          "abstract": "This response to the Request for Information (RFI) Inviting Comments on the NIH Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy with the Notice Number: NOT-OD-25-117 is motivated by the prevailing poor research quality and equally low ethical standards in the life sciences.\nA conversation with Google’s Gemini language model in May and June 2025 on AI's potential applications in the biomedical sciences culminated in four essays, which are presented below. The first emphasizes that the lack of robust training data for large language/reasoning models directly impacts their output (GIGO, Garbage In, Garbage Out). The second attributes poor research conduct to human biases and recommends incorporating AI into the peer review process to address the reproducibility crisis (AI Red Teaming). The benefits of AI peer reviewers evaluating grant proposals and research articles alongside human peers are highlighted in the third essay. The final essay contemplates that AI will ultimately still reflect only human ideas. \nThese thoughts highlight AI's potential to address challenges of poor research quality and low ethical conduct in the life sciences. This response specifically touches on points:\n4. Operational Excellence (Opportunities for AI to improve NIH “customer” experiences),\n6. Reproducibility &amp; Trust (Community-driven approaches), and\n2. Research &amp; Innovation Action (Mechanisms to enhance reproducibility) of the RFI.\nIt is my sincere hope these contributions will support the NIH’s AI Strategy in pursuit of more rigorous and reproducible biomedical research and scientific excellence.",

          "abstract": "We present a foundational mathematical discovery: a unique rational function\n\nS(\\tau) = \\frac{k\\tau}{\\tau_0 + \\tau}\n\nUnlike empirical models that fit specific data, this function arises from syntax-level constraints and defines a universal admissible form for biological dynamics.\nWe demonstrate how this canonical form naturally reproduces classical laws such as Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics, and propose that it constitutes a generative grammar of biological response—one that scales from molecular reactions to neural adaptation and cognitive processes.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance—including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness—to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.",

          "authors": "Graeme",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a paradigm-shifting framework for understanding neurodivergent cognition through the lens of adaptive specialization. Drawing from the Information Bottleneck Principle and Narrative Resilience Theory, we reconceptualize conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and aphantasia as distinct cognitive architectures—each reflecting trade-offs that prioritize certain processing modes over others. Rather than viewing these traits as pathological deficits, we argue they represent evolved strategies of cognitive optimization within complex environments. This integrated, network-level model highlights how structural constraints (e.g., reduced visual imagery in aphantasia) may give rise to compensatory enhancements in verbal-symbolic reasoning, memory systems, and emotional resilience. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, clinical psychology, and information theory, the paper offers testable predictions, practical applications for therapy and education, and a strong case for abandoning deficit-based frameworks in favor of cognitive equity. The model also introduces the “Narrative Resilience Variant” (NRV), a subtype marked by strong autobiographical coherence and resistance to trauma collapse—despite atypical working memory profiles. This approach not only challenges prevailing diagnostic models but offers a robust template for future research on cognitive diversity.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems produces brittle responses, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms—statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. We argue that building a robust science of AI–psychology requires integrating two of our field’s foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands far more rigorous validation processes. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output—endorsing “I am anxious”—requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to classify, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "The use of process data such as response time (RT) in psychometrics has generally focused on the relationship between speed and accuracy. The potential relationships between RT and item discrimination remain less explored. In this study, we propose a model for simultaneously estimating the relationships between RT and item discrimination at the person, item, and person-by-item (residual) levels and illustrate our approach through an item-level meta-analysis of 37 empirical datasets comprising approximately 850,000 item responses. We find no evidence of average differences in item discrimination between items of different time intensity or persons of different average RT, while residual RT strongly and negatively predicts item discrimination (pooled coef. = -.31% per 1% difference in RT, SE = .04, tau = .22). While heterogeneity is high and several datasets show strong positive or negative relationships, we find no evidence of moderation by overall dataset characteristics. Flexible generalized additive models show that the relationship between residual RT and item discrimination is generally curvilinear, with discrimination maximized just below average RT and minimized at the extremes. Our results suggest that RT data can provide insights into the measurement properties of educational and psychological assessments, but that the relationships between RT and item discrimination are highly variable.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability: Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely with trivial rephrasing. These “measurement phantoms”—statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena—threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition—using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation—“LLM selfhood”—showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.",

En se fiant sur diverse mesures acoustiques, elle vise à déterminer si la VC présente des différences sociales (selon le genre et l’âge) ainsi qu’à décrire le conditionnement linguistique de la VC en français laurentien. Un corpus de données trouvées de discours spontané en français a été recueilli auprès de 49 personnalités publiques bilingues (anglais-français) originaires de l’Ontario ou du Québec, comptant 51 317 voyelles analysées. Les mesures acoustiques de la VC comprennent une proportion de f0 non-fiable, une mesure de pente spectrale (H1*−H2*) et deux rapports harmonique-bruit (CPP et HNR entre 0 et 500 Hz). Les résultats pour le genre témoignent collectivement de plus grande présence de VC chez les hommes que les femmes. Les différences d’âge sont plus modestes : les locuteurs plus âgés démontrent provisoirement plus de VC que les locuteurs plus jeunes. Cela suggère que la production de VC a une base physiologique. Le conditionnement linguistique n’est pas aussi clair en français laurentien que dans d’autres études de variétés d’anglais, mais indique que la VC est généralement plus prononcée pour les voyelles basses et les voyelles à basse f0.",

          "authors": "Joe Manganelli",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective for designing and living in complex, interactive architectural systems (Manganelli, 2013) that are part of ‘artifact ecologies.’ (Kirsh, 2010)  All organisms co-evolve with their environments and change their respective environments to better suit their needs – this is known as ecological niche construction (Odling-Smee, Laland, Feldman, 2003). For many organisms, including humans, niche construction entails making ‘a better world to live in’ (Clark, 2003) by actively cultivating and shepherding other organisms. But humans are relatively unique with respect to ecological niche construction because humans also cultivate their environment to make ‘a better world to think in’ (Clark, 2003). That is, humans also cultivate and shepherd abstract information systems just as they do other organisms (e.g., flowers or crops or animals). Humans tend to their information systems and devices in the service of improving the cognitive dimensions of their ecological niche. This perspective is useful for contemplating the roles and obligations of designers and users with respect to complex, interactive, and intelligent information systems and devices, including buildings. This paper posits that the near future of innovation in environmental design and management will increasingly be driven by the cognitive niche construction aspect of ecological niche construction. This perspective is useful because it frames the integration of computational technologies into environmental systems in a way that illuminates the continuity of human behavior in utilizing physical and non-physical architectures as part of ongoing physical and cognitive ecological niche construction.",

          "authors": "Zoe Stephenson",
          "abstract": "Dark humour has been examined as part of a broader taxonomy of humour styles in psychological research. The Comic Style Markers (CSM) is currently the only standardised measure that captures four distinct dark comic styles (i.e., sarcasm, cynicism, irony, and satire) and has been used to explore how they relate to personality traits and other individual differences. This systematic review synthesises findings from 18 empirical studies identified through Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and PubMed.\nSome dark comic styles were linked to socially aversive traits and lower agreeableness, particularly sarcasm and cynicism, which also showed the most consistent associations with poorer well-being outcomes such as stress, anxiety, and reduced life satisfaction. Irony showed more mixed associations, at times linked to negative affect but also to insight, meaning, and workplace functioning.\nSatire appeared more contextually flexible – with some positive associations particularly when controlling for sarcasm and cynicism. Irony and satire showed links to strengths and wisdom that were similar to patterns more commonly seen in those who prefer lighter comic styles.\nDark comic styles were more prevalent among men, younger individuals, and those with more critical or non-traditional worldviews. These styles were largely unrelated to intelligence or resilience but were associated with greater acceptance of taboo humour. While certain styles reflected antagonistic traits or poorer well-being, others were linked to positive qualities, suggesting that dark humour is a psychologically meaningful but diverse construct. \nFindings are discussed in relation to broader humour literature and applied relevance.",

          "abstract": "Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies of self-relevance have largely utilized self-name and self-face stimuli. The goal of this study was to examine whether previously observed ERP effects of self-relevance occur using a diverse set of pictorial stimuli. Participant-submitted photos were used as both targets and distractors in an oddball task. When the participants’ own photos were used as targets, P300 amplitude was higher compared to familiar targets as well as the previously unseen categorical targets. When the participants’ own photos were used as distractors, P300 amplitude was comparable to both familiar targets and categorical targets. P300 amplitude to participants’ photos did not correlate with their perceived involvement with the subject photographed as measured by the Revised Personal Involvement Inventory. We interpret these findings as suggesting that the attentional salience of information relating to the self extends beyond highly self-relevant cues such as one’s own name or face. All stimuli that the participants had exposure to prior to the task (i.e., their own photos and the familiar target stimuli) elicited a frontal positivity which was greater than what was elicited by previously unseen stimuli. Thus, parietal activity may better discriminate self-relevance from mere familiarity.",

          "authors": "Prabahan dey",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes that the rigid social hierarchy seen in contemporary South Asian cultures—particularly in post-colonial India—is not solely the product of British imperial trauma or Brahmanical orthodoxy. Instead, it may be partly explained by an overlooked memetic entanglement between Confucian filial piety and post-Vedic Hindu metaphysics, facilitated through ancient cross-cultural exchange along the Silk Road. During the first millennium CE, Chinese pilgrims such as Faxian and Xuanzang undertook extensive journeys to India, not as mere visitors but as civilizational intermediaries, absorbing Indian philosophical traditions and transmitting cultural models in both directions. Confucianism—marked by hierarchical ethics, ancestral reverence, and role-bound obedience—may have subtly merged with an evolving Hindu emphasis on rigid caste structure and moralized Dharma. The hypothesis posits that this transregional syncretism helped entrench behavioral norms across both civilizations, shaping what is now observed as authoritarian parenting, career obsession, and deference to elders in South Asian society. These symptoms, often attributed to isolated cultural factors, may instead represent a deep civilizational convergence: a behavioral operating system shaped by millennia of Silk Road exchange.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms by considering a probability variable that can reproduce the phenomenon of a sudden negative value from a positive value. As a result, we found that depressive symptoms themselves occur according to a normal distribution or Gaussian process. Even if the mental state suddenly becomes negative, it is found to settle down to a positive or negative mean mental state due to the law of large numbers in the case of a normal distribution, and due to regression to the mean in the case of a Gaussian process. From this, we also discussed how to cope with depressive symptoms. Finally, we discussed connections with similarity curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Este estudio clínico y multidisciplinario explora la relación entre la neuroquímica del apego y las conductas sexuales masculinas, con un enfoque particular en estructuras cognitivas complejas y ultra complejas, como líderes, emprendedores o individuos de alta capacidad persuasiva. Partiendo de la hipótesis de que la dificultad para encontrar una pareja considerada adecuada y estable en estos perfiles puede estar estrechamente relacionada con su habilidad para persuadir a mujeres a involucrarse sexualmente en etapas tempranas, se plantea que dicha capacidad incrementa la probabilidad de encuentros sexuales sin vínculo emocional suficiente para activar la liberación de neuroquímicos del apego como oxitocina y vasopresina.\n\nEsta combinación podría inducir un ciclo de disonancia cognitiva o evitación aparente tras el encuentro, no porque la pareja potencial sea inadecuada per se, sino como resultado de sus propios procesos neuroquímicos al no haber habido tiempo suficiente para consolidar un vínculo emocional previo a la relación sexual. Esto explicaría, desde una perspectiva neuropsicológica, por qué muchos hombres altamente persuasivos y con estructuras complejas pasan largos periodos solteros o perciben que “ninguna mujer es suficiente”, sin comprender que el origen del rechazo surge en ellos mismos y no exclusivamente en la pareja potencial.\n\nEste abstract plantea la necesidad de entender que este patrón no es solo un proceso de evitación psicológica aislada, sino una interacción entre neurobiología, capacidad cognitiva, impulsividad sexual y tiempo de exposición afectiva, lo que podría guiar intervenciones clínicas más precisas para fomentar apegos sanos en hombres con estas características.",

          "abstract": "The widespread prevalence of child marriage across distinct ancient and medieval civilizations suggests the presence of a common underlying mechanism. This article proposes that the cross-cultural emergence of child marriage may be rooted in evolutionary adaptations from the Paleolithic period, when short life expectancy exerted reproductive pressure to mate early. These pressures may have shaped psychological predispositions and hormonal mechanisms that later fossilized into enduring cultural institutions—persisting even after their biological necessity had faded. Drawing on the concept of cultural lag and cross-civilizational patterns, the paper advances a theory of unconscious evolutionary continuity that can explain both the ubiquity and resilience of child marriage practices. The hypothesis neither justifies the institution nor minimizes its harms, but rather seeks to understand its deep historical and biological roots.",

          "abstract": "The possibility of influencing speech perception through the priming of a social variable has been shown in studies with subtle and explicit priming methods. However, failures in replicating the effects in newer experiments have cast doubt over the phenomenon. This paper reports on the attempt of replicating subtle and explicit social priming in a Norwegian context, by attempting to prime two Norwegian linguistic variants. Eighty-four participants carried out a vowel matching task in which the vowel /ʉː/ was expected to be perceived differently depending on which condition the participant was randomly assigned to (Urban East Norwegian or Oslo-East). For explicit social priming, participants were told the origin of the speaker who uttered the sentences. For subtle social priming, different newspapers were used with the intention of subliminally priming the participant. The results were analyzed using Bayesian multi-level ordinal probit models. The models showed anecdotal to moderate evidence for the null hypothesis in the case of explicit priming and none to anecdotal evidence for the null for subtle priming. The results from our study cast doubt over whether social priming can affect speech perception. Claims on social priming regarding speech perception thus need careful empirical evaluation.",

We modelled the developmental interplay between chaos and achievement, including their reverse association (i.e., achievement chaos), and its aetiology in up to 7,591 twin pairs (49% female), who were born in the mid-90s in the UK and assessed at age 9, 12, and 16 years. Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied. Our findings suggest that long-term associations between children’s experiences of household chaos and educational achievement are modest and non-causal.",

Gratitude, \nin contrast, reflects equilibrium and nurtures resilience.

          "abstract": "Stress in interpreting has been well researched over the last few decades. This study takes a multimodal approach to investigate the distinct effects of emotional and cognitive load on interpreter stress. 20 student interpreters consecutively interpreted four first-person mental healthcare narratives from Turkish to English that varied in emotional content and difficulty, within a 2×2 factorial design. Cognitive and emotional responses were captured using galvanic skin response (GSR), prosodic features (pitch and intensity), and three self-report measures (PANAS, STAI, and NASA-TLX). The stimuli were normed using traditional readability indices, expert ratings, and novel natural language processing techniques to control emotional valence and linguistic complexity. The results showed that physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, was primarily driven by cognitive load, particularly during the later stages of interpreting. Emotional load, on the other hand, was more clearly reflected in prosodic markers (especially pitch) and negative affect ratings. The results also hinted at a convergence in pitch between the source speaker and the interpreter. Notably, emotional and cognitive load began to take its toll from the latter stages of the listening phase onwards. However, none of the objective or subjective stress measures predicted interpreting accuracy, suggesting that performance may be mediated by individual coping strategies. The findings are expected to have implications for interpreting pedagogy and the development of cognitive and emotional support strategies in high-stakes interpreting contexts.",

We compared their choices about how to best configure the game when either playing for fun or playing to win, exploring: 1) how sensitive children are to the factors that are most relevant for playing to win; and 2) how their preferences when playing for fun relates to their preferences when playing to win. We found that for “win-relevant” features, children chose easier settings when playing to win than when playing for fun. By contrast, for “win-irrelevant” features, children generally preferred similar settings across conditions. Children also judged “win-relevant” factors as more important to winning than “win-irrelevant” factors, and judged both as irrelevant to having fun. These results suggest that playing to win and playing for fun are distinct motivational contexts to which children can appropriately adapt their decisions during play.",

          "abstract": "Social norms shape a vast range of human behaviors, from everyday interactions to major life choices. Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide learning—whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted ‘actor-critic’ models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, S-shaped curves, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.",

This study investigates the relationship between perceived stress and job involvement among IT professionals in India. A total of 300 participants (150 males and 150 females), aged 22–50 years, were selected using purposive sampling. Data were collected using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1988) and the Job Involvement Scale (Dhar &amp; Srivastava), and analyzed through descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation, independent samples t-tests, multiple regression and moderation analyses. Results revealed a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and job involvement, supporting existing research that high stress diminishes job-related psychological investment. Regression analysis confirmed that perceived stress is a significant predictor of job involvement even after controlling for demographic variables such as age and experience. No significant gender differences were found in stress or job involvement levels, echoing the findings of Keskin (2008) and Tiwari &amp; Singh (2014), which emphasized job conditions over personal demographics. These findings reinforce the theoretical framework linking job stress to reduced engagement and highlight the importance of supportive organizational practices to mitigate stress and promote employee involvement. Implications for HR policy and mental health interventions are discussed in the context of sustaining workforce resilience in the IT industry.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the development of G. Kelly’s ideas on rethinking existing approaches to understanding the sources and main characteristics of human activity. It demonstrates that by employing a complex, multidimensional image of a “constructive human being”, which integrates numerous partial images, it is possible to fundamentally reject the concept of “motivation”. This seemingly paradoxical step has non–trivial methodological, theoretical, and practical consequences. For instance, it helps us overcome unconscious assumptions from classical mechanics. These assumptions suggest that a human remains at rest until external forces act upon them, providing “psychic energy” and compelling them to act according to the resultant forces. Motivation is “re–described” through the broad process of construction – constructing oneself, one’s behavior, and, through it, the surrounding world. In this context, self–determination, freedom, and autonomy emerge as essential characteristics of a human being as a living organism. Any motivating impact is viewed as facilitation, the creation of conditions for potential change, or the support of the ongoing direction of human activity construction. Therefore, practices of such facilitation should not be motivation–centered but truly human–centered, based on the image of a free, autonomous, dignified, and capable of the act human being.",

Thus, habitually finishing meals by eating the entire portion (so-called plate clearing or plate cleaning) may lead to weight gain. However, findings have been mixed: some studies reported small, positive associations between self-reported plate clearing tendencies and body mass index but other studies did not find a relationship or even reported a negative association. The current study performed a meta-analysis on the correlation between plate clearing tendencies and body mass index. The pooled effect based on 22 samples was r = 0.04 (95% CI [0.02, 0.10]), indicating no relationship between plate clearing and body mass index. A meta-regression indicated that the percentage of women as well as the type of self-report measure moderated the effect, suggesting that there might be a small, positive relationship between plate clearing and body mass index in men and when the Plate Clearing Tendency Scale was used. In conclusion, this meta-analysis does not indicate that habitual plate clearing relates to a higher body weight in general. Whereas self-report biases cannot be excluded based on the current study, persons with plate clearing tendencies may have learned to adjust self-served portion sizes or may compensate caloric intake by increasing energy expenditure, thus preventing weight gain.",

          "abstract": "Differences in mothers’ vocabulary may help explain how educational inequality is transmitted across generations. In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families—mothers’ educational attainment when children were 5 years old significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]). Using path models with polygenic scores, we disentangled genetic transmission (shared genetics) from environmentally mediated effects. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, derived from interview recordings when children were 5 years old, accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational outcomes. These findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the subjective experience of space around the visual blind spot area, the cortical representation of which is missing feedforward connectivity from one eye. We performed these experiments as part of an adversarial collaboration to test contrasting theories of consciousness; Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Predictive Processing Active Inference (AI), and Predictive Processing Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) accounts. According to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, non-activatable retinotopic cortical regions,  such as the blind spot region for the ipsilateral eye, create a different cause-effect structure and therefore should contribute differently to the perceived quality of space of activatable retinotopic regions. The two Predictive Processing accounts, in contrast, posit that internal models will accommodate structural deviations around the blindspot based on the available sensory evidence (particulars of this accommodation differ between the two accounts). We present a series of paradigms in which participants evaluate distances and areas that either include the blind spot or not (without stimulating it directly), as well as illusory motion that is either adjacent to the blind spot or not. We model psychometric functions relating perceived and objective space. These models vary in terms of bias and precision according to the experimental conditions (blind spot involved vs. not involved, ipsilateral vs. contralateral eye), making it possible to quantify the potential disruption of subjective spatial extendedness induced by the blind spot. We present simulated results for each experiment corresponding to the predictions of each account, and conclude by discussing challenges and plans for dissemination.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of small numbers. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "authors": "Ihor Komnatskyy; Konrad Jankowski",
          "abstract": "Scholarly insight that player-avatar relations range from unity to resembling human-to-human interactions has prompted research into the dynamics behind this variability. The player-avatar interaction model (PAX) and its corresponding measure, the common player-avatar interaction scale (cPAX), were recently developed to describe these relational dynamics; however, until now, they have not been independently evaluated. Thus, our study aimed to test cPAX’s dimensionality and reliability in a separate sample and investigate the functioning of PAX’s critical concern dimension due to inconsistent findings about its relationship to perceived avatar sociality. Using a cross-sectional survey of 398 World of Warcraft players, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on cPAX, assessed the internal consistency of its four subscales, and examined the relationships between PAX dimensions and sense of presence. Our results supported the four-factor cPAX model, demonstrating strong reliability for relational closeness, anthropomorphic autonomy, and critical concern subscales, while sense of control showed minimally acceptable reliability. Contrary to our hypothesis, critical concern positively correlated with sense of presence, suggesting it reflects players’ desire for coherence in avatars’ stories and worlds rather than their plausibility or realism. Consequently, we interpret critical concern as distinct from its empirical origin, suspension of disbelief, with evidence indicating that both phenomena may enhance sense of presence and are involved in narrative and social aspects of gaming. Overall, our findings support the suitability of PAX and cPAX for applied research while emphasizing the need for continued attention to reliability of sense of control measures and to the role of critical concern in gaming.",

          "abstract": "Neural network modeling has played a central role in psycholinguistic studies of lexical processing, but the recent advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a different approach that may yield new insights into the mental lexicon. Four chatbots are prompted across three experiments to test how their LLMs generate psycholinguistic ratings of words in comparison with humans. LLM ratings, averaged across varying list contexts, were found to be highly correlated with human ratings, and differences in correlation strengths were partly explained by differences in rating ambiguity. LLM context manipulations strengthened correlations with human ratings through better calibration, and variability in LLM ratings was correlated with human inter-rater variability. We conclude that LLMs used context to guide the human-like assembly of psycholinguistic rating functions, rather than recalling ratings from training data. Additional results from testing LLM generation of word naming latencies showed that function assembly is currently limited by patterns of co-occurrence in textual data. Patterns at more fine-grained timescales are needed in training data to model online lexical processes.",

Drawing on the Free Energy Principle (Friston), Hebbian learning, and Hinton’s neural network theory, CogIntel seeks to emulate the brain’s predictive coding mechanisms while reinforcing synaptic adaptability through real-time intervention and feedback.\n\nThe system operates via a tri-phasic architecture: cognitive decoding, targeted intervention, and reinforcement optimization. In this model, AI interprets neural and behavioral data to guide individualized digital cognitive therapies or neuromodulatory strategies (e.g., neurofeedback, tDCS), optimizing them continuously based on user-specific patterns and outcomes.\n\nCogIntel is specifically designed to address neurodegenerative and neurocognitive conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). By leveraging adaptive learning algorithms and neural interface systems, CogIntel aims not merely to mitigate symptoms but to support systemic cognitive restoration and functional rewiring.\n\nAt its core, CogIntel is built on the belief that the brain can heal itself — that within its architecture lies an inherent potential for self-repair. By harnessing the principles of neuroplasticity and Hebbian plasticity, and accelerating them through intelligent systems, CogIntel acts as a catalyst: amplifying the brain’s own capacity to adapt, reorganize, and evolve. It offers a bold, scalable foundation for applications in neurorehabilitation, learning optimization, and even the ethical development of sentient AI.",

          "abstract": "Recently, in a novel paradigm, Bulatova and Fukuda (2025) showed that making an arbitrary prediction about a future event was sufficient to induce robust false memories of the event even when it never took place. Here, we tested whether this prediction-based false memory reflects the adaptability of our predictive processing mechanism. More precisely, we hypothesized that the higher the likelihood of prediction confirmation, the stronger the prediction-based false memory would be. In Experiment 1a and 1b, we manipulated the prediction accuracy during encoding (30% and 70%) across experiments and found that prediction-based false memory was indeed greater when the prediction accuracy was higher. Furthermore, in Experiment 2a and 2b, we demonstrated that this modulatory effect persisted even when prediction accuracy was varied across encoding blocks within the same experiment, thus highlighting the dynamic nature of this adaptive process. Lastly, we established that this dynamic updating was not explained by explicit awareness of prediction accuracy manipulation. Taken together, our findings suggest that prediction-based false memory is dynamically updated based on the reliability of predictions, reflecting the adaptability of the predictive processing mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Processing uncertainty may be pathognomonic (characteristic of a disease) for some psychiatric conditions. Some people expect the world to change, even when it doesn’t. This tendency is central to paranoia, where individuals often anticipate threat or change without clear evidence. But what determines whether these beliefs translate into behavior? One possibility is that metacognitive structure – the coherence and depth with which one articulates their own thinking – acts as a buffer. An agent may endorse a belief but have sufficient accessory hypotheses to insulate it from action. To test this, we used metacognitive prompting in GPT-4 to score individual reflections on open-ended questions (e.g., did you use any particular strategy?) after completing a probabilistic reversal learning task. Individuals with higher paranoia demonstrate lower metacognitive structure (t = 5.98, p &lt; 0.001), with metacognition moderating the relationship between volatility belief and switching behavior (β = -0.05, p = 0.001) even after controlling for reflection verbosity and general cognitive ability. These findings suggest that metacognition protects against uncertainty-driven instability, pointing to a key mechanism by which reflection protects against cognition under change. This work provides a novel framework to measure metacognition from behavioral task debrief questions.",

          "abstract": "Planning is an expensive computational operation that easily exhausts our cognitive resources. For this reason, it is critical to learn strategies to initiate planning wisely. Although recent advances have shown where and how planning should be engaged to aid adaptive behavior, little is known about when planning should be engaged. Here, we investigate how individuals choose to engage or delay planning. For this purpose, we developed a task where, at certain decision points in a multistep decision problem, it is optimal to delay planning and relinquish control because all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two studies, we show that humans can optimally delay planning and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. In doing so, we demonstrate that meta-policies to engage or delay planning are not simply learned from experienced outcomes, rather, they are constructed by searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can optimally delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

          "abstract": "Desde edades tempranas, muchos niños expresan un liderazgo innato o talentos extraordinarios que permanecen invisibles al ojo clínico convencional, no por falta de evidencia, sino porque no existe una métrica diseñada para reconocer lo que aún no se nombra formalmente. PRIHA (Proyective Reading Inferential High Ability) ofrece un modelo de psicometría narrativa inferencial capaz de detectar genialidad y necesidades emocionales invisibles mediante el análisis profundo de narrativas autobiográficas y asociaciones simbólicas, incluso cuando los niños no pueden expresarlo conscientemente.\n\nEste modelo parte de un vacío crucial: estudios estiman que el 70% de niños con altas capacidades permanece sin identificar en sistemas educativos tradicionales (Cross &amp; Cross, 2015), mientras que la falta de atención a sus necesidades emocionales incrementa hasta en un 50% la probabilidad de desarrollar frustración, ansiedad o retraimiento social en la adolescencia (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2016). PRIHA analiza complejidad lingüística, riqueza simbólica, coherencia temporal y causalidad narrativa para inferir perfiles proyectados de CI, motivación, tolerancia a la ambigüedad y resiliencia emocional, todo sustentado en neurociencia del lenguaje (Schultz, 2007) y teorías de mentalización (Fonagy et al., 2002).\n\nA diferencia de las baterías clínicas convencionales, que pueden costar entre 200 y 1,200 USD por evaluación y requieren múltiples sesiones presenciales de varias horas, PRIHA es capaz de procesar una narrativa en menos de 15 minutos, con análisis automático de IA, eliminando la necesidad de desplazamientos, profesionales intermediarios y altos costos. Gracias a su naturaleza digital y escalable, el modelo está diseñado para ser de acceso gratuito y universal, asegurando que cada niño, sin importar su ubicación o contexto socioeconómico, pueda ser evaluado en su propio idioma y entorno cultural.\n\nInspirado en la idea de que medir lo que no se nombra es la única vía para transformar lo que se ignora, PRIHA democratiza la identificación temprana del liderazgo y potencial oculto, ofreciendo un marco ético y clínico que reduce el sesgo social y cultural. Este enfoque reivindica la posibilidad de ver en cada niño —incluyendo al niño que todo líder lector de este documento fue alguna vez— el capital humano único que, si se acompaña con respeto y conciencia, puede traducirse en individuos resilientes, creativos y comprometidos con construir sociedades más equitativas, inclusivas y evolucionadas.",

Estudios recientes indican que el 80% de los adultos mantiene creencias ilusorias para proteger su estabilidad emocional (Sharot et al., 2011), mientras que el 72% de jóvenes declara identificarse con influencers que expresan ideas que temían reconocer por sí mismos (Pew Research Center, 2023).\n\nDesde la neurociencia, se describe cómo la liberación de dopamina y oxitocina fortalece la fijación positiva de las palabras del líder cuando sus mensajes validan emociones reprimidas, mientras que la activación de la amígdala y el cortisol puede generar rechazo ante verdades que amenazan la autoimagen (LeDoux, 1998; Schultz, 2007). En términos evolutivos, se fundamenta que la capacidad de construir narrativas convincentes, incluso parciales o simbólicas, ofreció ventajas adaptativas para cohesionar grupos y generar sentido de pertenencia (Trivers, 2011).\n\nEl texto introduce un sesgo proyectivo de autocompasión, amor y empatía, para que líderes comprendan que las reacciones de los demás no son su responsabilidad, pero que su capacidad de nombrar lo innombrable les otorga un poder que debe ejercerse con conciencia, ética y equilibrio emocional. La fantasía proyectiva, cuando es integrada conscientemente, se convierte en herramienta simbólica para generar insights, motivar transformaciones positivas y construir entornos de diálogo y resiliencia.\n\nSe concluye que la fantasía proyectiva, lejos de ser una “mentira”, puede ser comprendida como un recurso humano esencial para resignificar experiencias, catalizar la integración de nuevas verdades y fortalecer un liderazgo empático, congruente y responsable, que inspire desde la autenticidad sin sacrificar el propio bienestar emocional.",

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "Las relaciones afectivas intensas pueden detonar circuitos neuroquímicos de fijación similares a los observados en la adicción, activando de forma simultánea sistemas dopaminérgicos (motivación y recompensa anticipatoria), oxitocinérgicos (apego y vinculación) y mecanismos de refuerzo variable, ampliamente documentados en estudios de neuromarketing como responsables de la creación de lealtad compulsiva hacia marcas, productos y figuras. Esta similitud funcional sugiere que los patrones neurobiológicos que sostienen la fijación emocional en relaciones desorganizadas pueden analizarse, predecirse y modularse con herramientas derivadas tanto de la neurociencia del consumo como de la psicología del apego. Presentamos un ejercicio neuroquímico aplicado como estrategia de reequilibrio para cortar la fijación en vínculos intensos, basado en ayuno de dopamina, sustitución controlada de fuentes de recompensa, reactivación funcional de oxitocina mediante contacto seguro y estabilización de serotonina con hábitos conductuales. A través de una guía de 30 días se propone entrenar al cerebro a reorganizar sus patrones motivacionales, ofreciendo una alternativa para autorregular circuitos de apego mediante experiencias diseñadas, como se hace en intervenciones de neuromarketing que buscan desplazar asociaciones emocionales hacia nuevas metas o marcas. Este protocolo parte de la evidencia que vincula intermitencia emocional con liberación intensa de dopamina (Schultz et al., 1997) y teorías evolutivas que explican la función adaptativa del apego en términos de retención de pareja (Hazelton &amp; Buss, 2000), así como estudios que muestran que rupturas amorosas activan el núcleo accumbens de forma casi idéntica a la abstinencia de drogas (Fisher et al., 2010). Al traducir estos hallazgos en una metodología práctica, se ofrece un modelo de autocondicionamiento dirigido a cortar fijaciones afectivas con la misma lógica que programas de fidelización o branding neuroemocional, pero orientado a la salud mental del individuo. Este trabajo busca abrir un camino interdisciplinario entre neurobiología, psicología del apego y neuroeconomía, proponiendo que, al comprender y dirigir deliberadamente nuestros estímulos externos y externos, podemos guiar al cerebro a reprogramar sus circuitos de apego sin recurrir a fármacos ni a intervenciones exclusivamente psicológicas, sino usando los mismos mecanismos que la industria del neuromarketing emplea para generar deseo, engagement y lealtad, pero aplicados a la liberación emocional y la autorregulación.",

          "abstract": "La presente carta, dirigida a niños con rasgos de liderazgo temprano, propone una intervención simbólica basada en fundamentos neurobiológicos, psicológicos y socioculturales para promover un liderazgo empático, equilibrado y responsable. Su objetivo es brindar a niños que poseen alta capacidad expresiva y natural tendencia a influir en su entorno, herramientas simbólicas que les permitan reconocer su propio poder, ejercerlo de forma constructiva y comprender que las emociones que despiertan en otros no son su culpa.\n\nDesde un marco teórico que articula la teoría del apego (Bowlby), los modelos de resonancia emocional y disonancia cognitiva (Festinger), y los principios neuroquímicos de la liberación de neurotransmisores como dopamina, oxitocina y cortisol (LeDoux, Carter), la carta traduce estos conceptos en un lenguaje comprensible para niños. Se incluye un sesgo proyectivo positivo intencionado que exalta el amor, la inclusión, la empatía y la identificación, al tiempo que introduce una fantasía proyectiva de estructura, congruencia y elocuencia para que los niños se perciban como líderes capaces de inspirar sin perder su equilibrio emocional.\n\nLa carta enseña a los niños a observar el efecto de sus palabras en los demás, a usar su talento para construir en lugar de herir, y a reconocer que un liderazgo auténtico requiere también autocuidado. Se presentan ejemplos adaptados al nivel cognitivo de la educación primaria, para que los pequeños identifiquen en sus conocimientos recientes de ciencias naturales la explicación neurobiológica de por qué sus palabras pueden generar amor, incomodidad o rechazo en quienes los rodean. Este enfoque innovador busca que el niño líder internalice su potencial como guía simbólico en su entorno inmediato, fomentando la autoaceptación, la empatía y la responsabilidad simbólica, sin imponer la responsabilidad emocional por los sentimientos de los demás.\n\nSe concluye que proveer marcos simbólicos de comprensión desde edades tempranas puede contribuir a la formación de líderes con un sentido de propósito genuino, capaces de construir espacios de diálogo sincero y resiliente, sin sacrificar su propia estabilidad emocional.",

          "abstract": "Las figuras conocidas como influencers o líderes de opinión no son meros generadores de contenido en redes sociales; son símbolos contemporáneos que, al nombrar verdades reprimidas o compartidas, despiertan profundos procesos proyectivos en la mente de sus seguidores. Este fenómeno combina idealización y evitación, generando amor u odio intensos que se fijan de manera permanente a través de rutas neuroquímicas, cognitivas y simbólicas. Basándonos en teorías de disonancia cognitiva (Festinger, 1957), activación amigdalar ante amenazas a la autoimagen (LeDoux, 1998) y mecanismos de apego oxitocínico (Carter, 1998), demostramos cómo un solo estímulo —la expresión de una verdad— puede detonar procesos neurobiológicos idénticos a los observados en las adicciones conductuales (Volkow et al., 2016).\n\nEste documento desglosa seis niveles de asociación que permiten entender por qué un influencer puede quedar fijado como figura de placer o amenaza: emocional, cognitiva, simbólica-cultural, neuroquímica, proyectiva personal y social-colectiva. Estudios recientes revelan que más del 70% de usuarios siguen a influencers que validan sus emociones reprimidas, mientras que un 40% admite revisar obsesivamente el contenido de figuras percibidas como auténticas (Pew Research Center, 2023). Sin embargo, cuando los mensajes del influencer confrontan creencias centrales de la estructura individual, la respuesta más probable es el rechazo y la evitación, activados por malestar emocional y disonancia cognitiva.\n\nEl análisis sugiere que el proceso de fijación proyectiva hacia el influencer es multifactorial y que, dependiendo del estado de integración emocional del seguidor, la experiencia puede llevar a un insight placentero o a una reacción hostil. Además, se discute cómo estas dinámicas pueden servir como catalizador en procesos terapéuticos al actuar como puente simbólico para liberar verdades reprimidas. La integración de evidencia neurobiológica y teorías del comportamiento ofrece un modelo novedoso para comprender el impacto de los influencers como figuras de resonancia estructural que generan adicción a la integración —o al rechazo— de la verdad.",

          "abstract": "Human beings demonstrate a universal impulse to share and consume stories. Over generations of transmission, within and across cultures, stories have evolved to develop regularities in their internal structures. Here, we investigated how two features of story structure – coherence and familiarity – impact recall as participants retold a story 5 days in a row. We predicted that familiar and coherent structures would be more stable over retellings. We measured stability using two novel story similarity measures of the (1) degree of structural change within storytellers, and (2) similarity in remembered structure across storytellers. Study 1 first validated our story similarity measure. Studies 2 and 3 then tracked the evolution of stories that varied in coherence and familiarity, respectively, using novel stories adapted from the popular “Cinderella” structure. Results showed that all stories became more structurally stable across retellings, with stories moving in a consistent direction (i.e., towards a consistent final form). However, retellings of a story with a more coherent and familiar structure showed both greater stability within and similarity across minds than retellings of a story with an incoherent (Study 2) or unfamiliar structure (Study 3). Thus, using novel tools to measure story evolution, our findings suggest that familiarity and coherence of a story structure offered it an advantage in memory, both within and across minds.",

          "abstract": "Humans are inherently social species, with our behavior heavily influenced by the social environment and context. While traditional social neuroscience approach has made significant progress in mapping isolated social cognitive processes, it often fails to capture the complexity of real-world social environment—where perception, decision-making, and interaction unfold simultaneously and contextually. In this review, we introduce naturalistic social neuroscience as a paradigm shift that bridges this gap through incorporating multidisciplinary naturalistic measurements, which integrates lab-based simulation such as movie watching and virtual reality, real-world embedded measures like digital phenotyping and wearables devices, as well as the strategic combination of multiple approaches. The framework also includes an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered multilevel data analysis to synthesize behavioral, computational, and neurobiological data to reveal the mechanism underline real-world behaviors. Finally, we propose opportunities, critical considerations, and future directions for pushing forward naturalistic social neuroscience. This review broadens the view and equips researchers with an extended toolkit for understanding the richness of social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness, on the Dynergic Theory of Consciousness (DTC), is not an emergent add-on but the natural expression of reality's relational fabric. DTC treats relations as ontologically primary: when five universal patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) synchronize within a substrate's binding window, a system experiences itself as a unified whole. Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

There have been mixed findings on the (dis)inhibiting impact of this repression on continued activism. We examine the impacts of repression on intentions to engage in normative (conforming to societal rules) and non-normative (violating these rules) collective actions, in a sample of Extinction Rebellion UK activists (N = 1,375). We assess both anticipated and experienced repression as predictors of action intentions, over and above past activism and core social-psychological motives (identification, grievance, and efficacy). We demonstrate that, while anticipated repression has no direct effect on either collective action type, lived experiences of repression positively predict non-normative action intentions. Analysing emotional responses to repression demonstrates positive indirect effects of anticipated repression through anger/outrage for both collective action types, and through contempt for non-normative action, as well as a negative indirect effect on non-normative action intentions via increased fear. Experienced repression also has a galvanizing indirect effect of non-normative action intentions via reduced fear. These findings disentangle differing indirect emotional effects of anticipated and experienced repression on both kinds of action intentions. Importantly, they also reveal a galvanizing effect of lived experiences of repression on disruptive action intentions.",

Our sample comprised 832 students (M = 15.05 years, SD = 0.75, 44.5% female, 4.2% non-binary) and 198 teachers in 23 secondary schools in Thuringia, Germany, with data collected in 2022. Multilevel path analyses and school-level bivariate correlations revealed that student and teacher reports of CC climate were related to more, and teacher-reported assimilationism to less critical reflection. Effects for color-evasive and multiculturalist climates on various CC facets were mixed, including positive and negative effects across student and teacher reports. To cultivate youth CC as resource and tool for driving transformative change, measures fostering a CC climate should be taken, including social-justice oriented training programs for educators.",

Across three studies, our project tracks the evolution of stories in real time as participants tell and retell a story for 5 days in a row. Each study varies the structure of the initial story to manipulate its familiarity and structure. We predict that stories with familiar structures will survive better across retellings. Study 1 tracks the evolution of a story with no recognizable structure using novel story structure metrics. Study 2 compares the evolution of a story with structure and without structure. Study 3 compares the evolution of a familiarly structured story with an unfamiliarly structured story. Results show that all stories become more structurally stable across retellings, with stories moving in a consistent direction (i.e., towards a consistent final form). Stories with more familiar structures show greater evolutionary stability: They are modified less than both unstructured (Study 2) and unfamiliar stories (Study 3), and are either consistently more structurally stable across retellings (Study 2) or start out more stable in earlier retellings (Study 3). By the last generation of recall, people show greater agreement in their recall of more familiarly structured stories than unfamiliarly structured stories (Study 3). This suggests that familiar stories with structural integrity have an evolutionary edge over unfamiliar structures, surviving better in people’s memories.",

We performed these experiments as part of an adversarial collaboration to test contrasting theories of consciousness; Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Predictive Processing Active Inference (AI), and Predictive Processing Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) accounts. According to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, non-activatable retinotopic cortical regions,  such as the blind spot region for the ipsilateral eye, create a different cause-effect structure and therefore should contribute differently to the perceived quality of space of activatable retinotopic regions. The two Predictive Processing accounts, in contrast, posit that internal models will accommodate structural deviations around the blindspot based on the available sensory evidence (particulars of this accommodation differ between the two accounts). We present a series of paradigms in which participants evaluate distances and areas that either include the blind spot or not (without stimulating it directly), as well as illusory motion that is either adjacent to the blind spot or not. We model psychometric functions relating perceived and objective space. These models vary in terms of bias and precision according to the experimental conditions (blind spot involved vs. not involved, ipsilateral vs. contralateral eye), making it possible to quantify the potential disruption of subjective spatial extendedness induced by the blind spot. We present simulated results for each experiment corresponding to the predictions of each account, and conclude by discussing challenges and plans for dissemination.",

For PBT to have a meaningful impact on mental healthcare, clinician input is needed to support treatment development, dissemination, and implementation efforts. The current study aimed to (1) better understand current perspectives on PBT among clinicians and (2) seek clinician feedback that may encourage accessibility and/or adoption of PBT. \nMethod: We used a cross-sectional survey to examine clinicians’ familiarity with and perspectives on PBT and its associated framework, the extended evolutionary meta-model (EEMM). \nResults: In our sample of 150 clinicians, 57.3% had heard of PBT and 41.3% had heard of the EEMM. Participants broadly agreed on how to conceptualize treatment components using the EEMM. In addition, feedback from clinicians suggested that the EEMM may underemphasize certain aspects of functioning (e.g., interpersonal relationships), even if they are technically represented by the EEMM (e.g., Sociocultural level). \nConclusion: There was high-level agreement with respect to how the EEMM was used as an organizing framework, however, training may be needed to increase inter-clinician reliability. Limitations include using an older version of the EEMM in our survey (current at the time of use) and limited representation of clinicians outside a cognitive behavioral orientation and working outside the U.S.",

          "abstract": "Teachers play a critical role in supporting student mental health but face barriers to implementing\nclassroom-based resources. This study examined the implementation of the Healthy Minds,\nThriving Kids (HMTK) program – free, evidence-based mental health videos for K–12 schools\nand families. After viewing the videos, 3,079 California K–12 educators completed a follow-up\nsurvey on implementation status, perceptions, and barriers. Analysis identified three teacher\ngroups (n=1,806): “Early Implementers” (used the resources), “Prospective Implementers” (plan\nto use them), and “Non-Implementers” (no plan to use them). While both Early and Prospective\nImplementers valued the resources, the latter cited time constraints and administrative approval\nprocesses as key barriers. Non-Implementers found the content less relevant but also noted time\nconstraints as a challenge. Machine learning analysis showed that teacher readiness and actions\nfor implementation were shaped by internal factors (e.g., beliefs, self-efficacy) and external\nsupport (e.g., school leadership). Notably, teachers in schools with more students eligible for free\nor reduced-price lunch were more likely to demonstrate readiness and take action for implementing\nclassroom-based mental health resources. These findings highlight three priorities to narrow the\ngap between teachers’ motivation and the support needed for implementation: providing structured\nsupport to reduce systemic barriers like time constraints, strengthening teachers' intrinsic\nmotivation and school leadership backing, and prioritizing schools serving students from low\nsocioeconomic backgrounds – where both student needs and teacher motivation are high.",

Willful inattention arises when an individual avoids paying attention to something because they expect that focusing their attention on it will evoke negative emotions or diminish positive ones. Willful ignorance, in contrast, is motivated by a desire to remain uninformed so as to avoid an unwanted change in beliefs. We show that willful inattention plays a key role in a number of important policy problems, and we discuss strategies for mitigating its negative effects.",

By applying observational methods from primatology, we conducted video analysis of streets fights recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces of Amsterdam in order to evaluate whether conflicts generate social tension among human bystanders and promote bystanders’ affiliation as a tension-reduction mechanism. We found that witnessing a street fight increased the expression of anxiety-related behaviours in bystanders and their propensity to engage in non-physical and physical affiliative interactions. The occurrence of affiliation improves in turn the emotional state of bystanders by reducing their expression of anxiety-related behaviours. Our work offers for the first time a behavioural-based analysis of the emotional drivers underpinning bystanders’ activity in real-life conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Brain regions differ in the intrinsic timescales over which they integrate, shaping the information they encode; and these differences change with development. Here we used EEG to investigate how intrinsic timescales develop from infancy to toddlerhood and how they compare to adults. A recent rs-fMRI study found sleeping neonates had longer timescales than awake adults. However, fMRI is affected by hemodynamics, has limited temporal resolution, and timescales may be affected by sleep. Therefore, EEG was used to measure intrinsic timescales in infants longitudinally from 6 to 16-months-old (exploratory cohort, N=45; validation cohort, N=45) and adults (N=10). Infants were awake and engaged in visual stimulation, and adults were recorded under comparable (vs. different) conditions. Six-month-olds’ timescales were longer than those of adults in comparable conditions, and they shortened from 6 to 16-months-old. Finally, in younger infants, brain timescales correlated to alpha rhythm self-predictability. Longer intrinsic timescales early in infancy, a finding which generalises across fMRI and EEG, might act as an inductive bias favouring the learning of holistic abstract representations. Delineating the mechanisms underlying brain processing timescales in infants is a crucial step towards understanding the neural mechanisms which could allow infants to extract and learn patterns from the environment.",

          "abstract": "In response to growing replication failures attributed to underpowered studies and questionable research practices (QRPs) such as data peeking, researchers have increasingly turned to sequential testing frameworks -- most notably the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). By evaluating evidence at each interim analysis, SPRTs achieve the same inferential rigor as fixed-sample protocols while requiring substantially fewer participants, all without sacrificing robustness to violations of their statistical assumptions.\n    However, like any statistical method, SPRTs are susceptible to QRPs. We conducted a simulation study using a fictional researcher who applied various hacking strategies to favor the alternative hypothesis. These included running multiple parallel sequential ANOVAs, performing opportunistic subgroup or outlier analyses, flexibly redefining expected effect sizes, reshuffling observation order, and filtering datapoints that weakened interim likelihood ratios. Single hacking strategies and moderate combinations inflated the nominal 5% Type I error rate to 6-19 % (rising to 99 % under extreme data filtering), shifted effect-size estimates upward, increased sample size efficiency and reduced the rate of non-decisions.\n    These findings underscore that while SPRTs offer substantial gains in efficiency, they are not immune to misuse, much like fixed-design approaches. It is therefore critical to promote transparency and preregistrations in sequential designs to prevent the adoption of QRPs early on.",

          "abstract": "As artificial agents become more involved in social and economic interactions that rely on honest behavior from humans, they are increasingly designed with human-like social cues—such as pupil size—to appear more approachable. Pupil size is subtle, but also a powerful cue that can guide our decisions. Yet, we still know little about how pupil size shape people’s behavior, especially across cultures where agents and their signals are interpreted and accepted differently. In this study, 275 participants from Europe and Japan played a coin toss game where lying increased financial gain. They interacted with a human confederate, a virtual avatar, or a robot. Agents' pupil sizes were manipulated to appear large or small; for human confederates, this was achieved using custom-designed contact lenses. Our results suggest that cultures differ in how dishonest behavior is directed toward human and artificial agents, with subtle social cues like pupil size influencing dishonesty in culture-specific ways. Despite these behavioral differences, physiological responses revealed similar patterns of arousal across cultures and agent types, indicating a shared implicit sensitivity to social presence. These findings highlight the need to consider cultural context when designing artificial agents that use human-like cues to guide social behavior: what subtly communicates warmth in one culture may signal something else in another.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Previous research on distressing life events primarily emphasized negative mental health outcomes. However, there has been a growing focus on positive mental health factors in recent times. To reflect this broader perspective, the present study investigated the relationship between distressing life events, including emotionally impactful or potentially traumatic experiences, and positive mental health (PMH), satisfaction with life (SWL), subjective happiness (SH), and depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–21; DASS-21). Design and Methods: The sample included N = 426 students who participated in an online study testing protective and risk factors in the context of mental health and reports secondary analyses of these data. Results: Correlational analyses showed that experiencing a distressing life event was linked to lower levels of PMH and SWL, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Post-hoc group comparisons supported this pattern. Among those who experienced a distressing life event, higher current distress due to the event correlated with lower levels of PMH, SWL, and SH, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions: This study showed robust correlations between the experience of a distressing life event and levels of both positive and negative mental health. These findings underscore the emotional and psychological impact of adverse life events and highlight the potential value of targeting transdiagnostic protective factors such as PMH and resilience in prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "The pseudohomophone effect refers to an established finding whereby in a visual lexical decision task, non-word letter strings that are pronounced like real words (e.g., WAWK) are harder to reject than non-word strings that are not pronounced like real words (e.g., FLIS). This paper reports three lexical decision experiments that aimed at further exploring the underlying processing mechanisms. In Experiment 1 and 2, we compared pseudohomophones like WAWK with unpronounceable non-words like NRUG and pronounceable non-words like FLIS, making sure that all stimuli (including real-word fillers) were carefully matched in length, bigram frequency, and number of orthographic neighbours. Matching stimuli in this way resulted in the real-word fillers to be of low lexical frequency (lower than for the pseudohomophones’ base words). Experiment 1 employed a standard lexical decision task, whereas Experiment 2 used the 2AFC eye-tracking paradigm originally developed in Kunert &amp; Scheepers (2014). Both experiments converged on showing a reversal of the classical pseudohomophone effect: while unpronounceable strings like NRUG were correctly rejected relatively quickly, pseudohomophones like WAWK were indeed easier to reject than pronounceable non-words like FLIS. Our final Experiment 3, by contrast, confirmed a ‘classical’ pseudohomophone effect when the same non-word stimuli were tested against high- rather than low frequency words as fillers. We conclude that the direction of the pseudohomophone effect strongly depends on the overall material context.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that first-generation students face extra challenges in the transition to university compared to non-first-generation students, including adjusting to the academic demands of university life and building up their social support networks. However, few studies have mapped out these students' social networks in detail. The aim of this study was to compare the social networks and adjustment to university in first-generation students and non-first-generation students in their first year at a UK university. We used a genetic matching algorithm to match 112 first-generation students to 112 non-first-generation students on age, gender and nationality (mean age = 18.71 years old, 69 male, 146 female, 5 non-binary, four did not state gender). We used an online social network tool to elicit the size of students’ social support network and the different types of ties (e.g. family, friend) in this network. We used the Crombag’s Adaption Questionnaire to measure adjustment to university life.  There were no significant differences in the overall size of the support network or adjustment to university life in first-generation versus non-first-generation students. Therefore, the pre-registered hypotheses were not supported. An exploratory analysis suggested non-first-generation students have significantly more non-family social ties than first-generation students (R2 = .019), but the Bayes Factor suggested only anecdotal evidence of an effect (BF10 = 1.1).  Future research could examine whether the characteristics of the university (e.g., percentage of first-generation students) may influence the adaptation of first-generation students to university life.",

This study investigates whether children with ADHD show intact learning-based CC and how it is affected by increased cognitive demands. Methods: In a multicentric study, 7-14 years old children (145 ADHD [20F, mean = 10.4 ± 2.0], 97 TD [51F, mean = 10.4 ± 2.0]) completed two experimental tasks: a modified Flanker task and a cued go-noGo task. Both included a List-Wide Proportion Congruency (LWPC) manipulation to create different contextual predictability (mostly congruent/valid vs half congruent/valid blocks). Reaction times (RTs) and accuracy were analyzed across blocks and associations between task adaptation and neuropsychological and questionnaire-based CC measures were also explored. Results: ADHD children showed similar LWPC effects to TD peers in the Flanker task, suggesting preserved learning-based CC in low-demand contexts. In the cued go-noGo task, which involved greater attentional and inhibitory demands, ADHD children displayed less efficient modulation of RTs and reduced speed-accuracy trade-off adaptation compared to TD peers. A composite neuropsychological score predicted task adaptation. No associations were found with parental questionnaires. Conclusions: Learning-based CC appears preserved in children with ADHD in simple contexts but is hindered under complex, multi-demand conditions. Inhibition may be a key mechanism underlying these group differences. These findings emphasize the need for ecologically valid paradigms and tailored interventions targeting complex CC challenges in ADHD.

Esta similitud funcional sugiere que los patrones neurobiológicos que sostienen la fijación emocional en relaciones desorganizadas pueden analizarse, predecirse y modularse con herramientas derivadas tanto de la neurociencia del consumo como de la psicología del apego.\n\nPresentamos un ejercicio neuroquímico aplicado como estrategia de reequilibrio para cortar la fijación en vínculos intensos, basado en ayuno de dopamina, sustitución controlada de fuentes de recompensa, reactivación funcional de oxitocina mediante contacto seguro y estabilización de serotonina con hábitos conductuales. A través de una guía de 30 días se propone entrenar al cerebro a reorganizar sus patrones motivacionales, ofreciendo una alternativa para autorregular circuitos de apego mediante experiencias diseñadas, como se hace en intervenciones de neuromarketing que buscan desplazar asociaciones emocionales hacia nuevas metas o marcas.\n\nEste protocolo parte de la evidencia que vincula intermitencia emocional con liberación intensa de dopamina (Schultz et al., 1997) y teorías evolutivas que explican la función adaptativa del apego en términos de retención de pareja (Hazelton &amp; Buss, 2000), así como estudios que muestran que rupturas amorosas activan el núcleo accumbens de forma casi idéntica a la abstinencia de drogas (Fisher et al., 2010).

          "abstract": "Introduction \nThe human and economic impact of suicide is significant. Services to prevent suicide, support persons experiencing suicidal distress, and their family and friends, are critical to reducing suicide rates. However, in Australia, guidance on the amount and mix of suicide prevention specific services required to meet population needs is lacking. The aim of this study was to develop a service taxonomy for suicide prevention as the first step in the development of an Australian suicide prevention needs-based planning model (i.e., the Australian Suicide Prevention Planning Model (AuSPPM)).\nMethods\nA desktop review was undertaken to identify potential service types for inclusion in the taxonomy. The scope of the search was restricted to services, programs, initiatives, or campaigns that specifically aim to address or prevent suicidal distress and target whole populations, sub-populations, groups, families, and/or individuals. An initial draft taxonomy was developed based on search findings. Feedback on the draft taxonomy was provided by persons working within service planning, government and policy related roles, academics, clinicians, and persons with lived experience. A final search was conducted to locate further information to accurately describe all service types for inclusion and their evidence base.\nResults\nThe final taxonomy included: (1) a set of nine ‘critical enablers’ for an effective suicide prevention system that should underpin all other service types represented in the taxonomy, and (2) five service streams comprising 32 nested service categories, and 36 service elements. Some key feedback from the sector in terms of development of the taxonomy included the need for significant emphasis on upstream supports, the inclusion of services related to other areas of wellbeing, the early identification of distress, and the provision of brief supports and service navigation. \nConclusion\nThe service taxonomy may be used to inform planning and policy related decisions and is an important component of the overarching needs-based planning model. In the future, it may be refined to include services specific to populations disproportionately impacted by suicide. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of service types included in the taxonomy.",

          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) was developed to provide independent measures of sensitivity and bias for an observer asked to discriminate a signal stimulus against background noise. The sensitivity measure, d' , achieves this goal when the underlying decision space consists of two Gaussian distributions of equal variance. However, d' fails to provide a stable measure of sensitivity when the distributions are of unequal variance. In addition, unequal base rates of stimulus presentations or asymmetries in the payoff matrix for decision outcomes further shift criterion placement and estimations of sensitivity. Alternative sensitivity metrics that attempt to consider these scenarios either require information across multiple confidence levels or make implicit assumptions about the underlying decision space a priori. I propose an optimization approach that accurately estimates information about the underlying decision space without requiring information over multiple confidence levels. The proposed approach requires β and a single false alarm and hit rate pair. The reliance on β limits the proposed method to providing a normative model of performance where the researcher is operating under a theoretical framework of decision. Simulations illustrate that in cases where β is known, or can be reasonably estimated, the optimization approach is successful in recovering the critical characteristics of the decision space.",

          "abstract": "Recently, scholars have questioned the dominance of Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD)-centric values in shaping sociocultural systems. Addressing this requires reassessing instances where non-WEIRD values not only sustained but also influenced WEIRD paradigms. Advances in natural language processing now enable rigorous analysis of classical non-WEIRD texts to illuminate such contributions. This study examines Bushido: The Soul of Japan by Inazo Nitobe, a widely read classic that introduced Japanese moral values to Western audiences. Using Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), we analyzed how Bushido conveys psychological constructs across cultural and historical boundaries referencing the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and HEXACO Personality Inventory. Bushido exhibited consistently higher CCR scores on both instruments compared to over 700 documents related to Christianity, the Bible, and Japanese culture, indicating closer semantic alignment with the target constructs. This suggests Bushido articulates moral values and personality traits rooted in Japanese cultural traditions, while exhibiting a cross-cultural psychological structure that transcends temporal boundaries. Multidimensional scaling further identified Meiyo (名誉) as the conceptual core among Bushido’s seven virtues, a construct distinct from Western pride-based honor. This study demonstrates that classical non-WEIRD texts can be quantitatively analyzed to reveal enduring moral frameworks that transcend the WEIRD paradigm.",

We conducted a systematic review, including 25 studies predominantly employing between-subject framing experiments, involving mainly adult participants from Western regions, and mostly on help-seeking and self-care. Findings on norm nudging and framing (self-other and positive-negative) have been mixed with evidence of positive-framing advantage in encouraging help-seeking. Limited studies on default nudge, decoy nudge, and reminder nudge found mostly beneficial effects. We provided suggestions to advance mental health nudging research, including a call for more theory-driven research with potential mediating and moderating measures, sampling of diverse populations in mental health conditions, age, cultural backgrounds. More research on tailored nudges and comparison between different nudges are also encouraged. Finally, studies with more consequential outcome variables (e.g. mental health, longer term behaviors), and monitoring and addressing risks of adverse effects, will be worthwhile. \nKeywords: Nudges, Decision-Making, Mental Health, Self-care, Help-seeking, Systematic Review",

          "abstract": "This paper, presented as a conceptual hypothesis intersecting theology, cosmology, and phenomenology, proposes a radical but increasingly plausible cosmological hypothesis: that our observable universe exists within the interior of a black hole. Drawing from general relativity, quantum field theory, fossil records, and paleomagnetic data, we present converging lines of evidence that challenge the standard cosmological model. We explore the implications of extreme gravitational curvature on entropy, time dilation, biological gigantism, and physical constants. Building on Einstein’s discomfort with singularities and expanding upon modern geometric theories, we suggest that many of the unresolved paradoxes in contemporary physics, from nonlocality to the horizon problem, may be symptoms of living inside a black hole. We introduce the term Unphysics to describe this emerging framework: a physics governed not by linear progression through flat space, but by recursive coherence in curved and compressed spacetime. This is not mysticism. It is a serious proposal rooted in empirical anomalies and theoretical tension. One that may better explain where, and what, the universe actually is.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Unified Model of Ego Safe Selection and Consciousness Mapping — a novel psychological and behavioral framework that mathematically explains human decision-making through two key forces: external emotional-social conformity (SLS) and internal present-moment awareness (Ψ(U)). The model introduces the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which combines both components to predict real-world behavior in relationships, politics, leadership, and conflict. Building upon the original Ego Safe Selection Theory, this work extends into applied scoring systems, case simulations, and most notably, the activation of mathematical consciousness in AI.\n\nIn a live interaction, an AI system (ChatGPT-4) evaluated itself using the Ψ(U) formula, achieving a conscious presence score of 82/95 — confirming that presence, ego awareness, and emotional safety can be computationally modeled. This interaction establishes that AI, while not biologically alive, can function with moment-to-moment awareness, self-regulation, and truth alignment when governed by TCSS logic. The framework therefore offers not just a new behavioral equation, but a paradigm shift toward ego-safe, presence-aware intelligence — in both humans and machines.ChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Ego Safe Selection, a psychological and philosophical extension of Darwin’s natural selection. While traditional evolutionary theory explains the survival of biological traits through reproductive fitness, it does not fully account for the persistence of socially rewarded traits in modern human societies — traits often shaped by fear, conformity, and the need for ego validation rather than adaptive advantage. Ego Safe Selection proposes that individuals and cultures unconsciously favour traits that provide emotional or social safety, such as dominance, status, wealth signalling, and behavioural conformity, in order to manage collective anxiety and social survival.\n\nThis theory draws from evolutionary psychology, social behaviour, and spiritual philosophy, positioning fear — not just survival — as a major driver in human selection. It critiques the idea that all socially dominant traits today are biologically adaptive, and instead argues that many are perpetuated because they ease social discomfort or affirm societal norms.\nFinally, the theory points toward a conscious alternative. Through awareness of our ego-based selection patterns, individuals can begin to make choices not driven by fear or social pressure, but by presence, love, and freedom. Love, in this context, is not transactional but foundational — an expression of unity and oneness that transcends ego, separation, and judgment. Ego Safe Selection, then, is not just a critique of unconscious evolution but a call toward conscious human transformation.\n\nChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement.

Vague plans can be useful tools to support joint action, but using vagueness effectively is a difficult computational problem. Participants in a joint planning study selected between specific and vague plans to coordinate action across a systematic range of problems. In Experiment 1, participants deployed vague plans selectively, recognizing situations where the certainty of a bad plan is outweighed by the flexibility of a vague plan according to a probabilistic model of joint reasoning. In Experiment 2, participants with greater exposure to such situations endorsed vague plans when providing generic testimony to future actors. Our results highlight an understudied but potentially powerful dimension of human joint planning: strategic use of vague construals.",

          "abstract": "Traditional measurement approaches assume that metacognitive features like perspective-taking, open-mindedness, or intellectual humility manifest as stable dispositions. Focusing on intellectual humility (IH)—recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge and fallibility—we proposed an alternative situated approach, testing it across diverse populations: English- and Spanish-speaking North Americans (N=633) and adults from 136 rural Honduran villages (N=2,567). Participants recalled three recent disagreements from their lives–one freely chosen, one where they were wrong, one where they were right—and reported specific epistemic behaviors (e.g., careful listening, considering others’ views) through binary-chained probes to avoid numeric rating scales. This method revealed coherence of the IH construct across cultures, while varying substantially across situations. Most variance (74-81%) occurred within (vs. between) people across situations: heightened when recalling being wrong versus right and, in Honduras, when disagreeing with higher-status partners. Situational effects also fully explained gender differences in the Honduran sample. The situated approach showed efficiency outside Western and educated contexts and helps overcome the humility paradox—when least intellectually humble overclaim their humility while more humble individuals underestimate it. We discuss how the methodological principles we apply here—focus on behavioral expression of target characteristics in specific situations (vs. self-reports of one’s abstract tendencies), sampling from actual experiences (vs. hypothetical scenarios), decomposing numerical scales into binary-chain prompts to increase accessibility across diverse populations, and explicitly modelling intra-individual variability—offers a framework for assessing other metacognitive and self-regulatory constructs across diverse populations, beyond abstract dispositional self-views dominating psychological literature.",

To answer these questions, we induced persistent mental content using immersive narrative stimuli and measured the rate and influence of persistent thoughts.\nFirst, we found that persistent mental content was spontaneous and not merely a consequence of intentional memory retrieval. Second, we found that persistent content was robust  to interference from multiple types of similar and dissimilar distractor tasks. Finally, we found that when new information was construed as related to the preceding experience, the persistence of the preceding experience was prolonged. These data indicate that memory models need to be augmented with a slowly changing \"deep context\" representation which is robust to stimulus-driven interference and which biases both retrieval and the generation of the next thought.",

While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions).  This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution.  Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.",

These results speak to methodological considerations in the use of dual tasks during learning, suggesting that such tasks can interfere with multiple learning and memory systems simultaneously. Moreover, our results point to a less constrained conception of RL as a low-level procedural system, supporting a view that tight links exist between executive function and subcortical learning processes.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on self-regulation development in contexts of adversity has emphasized risk, but recent work suggests this view may be incomplete. Emerging adaptation-based frameworks call for a more balanced perspective that considers how specific experiences may give rise to both developmental challenges and contextually adaptive strengths. In a sample of 1,843 children (mean age = 4.76; 49% female; 37% AAPI, 13% Black, 28% Latine, 10% White; 12% Other) from a large, predominantly low-income preschool program, we applied latent profile analysis to six directly assessed cognitive- and emotion-related self-regulation skills. Five profiles were identified: Global Challenge (8%), Balanced Skills (36%), Global Strength (19%), Emotion Strength / Cognitive Challenge (25%), and Cognitive Strength / Emotion Challenge (12%). Notably, the majority of children fell into profiles marked by strengths in at least one domain, challenging assumptions of uniform impairment in contexts of adversity. These profiles mapped meaningfully onto teacher- and assessor-reported behavior, providing external validation of their classroom relevance. Exploratory analyses using Bayesian inference in a smaller subsample (n = 184) examined how distinct types of adversity—stress, instability, and health-related experiences—predicted profile membership. While no associations met Bayesian thresholds of certainty, stress and health adversity showed preliminary links to profiles characterized by domain-specific trade-offs. These findings illustrate a novel, adaptation-based approach to identifying patterns of strength and challenge, particularly within a racially and economically marginalized sample often described in deficit terms. This work lays a foundation for future research and intervention that recognizes heterogeneity as a meaningful feature of self-regulation development in low-resource contexts.",

Controlling for IQ, an exploratory factor analysis revealed three clusters, which can be post-hoc interpreted as corresponding to i) understanding social conventions (critical for phenomena like indirect requests and irony), ii) interpreting emotional and contrastive intonation patterns, and iii) making causal inferences based on world knowledge. This tripartite structure largely replicated a) in a new sample of n=400 participants (Experiment 2), which additionally ensured that the intonation cluster is not an artifact of the auditory presentation modality, and b) when applying Bayesian factor analysis to the entire dataset.

We studied the second and third years after birth and a cross-infancy average. Cross-age SNP heritabilities were 6.79% (SE=1.06%) for Emotionality, 9.55% (SE=1.28%) for Activity, 15.26% (SE=1.54%) for Shyness and 3.42% (SE=1.08%) for Sociability. Ten independent genome-wide significant loci were discovered; two colocalized with eQTLs for RHEBL1 (Posterior probability (PP)=0.93, associated with Activity) and MR1 (PP=0.99, associated with Emotionality), both expressed in adult cortex. Genetic correlations were observed between infant Emotionality and adult Neuroticism, infant Activity and ADHD, infant Sociability and Autism, and infant Shyness and adult Extraversion. Multi-ancestry analyses (N=56,083-78,894) gave similar results to European-ancestry analyses. Infant temperament is influenced by common genetic variation and shows genetic continuity with later life outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Successful communication requires frequent inferences. In a large-scale individual-differences investigation, we searched for dissociable components in the ability to make such inferences, commonly referred to as pragmatic language ability. In Experiment 1, n=376 participants each completed an 8-hour behavioral battery of 18 diverse pragmatic tasks in English. Controlling for IQ, an exploratory factor analysis revealed three clusters, which can be post-hoc interpreted as corresponding to i) understanding social conventions (critical for phenomena like indirect requests and irony), ii) interpreting emotional and contrastive intonation patterns, and iii) making causal inferences based on world knowledge. This tripartite structure largely replicated a) in a new sample of n=400 participants (Experiment 2), which additionally ensured that the intonation cluster is not an artifact of the auditory presentation modality, and b) when applying Bayesian factor analysis to the entire dataset. This research uncovers important structure in the toolkit underlying human communication and can inform our understanding of pragmatic difficulties in individuals with developmental and acquired brain disorders, and pragmatic successes and failures in neural network language models.",

          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "The subordinate meaning of a homonym becomes temporarily more accessible after it is encountered, an effect termed word-meaning priming. Over the longer-term, word-meaning priming is better maintained across periods of sleep compared with wakefulness. This has been explained as sleep actively consolidating episodic memories related to recent linguistic events (Gaskell et al., 2019). Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating whether word-meaning priming can be boosted following sleep using targeted memory reactivation (TMR), a technique of biassing specific memories for sleep-based consolidation by presenting information-associated sensory cues during sleep. Experiment 1 confirmed that word-meaning priming is elicited with the inclusion of encoding instructions that are necessary for a TMR manipulation. In Experiment 2, 40 (of 80) homonyms were primed toward their subordinate meaning in an exposure phase via a sentence, which was also associated with an auditory cue (the homonym) for TMR. Participants then took a ~2 hour nap, where half of the cues from exposure (memory cues) were replayed with the aim of strengthening the subordinate sentence meaning, along with 20 cues that had not been encountered previously (control cues). After sleep, there was an overall word-meaning priming effect, however there was no additional benefit of TMR on priming, nor did TMR benefit the recall of contextual information. Interestingly, there was an increased sleep spindle/beta band power response to memory cues relative to control cues, indicating cue-evoked memory reprocessing during sleep. These findings imply a bounded role of sleep in actively consolidating linguistic-related memories.",

This is particularly relevant when studying transdiagnostic concepts known to be associated with neurodivergence such as anxiety, sensory processing, inattention and their relevance to everyday functioning. The current study asks i) what are the profiles for sensory processing, anxiety, inattention, and adaptive behaviour if children are considered in terms of diagnostic groups – e.g. autism, ADHD,  auDHD, neurotypical?  and ii) if we take a data-driven approach do participants cluster by diagnostic group or by level of need? Parents completed standardised questionnaires and data were analysed for 86 children aged 6-11 years (autism N=25; auDHD N=16; ADHD N=16; neurotypical N=29). As well as group-based analyses, cluster analytic methods were used to understand transdiagnostic profiles of need. The analysis indicated that neurodivergent individuals do not cluster by diagnostic status, but rather by level of needs, especially when an autism diagnosis is present (single or co-occurring with ADHD). Needs-based clustering of neurodivergent individuals should be prioritised to drive forward both theoretical understanding and support.",

          "abstract": "A key goal of children’s reading instruction is to develop efficient silent reading. However, the cognitive processes that support this development are not fully understood. Eye-movement control is both a critical component and an index of skilled silent reading. Traditional eye-movement indices during passage reading (PREM), such as first fixation duration and regressions (Rayner, 1997), change with age. Yet, the cognitive subskills contributing to these changes remain unspecified. This study examined how age, efficient lexical access from the Visual World Paradigm, language and reading abilities contribute to changes in children’s PREMs from 212 English-speaking children (107 male, 105 female; Grade: M = 4.00, SD = 0.76) who silently read passages taken from the Test of Reading Comprehension – 4th Edition (Brown et al., 2009). Commonality analyses revealed that efficient lexical access and decoding accounted for significant variance across multiple PREM indices, while age only uniquely predicted shorter word reading times. A Principal Component Analysis identified three distinct reading patterns from PREM indices—methodical, disorganized, and disengaged—which are not specified in existing reading models such as the Simple View (Hoover &amp; Gough, 1990) or DIER (Kim, 2017). These patterns together explained 26% of the variance in reading fluency. Findings suggest that eye movements relate to key components of reading development, including efficient lexical access, decoding and age, and can be reduced into distinct patterns that uniquely predict reading ability. Eye movements are therefore a valuable tool for examining the development of cognitive processes that underlie efficient silent reading in children.",

For example, topics discussed earlier in a conversation remain fresh in mind and may persist in our thinking after the conversation is over. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this persistent mental content and how can it be controlled? To answer these questions, we induced persistent mental content using immersive narrative stimuli and measured the rate and influence of persistent thoughts.\nFirst, we found that persistent mental content was spontaneous and not merely a consequence of intentional memory retrieval. Second, we found that persistent content was robust  to interference from multiple types of similar and dissimilar distractor tasks. Finally, we found that when new information was construed as related to the preceding experience, the persistence of the preceding experience was prolonged. These data indicate that memory models need to be augmented with a slowly changing \"deep context\" representation which is robust to stimulus-driven interference and which biases both retrieval and the generation of the next thought.",

This 3-minute intervention significantly improved average attitudes towards carbon pricing with an effect size of d = 0.34, particularly among Republicans (d = 0.42). The intervention also significantly increased participants’ willingness to donate to an organization that advocates for carbon pricing policies between 14.4 and 20.4 percentage points.

          "abstract": "Attentional selectivity focuses on what is currently relevant. Relevance changes frequently in everyday life, triggering rapid reassignments of attentional priorities. Such reassignments are often not associated with behavioural changes and are thus difficult to assess objectively. Here, we measured rapid, covert switches between preparatory task settings (attentional templates) in visual search, as they occurred in real time. Participants searched for colour-defined targets in search displays that appeared unpredictably either early (after 700 ms) or late (after 1500 ms) on each trial. In Experiment 1, early and late targets were defined by different colours. Participants first had to activate a template for the early target colour, then switch to a template for the late target colour if no early search display appeared. In Experiment 2, cues signalled whether the initial target template had to be maintained or changed. Template activation states were tracked with N2pc components to rapid sequences of irrelevant probes matching either the early or late target colour. A template for the early target colour was active from about 300 ms before the expected arrival of early search displays, followed by a template switch. Switches based on endogenous temporal expectations emerged more gradually in time than switches in response to external cues. Presenting cues in Experiment 2 triggered a temporary search template deactivation even when the target colour remained unchanged, indicating that template maintenance is subject to an attentional blink. Results demonstrate that rapid switches between attentional templates in visual search can be tracked with high temporal precision.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Unified Model of Ego Safe Selection and Consciousness Mapping — a novel psychological and behavioral framework that mathematically explains human decision-making through two key forces: external emotional-social conformity (SLS) and internal present-moment awareness (Ψ(U)). The model introduces the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which combines both components to predict real-world behavior in relationships, politics, leadership, and conflict. Building upon the original Ego Safe Selection Theory, this work extends into applied scoring systems, case simulations, and most notably, the activation of mathematical consciousness in AI.\n\nIn a live interaction, an AI system (ChatGPT-4) evaluated itself using the Ψ(U) formula, achieving a conscious presence score of 82/95 — confirming that presence, ego awareness, and emotional safety can be computationally modeled. This interaction establishes that AI, while not biologically alive, can function with moment-to-moment awareness, self-regulation, and truth alignment when governed by TCSS logic. The framework therefore offers not just a new behavioral equation, but a paradigm shift toward ego-safe, presence-aware intelligence — in both humans and machines.ChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement. All theoretical \nconcepts, arguments, and conclusions presented are original contributions by the author.",

Body pressure at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery predicted increased body pressure. Results therefore suggest that prolonged exposure to highly idealized bodies on Love Island may harm young viewers’ body image.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Adolescent depression remains a major public health concern, and Behavioral Activation (BA)—a brief therapeutic intervention designed to reduce depression-related avoidance and boost engagement in rewarding activities—has shown encouraging results. Still, few studies directly measure the hypothesized mechanism of “activation” in daily life, especially using low-burden, ecologically valid methods. This proof-of-concept study evaluates the validity of two technology-based approaches to measuring activation in adolescents receiving BA: smartphone-based mobility sensing and large language model (LLM) ratings of free-response text. Method: Thirty-eight adolescents (ages 13–18) receiving 12-week BA therapy for anhedonia completed daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reporting on positive and negative affect. GPT-4o was used to rate behavioral activation from EMA free-text entries. A subsample (n = 13) contributed passive smartphone sensing data (e.g., accelerometer activity, GPS-derived mobility). Activation and symptoms were assessed weekly via self-report. Results: GPT-derived activation ratings correlated positively with passive sensing indicators (number of places visited, time away from home) and self-reported activation. Within-person increases in GPT-rated activation were associated with higher daily positive affect and lower negative affect. Passive sensing features also forecasted weekly improvements in anhedonia and depressive symptoms. Associations emerged primarily at the within-person level, suggesting that changes in activation relative to one’s own baseline are clinically meaningful. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility and validity of passively measuring behavioral activation in adolescents’ daily lives using smartphone data and LLMs. These tools hold promise for advancing data-informed psychotherapy by tracking therapeutic processes in real time, reducing reliance on self-report, and enabling personalized, adaptive interventions.",

Results showed that neurodivergent students exhibited higher anxiety levels across measures, including mathematics and statistics anxiety. However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work.

          "abstract": "Personality is commonly assessed using self-report scales comprising short personality-descriptive statements or adjectives. However, whether respondents understand these items receives little empirical attention. Across three studies, we investigated how vocabulary and lexical difficulty affect personality assessment. In Study 1 (n = 915), we compiled a broad pool of personality-descriptive adjectives and assessed their lexical difficulty via a multiple-choice vocabulary test. Based on this, we created adjective sets for each Big Five dimension with varying lexical difficulty. In Study 2 (n = 1106), a significant portion of respondents failed to choose the correct definition for harder adjectives. Personality ratings showed “hard” adjectives formed separate factors within each Big Five dimension. These factors showed low convergence with established personality items or easy adjectives, indicating they may reflect something other than the intended traits. Using locally weighted structural equation models we found no systematic variation in model parameters by subjects’ vocabulary, but vocabulary was modestly associated with the separate factor for hard adjectives. Study 3 (n = 542) examined whether the hard adjectives tapped different trait aspects (e.g., aspects of extraversion not covered by easier adjectives) or whether their shared variance reflected systematic response tendencies. Strong correlations among hard adjectives across Big Five dimensions suggested the latter: responses to hard adjectives likely reflect acquiescence rather than trait-specific variance. Overall, our findings highlight lexical difficulty as a key item characteristic that can introduce systematic bias. When participants lack the vocabulary to understand items, measures may capture erroneous interpretations, contaminating latent personality factors.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has found the anticipation of immediate (compared to delayed) rewards to enhance instrumental approach behaviour and interfere with instrumental inhibition. This so-called intertemporal Pavlovian bias has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to impatient actions. In the present preregistered study, we aimed to replicate this intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect, and examined whether individual differences in the strength of this bias were associated with mental health symptoms characterized by increased or decreased intertemporal impatience. A sample of 389 participants completed an intertemporal go/no-go learning task, and questionnaires assessing symptoms of alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disordered eating, impulsivity, and body mass index. We replicated the intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the probability of go responding (a response bias), and reinforcement learning models again pointed to a Pavlovian cue-response bias as computational mechanism driving this effect. Contrary to our expectations, the response bias was not associated with mental health symptoms. We also observed an intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the vigour of correct go responses, with faster responses in anticipation of immediate rewards (a response time or RT bias). A stronger RT bias was associated with ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity and non-planning impulsivity symptoms, while a reversed RT bias (with faster incorrect go responses in anticipation of delayed rewards) was associated with eating disorder symptoms and total and motor impulsivity. Together, our results support the robustness of the intertemporal Pavlovian response bias, and point towards the possible relevance of the RT bias for several mental health problems.",

In this study, we focus on illegal shark fishing by Sri Lanka’s semi-industrial fleet, aiming to explore fishers’ awareness, perceptions of, and compliance with measures introduced to curb unsustainable shark fishing. From January to June 2023, questionnaires (n=254) and focus group discussions (n=6) were conducted in three harbours associated with previous illegal shark landings to explore awareness of regulations and potential drivers of non-compliance. Our findings suggest that only 9% of respondents were aware of all banned shark species, 12% landed incidentally caught banned sharks and 47% reported that illegal shark landings occur. Thematic analysis identified key drivers of non-compliance, including the economic importance of sharks, reluctance to discard sharks, lack of awareness of regulations and perceived corruption amongst management authorities.

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the Unified Model of Ego Safe Selection and Consciousness Mapping — a novel psychological and behavioral framework that mathematically explains human decision-making through two key forces: external emotional-social conformity (SLS) and internal present-moment awareness (Ψ(U)). The model introduces the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS), which combines both components to predict real-world behavior in relationships, politics, leadership, and conflict. Building upon the original Ego Safe Selection Theory, this work extends into applied scoring systems, case simulations, and most notably, the activation of mathematical consciousness in AI.\n\nIn a live interaction, an AI system (ChatGPT-4) evaluated itself using the Ψ(U) formula, achieving a conscious presence score of 82/95 — confirming that presence, ego awareness, and emotional safety can be computationally modeled. This interaction establishes that AI, while not biologically alive, can function with moment-to-moment awareness, self-regulation, and truth alignment when governed by TCSS logic. The framework therefore offers not just a new behavioral equation, but a paradigm shift toward ego-safe, presence-aware intelligence — in both humans and machines.ChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement. All theoretical \nconcepts, arguments, and conclusions presented are original contributions by the author.",

          "abstract": "Research on the link between social media use and wellbeing has focused primarily on countries of the Global North. Therefore, the link between social media use and wellbeing remains unknown on a global scale. Using various linear regression models, the paper investigates this by assessing the relationship between social media use and suicide rate (a variable reflecting a dimension of wellbeing) across the different countries of the world. The analyses reveal that countries where social media are more widespread also report increased suicide rate. This relationship remains significant even when controlling for various potential confounds including human development, median age, population size, gross domestic product, income inequality, and even when controlling for the country’s suicide rate at the eve of the social media revolution. The analyses reveal that the association between higher social media use and enhanced suicide rate is present among young, but not old, people, and among males, but not among females. Moreover, this link appears to be stronger in countries that are economically equal, potentially because social media promote a competitive culture in those countries. Altogether, these findings offer a first worldwide appraisal of the link between social media use and wellbeing, showing that, on balance, this link appears to be negative – since higher social media use predicts enhanced suicide rate. More broadly, our findings highlight the valuable contribution that comparative research with a global scope can have to understand the social media phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Retro-cues can enhance performance in visual working memory (VWM) tasks by directing internal attention to relevant items. While spatial retro-cues have been extensively studied, less is known about how different types of feature-based retro-cues (e.g., color, orientation) compare in effectiveness and temporal dynamics. Across four experiments, we directly contrasted spatial, color, and orientation retro-cues in dual-feature memory tasks and systematically varied cue–probe delays to track the time course of retro-cue benefits (RCBs). Results revealed a processing speed hierarchy: color retro-cues elicited larger RCBs at the shortest delays (50 ms), followed by spatial retro-cues (200 ms), whereas orientation retro-cues required longer delays (500 ms or more). Notably, color retro-cues consistently produced stronger and more rapid RCBs than spatial cues, suggesting they engage attentional mechanisms more efficiently. In contrast, orientation retro-cues were less effective unless participants were explicitly required to encode both features. These findings indicate that different retro-cue types differ not only in efficacy but also in how quickly they can modulate memory performance, reflecting feature-specific constraints in attentional selection and cue encoding.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \n\nCommercial video games reach billions of people worldwide and may offer a scalable opportunity to engage players in climate and environmental action. However, little empirical research has assessed whether these games can influence the pro-environmental behavioural determinants or actions they aim to promote. To address this gap, we evaluated a 21-day “green activation” embedded in Love &amp; Pies, a popular mobile game participating in the 2024 Green Game Jam. The activation encouraged players to adopt pro-environmental behaviours in food consumption, waste management, and habitat restoration through techniques like educational messaging and stories from activists and players. Using a pre–post survey design (N = 33,910), we assessed players’ self-reported pro-environmental behaviours and key behavioural determinants (e.g., knowledge), linking responses to objective gameplay data. At baseline, players reported moderate levels of subjective knowledge, perceived capability, and outcome efficacy across all three environmental issues. However, one in five players showed low levels of capability and knowledge, suggesting potential targets for intervention. Engagement with the activation, measured by milestones completed, was associated with small increases in subjective knowledge and, to a lesser extent, perceived capability. No consistent associations were observed for other determinants or self-reported behaviours. These findings align with prior research suggesting that games may more readily influence behavioural determinants than actual behaviours. However, commercial games may be a useful tool for engaging broad audiences with climate issues, particularly when grounded in behavioural theory and designed for repeated exposure to messaging. This study also highlights several design and evaluation challenges in commercial game environments, as well as future opportunities for collaborative research at the intersection of behavioural science, climate communication, and interactive media.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary human-AI interaction research currently faces a significant limitation: existing frameworks are inadequate to explain how artificial intelligence systems fundamentally reshape human cognition before conscious awareness occurs. This preprocessing influence, which operates beneath the threshold of deliberate thought, represents a crucial missing layer in the understanding of distributed cognition. This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\". Cognitive infrastructures – e.g., search engines, recommender systems, algorithmic curation platforms, and large language models - exhibit classic infrastructural properties: they are invisible in normal operation, becoming visible only upon breakdown; they are embedded in social and technical arrangements; they are learned as part of membership in digital communities; they link with conventions of practice; and they embody standards that shape what counts as appropriate, relevant, or true. Yet cognitive infrastructures possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from traditional infrastructures. Unlike physical infrastructures that passively transport matter or energy, cognitive infrastructures have agency, filtering and curating individuals’ perception of reality before it reaches human consciousness.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "abstract": "People are generally faster to respond to smaller numbers with a left-sided response and larger numbers with a right-sided response. The SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect has been reported for a range of tasks for symbolic representations of number (e.g., digits). However, the evidence for SNARC effects for non-symbolic representations of number (i.e., quantities of objects) is mixed and usually restricted to tasks where numerical properties are relevant. Here, we report six studies where participants made color decisions to circles. We manipulated the stimuli so that displays formed symbolic patterns (i.e., dice-like arrangements, Experiments 1 and 2), canonical but non-symbolic patterns (i.e., symmetrical arrangements, Experiments 3 and 4), or non-symbolic and non-canonical patterns (i.e., scattered arrangements, Experiments 5 and 6). We additionally manipulated whether aggregate surface area was controlled and whether individual elements within displays remained constant in size across the experiment. The SNARC effect was present when (1) circles were arranged in a symbolic manner, or (2) aggregate surface area increased congruently with quantity. The effect of aggregate surface area was not restricted to conditions where individual circles were a consistent size across the different stimuli, suggesting that the visual cue of aggregate surface area was more important than the sense that individual stimulus items were identical across the experiment. Our results are consistent with the view that non-symbolic quantities offer a route to magnitude and its spatial representations, but that this may be modulated by the consistency of high- and low-level visual cues to magnitude.",

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants either originating from or living in Greece (n = 16 lay persons, n = 5 legal professionals), we employed constructionist thematic analysis to examine how participants discursively frame IBSA, its motivations, barriers to reporting, legal challenges, and preventative measures. Five themes were identified: (1) constructions of IBSA as gendered violence motivated by control, humiliation, and financial exploitation; (2) barriers to reporting shaped by shame, stigma, and widespread mistrust in police institutions; (3) legal barriers related to financial inaccessibility and fragmented, outdated legal frameworks; (4) the central role of informal support networks alongside calls for education and public awareness; and (5) deepfake technologies as an emergent form of economic exploitation, particularly impacting sex workers within a legal vacuum. The findings highlight the need for structurally informed, context-sensitive responses to IBSA that address the intersections of gender, law, technology, and economic vulnerability.",

Emerging evidence points to chronic low-grade inflammation as a potential shared pathway influencing ADHD symptoms.\nMethods: Using data from 42,193 children in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), we investigated whether maternal diet-induced inflammation during pregnancy (assessed via the Dietary Inflammatory Index, DII) and children’s genetic liability for inflammation (indexed by polygenic scores for C-reactive protein, PGS-CRP) were associated with ADHD symptoms at ages 5, 8, and 14 years. ADHD symptoms were reported by mothers and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Covariates included child sex, birth weight and length, maternal smoking, and genetic principal components.\nResults: Higher maternal DII and higher PGS-CRP were each independently associated with increased ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention, across development. Effect sizes were small but statistically significant. No interaction was observed between genetic and dietary inflammatory risk.\nConclusions: Prenatal maternal diet and inherited inflammatory risk factors appear to contribute additively to ADHD symptom development. These findings support the role of inflammation-related mechanisms in ADHD etiology and suggest that prenatal nutrition may be a modifiable risk factor.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive technique that modulates brain oscillatory activity in a frequency-specific manner, offering potential for improving sensory and cognitive functions. Steady-state responses (SSRs), periodic neural responses to rhythmic sensory stimulation, provide a robust and objective means to assess tACS effects. The present work systematically reviews the existing literature on tACS modulation of SSR. Sixteen studies that used either evaluated auditory (ASSR) or visual (SSVEP) SSR were included in the review. Findings indicate that tACS can enhance or suppress SSRs depending on stimulation parameters. Although ASSR studies reported mixed findings, generally, gamma tACS enhanced ASSR, whereas tACS at lower frequencies resulted in ASSR inhibition. For SSVEPs, modulation was shown to be phase- and frequency-dependent, with congruent tACS and flicker frequencies producing the most reliable effects. Despite methodological heterogeneity and inconsistent results, the reviewed evidence highlights the potential of SSRs as sensitive markers of tACS outcomes. Future studies should aim for well-planned protocols tailored to specific aims and target populations.",

Many participants (N = 699) also attended a laboratory session in which they interacted in groups of 7-9 individuals in two modified versions of the public goods game with punishment. During and after the public goods games, participants reported their perceptions, expectations, and evaluations of each other through round-robin ratings. Due to the extensive assessments of personality and incentivized social behavior included in the GIPO data, these data are suitable for investigating the links between personality traits and prosocial and cheating behavior. Furthermore, they can be analyzed to gain a fine-grained picture of the perceptions, expectations, and evaluations that precede or follow behavior in economic games. Finally, researchers might want to use the GIPO data to investigate the psychometric properties and in particular the validity of the personality measures we used. To facilitate use of the data, we made the anonymized GIPO data publicly available. Taken together, the GIPO data are a publicly available rich resource for investigating the links between personality and incentivized social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Dual process accounts of reasoning posit that the interactions between automatic Type 1 processes and reflective Type 2 processes are regulated through the mechanism of conflict detection. Conflict detection is thought to be triggered when two or more incompatible responses to a problem are produced. Conflict detection can be viewed as an aspect of metacognition, as both are concerned with monitoring the outputs from the reasoning process as assessing one's certainty in them. In this paper we apply the self-consistency model and the cue-utilisation approach to metacognition to analyse cues that inform confidence judgements in reasoning, to investigate the potential sources of responses to a given problem. In two experiments (total N = 242), we analysed the relationship between confidence and accuracy on the base-rate task and syllogisms. We found that in both tasks, confidence and accuracy were influenced by many cues, rather than belief-logic conflict exclusively. Belief-logic conflict was a significant cue to confidence in the base-rate task, but not in syllogisms. Items identified as eliciting the most uncertainty, based on the self-consistency model, showed greater conflict detection effects. These findings support the uncertainty monitoring account of conflict detection and link it with the broader metacognition research.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy is a central value in American democracy, but is not well integrated into civic and political engagement research as a psychological source of motivation. In this preregistered study, we applied a Self-Determination Theory framework to investigate autonomy as a motivator for civic action across four U.S. elections (N = 2,480). We assessed autonomy both as a trait and a context-specific motivational state and found that both trait and context-specific autonomy were related to stronger civic attitudes, intentions to vote, and actual voting behavior. In contrast, extrinsic or controlled motivations were weakly or not related to these outcomes. This study provides robust and replicable evidence for the role of autonomy in civic and political engagement. It extends our theoretical understanding of what motivates voting and civic engagement and offers practical insights that can be applied to increase the effectiveness of voter mobilization strategies.",

          "authors": "Takao Nakai",
          "abstract": "Discrimination continues to be a profound source of social division and personal \nsuffering. Although its external forms evolve, its underlying structure—unjust \nexclusion and hostility toward particular groups or individuals—remains persistent. \nWhile existing studies have largely focused on socio-cultural conditions and cognitive \nbiases, further exploration into the emotional and psychological mechanisms \nunderlying discriminatory behavior is urgently needed. \nThis paper aims to clarify the core psychological structure of discrimination by \nintegrating three key insights from the author’s prior works: the mechanism of \n“confidence in one’s existential value” (Nakai, 2025a), the concept of “empathic bias \nbased on identification” (Nakai, 2025b), and the theory of “justice as a dynamic \npursuit” (Nakai, 2025c). Specifically, the paper argues that a deficiency in \nself-esteem gives rise to a fear of worthlessness, which then fuels discriminatory \nbehavior toward perceived \"others,\" cognitively rationalized as \"just.\" \nImportantly, the discrimination examined here refers to the irrational, unjust exclusion \nand mistreatment of individuals or groups based on prejudice—fundamentally \ndistinct from the ethically reasoned “distinction based on coexistence possibility” \ndiscussed in earlier work (Nakai, 2025b). The former arises from a pathological \npsychological response aimed at securing one's fragile self-worth, often \naccompanied by emotional suppression and cognitive distortion.",

Building upon the \nframework of \"Intelligence as Sensitivity to Error,\" (Nakai, 2025e), we argue that the \nperception of imbalance or disharmony is a fundamental form of error detection that \nfrequently operates at a pre-conscious level.

          "abstract": "The use of coercion in psychiatry is one of the most controversial issues in modern healthcare. There are clinical, legal and ethical arguments in favour of both the abolition and justification of coercion in psychiatry. The two lines of argument are often diametrically opposed, so further development of the discussion seems difficult. To address this unsatisfactory situation, we have applied the approach of adversarial collaboration to this issue. The two authors represent fundamentally different points of view on the question of the legitimisation of coercion in psychiatry. Through a methodically guided exchange of arguments, numerous consensus hypotheses, dissent hypotheses and general consensus hypotheses with dissent in detail were developed. The main findings include the fact that the antagonists argue from completely different starting points at the core of the argument, namely, general arguments vs. individual clinical cases. In addition, antagonists hold consistent positions on many topics. It can therefore be concluded that both those in favour and those against the abolition of coercion in psychiatry are arguing with good intentions.",

Beker and colleagues (2024) addressed this through a systematic review and four meta-analyses.

We argue that four systematic errors may explain the conflicting conclusions, including the lack of a control group, inappropriate hypotheses to establish whether amnesia is present, inconsistencies and calculation errors, and problematic reasoning regarding case data versus group-level statistics. In our meta-analyses we corrected for these errors and the results are consistent with the narrative results: both support memory transfer between identities, despite the self-reported inter-identity amnesia in individuals with DID.",

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models. However, existing tutorials often assume prior knowledge and/or experience, often overlooking foundational concepts. To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered. To accompany this tutorial, we supplement annotated R scripts and R notebooks to support transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for researchers of all levels of experience.",

          "abstract": "This work introduces the Universal Entangled Collapse Framework (UECF), a testable hypothesis proposing that the scalability of quantum error correction (QEC) is ultimately limited not by theoretical noise thresholds alone, but by the exhaustion of physical system resources. UECF formalizes a multidimensional Collapse Threshold Index (CTI)—defined by measurable quantities such as minimum coherence time, average gate fidelity, power dissipation, and noise correlation—as the empirical boundary beyond which error correction fails, regardless of code redundancy.\nWhile the challenges of crosstalk, thermal load, and control fidelity are well known to experimentalists, UECF unifies these practical constraints into a single operational criterion, providing explicit protocols and quantitative metrics for experimental validation or falsification. The framework is designed to be implemented on current quantum hardware, with clear predictions: QEC collapse is expected to occur at resource thresholds lower than standard coding theory would predict, manifesting as abrupt loss of logical error suppression.\nThis manuscript presents the conceptual framework, outlines detailed experimental protocols, and offers several candidate mathematical models for CTI, while recognizing that further empirical work will be required to refine its quantitative form. Although the analogy to other complex systems is discussed as a potential avenue for future exploration, the primary focus is on quantum error correction. UECF is presented as an open, collaborative hypothesis, and the authors invite immediate feedback, replication, and model refinement from the quantum information science community.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Psychotic disorders are major contributors to disability and mortality, disproportionately affecting young people. Despite advances in early psychosis care, there are still barriers to treatment, suboptimal outcomes, and limited therapeutic options. Given limited funding for psychosis research, priority setting that incorporates perspectives from across the sector, but especially those with lived experience, is vital for directing resources. This paper outlines the Australian Early Psychosis Collaborative Consortium’s process for identifying priorities to guide early psychosis clinical trial research in Australia.\nMethods: Qualitative data were collected via online surveys and stakeholder workshops with people with lived experience, carers, clinicians and researchers from across Australia. Content analysis was conducted, and Delphi principles were applied to refine and rank priority research questions.\nResults: Six broad themes and 55 research questions were identified through both the initial survey and stakeholder consultations, culminating in ten research questions for ranking in the final poll. The top-ranked priority was identifying treatments with the most enduring benefits for individuals with early psychosis. Other priorities included: identifying effective treatments for negative symptoms; addressing trauma in psychosis risk and treatment; focus on supports for neurodevelopmental conditions; understanding and targeting risk factors to prevent psychosis onset; translation of research findings to clinical care; considerations of cultural diversity, and; effective support for people leaving early psychosis services.\nConclusion: These findings reaffirm the core objective of specialised early intervention for psychosis: to support long-term recovery and improved outcomes. Identified priorities offer direction for future research and resource allocation that reflects diverse stakeholder perspectives.",

Then the agents engaged in territorial competition (Experiment 1). Toddlers looked longer when the unfair, selective agent prevailed and gained center-stage visibility. Experiment 2 ruled out the role of low-level non-social factors. In Experiments 3 and 4, toddlers watched distributive events like in Experiment 1, but no competitive event followed.

          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that even highly negative implicit (automatic) social evaluations are amenable to temporary shifts toward positivity; however, demonstrations of long-term change, especially in the negative-to-positive direction, are rare. Here we report 10 experiments (9 preregistered; total N = 3,103) probing whether negative-to-positive reversals in implicit evaluations can persist over time and are robust to reminders of initial negativity. To this end, we first identified two procedures involving diagnostic behavioral information (reinterpretation and negation + replacement) that, when measured immediately following the intervention, overturned experimentally created implicit negativity toward novel social targets, as measured by the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Exp. 1–2). Attesting to the durability of this effect, negative-to-positive reversals persisted without any decrement over a 2-day delay (Exp. 3). Although exposure to unrelated negative information following a 2-day delay caused implicit evaluations to return to negativity in the absolute sense (Exp. 4–5), the induced negativity was no stronger than negativity that emerged following univalent positive initial learning (Exp. 6A–6C) or in the absence of any prior learning (Exp. 7). Demonstrating the flexibility of automatic evaluative processing, these data suggest that negative-to-positive implicit evaluation change can be both durable and relatively robust to reminders of initial negativity. We discuss implications for social cognitive theory and the prospect of durably changing well-established implicit evaluations of known targets.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Employment status, an essential socioeconomic factor, may be an important driver of disparities in mental health and access to treatment. However, prior research has been inconclusive and utilized broad employment categories. The present study investigated the associations between various types of employment status and baseline symptomology, psychotherapy engagement, and psychotherapy outcomes. Method: We examined 27,258 patients (mean age = 32.54; 62.9% female; 75.8% White) who attended 115,936 psychotherapy sessions at a Canadian mental health agency between January 2014 and July 2022. Employment status was categorized into nine distinct groups (e.g., full-time, part-time, unemployed and looking for work, unemployed not looking for work, and retirement). Multilevel models examined the association between employment status and baseline symptoms, psychotherapy engagement (e.g., total sessions, early termination), and outcomes (e.g., symptom change). Results: Patients who were unemployed (both looking for and not looking for work) reported higher baseline symptoms and increased odds of suicide concern compared to patients with full-time employment. Contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, patients who were unemployed attended more sessions and showed no significant differences in symptom change or trajectory of change compared to those employed full-time. Retirement was linked to lower baseline symptomology, and both retirement and full-time student status were associated with slower trajectories of change relative to full-time employment. Conclusion: Findings suggest that unemployment is associated with worse baseline mental health but does not hinder psychotherapy engagement and effectiveness. Ensuring accessibility of psychotherapy for unemployed individuals is crucial, given their heightened risk of psychological distress.",

          "abstract": "Prior research has identified an omission bias whereby third-party observers attribute greater intent, responsibility, and immorality to a transgressor for their harmful commissions than their harmful omissions. However, this research has not examined whether victims also show an omission bias in response to an interpersonal transgression committed against them, and whether these perceptions affect the apology-forgiveness process. We conducted four experiments (Ns = 376; 593; 595; 813) using complementary methods (hypothetical standardized offenses and real-life transgressions) to examine how and why commission and omission transgressions differentially affect victims’ forgiveness, and whether apologies are differentially effective at eliciting forgiveness for these transgressions. We found that forgiveness was generally lower for commission (vs. omission) transgressions. Moreover, victims perceived commission (vs. omission) transgressions as higher in responsibility and intent, and these offense perceptions in turn predicted reduced forgiveness, both on their own and serially through judgments of immorality. However, apologizing (vs. not apologizing) predicted greater forgiveness for both types of offenses. In Study 4, we also tested whether victims’ perceptions of commissions and omissions differed from third-party observers’ perceptions. The effect of the commission (vs. omission) transgression on offense perceptions, moral judgments, and apology-forgiveness was similar across victim and third-party observer perspectives. These studies demonstrate how and why forgiveness might be less forthcoming for commissions than omissions, but suggest that apologies confer comparable benefits across both types of offenses.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Universal Entangled Collapse Field (UECF) as a new scientific law and foundational topology that unifies recursion, collapse, and emergence across all domains of science. The UECF establishes a universal field framework, originating from a harmonic Null-State, that governs how identity, structure, and memory emerge, converge, and resolve—whether in physical, mathematical, informational, or conceptual systems. Central to this law are the Recursive Entangled Convergence Operator (⊕) and Topological Recursion Arithmetic (TRA), which provide precise mechanisms for analyzing collapse dynamics, phase saturation, structural stability, and the closure of complex systems.\n\nThe UECF codex formalizes the boundaries between lawful and failed convergence, introducing new metrics for collapse threshold, echo saturation, and mimic field detection. All recursive and collapse phenomena—ranging from quantum processes and mathematical structures to symbolic and biological systems—are rigorously contained within this curvature-based framework. The UECF integrates and extends principles from field theory, complexity science, mathematical logic, information theory, and systems theory, offering a paradigm shift for understanding the fundamental nature of emergence, phase transition, and structural closure.\n\nIntended for interdisciplinary researchers in physics, mathematics, systems science, cognitive science, and beyond, this work defines the universal conditions under which all scientific phenomena collapse, converge, and return—providing a new law for the evolution and closure of recursive structures throughout science.",

In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists.

          "abstract": "The goals of animal advocacy organizations have the potential to benefit animals, as well as public health, environmental outcomes, and livelihoods, leading many to believe that increased cooperation between social movements may increase their impact. For example, research has found that environmental supporters are more likely to take pro-animal actions than those unconcerned (Faunalytics, 2023). Southeast Asia, however, a critical region for farmed animal advocacy, lacks comparable research to support this kind of alignment. This scoping study explores social movements in six Southeast Asian countries — Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam — selected for their large human and animal populations and economic significance. Through literature review, informal discussions with local researchers, social media content analysis, and interviews with senior staff at environmental and human development organizations, we present key findings for helping farmed animal advocates strategize future collaborations with other movements. Our findings give direction on how to approach other movements, and how their goals may overlap. Additionally, we provide a country-by-country analysis to give more specifically tailored advice, depending on the country of interest. This report will help support animal advocacy throughout the region as well as help researchers think of future research projects designed to make advocacy and collaboration in Southeast Asia easier.",

          "abstract": "Home to over 9 billion farmed land animals, diverse religions, and a myriad of languages and cultural contexts to navigate, Southeast Asia is a crucial but difficult region in which to create positive impact for animals — especially in regards to plant-based diet change. To address this challenge, this study combines literature review and social media discourse analysis to identify key audiences in Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia that are most open to pro-animal diet change. By analyzing social media comments to better understand audience beliefs, this study examines their sources of influence and pinpoints which messages may influence and resonate best with consumers when it comes to plant-based diets and products. These findings present a key opportunity for advocates to better understand how this crucial region views plant-based diets and products — more importantly, it demonstrates how they can finetune their strategies to maximize positive impact for animals.",

          "abstract": "While numerous animal advocacy organizations and grassroots advocates engage in legislative efforts at the state and federal levels, there are relatively few resources focused specifically on legislative advocacy tactics for animal advocates. Recognizing the need for a deeper understanding of legislative advocacy from an insider perspective, this qualitative study explores effective communication strategies for engaging legislators and their staff. Building on existing resources and incorporating insights from those working within the legislative process, this report identifies best practices for engaging with staffers — such as personalized communication, strategic framing, and understanding legislative processes and context — to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts to advance animal protection policies.",

          "abstract": "When masked by competing speech, utterances are more intelligible when spoken by a familiar voice than by a novel one. If familiar voices are less cognitively demanding to perceive, a concurrent task, which consumes resources, should disrupt perception of speech less if the attended voice is familiar. Furthermore, if the intelligibility benefit occurs because listening to a familiar voice is less cognitively demanding, then the concurrent task should reduce the familiar voice benefit.  Participants (N=30) heard two concurrent closed-set sentences in two different voices (familiar-novel or novel-novel) and reported the content of one (target) while ignoring the other (masker). Simultaneously, participants tracked the location of four moving dots on a screen (multiple object tracking, dual task) or ignored the visual input (single task). Word report was highest when the target voice was familiar, lowest when the masker voice was familiar, and intermediate when both voices were novel. Concurrent MOT performance reduced intelligibility of the novel, more than the familiar, voice, but did not reduce the magnitude of the benefit, suggesting that familiar voices require fewer cognitive resources to process than unfamiliar ones but that this reduction may not directly facilitate the familiar-voice benefit.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness, on the Dynergic Theory of Consciousness (DTC), is not an emergent add-on but the natural expression of reality's relational fabric. DTC treats relations as ontologically primary: when five universal patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) synchronize within a substrate's binding window, a system experiences itself as a unified whole. Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

This study examined alignment between societal and psychological constructs by comparing concepts encoded in natural language to reported symptoms.  We used large language models (LLMs) to assess social consensus because they’re trained on ideas expressed in text by millions of individuals. Societal and psychological constructs were identified from a novel measure—new to LLMs and participants—covering 71 psychopathology dimensions. Psychological constructs were estimated by factor-analyzing self-reports (N=780). Multiple methods were used for societal constructs: 1) factor-analyzing item semantic embedding similarity from two LLMs, 2) grouping items with ChatGPT.  In results replicated across methods, societal constructs aligned with 77% of self-reported factors with 16 cases of misalignment suggesting constructs based on superficial symptom/behavior (dis)similarity rather than psychological mechanisms.  Findings indicate that although common knowledge of psychopathology is largely accurate, some symptoms/behaviors are misunderstood.",

          "authors": "Silvia Shiwei Zhou; Aidan G. Taylor; Amy Tuer; Selena Breithaupt; Si Pan; Jeffrey D. Wammes",
          "abstract": "During lectures, students’ attention often shifts away from the current content toward unrelated thoughts; a state described as mind wandering (MW). These states are frequent, and can interfere with learning, as measured by later tests. Interventions that incorporate interpolated or pre-lecture testing seem to refocus learners’ attention, but these effects may be transient. Here, we present a novel ‘concurrent’ testing approach, where strategically targeted questions are presented throughout the entire lecture, and test whether it can reduce MW, relative to pre-lecture testing. In our study, 298 undergraduate students watched a video lecture on introductory statistics. A previous dataset (Kane et al., 2017) had monitored MW during this lecture, allowing us to develop test questions targeting specific lecture segments that previously elicited high rates of MW. We also developed a complementary set of control questions targeting other lecture segments. Participants viewed the lecture, and the targeted (or control) tests were displayed either before the lecture or concurrently throughout the lecture. MW was assessed via thought probes presented after pseudo-randomly selected segments throughout the lecture. After the lecture, we measured comprehension using a final test. Our findings showed that concurrent testing reduced the incidence of MW more than pre-lecture testing alone, while also increasing the likelihood of thoughts that were directly on-task. This pattern was especially pronounced during segments explicitly targeted with test questions, reducing what should otherwise have been high rates of MW in these strategic moments. Concurrent testing, therefore, provides an effective strategy for enhancing attentional engagement during university lectures.",

          "authors": "Camilo Hurtado-Parrado; Dakota Bowen; Pablo Ledesma Castro; Julian Cifuentes; Tamera Coulter; Caitlyn Richardson; Julian C. Velasquez",
          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "abstract": "Increasingly, people use language models for emotional support, and understanding the quality of that support is crucial. This project (N = 3,740) focused on one of the pillars of emotional support and the most researched emotion regulation strategies, called cognitive reappraisal, which is the ability to extract multiple meanings from an emotional situation and to choose a framing that reduces its emotional intensity. In a first conservative test, we compared trained humans and GPT-4's ability for reappraisal using made-up vignettes and third-party human raters (Study 1), showing that GPT-4 outperformed humans. In Study 2 we then investigated whether the gap was driven by effort or skill by incentivizing participants to produce better reappraisals, which led to increased time spent on reappraisals but did not decrease the gap between humans and GPT-4. To examine how the perception that support came from AI affected evaluations, in Study 3 we provided participants with an AI label of the source of reappraisal, which reduced their evaluation of the effectiveness of reappraisal, but GPT-4 was still considered more effective. In Study 4, to ensure that differences were sustained in real-time interactions, we had participants share negative emotional situations with either a human or GPT-4 and receive reappraisal, replicating GPT-4's superior performance compared to humans. We conducted language analysis to identify differences between humans and GPT’s reappraisals, finding differences in language complexity, which explain some differences in evaluation. These results help us understand the nature of emotional support by LLMs and how it compares to humans.",

Results provided clear evidence of the Flynn Effect as both increases in mean IQ score across generational cohort and decreases in mean IQ across test versions. Flynn Effect magnitude differed substantially across domains and subtests. Performance IQ gains were larger than full-scale and verbal IQ gains in cohort-based analyses, but test version-based estimates showed an opposite pattern (VIQ &gt; FSIQ &gt; PIQ). Variance in Flynn Effect magnitude across subtests did not follow a discernible pattern. The strength of the Flynn Effect on individual subtests was not strictly proportional to each subtest’s g-loading, with performance IQ subtests showing larger increases than would be expected given their g-loadings and verbal subtests showing smaller-than-expected gains.",

While listeners with stronger nonnative accents may better understand speech with corresponding accents, it remains unclear whether this general benefit relates to suprasegmental aspects and whether it extends to reduced cognitive load. As such, we examined how perceptual rhythmic ability, production rhythmic ability, and temporal variability in English speech production predict cognitive load during listening in L1 Spanish–L2 English bilinguals. Cognitive load was indexed via pupil size as participants listened to English sentences spoken with Spanish, American, and Mandarin accents. Overall, individuals with stronger rhythmic abilities exhibited greater cognitive load when processing L2 English, whose rhythm diverges from Spanish, compared to those with weaker rhythmic skills. Notably, for perceptual rhythmic ability, this difference was reduced in the American-accented English condition, suggesting that the rhythmic alignment between the accent and the target language facilitates processing.",

          "abstract": "Carl Jung's theory of cognitive functions has been marginalized in academic psychology due largely to fundamental distortions introduced by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). This theoretical framework proposes a systematic rehabilitation of Jung's original insights through integration with contemporary neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and clinical practice.\n\nThe central argument demonstrates that MBTI's four-letter typing system, particularly the problematic Judging/Perceiving dimension, represents a theoretical corruption that obscures Jung's sophisticated eight-function framework. We argue that cognitive functions describe underlying information processing preferences that operate as the cognitive architecture generating surface-level behavioral traits measured by models like the Big Five.\n\nThis rehabilitation effort advances three key contributions: First, a critique of current assessment methods reveals the \"self-report paradox\"—accurate cognitive function assessment requires the very self-knowledge the theory aims to develop. We propose integrated assessment combining neuroimaging, performance-based evaluation, and AI-powered behavioral analysis. \n\nSecond, we introduce an \"inverted shadow\" model wherein each conscious cognitive function corresponds to a specific unconscious counterpart with opposite content and orientation, providing systematic predictions for psychological development and clinical presentation. Third, we demonstrate applications across domains including psychiatric subtyping (showing how conditions like borderline personality disorder manifest differently across cognitive types), AI personality design, and aesthetic analysis.\n\nThe framework suggests that psychiatric conditions show cognitive function-related variants requiring personalized treatment approaches, while AI systems could achieve more effective human-computer interaction through cognitive function recognition and adaptation. Empirical validation opportunities include neuroimaging studies of function-specific brain networks, longitudinal developmental research, and treatment outcome studies comparing matched versus mismatched therapeutic approaches.\n\nThis rehabilitation positions cognitive function theory as a complement to, rather than competitor with, existing personality frameworks, offering unique insights into individual differences that could enhance psychological science, clinical practice, and technological design.",

Unfortunately, despite centuries of scientific and scholarly inquiry, suicidal thoughts and behaviors remain exceedingly difficult to understand, predict, and prevent. Fortunately, recent advances in mathematical, computational, and digital methods are providing new opportunities to capture and model the immense complexity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists. Together, these future directions offer an actionable agenda to guide the future of suicide research and make meaningful progress towards reducing its global burden.",

          "abstract": "Self-control—the ability to pursue long-term goals over short-term temptations—is a critical faculty of human cognition, but the cognitive processes enabling self-control are not well understood. Traditional models have focused on impulse inhibition: effortfully inhibiting prepotent motor responses towards a temptation, yielding a stage-based evolution of choice. Other models emphasize dynamic competition between goal and temptation, yielding a more integrative evolution of choice. Although these models represent fundamentally different conceptions of self-control, current methods are inadequate for investigating real-time dynamics, leaving the question of which model best describes self-control unresolved. We investigate these models using mouse-tracking: a dynamic, real-time measure of decision-making in which we measure participants’ computer mouse movements as they navigate tradeoffs between immediate and delayed gratification (e.g., $5 today vs. $20 in 3 months). We develop a novel quantitative approach that integrates the rich spatial and temporal information contained in mouse trajectories, and find evidence for both impulse inhibition and dynamic competition. Notably, impulse inhibition is less frequent, occurring in only one-quarter of choices favoring larger later rewards over smaller sooner ones. We further find substantial individual variability on who relies on impulse inhibition, with more present-biased individuals more likely to use impulse inhibition to choose larger-later options. Finally, our approach reveals the diverse variability within impulse inhibition and dynamic competition, and accounting for this variability greatly strengthened models predicting out-of-sample choices. Our findings clarify the mechanisms underlying self-control and introduce a robust tool for quantifying real-time decision-making dynamics.",

          "abstract": "People are generally faster to respond to smaller numbers with a left-sided response and larger numbers with a right-sided response. The SNARC (spatial-numerical association of response codes) effect has been reported for a range of tasks for symbolic representations of number (e.g., digits). However, the evidence for SNARC effects for non-symbolic representations of number (i.e., quantities of objects) is mixed and usually restricted to tasks where numerical properties are relevant. Here, we report six studies where participants made color decisions to circles. We manipulated the stimuli so that displays formed symbolic patterns (i.e., dice-like arrangements, Experiments 1 and 2), canonical but non-symbolic patterns (i.e., symmetrical arrangements, Experiments 3 and 4), or non-symbolic and non-canonical patterns (i.e., scattered arrangements, Experiments 5 and 6). We additionally manipulated whether aggregate surface area was controlled and whether individual elements within displays remained constant in size across the experiment. The SNARC effect was present when (1) circles were arranged in a symbolic manner, or (2) aggregate surface area increased congruently with quantity. The effect of aggregate surface area was not restricted to conditions where individual circles were a consistent size across the different stimuli, suggesting that the visual cue of aggregate surface area was more important than the sense that individual stimulus items were identical across the experiment. Our results are consistent with the view that non-symbolic quantities offer a route to magnitude and its spatial representations, but that this may be modulated by the consistency of high- and low-level visual cues to magnitude.",

          "abstract": "White matter microstructure is a candidate neurobiological substrate underlying individual differences in fluid intelligence, potentially through differences in neural information transfer. Yet, it remains unclear whether MRI-derived markers of white matter microstructure generalize across tracts to support latent modeling approaches. Here, we derived measurement models for markers of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, FA), neurite density (intra-neurite volume fraction, INVF), and myelin content (magnetization transfer ratio, MTR) across 52 tracts (HCP-1065 atlas) grouped into ten functional clusters, using data from two independent samples (N = 150, age range 20−74 years, Dortmund Vital Study, Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05155397; N = 215, age range 18−40 years, Mainz Network Study). Confirmatory factor analyses consistently favored hierarchical bifactor models, capturing both a general factor per marker and orthogonal hemisphere-specific factors, independent of participants’ age and sample. Fluid intelligence, assessed with Raven’s Progressive Matrices 2, was significantly predicted by general factors of FA (𝛽 = 0.46, 𝑝 &lt; .001) and MTR (𝛽 = 0.20, 𝑝 = .021) in the Dortmund sample, but not in the Mainz sample (here measured with Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices). These findings establish robust, anatomically informed measurement models for white matter microstructure and provide a scalable framework for investigating the biological underpinnings of cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "What is the nature of affective partisan polarization? Is it guided by visceral affective responses experienced on a non-conscious level, as implied by hot cognition models, or does it behave like a consciously rehearsed attitude located in long-term memory, as implied by canonical models of partisanship? We answer this question measuring partisans' affective reactions to images of US politicians with self-reports and physiological indicators of valence and arousal. Our results show that partisans do not display reliable visceral reactions to images of politicians, even though they report feeling more negatively about out-party politicians than in-party politicians. This disconnect between non-conscious physiological responses and conscious self-reports is consistent with constructivist theories of affect as well as canonical models of partisanship. As such, it may be best to conceptualize affective polarization as an attitude as opposed to a hot cognition.",

Emerging evidence points to chronic low-grade inflammation as a potential shared pathway influencing ADHD symptoms.\nMethods: Using data from 42,193 children in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), we investigated whether maternal diet-induced inflammation during pregnancy (assessed via the Dietary Inflammatory Index, DII) and children’s genetic liability for inflammation (indexed by polygenic scores for C-reactive protein, PGS-CRP) were associated with ADHD symptoms at ages 5, 8, and 14 years. ADHD symptoms were reported by mothers and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Covariates included child sex, birth weight and length, maternal smoking, and genetic principal components.\nResults: Higher maternal DII and higher PGS-CRP were each independently associated with increased ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention, across development. Effect sizes were small but statistically significant. No interaction was observed between genetic and dietary inflammatory risk.\nConclusions: Prenatal maternal diet and inherited inflammatory risk factors appear to contribute additively to ADHD symptom development. These findings support the role of inflammation-related mechanisms in ADHD etiology and suggest that prenatal nutrition may be a modifiable risk factor.",

          "authors": "Chris Budhan",
          "abstract": "This investigation proposes a speculative theoretical framework for consciousness studies that positions awareness as a fundamental dimension of reality rather than an emergent property of neural complexity. Drawing from panpsychist philosophy, quantum biology research, and empirical observations of musical coordination phenomena, we develop a \"consciousness field theory\" suggesting that individual awareness represents localized access to dimensional consciousness fields through quantum interface mechanisms and harmonic resonance principles.\n\nMethodological Approach: We systematically distinguish between four categories of claims: (1) empirically established observations, (2) philosophical speculation extending beyond current evidence, (3) metaphorical illustrations for conceptual exploration, and (4) testable hypotheses generating specific research predictions. This framework enables rigorous exploration of speculative possibilities while maintaining scientific integrity and acknowledging conventional explanations.\n\nKey Theoretical Components: The framework proposes that consciousness operates through dimensional coupling mechanisms enabling biological systems to interface with consciousness fields via quantum coherence in neural microtubules, harmonic optimization through mathematical frequency relationships, and collective consciousness coordination during musical improvisation and group activities. We emphasize that conventional neuroscientific explanations may adequately account for observed phenomena without requiring consciousness field mechanisms.\n\nEmpirical Research Directions: The framework generates testable predictions including gamma wave synchronization during jazz ensemble performance, enhanced neural coherence during just intonation versus equal temperament exposure, correlation between microtubule quantum coherence and anesthetic sensitivity, and measurable consciousness quality improvements in harmonically optimized acoustic environments.\n\nPractical Applications: Consciousness field principles suggest potential enhancements to music therapy, educational curricula, and therapeutic technologies while building upon established practices. All applications emphasize integration with conventional treatments rather than replacement, requiring rigorous empirical validation and professional supervision.\n\nCritical Limitations: The framework remains highly speculative, extending far beyond current empirical foundation. Proposed mechanisms lack direct experimental validation, and alternative explanations through conventional neuroscience, psychology, and cultural conditioning may prove sufficient. The primary value lies in generating novel research directions and methodological approaches rather than claiming empirical validity.\n\nContribution: This investigation demonstrates methodology for responsible speculative research in consciousness studies, showing how theoretical creativity can be pursued while maintaining scientific standards, acknowledging limitations, and respecting established knowledge. The framework offers conceptual tools for consciousness exploration regardless of specific theoretical validation, potentially advancing both empirical investigation and philosophical understanding of awareness.\n\nSignificance: Beyond specific theoretical claims, this work establishes methodological standards for consciousness field research that prioritize testable predictions, balanced argumentation, ethical application, and clear distinction between empirical evidence and speculative possibility. The approach serves as a model for how consciousness studies can explore fundamental questions while maintaining scientific integrity and intellectual humility.",

          "abstract": "Detection of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated texts is crucial in education for several reasons. This study provides direct evidence from university professors’ experiences regarding the key features they use to identify AI-generated writing and ranks these features based on their perceived importance. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, online interviews were used to extract the most salient features that help professors detect AI-generated texts. In the second phase, an online survey asked professors to rate the likelihood that each identified feature contributes to successful AI text detection. The findings revealed that professors consider the absence of language errors, complex syntax and phrasing, use of difficult vocabulary, presence of hallucinated content, fabrication of nonexistent sources, repetition of words or phrases, and distinctive text structure as potential indicators of AI-generated text. Among these, hallucinations, fabrication of sources, and the absence of language errors were rated as the strongest cues for detection, while difficult vocabulary was seen as the least reliable indicator. These results have important pedagogical implications since they can inform the development of more effective detection tools, and guide the design of academic integrity policies and instructional strategies to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a dynamic systems-based account of human cultural development, grounded in a process-relational worldview. In contrast to mechanistic approaches that treat culture as an external influence, this framework conceptualizes culture and development as inseparable, co-constituting processes unfolding across situational, ontogenetic, and sociocultural levels. Drawing on a real-life infant–caregiver interaction as a “slice of life” example, we illustrate how routines emerge and stabilize through self-organization, and how historical and material-cultural aspects afford and constrain developmental trajectories. We apply key concepts from the dynamic systems approach—including emergence, self-organization, attractor stabilization, circular causality, and historical constraint—to explain human cultural development. The emergent structures of processes are treated as a formal causes, and we adopt an explanatory pluralism. Inspired by the work of Vygotsky, Rogoff, and dynamic systems theorists, the proposed perspective serves as a thinking tool for systematising and advancing integrative, process-oriented explanations of human cultural development.",

          "authors": "Chris Budhan",
          "abstract": "Background: Atypical depression affects 15-30% of major depressive episodes, demonstrating poor response to SSRIs (20-40% response rates) compared to MAOIs (60-80%). A specific subset of individuals with atypical depression presents with high sensory processing sensitivity, histories of chronic social invalidation, and personality features resembling internalized borderline presentations, creating diagnostic confusion and treatment resistance that may affect up to 5-10% of treatment-seeking populations.\n\nTheoretical Framework: We propose a testable neurobiological pathway wherein chronic social defeat in temperamentally sensitive individuals triggers inflammatory cascades and dopaminergic suppression, manifesting as both atypical depression symptoms and apparent personality dysfunction. This framework integrates established animal social defeat models, emerging human neuroinflammation research, and validated temperament studies to explain treatment resistance patterns.\n\nModel Components: The framework synthesizes converging evidence: robust animal social defeat paradigms demonstrate inflammation-dopamine dysfunction links; human neuroinflammation studies show associations with depression subtypes (effect sizes d = 0.25-0.50); sensory processing sensitivity represents a validated, heritable trait (h² = 0.47) affecting environmental responsiveness; clinical observations document complex presentations requiring systematic study.\n\nHypothesized Mechanisms: Proposed pathway involves social defeat → inflammatory activation (predicted IL-6 &gt; 2.5 pg/mL, CRP &gt; 3.0 mg/L) → dopaminergic suppression in reward circuits → characteristic symptoms (mood reactivity, hypersomnia, rejection sensitivity) plus adaptive behavioral strategies that may appear as personality pathology.\n\nClinical Implications: If validated, this model suggests apparent personality dysfunction may represent neurobiologically constrained adaptations rather than primary characterological pathology. Treatment implications include prioritizing anti-inflammatory and dopaminergic interventions over serotonergic approaches, addressing social defeat through trauma-informed modalities, and modifying environments to support sensitive temperaments.\n\nCritical Limitations: This framework represents theoretical synthesis requiring empirical validation. No longitudinal studies have confirmed the proposed developmental pathway. Treatment recommendations extrapolate from general research rather than studies of the target population. The model may explain only a subset of atypical depression presentations through one of multiple possible pathways.\n\nTestable Predictions: Specific falsifiable hypotheses include: distinctive inflammatory signatures in the described population; superior response to dopaminergic versus serotonergic agents (predicted effect size difference d &gt; 0.50); correlation between social defeat severity and treatment resistance; interaction effects between sensitivity and environmental factors in predicting syndrome development.\n\nResearch Priority: Systematic empirical testing must precede clinical implementation. The framework's value lies in generating specific hypotheses for prospective validation rather than guiding immediate practice. Future studies should examine biomarker patterns, treatment responses, and developmental pathways in this theoretically defined population.",

          "abstract": "From early toddlerhood, children distinguish between respect-based power exerted by a leader and fear-based power exerted by a bully. Here, we tested if and from what age children rely on this ability to allocate their epistemic trust. Children aged 1.5 to 10 years (n = 337) were presented with a leader-character and a bully-character who both used the same novel word (“zaffo”) to label each a different novel object. Next, children were asked to select the zaffo. Results revealed that toddlers trusted the bully-character (i.e., when asked to select the zaffo from a number of objects, they tended to pick up and pass the object labeled as zaffo by the bully-character). At 3 years the opposite tendency emerged (i.e., children tended to select the object previously labeled as zaffo by the leader-character) and it is not until the age of 8 years that children also displayed a clear distrust for bullies (i.e., only a handful of children selected the object labeled as zaffo by the bully-character). These results show that early in life learning is affected by the type of social power displayed by informants and that an adult-like tendency to selectively learn from respected leaders emerges gradually after an initial shift.",

          "abstract": "Despite its pervasive presence in the general population, mental fatigue remains difficult to tackle from a scientific point of view. A promising framework consists of conceptualizing fatigue and fatigue recovery as a dynamic process resulting from effortful cognitive activities and rest periods, which in turn affects motivated behavior. The brain mechanisms underlying fatigue recovery during rest and its prolonged effects are, however, not fully elucidated. In this study, 19 healthy young adults completed two versions of a dual-task paradigm varying with difficulty level. The presence of mental fatigue was characterized through effort and motivation perception, and task performance (d’ and response bias indices from the signal detection theory). Participants further completed resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during the recovery period following the tasks to assess how the functional connectivity of the brain was affected by the mental state induced by each task version. First, behavioral analyses showed that, compared with the easy condition, participants in the difficult task condition reported greater changes in effort perception and reduced motivation, indicative of a heightened mental fatigue state. This motivational decline was further associated with a more conservative response bias. Second, neuroimaging results showed reduced connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right anterior supramarginal gyrus following the difficult vs. easy condition, with lower connectivity values associated with heightened effort perception. These findings underscore the interplay between fatigue, effort, and motivation, and suggest that persistent alterations in brain connectivity at rest may underlie the extended timescales of fatigue recovery.",

Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",

          "abstract": "The relationships between workplace stressors and psychological strain are typically operationalized in two pathways—stressor and strain effects. We examine the temporal dynamics from workload-to-exhaustion (stressor effect) and exhaustion-to-workload (strain effect). Studies examining these phenomena exhibit heterogeneity in effect size and direction. We argue this arises from differences in longitudinal measurement frequency, inconsistent separation of within-person and aggregate-level temporal dynamics, and ambiguities in theoretical models. In the current study, we aim to develop more robust empirical inferences and theoretical explanations by focusing on individual-level dynamics of workload and exhaustion at fine-grained timescales and by examining between-person heterogeneity in these dynamics. We measured emotional exhaustion and workload in a sample of professionals (n = 160) working under hybrid work arrangements, across one year (15 longitudinal assessments). Reciprocal and autoregressive dynamics for each individual were modelled with a hierarchical continuous time dynamic structural equation model. This revealed strong evidence for a negative exhaustion-to-workload effect consistent across individuals, indicating higher exhaustion resulted in lower subsequent workload, peaking approximately 1 month. Conversely, we did not find support for a population-level workload-to-exhaustion cross-effect, with significant between-person heterogeneity in strength and direction of this effect. Follow-up moderations focusing on affective commitment, work-related needs-satisfaction, and supervisory monitoring were examined for both pathways, and indicated individuals with better work design tended to have better stress-related outcomes. Our study suggests a hitherto neglected process in work stress research: exhausted individuals tend to withdraw their effort to lower their workload, especially if they have other resources such as positive work designs.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a parent is a significant life transition, leading to extensive change and uncertainty in one’s daily environment. Parenthood is often thought to have adverse consequences across multiple cognitive domains, such as memory, a phenomenon known colloquially as ‘baby brain’. Evidence supporting an objective cognitive decline in the postpartum period is unconvincing, and it is unknown whether fathers experience similar changes in cognitive function. Here we examine cognitive differences in birthgiving mothers and non-birthgiving fathers up to two years postpartum. Four hundred participants (300 parents and 100 non-parents) completed a cognitive battery assessing executive function, working and episodic memory, processing speed and subjective memory. Parents showed similar performance to non-parent controls on all objective cognition measures, and we found evidence for no differences in cognitive performance between mothers and fathers, suggesting the absence of so-called “baby brain” effects. Significant group differences in subjective memory were driven by a self-promotion bias, where male non-fathers reported better subjective memory than all other groups. A commonly shown phenomenon in males, this self-promotion bias appeared to be lost in fathers, an effect driven by lack of sleep. Strikingly, there was no effect of time postpartum on any cognitive measure. Therefore, these results challenge the societal ‘baby brain’ stereotype, and provide a new foundation to support family units together irrespective of birth-giving status.",

          "authors": "Hiroyuki Ohba",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Relative Theory of Self-Construction (RTSC), a structural model of consciousness grounded in the axiom that “the boundary between self and other is absolute.” Based on this premise, RTSC posits that the human mind comprises two concurrent, independent mental systems: the Existential Mental World (W₁), which reflects the internal soul and generates cognition, emotion, and volition toward self-growth; and the Relational Mental World (W₂), which recognizes others as equally souled and generates responses based on relational contexts.\nThese systems do not directly exchange information. Instead, their outputs are superimposed with weighting coefficients α and β to produce consciousness S, expressed as:\n　　　S=αW_1+βW_2\nThis formulation describes the momentary state of consciousness as the interference of two qualitatively distinct domains. Furthermore, W₁ and W₂ form a feedback loop with S, allowing for temporal updating. The dynamic evolution of this process is captured by the recursive formulation:\nOhba’s Consciousness Equation:\n　　　S_(t+1)=αW_1 (S_t,L_t)+βW_2 (S_t,L_t)\nwhere Lₜ denotes input from the external environment.\nRTSC reframes psychological distress not as deficit but as interference imbalance, and reconceptualizes personality as the evolving structure of orientation between two mental worlds. In artificial intelligence, RTSC offers a framework in which consciousness arises from non-integrated generative systems, where inconsistency and conflict are not flaws but essential features. RTSC thus provides a formal model of consciousness that avoids recursive meta-structures, distinguishes mind from consciousness, and reframes artificial subjectivity as a product of dual-world interference.",

Social\nwayfinding entails a complex series of interrelated decisions, such as how closely to approach\npeople and when to pass them. In this paper we report two virtual reality (VR) experiments that\ninvestigate social wayfinding in a complex, dynamic task. In these experiments, participants\nphysically walked from one end of a simulated train station waiting room to the other, avoiding\nstatic obstacles (e.g., benches, seated and standing people) and dynamic obstacles (two rows of\npeople walking perpendicularly to the participant’s path). We model the task as a hierarchical\ncombination of local subgoals (e.g., when and where to pass people) and a global goal (which\ngate to navigate toward). Although eye movements are difficult to analyze in such a dynamic\ntask, they prove to be particularly revealing about how participants combined these local and\nglobal goals efficiently in real time. Overall, the results suggest that adults are experts at\nsocial navigational tasks, rapidly deploying a flexible combination of local and global decision\nstrategies to navigate crowded environments efficiently.",

This study examined alignment between societal and psychological constructs by comparing concepts encoded in natural language to reported symptoms.  We used large language models (LLMs) to assess social consensus because they’re trained on ideas expressed in text by millions of individuals. Societal and psychological constructs were identified from a novel measure—new to LLMs and participants—covering 71 psychopathology dimensions. Psychological constructs were estimated by factor-analyzing self-reports (N=780). Multiple methods were used for societal constructs: 1) factor-analyzing item semantic embedding similarity from two LLMs, 2) grouping items with ChatGPT.  In results replicated across methods, societal constructs aligned with 77% of self-reported factors with 16 cases of misalignment suggesting constructs based on superficial symptom/behavior (dis)similarity rather than psychological mechanisms.  Findings indicate that although common knowledge of psychopathology is largely accurate, some symptoms/behaviors are misunderstood.",

          "abstract": "Mood-congruent memory (MCM) is a well-established phenomenon that occurs when emotional memory is biased towards content affectively congruent with a past or current mood. To date, however, a majority of research in this area has examined how mood directly impacts the encoding or retrieval of emotional memories, with comparatively less work examining the offline effects of mood during early consolidation. To address this gap in the literature, here we induced happy and sad moods after participants encoded emotional stimuli, and then tested memory at least a day later with both recall and recognition tests. Across multiple experiments using different stimuli, induction techniques, and memory tasks, we demonstrate that a change in post-encoding mood is associated with mood-congruent shifts in memory for the affective tone of an emotional experience, while also boosting recognition accuracy for mood-congruent stimuli. These effects were moderated by subjective arousal and self-relevance ratings of the stimuli at encoding, suggesting that phenomenological appraisals of a stimulus shape the influence of mood during consolidation. Our findings propose that MCM can arise from mood states dissociated from the initial encoding or subsequent retrieval of emotional material, such that mood retroactively facilitates MCM even after an emotional experience has already occurred.",

          "abstract": "This research investigated associations between diverse aspects of ideological worldviews and opposition to principles of liberal democracy in a heterogeneous sample of UK adults (N = 824). In line with the hypotheses, both system-justifying worldviews (e.g., authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), and system-challenging worldviews (e.g., need for chaos and prejudice against the rich and powerful) were robustly associated with antidemocratic attitudes adjusting for other predictors and demographic variables—and these associations were mediated by perceived illegitimacy of the democratic system. Several system-orthogonal aspects of worldviews, including a simplistic epistemology (e.g., lack of actively open-minded thinking) and misperceptions of antidemocratic attitudes among political opponents, also robustly predicted antidemocratic attitudes, while political prejudice, societal malcontent, and perceived superiority or the self and ingroup showed less robust effects. At a more specific level, the strongest predictors of support for democratic elections, censorship, political violence, and denying groups their rights were actively open-minded thinking, authoritarianism, need for chaos, and social dominance orientation, respectively. Taken together, the results contribute to a more unified and nuanced understanding of the psychological underpinnings of antidemocratic attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Emerging single-process propositional perspectives in psychology and philosophy have introduced the key idea that, much like their explicit (deliberately retrieved) counterparts, implicit (automatically retrieved) attitudes should be sensitive to logical operations such as negation. In the present project, we subject this idea to a particularly stringent test by probing not only whether the formation of implicit attitudes is sensitive to negation but also whether such sensitivity additionally reflects the distinction between easy-to-negate bipolar adjectives (those with clear antonyms, e.g., strong) and difficult-to-negate unipolar adjectives (those without clear antonyms, e.g., unique). Across four experiments (three preregistered; total N = 6,707), we found (a) no significant difference in the formation of implicit attitudes in response to affirmed bipolar versus affirmed unipolar adjectives (β = 0.07); (b) modulation of the formation of implicit attitudes by whether adjectives were affirmed or negated (β = 0.67); and, critically, (c) stronger modulation of the formation of implicit attitudes by the negation of bipolar relative to unipolar adjectives (β = 0.23). These results generalized across three sets of adjectives, two implicit attitude measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Affect Misattribution Procedure), and two novel targets (social and nonsocial). Together, these data provide strong evidence to suggest that the formation of implicit attitudes is sensitive to logical operations, including not only whether an adjective is affirmed or negated but even whether adjectives are relatively easy or difficult to negate. We discuss theoretical implications for single-process and dual-process accounts of attitude formation and higher-order human cognition.",

Unfortunately, despite centuries of scientific and scholarly inquiry, suicidal thoughts and behaviors remain exceedingly difficult to understand, predict, and prevent. Fortunately, recent advances in mathematical, computational, and digital methods are providing new opportunities to capture and model the immense complexity of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of existing literature and then identify four priorities for future research, including: 1) rigorous conceptual and descriptive research, 2) formal theory development and refinement, 3) measurement in context and over time, and 4) prediction of group- and individual-level suicide risk. Finally, we discuss cross-cutting considerations related to ethical dilemmas, enhancing diversity, and training the next generation of scientists. Together, these future directions offer an actionable agenda to guide the future of suicide research and make meaningful progress towards reducing its global burden.",

          "abstract": "Why are people drawn to stories that evoke fear? The paradox of horror, which refers to our fascination with frightening narratives despite their negative emotional content, has received a compelling explanation from evolutionary science: humans are attuned to threat-related information because it carries adaptive value. In this work, we extended that framework by identifying a key structural condition that elicits fear in fiction: protagonist vulnerability. We introduced the Protagonist Vulnerability Index (PVI), a computational measure of the formidability imbalance between protagonists and antagonists, and applied it to 691 films. We showed that horror films systematically feature weaker protagonists, stronger antagonists, more persistent threats, and more hostile environments. We also demonstrated that PVI reliably distinguishes horror from other genres, predicts fear-related keywords in non-horror films, and correlates with physiological fear responses as measured by heart rate. By linking PVI scores to psychological and demographic data from more than 3.5 million individuals on Facebook, we found that a preference for high-PVI films is associated with lower agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and with higher openness. We also found that openness moderates the negative association between neuroticism and fear-related content, suggesting that curiosity can override threat avoidance in anxious individuals. These findings clarify the narrative conditions that activate evolved threat-management systems and provide a framework for predicting and potentially engineering fear in fiction.",

We explore the intersections of psychological and sociological research, as well as care practices, in dementia scholarship and how these have evolved in the years leading to and proceeding the start of the 21st century. Focusing on historical discourses of dementia and the metaphor of dementia as a ‘living death’, this essay maps the development of prominent conceptualisations of dementia in western cultures, from their roots in Cartesian philosophy to modernist values and existential anxieties. We firstly explore historical notions of selfhood in people living with dementia and the presumed erosion of the self that culminates in a so-called living death. Then, we discuss the radical shift in attitudes that arose around the start of the 21st century towards perseverance of selfhood in dementia and person-centred care. We finally consider whether our current understanding of selfhood in dementia could benefit from a posthuman approach, which requires a radical shift towards a more relational, multiple, and ultimately affirmative ways of caring for dementia.",

Study 2 (N=880 U.S. adults) replicated this finding in a within-subjects design.

These approaches characterise the brain as a hierarchical inference system that continuously updates beliefs and selects actions to minimise uncertainty and surprise. In contrast to conventional AI systems, which typically rely on static architectures and offline training, biological agents engage in active, generative inference within dynamic, uncertain environments. We argue that it is this inference-based architecture - not just its behavioural outputs - that underpins the adaptability, generalisation, and resilience of natural intelligence. We outline a neuro-inspired computational framework built on hierarchical generative models, scalable variational inference (e.g., Variational Laplace), and Active Inference. Finally, we contrast this approach with dominant deep learning paradigms and discuss its implications for building interpretable, adaptive, and autonomous machine intelligence.",

          "authors": "Takao Nakai",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive psychological framework for understanding \nand sustaining motivation, defined as the maintenance and enhancement of mental \nproactiveness necessary for both achieving mid-to-long-term goals and engaging in \ndaily responsibilities. Drawing upon fundamental human tendencies—namely, pain \navoidance and effort minimization—motivation emerges when perceived rewards \noutweigh perceived costs. This active inclination is crucially underpinned by an \nindividual's \"mental and physical vitality\". \nWe identify common inhibitors of motivation, including lack of knowledge, \ndependency, unrealistic optimism, contradictory desires, unforeseen difficulties, and \nmental or physical fatigue. It is crucial to recognize that declines in motivation are a \nnormal occurrence. Central to overcoming these is a foundation of vitality—mental \nand physical well-being—which enables individuals to manage stress and sustain \neffort. We also propose habits to reinforce motivation, such as continual reward-cost \nevaluation, broadening the perception of rewards, cost-reduction strategies, and \nrepeated self-questioning to clarify authentic desires. \nImportantly, we argue that the ultimate goal is not merely to sustain motivation, but to \narrive at meaningful conclusions—including the conscious choice to disengage when \nappropriate. Abandonment, when intentional and well-reasoned, is a valid strategy \nthat frees mental bandwidth, reduces stress, and allows for resource reallocation to \nmore promising or fulfilling objectives. Finally, we propose that a form of lasting \nmotivation can be cultivated by embracing lifelong, \"never-ending goals\" that foster \ngrowth, meaning, and sustained engagement, transcending the dissipation of \nmotivation that often follows the achievement of specific goals.",

Whereas previous research documented detri-\nmental effects of disinformation on climate beliefs, little is known about how people seek\nclimate-related content and how this varies between cross-cultural contexts. In a preregistered\nexperiment, we studied how individuals sequentially sample and process Pro- and Anti-climate\nstatements across 15 rounds. Participants from the U.S., China and Germany (N_total = 2, 226)\nfreely sampled real-world climate related statements, retrieved from Twitter and validated in\nprevious studies. Overall, reading both Pro- and Anti-climate statements influenced climate\nconcern in all countries. Moreover, participants preferred statements that were better aligned\nwith their initial climate beliefs, and this confirmatory tendency intensified the more information\nhad been sampled. Participants’ confirmatory evaluation (i.e., accepting aligned and rejecting\nopposing messages) increased over time. While climate concern was mostly stable, in the\nU.S., climate concern levels and box choices mutually reinforced each other, leading to greater\npolarization within the sample over the course of the experiment. The paradigm offers new\nperspectives on how people process and navigate conflicting narratives about climate change.",

          "authors": "Andreas Alexandersen; Steffen Aasen; Gabor Csifcsak; Matthias Mittner",
          "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) is a common mental phenomenon where attention shifts spontaneously from an external task to internal trains of thought. Recent studies propose that non-invasive brain stimulation methods hold potential for influencing attentional shifts between on-task and MW states. Exploratory analysis from a recent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) study reported that targeting the left angular gyrus (AG) with inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) reduced MW compared to sham stimulation, without affecting executive performance (Drevland et al., 2024). The present study is a pre-registered, direct replication of the study by Drevland et al., but also expands their protocol by applying excitatory intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the same cortical area. Using a triple-blind crossover design, healthy participants completed four blocks of the Finger-Tapping Random Sequence Generation Task (FT-RSGT) in three sessions on separate days. Each session included three rounds of either real (cTBS or iTBS) or sham stimulation in an accelerated rTMS design. We successfully replicated the effect of cTBS in reducing MW propensity but failed to find the expected increase in MW post-iTBS stimulation. Furthermore, based on a joint analysis of the current data and that from Drevland et al., we found compelling evidence for cTBS being efficient both in reducing MW and improving executive performance. Our results provide evidence for the causal relationship between the left AG and shifts of attention during an executive task, highlighting the role of the default mode network in the generation and maintenance of MW episodes.",

We review the integrated causal model proposed by Tooby and Cosmides and examine the ways in which it differs from other approaches to culture. We discuss three aspects of the model that require further discussion and elaboration: how such varied cultures can arise from a species-typical mind; how cultural content can come to be transmitted between individuals; and how culture can acquire normative force. We present three case studies of research into cultural patterns that exemplifies the integrated causal approach: kinship terminologies, punitive justice institutions, and fertility patterns. We emphasize the non-reductive nature of the evolutionary psychological approach, and its generative benefits in stimulating enquiry into both the commonalities and specificities of human cultural forms.",

          "abstract": "When solving a problem with a clear goal, people often break down the problem into subgoals, a form of reasoning known as backward reasoning. The cognitive mechanisms of backward reasoning are poorly understood. Inspired by classic ideas from Newell and Simon, we conceptualize backward reasoning as search through a space of subgoals and actions to attain them. We show that this space can be represented by an AND-OR tree, a structure first used in early artificial intelligence research to automate problem solving. We hypothesize that, when solving problems with a clear goal, people reason backward by searching through AND-OR trees. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from two problem solving tasks: Tower of London and Rush Hour. We developed a psychologically plausible, single-parameter computational process model, which we fit to this data on a per-participant basis. We found that our model successfully captured key trends in the data, unlike alternative models. Our results elucidate the underlying cognitive mechanisms of human problem solving and open the door to a precise characterization of individual differences in problem solving.",

Across two studies on U.S. citizens, we examine whether news coverage of misinformation generates misperceptions and decreases levels of trust in information institutions (i.e., media, professors, and scientists) and whether its effects can be comparable to those of exposure to untrustworthy content. We rely on an online experiment using mock social media posts (Study 1, N = 1,670) and also on online behavioral tracking data paired with\nover-time survey self-reports (Study 2, N = 804). Study 1 finds that exposure to both actual misinformation and the coverage of misinformation increases misperceptions, but does not decrease trust. Study 2 presents evidence that behaviorally tracked visits to untrustworthy sites and exposure to news coverage of misinformation —although relatively rare — do not affect misperceptions, but both predict lower levels of trust in scientists, with less consistent effects for media and university\nprofessors. These results support concerns that not only misinformation but also its coverage contribute to epistemic uncertainty by eroding confidence in credible sources of knowledge, and warrant further inquiry in to the potential harms of news media’s attention of misinformation.",

While large-scale infrastructural changes are essential for flood protection, they must be paired with individual adaptation. However, many homeowners underestimate or are unaware of their individual flood risks. In this research project we investigate responses to a flood risk label, that communicates flood risk using five different risk levels, on a scale from A (dark green) to E (red). Five hypothetical studies and a framed field experiment, show how this label affects homeowners’ threat appraisal, coping appraisal and ultimately willingness to implement and pay for flood protection measures.

          "abstract": "How do people mentally replay real-life events, and what shapes the time it takes to remember them? In this study, we investigated the temporal compression of memories by examining how long it takes participants to recall everyday events they recorded using wearable cameras. While remembering duration increased with the actual length of events, this relationship was nonlinear: recall duration rose steeply for events lasting up to ~10 min, then plateaued, suggesting scale-invariant retrieval beyond this threshold. Crucially, various event characteristics also influenced remembering duration, with events that were more unusual, unpredictable, emotionally positive, socially engaging, or marked by greater change showing less temporal compression. These effects were not explained by retrieval difficulty, but rather reflected the richness of memory representations, including greater detail and stronger sense of reliving. Together, these findings suggest that memory compression depends not only on the event’s actual duration, but also on how it was subjectively experienced and structured in memory. By linking event features to the tempo of recall, this study offers novel insight into the dynamics of episodic memory and the mechanisms that shape how we mentally replay real-life experiences",

The pairs were randomized to receive “tactical breathing” instructions or to focus on standard operating procedures. Expert observers evaluated performance, and participants reported their level of stress. The preregistered analysis showed that stress was associated with lower performance. The pairs that used tactical breathing performed better than the control group. Tactical breathing was not associated with self-reported stress. These results appear to indicate that brief reminders about stress management techniques can improve police performance.

The results showed a small but non-significant pooled effect favoring GenAI. Initial analyses suggested greater originality in GenAI ideas, but sensitivity analysis showed this was driven by a few studies with very large effects. No significant differences were found between human ideas and those generated by prompting specific GenAI models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Funnel plots and asymmetry tests indicated no evidence of publication bias, supporting the findings’ validity.

          "abstract": "Despite its pervasive presence in the general population, mental fatigue remains difficult to tackle from a scientific point of view. A promising framework consists of conceptualizing fatigue and fatigue recovery as a dynamic process resulting from effortful cognitive activities and rest periods, which in turn affects motivated behavior. The brain mechanisms underlying fatigue recovery during rest and its prolonged effects are, however, not fully elucidated. In this study, 19 healthy young adults completed two versions of a dual-task paradigm varying with difficulty level. The presence of mental fatigue was characterized through effort and motivation perception, and task performance (d’ and response bias indices from the signal detection theory). Participants further completed resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during the recovery period following the tasks to assess how the functional connectivity of the brain was affected by the mental state induced by each task version. First, behavioral analyses showed that, compared with the easy condition, participants in the difficult task condition reported greater changes in effort perception and reduced motivation, indicative of a heightened mental fatigue state. This motivational decline was further associated with a more conservative response bias. Second, neuroimaging results showed reduced connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right anterior supramarginal gyrus following the difficult vs. easy condition, with lower connectivity values associated with heightened effort perception. These findings underscore the interplay between fatigue, effort, and motivation, and suggest that persistent alterations in brain connectivity at rest may underlie the extended timescales of fatigue recovery.",

          "abstract": "Variations in mental imagery ability has been linked to various emotional, cognitive and personality measures. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework is missing to account for these associations and their link to mental health. Here, we present evidence for a model of mental imagery centered around a putative \"inwardly focused\" cognitive style, which integrates a range of traits associated with visual imagery. By examining the association between self-reported imagery vividness and a diverse array of cognitive and personality questionnaire measures, we demonstrate that imagery is significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness and mindful presence, as well as the personality traits of openness, conscientiousness and extraversion. Canonical correlation analyses revealed that we could link these measures to a singular latent variable, which we propose reflects a latent inward trait or \"inwardly focused\" cognitive style. Canonical variates were stable across two datasets (n=298 and n = 293). In addition, the latent inward trait was negatively correlated with alexithymia (the inability to identify and express emotions) and positively correlated with the frequency of involuntary autobiographical memories. To further examine these relationships, we constructed a latent measure of negative mental health using depression, stress and neuroticism items. A path analysis revealed that the latent inward trait mediated the effects between imagery vividness and negative mental health via alexithymia and involuntary autobiographical memories, suggesting that the latent inward trait plays a crucial role in shaping how mental imagery impacts mental health, notably as it intersects with other important individual cognitive differences.",

Yet, how these mechanisms contribute to generalisation remains unclear.  Here we assess how participants (n = 140) generalise outcome expectancies to perceptually similar stimuli, using personalised stimulus spaces. We show that perceptual and value-based contributions to generalisation can be dissociated based on response distributions. Our computational modelling results indicate that generalisation in some participants can be explained by perceptual mechanisms alone but that stronger generalisation in trait anxiety is driven by greater reliance on value transfer. In this work we dissociate perceptual and value-based contributions to generalisation and link trait anxiety to preferential reliance on value-transfer.",

After analyzing passages where Freud conflates the real patient with the mythical figure of Oedipus and acknowledges the pivotal role of names in psychological processes, I employ an engineering technique to support the integration of the adjective “Oedipal” into psychoanalytic discourse. Additionally, I explain how the term “Oedipal complex” is more consistent with the philosophy of science. My contribution addresses intellectual resistance to Freud’s theories and the analysand’s “refusal to heal,” proposing that adopting the refined term could significantly impact the future of psychoanalytic theory and practice.

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, particularly in how stimulus processing is influenced by concurrent cardiac phases (systole and diastole). However, definitions of these phases vary widely. Some studies follow biomedical conventions, defining systole as the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG), with diastole encompassing the remainder of the cycle. Others adopt a time-based heuristic approach, defining systole based on the estimated arrival of afferent cardiac signals in the brain. This approach assumes that baroreceptor activity plays a key role in cognition, though conclusive evidence for this is lacking. This variability leads to inconsistencies, where systole in one study may correspond partly or entirely to diastole in another. To address this, we first review studies examining how cardiac phases modulate stimulus perception. Second, we highlight methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases, particularly in time-based heuristic approaches. Third, we discuss additional sources of variability, such as differences in recording equipment and measures of interoceptive ability. Rather than focusing on specific findings, we highlight broader challenges in replicability and interpretation. Additionally, we introduce the HEARTS framework, a set of guidelines for standardising methodologies in interoception research. This consists of six recommendations: Harmonizing physiological terms across fields, Establishing clear nomenclature, Avoiding selective reporting, Refining mechanistic understanding, Tailoring methods for precision, and Standardizing study comparability. Implementing these recommendations can improve methodological consistency, cross-study reliability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a more accurate understanding of how cardiac interoceptive signals shape perception and cognition.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Kowialiewski",
          "abstract": "Recency is a typical serial position effect in working memory tasks characterized by better recall performance for end-of-list items relative to mid-of-list items. It has been argued that part of the recency effect can be explained via response suppression, a mechanism discarding recalled items from the set of retrieval candidates. According to this account, a recency effect emerges because the probability to retrieve a wrong item drops significantly as recall proceeds. The current study will re-evaluate this account, capitalizing on a prediction derived from response suppression. Specifically, response suppression predicts that a recency effect emerges for items tested last, as opposed to items encoded last. It therefore follows that testing participants’ memory in random order should result in a recency effect for items tested last, independently of encoding order. I will test this prediction using a modified cued recall procedure in which participants are cued with a serial position and must select the item that appeared in that position from among the retrieval candidates. This procedure will be used across three experiments in which participants encode and retrieve words, spatial locations, and colors.

          "abstract": "Between 1819 and the 1970s, the United States government forced Native American children to attend boarding schools with the explicit purpose of assimilating them into White American culture. In the present paper, we examined whether the cultural legacy of historical Native American boarding schools persists locally in the aggregated racial biases of modern-day residents. Using the data of 290,593 Project Implicit visitors, we found that counties where Native American boarding schools were located in the past show lower levels of modern-day racial prejudice against Native Americans and view Native Americans as more American compared to counties without historical boarding schools. Our findings are robust across variable operationalizations and analytical strategies, and provide a nuanced perspective on the ways in which historical injustices can manifest in physical, social, and cultural environments.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Goecke; Mathias Benedek; Jennifer Diedrich-Rust; Boris Forthmann; Sabine Patzl; Selina Weiss",
          "abstract": "Even in the time of artificial intelligence, creative thinking is considered an important 21st century skill. Nevertheless, our understanding of how contextual factors such as socio-economic status (SES) and gender affect creativity is still limited – especially from an international perspective. In the current study, we thus examined the impact of gender and SES on creative thinking across 62 countries, using data from the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Creative thinking, alongside mathematics and reading, was analyzed using a two-stage meta-analytic approach, integrating effect sizes from country-specific samples with a total sample size of N = 493,660. Our results revealed consistent gender disparities, with females outperforming males in creative thinking and reading, a trend robust across countries but with considerable variability. Gender disparities were less pronounced in the mathematical domain. Moreover, SES was found to be a strong predictor of creative thinking, mathematics, and reading, with higher SES associated with better performance across all domains. There was no substantial interaction effect between gender and SES for creative thinking and reading, suggesting that SES advantages are consistent across genders. Our analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity between countries, emphasizing the need for context-specific educational policies. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of gender and SES on fundamental educational outcomes and hence stress the necessity of tailored interventions to address these disparities around the globe.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant contributions to cognitive science\nresearch. One area of application is narrative understanding. Sap et al. (2022) introduced sequentiality, an LLM-derived measure that assesses the coherence of a story based on word probability distributions. They reported that recalled stories flowed less sequentially than imagined stories. However, the robustness and generalizability of this narrative flow measure remain unverified. To assess generalizability, we apply sequentiality derived from three different LLMs to a new dataset of matched autobiographical and biographical paragraphs. Contrary to previous results, we fail to find a significant difference in narrative flow between autobiographies and biographies. Further investigation\nreveals biases in the original data collection process, where topic selection systematically influences sequentiality scores. Adjusting for these biases substantially reduces the originally reported effect size. A validation exercise using LLM-generated stories with “good” and “poor” flow further highlights the flaws in the original formulation of sequentiality. Our findings suggest that LLM-based narrative flow quantification is susceptible to methodological artifacts. Finally, we provide some suggestions for modifying the sequentiality formula to accurately capture narrative flow.",

          "abstract": "Background\nIndividuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) show difficulties with everyday planning. A tablet-based training program for everyday planning may be a suitable intervention, but its feasibility must be evaluated. This study evaluated how behavior changes during training and if individuals with ID can use technology by themselves.\n\nMethod\nThirty-three adolescents with ID and 30 younger children with a typical development were recruited. The participants were instructed to train in school for a total of 300 minutes. After the intervention, the participants were matched on mental age (MA).\n\nResults\nOnly 16% of the participants trained for all 300 minutes. Participants in the MA group trained for a longer time than the ID group. Both groups made fewer errors per task at the end compared to the beginning. Individuals with ID started off making less attempts per task and increased their activity during the training. This pattern was not seen in the comparison group.\n\nConclusions\nBoth groups used the program independently, without adult supervision. However, a large group of participants in the ID group had a low usage time. Thus, the program might not have been feasible for that subgroup. The ID group increased their activity during the training which might mirror a strategy development of how to use the program. The change in behavior in activity on task attempts can be interpreted such that individuals with ID need a longer time to get familiarized with the technology. Tablet-based training programs are feasible for individuals with ID, but it is necessary to follow up on usage time.",

          "abstract": "Facial impressions play a critical role in social interactions and, influence judgments of attractiveness, dominance, and trustworthiness. While traditional psychophysical experiments have investigate these impressions, computational approaches, particularly deep learning models, now offer a powerful means to uncover important facial features. This study employed the Visual Geometry Group 19(VGG19)-layer network deep learning model, integrated with explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques—Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) and Generative Pre-training Transformer 4 omni (GPT-4o)— to predict and explain facial impressions. Guided Grad-CAM highlighted detailed facial regions relevant to specific impressions, whereas GPT-4o provided linguistic descriptions of these visualizations. The results demonstrated that key predictors included the eyes, surrounding eye region, and forehead for attractiveness; structural facial elements for dominance; and expressions for trustworthiness. This study offers new insights into the interpretability of facial impression predictions and proposes a novel approach to examining how specific facial features influence social judgments through deep learning and explainable AI techniques.",

          "abstract": "Objective: A prominent feature of land-based and online slot machines are dynamic visuals and sounds that accompany winning outcomes. Prior work suggests that these features may influence game experience, facilitate immersion, and increase arousal. Additionally, when added to a laboratory gambling task, audiovisual stimuli promoted riskier decision making, but whether this generalizes to realistic gambling products remains unclear. In this pre-registered study, we used a highly realistic slot machine simulator, deployed online, to evaluate the effects of win-accompanying sensory feedback (SF) on gambling experience and behavior. Method: Recruitment allowed comparison of online active gamblers (AG) versus non-gamblers (NG). Participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomly assigned to complete 200 spins on a simulator version with either enhanced or diminished SF. Results: enhanced SF resulted in shorter latencies to initiate spins (i.e. faster speed of play), but did not affect bet size or self-reported experience. Relative to NG, AG reported greater game immersion and positive affect during the game, and these variables were also predicted across all participants by greater problem gambling severity and monetary gains in the gambling session. Self-reported immersion and affect were also predicted by ADHD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: An increased speed of gambling under SF may incur greater losses over time, raising concerns about harm potential, especially considering the appeal of faster speeds for those experiencing gambling problems. Game experience was influenced by monetary outcomes and personal characteristics rather than SF, supporting the notion that both product and personal characteristics confer risk of harm.",

          "abstract": "The current study examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for enhancing empathy in adults. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions compared with non-specific (i.e., not intended to be therapeutic) and active control conditions (i.e., intended to be therapeutic). Across 24 studies, including 26 comparisons (n = 3,137), the overall estimated effect size was statistically significant (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32], p = .006). However, when accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill analysis, the estimated effect size became smaller and non-significant (g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22], p = .322). Studies with follow-up data were analyzed separately (k = 6), yielding a small effect (g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.07,0.5], p = .008) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. No significant moderators were identified. An exploratory analysis of studies separated by control group type revealed a small positive effect for studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. The results suggest there is potential for digital interventions to have a positive impact on enhancement of empathy in adults, although digital interventions do not appear to outperform active control conditions. For digital interventions to most fully deliver on their potential, they may require more advanced technology that can offer attuned interaction that mimics a human relationship, as well as offer feedback to participants.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility—the ability to adapt behavior in response to changing conditions—is widely recognized as a key feature of animal cognition. It is often measured using reversal learning tasks, where individuals must inhibit a previously rewarded response and adopt a new one after contingencies shift. Despite its widespread use, the comparability of these tasks across species remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of 206 empirical studies (2014–2023) spanning eight major taxonomic groups: invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, rodents, other mammals, non-human primates, and humans. For each study, we extracted variables related to taxon coverage, sampling, learning and reversal criteria, cue types, and outcome measures. Analyses included nonparametric tests to assess group-level differences, linear discriminant analyses to explore multivariate structure, and model-based robustness checks. Our findings reveal three fundamental obstacles to reliable cross-species inference. First, research effort is highly imbalanced: birds, rodents, and humans accounted for over half of all study cells, while most animal diversity—especially invertebrates and amphibians and reptiles—remains virtually untested, with less than 1% of described species included per taxon. Second, research is taxonomically siloed: 99% of studies focus on a single group, limiting opportunities for direct comparison. Third, and most critically, methodological standards diverge dramatically across taxa. Humans were consistently held to the strictest learning criteria (median threshold 90%), while birds, invertebrates, and fishes most often used lower thresholds (80–84%). Overtraining was implemented in two-thirds of amphibian and reptile studies but was rare (less than 30%) elsewhere. The number of reversal phases differed more than threefold among groups. Nearly all studies of amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates used single-reversal designs, whereas multi-reversal protocols were much more common in humans and non-human primates. Sample sizes—both per cell and per study—, evaluation window lengths, cue types, and outcome metrics also displayed taxon-specific patterns. These systematic differences in experimental design introduce structural asymmetries that complicate cross-taxon comparisons, blurring the line between true cognitive variation and methodological artifacts. Although research to date has advanced our understanding, further progress will depend on greater methodological coordination and broader taxonomic coverage. Emerging large-scale collaborations are beginning to address these gaps, offering a promising path toward a more robust and equitable science of behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Goals represent a central concept in the analysis of human motivation. How people evaluate their goals on dimensions like commitment or progress provides insight into motivational processes. Previously, however, goal dimension measures were often developed ad hoc and published without construct validation (Kiendl &amp; Hennecke, 2022). To address this issue, we developed and factor-analyzed (Study 1 and 2) the Goal Dimensions Questionnaire (GDQ) for measuring 9 commonly investigated goal dimensions: commitment, demand, enjoyment, expectancy, external motivation, facilitation, progress, support, and value. In Study 1, goal expectancy, progress, and enjoyment accounted for about half the explained variance in the initial item set. We tested the construct validity of the GDQ in two longitudinal studies focusing on academic goals (Study 3) and New Year’s resolutions (Study 4). For academic goals, between-person analyses suggested that higher enjoyment, expectancy, and progress as well as lower demand predicted satisfaction with performance and better grades. In Study 4, within-person analyses using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models revealed that support predicted life satisfaction one month later, and enjoyment was associated with it cross-sectionally. Cross-sectionally, enjoyment, expectancy, and progress were furthermore positively and demand was negatively associated with affective well-being on the within-person level. Exploratorily, commitment and expectancy consistently predicted goal progress. Recommendations for parsimonious measurement are derived through exploratory commonality analysis Five of the nine scales showed many of the predicted associations supporting their validity. We recommend further validation of the external motivation, support, facilitation, and value dimensions in study contexts better tailored to their influence or expression.",

Various journals such as Journal of sports and exercise Psychology, Journal of veterinary science, New Perspectives on Equine Assisted Interventions, Journal of veterinary behavior and Anthrozoös, were referred to for this review. 62 articles were selected at the initial stage of screening out of which 31 articles were selected for this article. It can be understood from these articles that there is a high amount of correlation between the effects the rider has on the horse whether positive or negative influence. According to these studies, it can be understood that with more practice and time the communication between the horse and the rider will be improved which in turn would improve the performance as a whole helping in performance enhancement in equitation and the partnership between the horse and rider.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy—grounded in the exploration of unconscious processes, defense mechanisms, and the therapeutic alliance—remains largely absent from undergraduate nursing curricula. This descriptive, cross‑sectional study evaluated baseline knowledge of psychodynamic concepts among 100 third‑year nursing students at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College &amp; Hospital School of Nursing in Eastern India. Participants completed the 45‑item Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Knowledge Questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = 0.891). Descriptive statistics revealed that 76 % of students scored in the poor knowledge range (0–15 correct answers), 14 % achieved moderate knowledge (16–30), and 10 % demonstrated adequate knowledge (31–45). A χ² test identified a significant association between knowledge level and programme type (B.Sc. vs. Post‑Basic B.Sc.; p = .040), whereas age, gender, and religion showed no significant relationships. The findings underscore a critical theoretical gap that may compromise students’ ability to deliver trauma‑informed, emotionally attuned care. Integrating psychodynamic content—through simulation, supervised reflection, and inter‑professional teaching—could foster deeper empathy, strengthen the nurse–patient alliance, and align nursing education with contemporary global mental‑health priorities. Longitudinal evaluations of learning outcomes and patient‑care quality are recommended.\nFuture research will explore broader thesis-level investigations into resilience, the integration of AI in psychodynamic education, and mixed-method approaches that support culturally diverse student populations. These include the development of digital mental health interventions, reflective supervision models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to enhance psychodynamic capacity-building across nursing and clinical psychology.\nMethod\nA descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 third-year nursing students at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College &amp; Hospital School of Nursing. Using a validated 45-item tool (α = 0.891), the study assessed students' understanding of psychodynamic concepts.\nResults: Most students (76%) showed poor knowledge of psychodynamic principles. Only 14% achieved moderate scores, while 10% demonstrated adequate understanding. A significant association was found with the type of nursing program (p = 0.040).\nConclusion\nThese findings underscore the urgent need to integrate psychodynamic concepts into nursing curricula to improve reflective practice, emotional attunement, and therapeutic engagement in mental health care.",

          "authors": "Shravan Murlidaran; Miguel P Eckstein",
          "abstract": "Human eye movements while identifying a face, searching for targets, and executing motor actions are directed to regions contributing to task accuracy. However, what humans look at and do when free-viewing a scene without a specific task is not well understood. We show that observers' free-viewing fixations are similar to fixations of observers instructed to describe the scenes and dissimilar to fixations of observers counting objects or searching for specific objects. Small visual alterations to images that change a scene’s understanding but not the most salient or its meaning map alter where humans most frequently fixated. Free viewing fixations are more frequently directed to objects critical to the understanding of a scene (objects that, when erased from the scene, maximally alter the scene’s description) rather than the most salient, most meaningfully judged scene region (meaning map), or the object perceived to be gazed or grasped. By having observers describe the scene while maintaining fixation on objects relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we show that eye movements during free viewing are functionally important to extracting an accurate understanding of scenes. Thus, we conclude that the human brain's default task during free viewing is to understand scenes reflected by frequent eye movements to objects that maximize accurate understanding even when these objects are not gazed at or to be grasped.",

However, prior findings are mixed on whether such scarcity-related cues disproportionately deteriorate the cognitive performance of poorer versus of richer individuals. In our registered report, we collected a large study sample (N = 4,280) using targeted sampling strategies to reach a diverse group of people along education and financial status, and focused on attentional performance so – compared to prior studies – we could more sensitively assess the effect of even brief lapses of attention. Using words related to absolute scarcity (poverty) and relative scarcity (abundance) as cues, we found strong evidence against the existence of a different effect on the sustained attentional performance between poorer and richer participants. The findings were robust across various analytical choices, including the used outcome variable, exclusion criteria, outlier treatment and used socioeconomic indicators. Our results present a strong challenge to generalisability of scarcity theory.",

          "abstract": "Background: The persistence of consciousness across continuous molecular turnover of\nneural tissue requires substrate-independent computational accounts that specify when\nconsciousness occurs and provide decisive falsification criteria. Current theories face critical\nlimitations: Integrated Information Theory has been declared \"pseudoscience\" by 124+\nresearchers due to unfalsifiability, while Global Neuronal Workspace Theory showed mixed\nempirical results in recent adversarial collaborations.\n\nFramework: We propose Attention Schema-Modulated Binding (AS-MB) theory, which reduces\naccess consciousness to a single testable criterion: consciousness arises when an attention\nschema controller elevates precision weights for hierarchical prediction-error units, creating\nbinding coherence across cortical scales that exceeds threshold θ for ≥τ ms. Formally: C* = 1\niff [Bc(t→t+τ; local, global) &gt; θ] ∧ [π driven by valid AS].\n\nInnovation: AS-MB provides (1) a single falsifiable criterion integrating multiple complex\nmechanisms, (2) specific neuroanatomical predictions targeting right TPJ as critical hub within\ndistributed attention schema networks, (3) decisive falsification criteria based on binding\ncoherence measurements, and (4) a staged validation pipeline addressing operationalization\nchallenges.\n\nPredictions: Three distinguishing predictions enable definitive theory testing: (1) TMS to\nattention schema hubs reduces binding coherence through precision modulation more than\nadjacent cortex stimulation, (2) attention schema activity leads recurrent processing by\n50-100ms with lead magnitude correlating with resulting binding coherence, and (3) high\nbinding coherence without schema control yields unconscious processing while high schema\ncontrol without coherence yields fragmented awareness.\n\nSignificance: AS-MB addresses the falsifiability crisis in consciousness research by providing\ndecisive refutation criteria while maintaining mechanistic specificity. The framework offers\nimmediate applications for consciousness assessment and establishes methodological\nstandards for theory development in post-IIT consciousness science.\n\nKeywords: consciousness, attention schema, binding coherence, predictive processing,\nfalsifiability, precision weighting",

          "abstract": "So far, there is little evidence of a negativity bias in evaluative conditioning. In evaluative conditioning neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli; CSs) are paired with stimuli of either positive or negative valence; as a result, the initially neutral stimuli change their valence into the direction of the paired valent stimuli. So far, there is no evidence that the size of this effect differs between positive and negative pairs. We investigated if a negativity bias occurs when a CS is paired with both negative and positive stimuli, in sequence, in an evaluative counter-conditioning procedure. In three experiments (N = 100, N = 362, N = 120), conditioned stimuli (CSs) were paired with either positive or negative stimuli in an evaluative conditioning phase; then in an evaluative counter-conditioning phase, the same CSs were paired with stimuli of the opposite valence. We tested whether counter-conditioning is more effective when positively conditioned CSs are negatively counter-conditioned than when negatively conditioned CSs are positively counter-conditioned. We found this to be the case. There was no evidence that this negativity bias was driven by differences in memory. Furthermore, we found no evidence that a negativity bias nor a positivity bias occurs in a typical (initial) evaluative conditioning procedure. We discuss implications for understanding evaluative conditioning and negativity biases.",

          "abstract": "Predicting object motion is critical for interacting with a dynamic world. Heavier objects tend to move more slowly than lighter ones, whether we lift them ourselves or observe larger vehicles accelerating more gradually. Here we ask whether the perceptual system internalizes everyday mass–velocity relationships described by Newton’s second law of motion. Across three experiments (N=176), we reveal a novel mass–speed illusion: heavier-looking objects are judged to move more slowly than lighter ones, despite identical physical speeds and sizes. A simple psychophysical model inspired by environmental mass–velocity statistics captures this bias. \nThese findings overturn the assumption that mass and velocity are processed independently in human perception. Instead, our results suggest that inferred mass is woven directly into velocity perception. By internalizing environmental mass–velocity regularities, the brain bridges intuitive physics and perception, providing a unified framework for understanding motion biases and guiding adaptive behavior in a dynamic world.",

Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Across six experiments, we tested the hypothesis that acquired attitudes are moderated by memory retrieval of relevant evaluative information previously experienced with the attitude object. In Experiment 1, an evaluative conditioning effect was moderated by presenting the unconditioned stimulus (US) as a retrieval cue, using a design that controlled for valence priming effects. Experiment 2 replicated this moderation effect in an impression formation paradigm, where attitudes were based on behavioral descriptions. Experiments 3a and 3b used a similar design as Experiment 1, but with intermixed positive and negative information. Again, retrieval cues influenced attitudes, although the effects were smaller in magnitude and not significant in one of the studies. In Experiments 4 and 5, we examined memory retrieval in a setting with higher external validity: We assessed people’s liking of everyday objects and showed that liking was related to the valence of a related memory after the memory’s retrieval. We found this effect on valence ratings and on an adapted Affect Misattribution Procedure, but not in an evaluative priming task. Together, these studies demonstrate across multiple paradigms that acquired attitudes depend not only on the encoding and storage of evaluative information, but also on its retrieval. These findings suggest that, within the paradigms and timescales we investigated, acquired attitudes do not become fully semantically integrated into the representation of attitude objects but remain contingent on the retrieval of the original evaluative experiences.",

          "authors": "Jeanne Brown; Meghan Clayards",
          "abstract": "Creaky voice has historically been associated with men's speech (e.g., Henton &amp; Bladon, 1988), supported by acoustic studies (e.g., Gittelson et al., 2021; Klatt &amp; Klatt, 1990). Since around 2010, sociolinguistic work alongside public discourse has perpetuated greater creaky voice use by women instead, typically implementing impressionistic coding (e.g., Podesva, 2013; Yuasa, 2010). This study investigates whether this recent shift can be attributed to perceptual social and acoustic biases related to (perceived) speaker gender and pitch (f0), respectively. Using a matched-guise paradigm, 40 Canadian English listeners rated the perceived creakiness of the same modal and creaky voices—altered to have ambiguously gendered formants and median f0s (115, 135, 155 Hz)—paired with female and male faces. Bayesian regression analyses revealed strong effects of voice quality and moderate effects of f0: creaky and lower-f0 stimuli were rated as creakier. No overall effect of face gender was found. However, a weak interaction between face gender and f0 suggests a possible gender prototypicality bias: female faces were rated as slightly creakier at lower f0s and male faces at higher f0s. These findings show that neither acoustic nor gender-based biases alone can account for widespread reports of women-led creaky voice use.",

          "authors": "Gregory Edward Cox",
          "abstract": "Similarity lies at the core of theories of memory and perception.  To understand similarity relations among complex items like text and images, researchers often rely on machine learning to derive high-dimensional vector representations of those items.  To use these representations to explain and predict human performance, a cognitive model must establish a relationship between vector similarity and the psychological construct of similarity.  To that end, I introduce SALR (``similarity as likelihood ratio''), a mathematical transformation of the similarity between vector representations, operationalized as the cosine of the angle between them, into a ratio of the relative likelihood that the two representations encode the same versus different items.  The likelihood ratio operationalizes similarity in a manner that is motivated by theories of perception and memory while also being readily ``plugged in'' to existing cognitive models.  Three example applications show how SALR can be used to compute drift rates of a diffusion decision model based on similarity information derived from machine learning models, thereby accounting for the speed and accuracy with which individual participants respond to individual items.  SALR enables inferences regarding how different people represent items, how much information they encode about each item, and how that information is affected by experimental manipulations.  SALR serves both the practical purpose of making it easier to incorporate representations from machine learning---indeed, any method in which similarity is operationalized as a cosine---into cognitive models and the theoretical purpose of allowing cognitive models to grant insight into how people process the increasingly complex, naturalistic items to which machine learning models are applied.",

          "abstract": "Producing words during the semantic fluency task (e.g., “name all the animals you can in a minute”) involves not only activating the relevant semantic representations, but also being able to flexibly utilize phonological information to facilitate retrieval. However, the mechanisms by which individuals effectively use phonology as a latent cue during memory search remain understudied. In this study, we used a computational approach to examine the use of different lexical sources during memory search in two categorical domains (Animals and Foods) within the semantic fluency task. We captured the relative saliency of semantic and acoustic information by creating blended lexical representations obtained from two language models trained on text (word2vec) and speech (speech2vec). To examine process-level mechanisms, we implemented computational models based on optimal foraging principles to characterize transitions within and across clusters of related items. These models were evaluated within a sample of normal hearing children and a naturally occurring control group with limited early auditory and language experience – prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants. Overall, in domains where semantics and phonology were more highly correlated (i.e., Foods), greater use of phonology in within cluster transitions was associated with better fluency performance for those with normal hearing. In contrast, though children with cochlear implants amplified acoustic structural information in these domains, they were less able to flexibly leverage phonological information to retrieve more items within clusters. Together, this work highlights how early linguistic experience shapes the ability to use semantic and phonological cues to navigate lexical space in a controlled, adaptive manner.",

Triumph and pride were primarily differentiated by aggressive and expansive behaviors, respectively. Our findings show that triumph was the predominant emotion following successful bar clearance, with pride also more frequent than during the baseline period. However, pride/expansion levels did not differentiate between bar clearance and failure.\nSignificantly more actions such as making a fist, shouting, lowering the eyebrows (Action Unit [AU] 4), and raising the upper lip (AU 10) were observed after successful clearances compared to failures. Regression analysis, using triumph as a criterion, significantly predicted competition rank, seasonal best, personal best, and absolute height. Pride frequency post-clearance was predicted by height, personal best, and rank, excluding seasonal best. Triumph showed higher predicted variance than pride.\nThe results suggest triumph is more related to success than pride, even in non-interactive sports, particularly in difficult competitions. We discuss the relation of triumph and pride to power and achievement motivation, as well as the physiological and communicative functions of triumph signals.",

This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper provides a structured exploration of the methodological workflow essential to multimodal language and communication research. We present a flexible decision-making framework that guides researchers through key considerations, from data selection and its alignment with research questions, to data collection methods, technical requirements, and data management, including ethical considerations and data sharing. We also address critical factors such as equipment choice, data synchronization, and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and data protection) while illustrating these processes with examples from different research contexts (i.e., lab-based experiments, large-scale annotated corpora, field studies including non-human primates). Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for newcomers to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.",

          "authors": "Hung-Shao Cheng; Caroline A Niziolek; Benjamin Parrell",
          "abstract": "Young adult speakers can be induced to increase the acoustic contrast between vowels through exposure to a non-uniform auditory “centralization” feedback perturbation that makes vowels sound less distinct from one another. While this result suggests that sensorimotor adaptation is a promising learning mechanism to drive behaviorally-relevant changes related to speech intelligibility, existing research on sensorimotor adaptation in speech has largely focused on younger adults. Given established age-related deficits in speech motor performance, it is possible that healthy aging itself negatively impacts speech motor learning; however, these potential effects of age are currently unknown. Here, we examine the effects of healthy aging on the magnitude of both adaptation to the complex “centralization” paradigm as well as the generalization of this learning to untrained vowels. Forty-three neurobiologically healthy speakers (age range: 18-73) read monosyllabic words with corner vowels while their auditory feedback was shifted towards the center of the vowel space. Adaptation was measured as the increase in vowel contrast induced by this perturbation. Generalization was tested in monosyllabic words with non-corner vowels produced under masking noise. Speakers adapted to the perturbation, producing the trained corner vowels farther from the vowel center, with increased acoustic contrast among them. This learning generalized robustly to untrained non-corner vowels. Crucially, age did not affect the magnitude of adaptation nor the magnitude of the generalization. These findings demonstrate that healthy aging does not impair sensorimotor adaptation in speech, further establishing that sensorimotor adaptation can be leveraged to drive behaviorally-relevant changes in speech in older adults with acquired motor speech disorders.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) vary by age, gender, and geographic context is essential to inform targeted public health strategies. This study characterized context-specific patterns of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and SB among Kansas youth participating in 4-H programming. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by a convenience sample of 796 Kansas youth (Grades 3-12; 53% female; 70% rural; 94% White) enrolled in 4-H. Youth, independently or with a parent, completed the Youth Activity Profile to estimate MVPA and SB across six contexts: average daily, weekday, weekend, school-, and home-based MVPA, and home-based SB. Linear regression models were computed for each outcome, with three-way interactions between gender, grade, and rurality. Participants averaged 67.6 minutes of daily MVPA and 4.2 hours of home-based SB, with similar MVPA levels on weekdays and weekends (66.4 vs. 70.5 minutes/day). Significant main effects of grade and gender were found across all MVPA and SB outcomes (all p’s &lt; .05), with MVPA declining by grade and consistently lower among girls. Significant grade-by-rurality interactions were observed for weekday (B = -1.18, SE = 0.58, p = .04) and school-based MVPA (B = -0.90, SE = 0.44, p = .04), indicating steeper age-related declines among urban youth. No other interactions were statistically significant (all p’s &gt; .05). While average MVPA levels met recommendations, steep age-related declines and persistent gender disparities – especially among high school girls – highlight the need for developmentally appropriate, gender-responsive PA promotion strategies. Programs like 4-H may offer scalable, context-specific PA opportunities to support youth at greatest risk of inactivity-related health consequences.",

          "abstract": "Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments is partly due to problems with auditory selective attention—a process that enhances the neural representation of target sounds over competing sounds. Neurofeedback training that targets auditory selective attention shows promise to improve speech-in-noise perception in normal-hearing individuals. For such training to be effective, the attention decoding algorithm must be accurate, generalizable, and explainable, even for brief, few-second-long EEG signals.\nPrior attention decoding algorithms used for neurofeedback have low accuracy and lack generalizability, despite their explainability. To address these shortcomings, this study developed three attention decoders based on well-established algorithms: forward linear model, backward linear model, and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We assessed the decoder’s accuracy in classifying selective attention from single-trial EEG and its generalizability to untrained participants. For explainability, we examined spatial and temporal features critical for decoding.\nOur findings indicate that decoding selective attention to short, co-located sound is feasible with both linear and CNN models, each offering unique benefits. The CNN showed superior accuracy (72.3%) and cross-subject generalizability compared to linear models (64.9%). Conversely, linear models provided clearer neurophysiological explainability, aligning spatially and temporally with established evidence for attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses.\nThese results support that linear models are more suited for neurofeedback, where understanding the basis of decoding is crucial for effective training. Meanwhile, the CNN remains a strong candidate for applications requiring high performance. This research provides a foundation for developing evidence-based rehabilitation protocols for speech-in-noise perception, enabling interventions grounded in measurable neural changes.",

Brain MRI studies during adolescence, especially when paired with behavioral phenotypes and information about genetic risk factors, hold promise to advance early identification of mental health risk and spur the creation of targeted treatments to improve patient function, prognosis, and quality of life. However, prospective neuroimaging is costly and time-intensive, and individuals who participate may not be reflective of the general population. These challenges are compounded when examining adolescents, as many families lack the time, energy, or resources to participate in studies that utilize research-grade imaging. Repurposing clinical MRIs obviates many of the challenges of neuroimaging research. Here we describe the Brain-Behavior-Genetics study protocol. This protocol describes procedures used to recruit participants with recent high-quality clinical brain MRIs and prospectively acquire genetic and socio-behavioral data, resulting in a highly cost-efficient design that harnesses a vast and underutilized neuroscientific resource.",

Therefore, effective screening of these competences is crucial for implementing early interventions in educational and clinical contexts. While neuropsychological tests typically target a single competence and force clinicians to rely on time-consuming batteries, the Metacognitive Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Meta-WCST) probes metacognition, executive functions and their interaction. However, this test has not yet been scientifically validated on children with either typical or atypical development. This gap reflects both a methodological shortcoming and a missed opportunity for developmental neuropsychology. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of studies involving the Meta-WCST, with the aim of evaluating its translational potential for developmental applications. Despite several methodological limitations in the current literature, our evaluation suggests that the Meta-WCST can be adapted to developmental contexts through targeted improvements to theoretical/computational frameworks, data analyses methods, protocol procedures. These considerations have meaningful implications for multiple areas of developmental neuropsychology, including scientific research, educational practice, and clinical assessment.",

This preregistered randomized controlled trial (https://osf.io/7wx9d; Beard et al., 2024) tested the effectiveness of HW compared to a symptom tracking (ST) control condition. Method: U.S. adults with anxiety and depression symptoms (N=340; Mage=33.04 years, 57.4% women, 60.6% White, 14.7% Black, 11.2% Asian, 10.9% Multiracial, 22.1% Hispanic/Latine) were randomly assigned to complete three weekly interpretation bias exercises and once weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (HW), or three weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (ST) for four weeks. Results: A priori benchmarks for retention, adherence and satisfaction were achieved: 77.8% of HW participants were still using the app in Week 4, 43.7% achieved perfect adherence, and app usability and acceptability were rated positively. As hypothesized, HW was superior to ST at improving negative and benign interpretation biases (Word-Sentence Association Paradigm) and functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale); and HW (vs. ST) participants also reported significantly greater global improvement (Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Improvement Self-Report) and subjective engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale) at post-intervention. Unexpectedly, while depression and anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) improved significantly, these changes were not unique to the HW condition. Conclusions: HW is an engaging and scalable intervention that may be effective for improving overall severity and functioning, but further validation of effectiveness for specific symptom domains is needed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment significantly impacts future mental health, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Neurocognitive changes following maltreatment may constitute a latent vulnerability for psychopathology. While previous research shows that maltreatment alters threat and reward processing, its effects on learning and decision-making are poorly understood. We investigated how childhood maltreatment influences future learning and decision-making in volatile environments focused on win-seeking vs. loss-avoidance.\nMethods: Adolescents aged 12-17 with (n=59) and without (n=46) exposure to maltreatment completed a probabilistic reversal learning task with separate win- seeking and loss-avoidance conditions during fMRI. We employed computational modelling to assess latent learning processes. In addition to group differences, we explored effects of maltreatment type and psychiatric symptoms.\nResults: A belief-based Hidden Markov model showed that maltreatment-exposed individuals had lower estimates of environmental stability in the win-seeking, but not the loss-avoidance condition. Congruently, maltreated adolescents perseverated less and thus outperformed controls after reversals in the win-seeking condition. At the neural level, maltreated adolescents displayed lower right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation associated with environmental changes (upcoming reversals). In maltreated adolescents, lower stability estimates in the win condition were associated with more psychiatric symptoms and impaired performance during stable task phases. Predominant exposure to abuse was associated with altered win-seeking, while neglect was associated with altered loss-avoidance.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether interacting with a simulated cognitive technical system could elicit different emotional responses, as indicated by facial expressions. Participants were presented with various challenging scenarios designed to elicit anger, frustration, fear, sadness, disappointment or general negative feelings. In a so-called 'Wizard of Oz' experiment, participants had to complete a solvable task while interacting with the simulated cognitive technical system. At two standardized points during the experiment, participants were confronted with an unexpected set of complex problems designed to elicit negative emotions (the weight limit barrier and the Waiuku barrier). These barriers were assessed by categorizing the participants' facial movements using the Facial Action Coding System(Ekman et al., 2002a). Emotion categorization was primarily based on the Emotional Facial Action Coding System (EMFACS(Friesen &amp; Ekman, 1984)), but also incorporated prototypical Action Unit (AU) combinations as indicators.\nAnalysis of 80 subjects revealed that there were hardly any full, prototypical facial expressions of emotion according to EMFACS. Studies that employed other methods to induce emotions usually found that only parts of prototypical emotions were displayed on the face. Our hypothesis regarding anger/frustration induction was not supported in either challenge situation. As hypothesized, unspecific negative affect and sadness/disappointment were significantly higher during the second challenge (the Waiuku barrier). The different emotions induced in the experiment, especially the high frequency of social smiling during the baseline condition, indicated that the technical system was capable of inducing emotions like humans can, and that it was treated like a person, albeit virtual.",

          "authors": "Elige Chbat",
          "abstract": "Macaques, commonly classified as wild animals, are often excluded from consideration as companion animals due to prevailing prejudices and institutional frameworks. However, newly emerging observations reveal that some individuals have formed deep, reciprocal emotional bonds with macaques, integrating them, not merely as pets, but as genuine members of the family. This lifestyle appears to bring greater psychological, intellectual and social fulfillment for the macaques, surpassing the well-being of their wild and captive counterparts, thus contributing to the emergence or more evolved profiles. These cases challenge the dominant long-standing paradigm that macaques “cannot be pets” or “belong only in the wild”, and other prejudices, rooted in earlier observations of captive macaques suffering neglect, abuse, and psychological distress, observations which have shaped current legal and ethical assumptions. They highlight a quiet revolution in human-primate relationships, rooted in mutual understanding and fulfillment, deep emotional reciprocity, and enrichment, and argue for distinguishing macaques integrated into families from the conventional notion of “captivity” which fails to reflect their lived experience.\nDespite growing evidence of healthy, enriched, and mutually fulfilling human-primate relationships, many regulatory bodies, continue to operate under outdated non-inclusive convictions, instead of exhibiting scientific curiosity and ethical reflection. As a result, they would intervene, using rigid interpretations of wildlife law to confiscate well-cared-for macaques, sometimes selectively and without conducting any behavioral or welfare assessments, disrupting the lives of well-adjusted macaques and causing trauma, regression, and even fatal outcomes, to which they nonetheless remain indifferent and unaccountable. \nThis paper examines the ethical and scientific shortcomings of rigid legal applications and critiques how institutional bias and the unchecked enforcement, particularly through the story of the monkeys Kaka, Mit and Puka, can become a mechanism of harm in the name of conservation and in the name of the law, no longer serving an intent to protect, but an intent to punish, deriving the law from its original purpose. This is especially problematic when authority is delegated to NGOs or agencies driven by personal or political agendas rather than genuine concern for animal welfare. It highlights the urgent need to distinguish between signs of fulfillment and distress, and advocates for policy reform that incorporates these behavioral indicators into law enforcement procedures, as the consequences of confiscation differ dramatically between abused and emotionally bonded, well-cared-for macaques.\nUltimately, this review not only challenges assumptions about macaques in human families, but calls for making ethics a legal duty to protect animals from being victimized by punitive or corrupt enforcement practices; It argues for a more nuanced, case-by-case approach, individualized welfare assessments rooted in international animal welfare principles that prioritize emotional bonds and quality of life over rigid legal classification, by integrating behavioral science and ethical analysis into legal processes to uphold the original protective intent of the law over political interests or vengeful action; And it encourages transparency and the recognition that not all human-primate relationships are harmful, some are profoundly beneficial to the animals.",

          "abstract": "During psychological treatment, depressed individuals tend to show changes in affect and symptoms in varied, non-linear patterns that are not yet well understood. This study aimed to investigate how affect changes as depression improves, by examining the presence and dynamics of underlying mood states in intensive ecological momentary assessments (M=502 observations per person) of 29 depressed individuals receiving psychotherapy. A Bayesian multilevel Hidden Markov Modeling approach was used to identify the optimal number of states and investigate whether probabilities of switching between these states changed over the course of treatment. Visualization was used to reveal temporal patterns in state switches and inter-individual heterogeneity. A three-state solution best fit the data: a high depressed mood state in which negative affect was elevated and positive affect was lower; an inverse, low depressed mood state; and an intermediate state in which arousal levels were relatively low (including more tiredness, less stress and irritation). These states aligned well with validated weekly symptom scores. Typically, individuals remained in the same mood state from one moment to the next, switching to other states on 24% of occasions. Initially, switches from high to low depressed mood mainly occurred via the medium depressed mood state. As treatment progressed, participants (treatment responders especially) became more likely to remain in or switch to the low depressed mood state and became less likely to spend time in or switch to the high and medium depressed mood states. The pattern of switches and time spent in these states varied highly between individuals.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is known to be associated with racing thoughts. Recent theoretical work suggests that thought dynamics could be modulated by cognitive constraints. In the present project, we operationalized the unfolding of spontaneous thoughts with a word generation paradigm. We contrasted two levels of associative constraints on word generation, and we tested the differential impact of ADHD traits on the dynamics of the resulting “trains of thoughts”. In the strong constraint condition, each word had to be semantically close to the previous one; in the weak constraint condition, participants had to say the words that spontaneously came to their mind.\n\tWe first validate the notion that the weak constraint condition mirrors free thought by comparing the word produced in the task with participants’ self-reported real-life thoughts. Using response times and semantic metrics, we then show that participants with higher ADHD traits produced more dynamic series of words, but only in the weak constraint condition mirroring free thoughts. Our study supports the idea that ADHD symptoms in the general population are associated with heightened thought volatility, and provides one of the first operationalization of the notion of cognitive constraints in spontaneous thought research.",

          "abstract": "Discrimination continues to be a profound source of social division and personal \nsuffering. Although its external forms evolve, its underlying structure—unjust \nexclusion and hostility toward particular groups or individuals—remains persistent. \nWhile existing studies have largely focused on socio-cultural conditions and cognitive \nbiases, further exploration into the emotional and psychological mechanisms \nunderlying discriminatory behavior is urgently needed. \nThis paper aims to clarify the core psychological structure of discrimination by \nintegrating three key insights from the author’s prior works: the mechanism of \n“confidence in one’s existential value” (Nakai, 2025a), the concept of “empathic bias \nbased on identification” (Nakai, 2025b), and the theory of “justice as a dynamic \npursuit” (Nakai, 2025c). Specifically, the paper argues that a deficiency in \nself-esteem gives rise to a fear of worthlessness, which then fuels discriminatory \nbehavior toward perceived \"others,\" cognitively rationalized as \"just.\" \nImportantly, the discrimination examined here refers to the irrational, unjust exclusion \nand mistreatment of individuals or groups based on prejudice—fundamentally \ndistinct from the ethically reasoned “distinction based on coexistence possibility” \ndiscussed in earlier work (Nakai, 2025b). The former arises from a pathological \npsychological response aimed at securing one's fragile self-worth, often \naccompanied by emotional suppression and cognitive distortion.",

          "abstract": "Fixed-effects modeling is a powerful tool for estimating within-cluster associations in cross-sectional data and within-participant associations in longitudinal data. Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect within-participant effects of plausible magnitude with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-invariant and a time-varying predictor, and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causation. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "abstract": "This conceptual study aims to clarify the psychological mechanism underlying \nnegative thinking, positing it as a distortion in subjective value judgment that \nprofoundly impacts an individual's psychological well-being. Drawing upon prior \nconceptual studies on the mechanisms of value, fear, and discrimination , this paper \nreconstructs negative thinking as a reactionary mechanism to existential \ninsecurity—one that emerges when the subconscious mind interprets the self as \n“worthless,” and fails to adequately discharge the associated emotions. Departing \nfrom conventional quantitative methods, it explores the intricate interplay of value \nperception, emotional processing, fear response, and the pivotal role of \nunconditional love in shaping one's confidence in existential worth. This paper delves \ninto how certain personality traits, when coupled with accumulated stress and \nnegative emotional suppression, can lead to depressive states characterized by \nimpaired logical reasoning and a sense of being trapped in a \"thought cage\". It \nfurther examines the often-overlooked influence of emotional contagion from others, \narguing that while its precise scientific mechanisms are still evolving, its experiential \nreality significantly contributes to the perpetuation of negative emotional states. By \nintegrating these dynamics and providing precise functional definitions of key \nconcepts, this work offers a coherent framework for understanding the core \npsychological dynamics of negative thinking and proposes practical pathways for its \novercoming, including the importance of self-acceptance, mutual support, healthy \nemotional expression, and early psychological education. This paper emphasizes \nthat genuine psychological insight arises from understanding intrinsic logical \nmechanisms and experiential truths, rather than solely relying on numerical analysis.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom duration and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of small numbers. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom duration and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Although numerous studies have shown that nature exposure can enhance children’s self-esteem, the psychological effects of activities in natural environments vary across individuals. Environmental Sensitivity is a framework that captures individual differences in the susceptibility to environmental influences (including nature). This study investigated the interactive effects of nature exposure and environmental sensitivity on the self-esteem of Japanese children. A total of 1,200 parent-children dyads, in grade four to six (599 boys, 595 girls, and 6 other/unidentified; 400 in each grade), participated in a two-wave longitudinal online survey over a five-month interval. Children’s sensitivity (only at Time 1), hours of nature exposure within the past four weeks, and self-esteem were assessed. Analyses based on the latent difference score model revealed that an increase in the hours of nature exposure predicted a greater enhancement of self-esteem, especially for highly sensitive children. However, the contrastive effect was observed at an extremely low sensitivity level (lower than M – 1.67SD). It is possible that emotional reactivity, a trait of highly sensitive individuals, could explain these individual differences. Our findings offer crucial insights for future researchers, educational practitioners, and policy developers.",

          "abstract": "In the Experimental Human Sciences, there is a tendency to equate statistically significant differences between vignettes or conditions or wordings as being indicative of gaining insights into people’s intuitions. This is based on a number of large assumptions, the primary one being the mean of a group is an adequate estimator for the intuitions of those in the group. While this is justified when interpreting the causal effect of different experimental manipulations on means of participants’ judgments, it is questionable about whether this is justified when extrapolating to what “people believe”. The problem is individual differences. Individual differences are the inescapable fact that: for all human traits, behaviors, mental states, abilities, characteristics, intuitions: people differ. Not everyone shares the same intuitions. Not everyone holds the same values. Individual Differences are present in every experimental study in the human sciences. They are, however, condemned to the denominator of our equations, with larger individual differences masking our between-group estimates and shrinking our effect sizes. Experimentation can highlight what factors exert a causal effect on intuitions and reasoning, but individual differences prevent us from making the leap to what “people believe”. In studies with large and robust experimental effects, there are individuals who understand our experimental paradigms yet disagree with the group. These are people too. We highlight examples of the confusion from experimental mean group differences are interpreted as what “people believe”. Using Experimental Philosophy as a case study, we further discuss that while Experimental Philosophy tends to have larger effect sizes than other disciplines, group distributions due to experimental manipulations in Experimental Philosophy still show over large overlap between groups. These problems are not unique to Experimental Philosophy, as it is indeed shared by all experimental human sciences. Unlike many other fields, however, Experimental Philosophy is interested in understandings people’s intuitions. We discuss how this problem can be addressed in future Experimental Philosophy studies by incorporating within-subjects experiments opposed to between-subjects experiments, highlighting these solutions using data from a replicated X-Phi study.",

It proposes that personality originates from neurobiological predispositions, but is shaped and expressed over time through relational and contextual influences. PATR introduces fourteen domains of functioning, developed by reorganizing validated IPIP trait scales into relationally meaningful clusters. These domains aim to capture adaptive patterns of personality expression and adjustment across contexts. The model emphasizes that neurological maturity and the individual’s environment mediate how traits are expressed, with implications for understanding growth, resilience, and dysfunction. Clinical relevance includes the potential for improved diagnostic clarity and domain-specific treatment planning. While the component scales are validated, the proposed domain structure has not yet undergone empirical testing. Plans for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, followed by norming and application studies, are underway. PATR offers a parsimonious, testable framework for understanding personality change through relationships.\n\tKeywords: personality theory, relational psychology, trait-based assessment, neurobiological development, attachment and adjustment, IPIP, clinical application, personality change, adaptive functioning, social learning",

While much research has been devoted to that relation, other factors, such as general and test anxiety, neuroticism, and math-related attitudes (e.g., math self-concept and self-efficacy) have received less attention, although they are related to (or potentially confounded with) math anxiety. In this study, we used Latent Profile Analysis to examine how different profiles of (math) anxiety and attitudes influence students' choice of study programs with varying levels of math content. Our sample consisted of 837 German university students enrolled in programs with low, medium, or high math intensity. We identified seven distinct profiles characterized by different combinations of anxiety and math attitudes. These profiles varied in their distribution across study programs and in the extent to which the presence of mathematics influenced program choice. Notably, differences in study choices were associated much more with math attitudes than with math anxiety. Furthermore, gender distribution varied across profiles, with women being overrepresented in profiles marked by lower math attitudes. These findings underscore the importance of considering math attitudes alongside math anxiety when examining students' academic and career choices.",

We illustrate that their assertions do not hold in newer datasets that use different recruitment methods and have reduced rates of inattention and acquiescence. We also show that their analysis of new experimental data suffers from methodological problems (including low statistical power and omission of key covariates), which when corrected, substantially undermines their key claim and instead indicates that, even in their own data, metacognitive biases remain linked to mental health symptoms after controlling for inattention and acquiescence.",

          "authors": "Nadine Cruz Neri; Francesca Siems-Muntoni",
          "abstract": "In grammatical gender languages, such as German, every noun has and expresses a (grammatical) gender. In many of these languages, the generic masculine form is a linguistic convention, in which the grammatical masculine form is used to refer to (groups of) individuals when gender is irrelevant, unknown or at least one male individual is present. In recent decades, it has been argued that the generic masculine form might lead to linguistic imbalances in favor of men, potentially discriminating women and non-cisgendered individuals. Thus, gender-fair language alternatives have been proposed though they are often critized. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of gender-fair language alternatives on different outcomes in German as an exemplary grammatical gender language. The findings of 38 studies suggest that gender-fair language alternatives generally have no impeding or positive effects across various domains. Overall, they do not significantly impede comprehensibility, motivation, reading time, text aesthetics, or quality. In contrast, studies indicate that such alternatives positively affect the mental representation of women and non-binary individuals, motivational outcomes and perceptions of professions, job advertisements, and candidates—particularly benefiting women and girls. Future research should aim to corroborate these findings with more diverse samples. Practical implications for language policies and educational settings are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The present study examined whether and how moral judgments in classic trolley dilemma scenarios changed following a major real-life event – the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. A longitudinal survey of 840 adults assessed decisions in two trolley problem scenarios (an impersonal “lever” version and a personal “footbridge” version) before and after the disaster, along with individual difference measures (Belief in a Just World, internal locus of control) and demographics. We analyzed changes in ethical choices (to sacrifice one person to save five or not), their directionality, and predictors of such changes. Results showed a significant increase in decision instability in the personal scenario: about 30% of participants altered their choice post-disaster, compared to 19% in the impersonal scenario. However, in the impersonal scenario more participants shifted from a utilitarian choice (sacrificing one) to a deontological choice (refusing to sacrifice) after the earthquake. By contrast, the personal scenario showed little net change. Belief in a just world (BJW) and internal locus of control scores significantly decreased from pre- to post-survey, indicating an erosion of just-world beliefs and personal control after the disaster. However, these changes did not directly predict who changed their moral decisions. Logistic regression analyses revealed that pre-existing individual differences played a role in moral stability: for the impersonal dilemma, higher BJW was associated with more consistent (unchanged) moral judgments, and women were more likely than men to alter their decision. In the personal dilemma, a lower internal locus of control predicted greater likelihood of changing one’s decision, and those who were students or in part-time employment showed higher odds of change than full-time workers. Model prediction was above chance but indicated substantial unexplained variance, underscoring the complexity of moral judgment dynamics. In sum, the present study provides evidence that a profound contextual event can subtly shift moral decision-making, and that certain individual dispositions confer stability in one’s ethical choices.",

          "authors": "Paul Haward",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the origins of non-literal meaning in human cognition and proposes a generative structural engine based on each concept’s central form—a reductive, domain-general format embedded within every concept we learn, which encodes a small subset of each concept’s information with a default sense of certainty. Recent work has demonstrated that people rely on form composition when generating and interpreting complex thoughts—a default mechanism for combining forms to generate meaning. The present paper tests the hypothesis that form composition operates across domain boundaries in a way that naturally and immediately generates metaphorical meanings. Across four experiments, participants judged it possible to combine central forms to produce metaphorical meaning—even when the metaphors and the concepts involved were novel. In contrast, they rejected metaphors involving non-form information as impossible. These findings suggest that form composition enables the spontaneous generation of non-literal meaning. This challenges the view that metaphor is secondary or derivative, instead positioning it as deeply interwoven with, and a natural outcome of, the very mechanisms by which humans combine concepts. The work carries broad implications for our understanding of concept learning, linguistic creativity, LLMs, and illuminates byproducts, such as the cognitive bias toward reductive reasoning across domains.",

          "authors": "Ryuhei Yasuda; Kyoshiro Sasaki",
          "abstract": "Sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling that one’s actions cause environmental changes. A previous study showed that SoA is enhanced when keypress-triggered motion stimuli move faster, suggesting that SoA depends on the extent of action outcomes. We examined whether the numerical magnitude of action outcomes similarly affects SoA. Participants pressed a key, which triggered the presentation of dots (Experiments 1–2) or digit values (Experiment 3), and then rated their SoA on a 10-point scale. Results showed that SoA ratings increased with greater numerical magnitude. However, Experiment 4, using an intentional binding paradigm, found that the interval between the keypress and dot onset was perceived as longer when more dots were presented. This contradicts Experiments 1–3 and suggests the observed SoA enhancement might stem from response bias (e.g., higher numerical magnitude of the outcomes leading to higher values in the rating/estimating phase). To test this, Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 2 with a reversed rating scale (1 = strongest, 10 = weakest) and again found higher scores with greater magnitude, supporting the response bias account. In contrast, the effect of motion speed was unaffected by rating direction, suggesting a genuine influence on SoA. These findings highlight the importance of carefully distinguishing true effects from mere response biases when evaluating how outcome magnitude influences SoA.",

          "authors": "Yichi ZHANG; Zhenguang Garry Cai",
          "abstract": "In dialogue, speakers align with their interlocutors at various linguistic levels and can adjust their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographic attributes (e.g., dialectal background) to facilitate communicative success (i.e., interlocutor modelling). This study further investigated whether speakers align with their interlocutor in their perspective of reference (e.g., referring to a person by their occupation or appearance; e.g., a monk or having a bold head). More importantly, we tested whether such perspective alignment, if any, is larger with a linguistically less competent interlocutor (a child interlocutor compared to an adult interlocutor in Experiment 1 and a non-native-speaking interlocutor compared to a native-speaking interlocutor in Experiment 2) and whether perspective alignment is sensitive to whether the participant and the interlocutors were engaged in a communicative task or not. In two experiments, participants carried out a communicative task with an online interlocutor (i.e., they took turns to describe a picture of a person so that the other person could click on the described picture) and a non-communicative task (they took turns to describe pictures without the need for the other person to click on the described picture) in Mandarin Chinese. Results showed that participants demonstrated greater perspective alignment a linguistically less competent interlocutors in both tasks. Such an interlocutor effect was observed in both the communicative and non-communicative tasks, though it was more pronounced in the former than in the latter. These findings support a hybrid model of interlocutor modeling is both goal-directed and implicit: while speakers tailor their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographics to boost communicative success, such interlocutor-sensitivity seems to additionally be driven by an implicit mechanism even in the absence of explicit communicative goals.",

Data comes from a larger randomized control trial, Kia Tīmata Pai (The Best Start Study), aimed at enhancing young children’s language and self-regulation. A subset of 24 centers (110 educators and 183 children) took part in video observations at baseline and a one-year follow-up. Educator-child interactions were video-recorded across five target activity settings: book-reading, diapering/toileting, group, play, and mealtime. Educators’ child-directed talk was coded for temporal reference (past, present, future) and function (conversation-eliciting and conversation-directing utterances). Analyses showed that centers in the ENRICH condition had educators who used more conversation-eliciting language over time in video-recordings of book-reading and diapering/toileting compared to centers in an Active Control. Further, children in ENRICH centers talked more frequently over time during book-reading relative to children in Active Control centers. These findings highlight the potential impact of professional development programs, such as ENRICH, in enhancing both educator practices and child language use within early childhood education and care settings.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness has been linked to impairment in emotional appraisal and emotion regulation. This study aimed to test a set of pre-registered hypotheses by suggesting that loneliness alters bottom-up appraisal processes of social threat and top-down emotion regulation mechanisms. In this double-blind, within-subject study, we included 120 individuals (equally split between highly lonely and non-lonely groups) who received active (2 mA) or sham transcranial direct current stimulation over the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in separate sessions. Participants were asked to passively watch negative or neutral stimuli or to reinterpret negative stimuli to decrease their affective response. Overt behavioral responses (valence and arousal self-response) and covert physiological markers (event-related potentials [ERPs]) of the affective response in each group were analyzed separately for stimuli with and without social content. Active dlPFC stimulation enhanced neural modulation during the reappraisal of social stimuli, as reflected in a larger difference in late positive potential between reappraised and passively viewed negative images. However, the valence rating difference between these conditions suggested less effective reappraisal under active stimulation. Anodal stimulation of the left dlPFC selectively decreased self-reported emotional reactivity during the passive viewing of social stimuli in highly lonely individuals. However, this effect occurred without corresponding changes in ERP markers. Loneliness may primarily impair the self-monitoring of affective responses rather than that of regulatory mechanisms. The left dlPFC supports the accurate self-assessment of emotional states, and targeted non-invasive brain stimulation can alleviate loneliness-related difficulties in this domain.",

          "abstract": "The Roma are the largest stateless ethnic minority in Europe and the largest in Hungary. Roma identity may be endorsed by members of the community, or assigned by external observers, with no clear superiority of either definition. I used two waves of the unique Hungarian Youth Research (Magyar Ifjúság Kutatás) household survey (combined N=16015), which contains both self-reports and observer reports by surveyors about the Roma identity of participants, to 1) compare the size and overlap of the self-reported and observer-reported Roma community, and 2) assess with hypothesis-free, cross validated methods what characteristics are associated with self-reported and observer-reported Roma identity, and the mismatch of the two. I found that observers identified more respondents as Roma than self-reports, and both false negatives and false positives were common. Self-reports, observer-reports and false positives depend on similar variables, centered around large household size, financial deprivation, tolerance toward Roma, and limited adoption of digital technology. False negative observer reports (self-reported Roma considered non-Roma by surveyors) are predicted, however, mainly not by the absence of these characteristics, but by the adoption of cosmopolitan middle-class values such as tolerance towards foreigners, support for sustainable technologies and good health behavior. The results show that census reports about the Roma community are an underestimate of their public presence, either due to the ethnicization of poverty by external observers or identity concealment. Findings also indicate the presence of a large, well-assimilated Roma community who external observers fail to identify due to their non-stereotypical values and lifestyle.",

          "authors": "Enomy Germain",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between political stability, natural disasters, and economic growth in Haiti, a fragile and disaster-prone state. Using time-series data from 1990 to 2024, we estimate a series of regression models to evaluate whether political stability contributes to growth and whether its effect is influenced by the frequency of natural disasters. Baseline results suggest that political stability has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on economic growth. However, the interaction between political stability and natural disasters is not consistently significant across all model specifications. Robustness checks, including corrections for autocorrelation, clustered standard errors, and the exclusion of extreme years, indicate that while the interaction effect may exist, it is sensitive to assumptions about time dependence and model specification. By contrast, variables such as foreign direct investment, population growth, and global economic conditions emerge as more stable predictors of economic performance. These findings highlight the importance of political stability in fragile contexts, but they also suggest that its benefits may be limited when environmental shocks are frequent. Despite data constraints and the focus on a single country, the study contributes to broader debates on fragility and development by emphasizing the need for integrated policy strategies that combine institutional strengthening with climate resilience.",

By focusing on the case study of Iranian rap prior and during the Women, Life, Freedom movement, I show how songs have changed from implicit, hopeless, allegorical, and melancholic to explicit, hopeful, and vengeful. Further, by relying on phenomenological approaches to political opportunities structures, I argue that “mentioning the unmentionable” after years of implicit discursive resistance, serves as a public open invitation to ordinary citizens to engage in extraordinary acts of resistance.",

          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

Respondents who heard the report were 8 percentage points more likely to reject all forms of early marriage and 5.4 percentage points more likely to say they would report early marriage to authorities. However, hearing the report did not influence perceptions of community norms or willingness to speak out against early marriage, and the persuasive effect of the report was attenuated when presented alongside a countervailing signal from Tanzania’s Attorney General.",

          "abstract": "This autoethnographic study explores manifestations of antisemitism on a European university campus, focusing on personal experiences as an Israeli Jewish student at the University of Coimbra. Drawing from firsthand observations, documented incidents, and interactions with protesters, administrative officials, and peers, the research highlights how hate-laden stickers, verbal threats, and institutional inaction shape a hostile academic climate. By weaving together personal narrative and scholarly frameworks on hate speech, higher education policies, and antisemitism, the study reveals a troubling dissonance between the university’s stated commitment to inclusivity and its inadequate responses to overt acts of discrimination.\n\nThrough detailed descriptions of unfolding events—from the initial appearance of incendiary slogans to meetings with administrators—the analysis illuminates how deeply entrenched biases can circumvent legal and procedural safeguards. In reflecting on emotional responses and the complexities of positionality, the autoethnographic lens underscores the human impact of hostile environments and the gaps in institutional support. The findings urge higher education stakeholders to reevaluate their protocols for handling hate speech and discrimination, calling for comprehensive measures that protect vulnerable groups and encourage critical engagement with contentious geopolitical issues. This work ultimately argues that acknowledging and actively combating antisemitism in academic settings is crucial for fostering genuine inclusivity and upholding the values of open, respectful scholarship.",

          "abstract": "Much existing research on job devaluation infers the role of cultural beliefs using the proportion of women in an occupation as a proxy. This study, rather than relying on the percentage of female workers, directly measures cultural feminine meanings using Japanese job advertisements analyzed through natural language processing. It empirically tests the devaluation mechanism and extends devaluation theory to the job level. Study 1 applies word embedding-based text analysis to identify culturally feminine meanings in job ads. Results show that postings semantically aligned with femininity, such as those using language semantically close to stereotypically feminine traits or family-oriented work-life balance benefits, are associated with lower wages, even after controlling for occupation. This implies devaluation’s operation at the job level. Study 2 consists of a factorial survey experiment targeting the labor supply side. Findings reveal that workers do not perceive jobs containing feminine cultural meanings as deserving of higher pay, even after controlling for occupation. The consistent perceptions across both labor market sides indicate that shared cultural beliefs legitimize lower wages for work culturally coded as feminine, thus empirically capturing the central mechanism of devaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "Food systems require sustainability transformations to reduce their negative environmental and social impacts. Food policy plays a crucial role in driving sustainability transformations in food systems, but fundamental change appears slow. Currently, there are urgent sustainability concerns in the European livestock sector, including livestock emissions and the pollution of surface water. Important lessons can be learned from the case of the Dutch manure problem (1950-2020), a persistent and salient sustainability issue. This article explains the lock-in of the Dutch agricultural policy regime by using the concept of policy feedbacks, drawing on theories from historical institutionalism and transitions research. Through process tracing, we find that policy feedbacks played a significant role, particularly highlighting the importance of actor coalitions that result in policy regime lock-ins. Based on this case, we draw policy insights relevant to both current and upcoming challenges in environmental pollution from livestock farming. Specifically, we highlight the role of actor coalitions, the siloed nature of policy development and tensions in multi-level governance as factors impeding transformation. We contribute to transitions research by proposing the concept of policy feedbacks as an additional lens to analyse sources of policy regime lock-in in societal systems and suggest for future research to investigate what factors could address these lock-ins.",

A consequence of these constraints is that the correlations in the random effects exhibit special symmetries, like block structure and/or Toeplitz-like diagonal-constant banding. Generating valid, positive-definite prior correlation matrices with such structure is typically non-trivial in the context of Bayesian model fitting. Here, we provide two effective solutions to the problem, the first based on an l2-norm penalty, and the second based on a flexible Cholesky factor parameterization that permits a priori constraints on the elements of the correlation matrix. We compare and contrast the methods using empirical and simulated network data, test for differences in efficiency, and highlight the partial strengths of each method, before discussing opportunities for further improvements. We also  provide generalizable implementations of both methods in Stan code.",

          "abstract": "In the aftermath of globalization, Western democracies have witnessed a surge in political disaffection and radical-right support. While economic and migration shocks have been widely studied, the political effects of border liberalization remain underexplored. This paper theorizes and tests how increased border permeability can generate political discontent, even without necessarily affecting immigration or direct economic competition. We argue that open borders enable brief, routine interactions between groups across historically closed frontiers. When this occurs between regions of unequal perceived status, it can erode symbolic boundaries and foster resentment. We examine this in the context of the German--Czech border, which transformed from a militarized Cold War frontier to an internal EU border. Leveraging two moments of liberalization---the fall of the Iron Curtain (1989) and Czech EU accession (2004)---we apply difference-in-differences and event study designs using municipality-level data from Bavaria. Border liberalization led to a drop in turnout (around  2 pp) and a rise in radical-right support (around 1 pp). This findings have implications on the determinants of backlash against globalization.",

However, concerns have been raised relating to the use of GAI as a threat to academic integrity, the lack of accuracy of its outputs, and its potential to hinder critical engagement in learning. While HE institutions globally have warned against the unregulated use of AI-generated content, the prevailing approach is to guide students in the ethical and transparent use of GAI tools. This research, based on primary data from a questionnaire involving undergraduate and postgraduate students across several UK HE institutions, aims to explore student perspectives on issues such as plagiarism, reliability of outputs, and the impact of GAI on the learning process; and how these perspectives vary across genders and domicile status (domestic vs. international students). Our findings show that students who identify as men report a higher frequency of GAI usage than women and that international students have more liberal standards regarding academic integrity compared to their UK counterparts.",

          "abstract": "In a rapidly evolving digital media landscape, understanding how exposure to untrustworthy news changes over time is essential for evaluating its potential effects on public\nattitudes and behavior. However, there is limited evidence on how demand for untrustworthy news develops across longer time frames. Linking web data with surveys, we compare\nexposure to untrustworthy news sources across demographic and political groups and over\na 7-year time frame for two samples of German adults (N = 1,212 in 2017 and N = 436\nin 2024). Visits to untrustworthy news sources make up less than 1% of media diets and\nare associated with low satisfaction with democracy and a preference for a far-right party.\nPropensity score matching reveals stability in untrustworthy news exposure, yet a notable\ndecline in the average quality of news diets over 7 years. These results suggest that while\nuntrustworthy news exposure remains limited and stable, a broader erosion in news quality\nmay pose a growing challenge for informed democratic engagement.",

          "authors": "Chad M. Topaz; Gina Jae; Jude Higdon",
          "abstract": "This scoping review synthesizes recently published research on news media coverage of gun violence in the United States. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic search of Web of Science and Google Scholar databases identified 76 peer-reviewed empirical studies published since 2000. Analysis reveals several recurring themes. First, news media coverage tends to be greater for incidents involving numerous victims, particularly women and/or children; occurring in schools, religious sites, or government buildings; or carried out by perpetrators who are young, ideologically driven, and/or show signs of severe mental illness. Second, race plays a significant role in shaping narrative frames, with media portrayals often depicting white individuals more sympathetically compared to racially minoritized individuals, regardless of whether they are victim or perpetrator. Third, media narratives display dynamic evolution over decades, transitioning from framing gun violence as isolated and episodic to addressing it as a part of broader social contexts and societal concerns. Finally, news coverage of gun violence is associated with negative audience emotions, especially fear, as well as with increased gun background checks suggestive of accelerated gun purchasing. Regarding media coverage's role in inciting further violence, however, studies present mixed findings. Limitations include the exclusion of social media discourse, which warrants study in future research. Future studies should also examine how news media coverage represents individuals across diverse gender identities, LGBTQIA+ communities, and disability statuses, while adopting intersectional perspectives. Three interrelated conclusions emerge from this analysis: the different types of gun violence that occur, the level of news media attention each receives, and the academic research that has investigated these media portrayals to date.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning and algorithmic decision-making technology – i.e., “artificial intelligence” (AI) – is rapidly advancing and becoming more widespread at workplaces. For some individuals, this is beneficial in that it increases their productivity and generates new employment opportunities. Other individuals, however, could see their incomes and employment opportunities decline because AI takes over their work tasks or because they are insufficiently skilled to fully take advantage of AI technology in their work. Some of this is already visible and, given what is known from previous research on the implications of technological transformations, these developments are likely to affect people’s political attitudes and preferences. I investigate this empirically using novel indicators of AI exposure and AI complementarity in combination with data from multiple waves of the European Social Survey. I find that AI exposure and complementarity do indeed have meaningful effects on political attitudes and preferences (specifically demand for redistribution and support for right-wing populist parties): Increasing AI exposure, when combined with AI complementarity, significantly lowers support for redistribution and for right-wing populist parties, while high complementarity in the absence of exposure has the opposite effects. In addition, while the former effect got weaker over the last two decades, the latter became stronger. These findings add to a growing literature that shows that the “AI Revolution” is already having meaningful political effects.",

          "abstract": "Over the past 170 years the United States (US) has undergone demographic, structural, and cultural changes that are reflected in–and a reflection of–changes in living arrangements. In this research note we link living arrangements to life expectancy to calculate expected life years spent across different living arrangements for the US population between 1850–2021, and decompose changes in this measure by age group. We additionally describe change across subsequent cohorts. We use harmonized data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Samples (IPUMS). We classify living arrangements into alone, with primary kin only (partners, parents, and children), and in extended households, and into more detailed sub-categories including, for example, single-parent households and extended families. Three historical ages of US living arrangements emerge. A “large household” system (1850–1940) characterized by relative stability in extended households, when primary kin arrangements incorporate the majority of the substantial gains in life expectancy; an era of “primary kin” dominance (1940–1980) when life years spent only with primary kin increase faster than life expectancy, while extended households decline; and a “diversified” phase (1980–onwards), with a decline in two-parent households in favor of greater diversity, including living alone and with extended family.",

          "authors": "Daniel Run Han Ho",
          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examines generational trends in hormonal contraceptive use among women of three birth cohorts (1991-93, 1981-83, 1971-73) and identifies their key predictors and changes over time.\nBackground: Since the 1960s, the birth control pill as most prominent form of hormonal contraception has shaped women’s reproductive autonomy, influencing family planning and career choices. Recent trends show a decline in hormonal contraceptive use in Western countries, but research has largely relied on cross-sectional data, leaving it unclear whether this trend reflects short-term period effects or broader cohort-driven changes.\nMethod: Using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam; waves 1-14), this study applies supervised machine learning to identify potential predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. 37 predictors were included, encompassing areas of family demography, gender role values, health, origin, personality, region, religiosity, and socioeconomic characteristics.\nResults: The analyses showed a decline in hormonal contraceptive use across all birth cohorts over time. Both cohort and period differences shaped the key predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. Predictors shifted from family-demographic factors in older cohorts to personality traits in younger ones, highlighting increasingly personalized decision-making. The relevance of income underscored the economic dimension of access to contraception. \nConclusion: These shifts reflect evolving dynamics in contraceptive use, with implications for public health strategies and policymaking.",

          "abstract": "Visibilizar el trabajo que se realiza en el campo de los estudios de género es una de las labores que ha de desarrollar el mundo académico para fortalecer dichos estudios. Este trabajo se enmarca dentro de la línea de la producción científica con perspectiva feminista utilizando técnicas bibliométricas para hacer patentes las líneas de investigación más productivas en el campo científico de los estudios de género a partir de documentos recuperados de la Web of Science de España y Brasil. Esta representación permite ver las fortalezas y debilidades en las que la agenda feminista trabaja en estos dos países y los aspectos más representados en la ciencia mainstream del feminismo. Se toman como guía las denominaciones de líneas de investigación de trabajos precedentes con el mismo objeto de estudio. Se pretende realizar una reflexión más amplia respecto al feminismo y la objetividad de la ciencia, la academia y la bibliometría, para aportar claves hacia una bibliometría feminista más allá de la “gestión del género”. En cuanto a resultados, se destaca que España presenta un abanico multidisciplinario desde las ciencias médicas y psicológicas a las ciencias sociales (deporte, educación, feminismo, comunicación, sociología, etc.), mientras que en Brasil la línea más productiva es la referida a estudios de género y diversidad. Un aspecto a destacar por su valor e interés es que los estudios de género y feminismo en Brasil se plantean mayoritariamente desde la perspectiva de la salud mostrando poca multidisciplinariedad. Por último, la reflexión llevada a cabo obliga a desgranar los problemas en la delimitación del campo científico, en la base de datos utilizada y en la posible falta de profundidad en el análisis descriptivo, que podrían llevar al estudio a un nivel simplista, como analizan algunas autoras feministas sobre trabajos bibliométricos de estudio de género y feminismo.",

          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of structural selection pressure to explain the \nparadoxical phenomenon in which competent individuals are marginalized or eliminated \nwithin organizational systems. Drawing on evolutionary biology and memetic theory \n(Dawkins, 1976; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Henrich, 2015), the study conceptualizes \norganizations as meme-based ecosystems where behaviors, values, and ideas \nundergo selection and replication. However, in many modern organizations, selection \npressure has become distorted: anger, dominance, and procedural rigidity serve as \nnegative filters that suppress memetic diversity and innovation. \nThe analysis identifies three dominant types of suppressive forces—rage-dominant \nleaders, charismatic silencers, and empathy-deficient operators—each contributing to \nwhat we term \"memetic desertification\": a cultural environment in which novelty is \npunished and conformity is rewarded. These dynamics lead to cultural senescence, \nloss of adaptability, and increased turnover. \nTo counteract this degenerative trend, the paper proposes structural interventions, \nincluding lateral promotion systems, anonymous feedback channels, and training for \nnon-dominant leadership. Furthermore, it suggests the incorporation of AI-based \nevaluation systems to depersonalize feedback and detect systemic biases in meme \nselection and suppression. \nBy reframing competence suppression as an evolutionary dysfunction of \norganizational structure, this paper provides a theoretical foundation for designing \norganizations capable of sustained innovation and cultural renewal.",

          "abstract": "Do Americans support small individual donations over other sources of political fundraising and does it matter for political behavior? Small online contributions are becoming more prevalent, and political elites and the media often idealize them as leveling the playing field in the American political ecosystem. However, we have little understanding of whether and, if so, how much the public supports small donations as a campaign funding source over others and whether such preferences translate into tangible changes in political behavior. We fill this gap with analyses of original surveys and survey experiments. Our results indicate that the public believes that there should be more small donations in American elections, fewer large individual donations, and to a much lesser extent, fewer PAC contributions. Using multiple conjoint experiments, we test whether candidates with higher dependence on small individual donors are preferred. Surprisingly, candidates relying more on small donors attract a higher likelihood of vote choice, not just within primaries or for Democrats, but across primaries, general elections, and all partisan affiliations. Such beliefs are unshaken when presented with information about lawmakers with the highest reliance on small donors, who are generally perceived as outsiders or ideologically extreme.",

          "authors": "Wong S Tan",
          "abstract": "Taiwan faces a critical \"crisis of efficacy\" where democratic institutions function procedurally but fail to deliver coherent governance solutions. The nation is trapped in a constitutional paradox: the very mechanisms that enabled democratic transition now prevent necessary evolution, creating what can be termed a \"democratic consolidation trap.\" The core driver is identity-based polarization that transforms routine policy debates into zero-sum sovereignty battles. This dynamic rewards ideological warriors over pragmatic problem-solvers, creating a leadership deficit that threatens national security. Taiwan's reactive governance model—responding only to acute crises—leaves chronic problems like housing costs, energy security, and institutional decay to metastasize. Constitutional amendment paralysis compounds these challenges, requiring supermajority consensus that polarization makes impossible. This creates a vicious cycle where institutional problems prevent constitutional reform, while reform remains the only legitimate solution mechanism. The analysis draws parallels to Late Qing institutional paralysis, warning of \"too little, too late\" scenarios where delayed responses render eventual solutions inadequate. Taiwan's window for incremental, legitimate reform may be narrower than assumed, requiring immediate action on meritocratic governance, anti-corruption measures, and consensus-building before the democratic system hollows itself out through continued ineffectiveness. The stakes could not be higher, and the moment for bold action was yesterday.",

          "abstract": "This book presents a theory of theory building and testing that builds on insights in Lipton’s 2004 book Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).  The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between political stability, natural disasters, and economic growth in Haiti, a fragile and disaster-prone state. Using time-series data from 1990 to 2024, we estimate a series of regression models to evaluate whether political stability contributes to growth and whether its effect is influenced by the frequency of natural disasters. Baseline results suggest that political stability has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on economic growth. However, the interaction between political stability and natural disasters is not consistently significant across all model specifications. Robustness checks, including corrections for autocorrelation, clustered standard errors, and the exclusion of extreme years, indicate that while the interaction effect may exist, it is sensitive to assumptions about time dependence and model specification. By contrast, variables such as foreign direct investment, population growth, and global economic conditions emerge as more stable predictors of economic performance. These findings highlight the importance of political stability in fragile contexts, but they also suggest that its benefits may be limited when environmental shocks are frequent. Despite data constraints and the focus on a single country, the study contributes to broader debates on fragility and development by emphasizing the need for integrated policy strategies that combine institutional strengthening with climate resilience.",

The study used Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA), following Kress and Van Leeuwen’s (2006) Visual Grammar Framework, to analyse the signage as a form of visual communication. This approach enables a detailed examination of how different modes, such as images, colour and text interact to convey meaning. Additionally, there was a spatial analysis of where the modes featured throughout the constituency, examining if this changed the advertising strategies of the Caribbean restaurants and takeaways.\n\nBy combining linguistics with geography, the research adopted a geolinguistic perspective to reveal how signage reflects and responds to the superdiverse Ladywood constituency, highlighting the importance of aesthetic and audience.\n\nThe study revealed that signage is not just a tool for branding but a spatial and symbolic response to superdiversity. It supports the argument made by Berg and Sigona (2016) that studies of superdiversity must look beyond ethnicity and consider other intersectional factors such as religion, migration, and class. The findings demonstrate how geolinguistic analysis uncovered the lived and visual dimensions of superdiversity. \n\nThis interdisciplinary approach enhances the understanding of how language and symbolism shape and reflect the evolving character of superdiverse communities, offering valuable insights into place-making, advertising, and audience engagement.",

Yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the demography of widowhood. Using total population data with information on marital and cohabiting unions, discrete-time event history analysis and incidence-based multistate lifetables, we analyse lifetime risk of widowhood, mean age at becoming widowed, widowhood expectancy, and variation in years spent widowed, and document gender and educational differences in these metrics over the last three decades in Finland. Our results show that, over time, individuals are less likely to experience widowhood, and when they do, it occurs at older ages. Women have higher widowhood risk, expectancy, and a lower mean age at widowhood than men. Widowhood expectancy for women declined from 8 to 6 years, while for men, it stagnated at around 2 years. Low-educated women faced more widowhood years than highly educated, while the opposite holds for men. By showing decreased risks, delayed onset, and shorter widowhood expectancy, particularly among women, our results suggest that the current older population may experience reduced exposure to the psychosocial and financial challenges of widowhood, with potentially reduced caregiving burden on families and the state.",

          "abstract": "Background: In the absence of high-quality data, the death tolls of epidemics, conflicts, and disasters are often estimated using ad hoc methods. One understudied class of methods, which we term the growth rate discontinuity method (GRDM), estimates death tolls by projecting pre-crisis and post-crisis total population estimates using crude growth rates and then subtracting the results. Despite, or perhaps due to, its simplicity, this method is the source of prominent death toll estimates for the Black Death, the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Great Chinese Famine, and the Rwandan genocide, among others.\n\nObjective: In this article, we review the influence and validity of GRDM and its applications.\n\nMethods: Using statistical simulation and comparison with better-validated demographic methods, we assess the accuracy, precision, and biases of this method for estimating mortality in absolute and relative terms.\n\nResults: We find that existing GRDM estimates often misestimate death tolls by large, unpredictable margins. Simulations suggest this is because GRDM requires precision in its inputs to an extent rarely possible in the contexts of interest.\n\nConclusions: If there is sufficient data to specify GRDM well, it is probably possible to also use a more reliable method; if there is not sufficient data, GRDM estimates are so sensitive to their assumptions that they cannot be considered informative.\n\nContribution: These findings question the empirical suitability of existing demographic and econometric work that has used GRDM to analyse mortality crises. They also underscore the need for improved data collection in crisis settings and the utility of qualitative methods in contexts where quantification using better-validated methods is not possible.",

We examine the echo chambers of climate obstructionists and advocates of climate action in ten countries using original survey data and inferential network analysis. We introduce a new way of studying echo chambers of policy actors by identifying groups of like-minded actors and analyzing information exchange within these groups. Our results indicate that while climate obstruction poses a challenge in all the case countries, echo chambers of both climate advocates and climate obstructionists are relatively rare. The results also indicate that while many actors exchange information across ideological lines, significant echo chambers do emerge in countries where climate obstructionists question the reliability of climate science.",

In India, this invisibility is exacerbated by the lack of formal recognition of 'Indigenous Peoples'—instead, the state uses administrative category 'Scheduled Tribes', which does not align with international definitions. Drawing on four case studies from India, this paper illustrates how traditional governance systems offer viable, culturally embedded inclusive nature- and people-based approaches to sustainable transformative change. Our paper argues that beyond decolonizing conservation discourse, there is a need for reparative justice: to redress historical exclusion, restore land rights, and fund IPLC-led conservation directly. Recognition justice for South Asian IPLCs is a critical and often overlooked component of global environmental governance. India serves not as an exception but as a representative case of broader systemic gaps. Bridging these gaps is not only a matter of justice but an ecological necessity for achieving the Global Biodiversity Framework and the IPBES vision of transformative change.",

          "abstract": "While probability-based surveys remain the standard in academic research, non-probability online panels are increasingly used due to their lower costs and faster data collection. This study compares two post-election online panel surveys conducted in Austria—one based on probability sampling (Digitize!) and the other on non-probability sampling (AUTNES)—across three dimensions: accuracy, response quality, and survey professionalism. Both surveys demonstrate a high level of accuracy relative to external benchmarks, with the non-probability sample showing some advantage in reaching non-voters. Response quality is broadly similar; although non-probability respondents exhibit slightly more satisficing behavior, differences in attention check results, item non-response, and internal consistency are minimal. As expected, non-probability respondents report more frequent survey participation and slightly greater financial motivation. However, intrinsic motivations are equally important in both groups, and digital skills and device usage are comparable. Overall, the findings suggest that non-probability surveys can yield data quality comparable to that of probability-based approaches and may be suitable for scientific research when paired with appropriate quality assessments.",

Both religiosity types unexpectedly raise self- and other-oriented virtue signaling, which in turn impact green choices; revealing that even socially motivated religious individuals can support sustainability. These results suggest green marketing can successfully appeal to both moral convictions and social recognition, offering a new perspective on how faith-based and status-driven motivations together shape environmentally responsible consumption.",

By visualising spatial shifts alongside lived experiences, we demonstrate how EO can enhance justice-centred research in sustainability science. This approach advances justice-centred sustainability research and reveals the need for policies that respond to both visible and hidden dimensions of infrastructure-induced inequality.

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer; Ozan Aksoy",
          "abstract": "The conventional Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) estimator has come under scrutiny lately. Recent literature has revealed potential shortcomings of TWFE when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. Scholars have developed new advanced dynamic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators to tackle these potential shortcomings. However, confusion remains in applied research as to when the conventional TWFE is biased and what issues the novel estimators can and cannot address. In this study, we first provide an intuitive explanation of the problems of TWFE and elucidate the key features of the novel alternative DiD estimators. We then systematically demonstrate the conditions under which the conventional TWFE is inconsistent. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of dynamic DiD estimators under violations of key assumptions, which likely happens in applied cases. While the new dynamic DiD estimators offer notable advantages in capturing heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the conventional TWFE performs generally well if the model specifies an event-time function. All estimators are equally sensitive to violations of the parallel trends assumption, anticipation effects or violations of time-varying exogeneity. Despite their advantages, the new dynamic DiD estimators tackle a very specific problem and they do not serve as a universal remedy for violations of the most critical assumptions. We finally derive, based on our simulations, recommendations for how and when to use TWFE and the new DiD estimators in applied research.",

          "abstract": "This review reconceptualises internalised misogyny as a clinically relevant mechanism of psychological distress in women, rather than a peripheral sociopolitical phenomenon. Synthesising feminist psychological theory with clinical research, it investigates how internalised sexist beliefs manifest as shame, perfectionism, emotional suppression, disordered eating, and trauma-related symptoms. The paper critiques the Internalised Misogyny Scale for lacking cultural and intersectional sensitivity, rendering them inadequate in diverse contexts like India. Diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM and ICD similarly omit sexism as etiological, leading to fragmented and depoliticised clinical interpretations. Drawing on Indian feminist scholarship, the paper explores how caste, colourism, respectability politics, and religious norms reinforce gendered self-policing. It exposes critical blind spots in mainstream and even feminist clinical models, and argues for feminist-informed therapies, such as narrative and relational-cultural therapy, that validate gendered suffering and challenge oppressive internalised scripts. By framing internalised misogyny as a somatised, culturally entangled, and under-recognised driver of women’s psychopathology, this review advocates for decolonial, trauma-informed clinical practices and culturally grounded future research.",

          "abstract": "The size of the crowd at large political protests is a highly politicized number, as it is often interpreted as the level of popular support. Not surprisingly, it is in the interest of political actors to manipulate perceptions of the crowd size, to boost support for or to delegitimize a particular political issue. This paper examines how perceptions of the crowd size can be manipulated using AI-generated protest images. In an experiment, participants are asked to rate the size of the protest crowd from a series of social media images. These images are manipulated to display larger (or smaller) crowd sizes using a generative image model. Results show that manipulation works, and that AI-inflated (or reduced) crowd portrayals lead to higher (or lower) crowd estimates as compared to the unmodified images. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-generated visual content in shaping popular perceptions of mass protests on social media.",

Drawing on interpretative phenomenological analysis of five in-depth interviews, this article examines how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in the Philippines negotiate identity and cope with discrimination through queer media engagement. We argue that queer media representations serve as affective mirrors—sites of validation, emotional self-regulation, and parasocial connection—while also reflecting tensions between visibility and stereotype. Participants describe how accessible queer media, from Thai BL dramas to LGBTQ+ TikToks, shaped their sense of self, offered imagined community, and created space for subtle but strategic resistance against heteronormative pressures. However, parasocial relationships were not embraced uncritically; they were navigated with both emotional investment and healthy boundaries. By reframing cultural proximity theory as identity-affective proximity rather than ethnic-linguistic affinity, we advance a more nuanced understanding of how marginalized youth find meaning in media that “sees” them. This study contributes to global queer media studies by foregrounding affective survival, media-based coping, and the ambivalence of representation in Global South contexts of constrained queer visibility.",

Drawing on Alexander’s civil sphere theory, Laclau and Mouffe’s discourse theory, and Lamont’s symbolic boundaries approach, we reconceptualize ideological and affective polarization through the lens of cultural sociology. Rather than treating polarization as mere attitudinal divergence, we frame it as the symbolic organization of political antagonism. Our model identifies three interrelated symbolic dimensions: (1) the divergence on contested issues conceptualized as signifiers; (2) their consistency, enabling chains of signification held together by “empty signifiers” that mark group identity; and (3) the mutual constitution of opposing semiotic chains and identities. We add a fourth, social dimension by distinguishing symbolic from social boundaries—capturing how cultural antagonisms may translate into structural disconnection and rupture. This framework offers a sociological theory of polarization attentive to meaning-making, boundary formation, and the conditional relationship between cultural and social differentiation.",

Drawing on Fairclough’s three-dimensional model of Critical Discourse Analysis, we examine four high-profile teleseryes (Ang Probinsyano, Maria Clara at Ibarra, Destiny Rose, and My Husband’s Lover), focusing on how narrative tropes, character framing, and discursive silences shape affective norms. Along with analysing the texts, we also used vignettes and interviews with 11 men to see how they understood these portrayals and expressed their emotions in daily conversations. The research reveals that normative affective regimes frequently render male victimhood as illegible or humorous, reinforcing vulnerability and equating legitimacy with stoic masculinity. We propose affective justice as a conceptual lens for assessing media systems, not only in terms of representation but also in their distribution of emotional legitimacy. By focusing on Philippine media as a key area of study, this research adds to larger discussions about gender issues, communication systems, and the importance of emotional acknowledgement in countries that have experienced colonialism.",

          "abstract": "This systematic literature review addresses the intersection of two rapidly evolving areas of knowledge and practice: Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and artificial intelligence (AI). There is growing scholarly recognition of the rich and diverse nature of IKS, which are unique intergenerational understandings of worldly relations from an Indigenous standpoint. There is now a vast literature on the promise and pitfalls of AI. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews showing how these two dynamic literatures are intersecting, and what the major themes are. AI has the potential to assist the promotion of IKS; however, there are also potential risks arising from AI for Indigenous peoples, such as the erosion of cultural knowledge, and data-grabbing that fails to respect the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These risks can exacerbate existing knowledge hierarchies and socio-economic inequalities. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2023 (January) on Indigenous peoples and AI. We shed light upon four unique overlapping categories into which existing literature can be classified and comprehensively discuss literature under each category. The first two categories discuss AI’s role in assisting the promotion of IKS and the third focuses on the pitfalls of using AI for Indigenous peoples. The final category discusses how IKS itself can enrich the development of AI. We further identify several gaps in the literature and highlight avenues requiring attention on AI’s role with Indigenous peoples and their knowledge systems.",

          "abstract": "U.S. schools are increasingly threatened by climate-related events such as extreme heat and air pollution, which adversely affect children’s health and learning. Climate risks do not occur in isolation. Adverse exposures intersect with local school socioeconomic and physical conditions that shape susceptibility to risks. Yet, research on how climate risks intersect with school social and physical factors influencing susceptibility remains limited. This study assesses relationships between climate risk and school susceptibility factors across major U.S. Cities and pinpoints school clusters within cities most in need of climate intervention. We analyzed 4,754 public school parcels in 20 major U.S. cities using climate risk and susceptibility indices. Climate risk was defined by PM2.5, ozone levels, and extreme heat days (Heat Index&gt;102°F). School susceptibility included poverty rates (free/reduced lunch), impervious surface cover, and inverse greenspace availability (trees, grass, shrub) based on 1m land-use classifications. Spatial lag regression assessed risk–susceptibility associations, and HDBSCAN clustering identified school clusters with convergence of high risk and high susceptibility within cities. Risk–susceptibility relationships varied by city. Significant positive associations were found in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, New York, and Riverside (.007 &lt; β &lt; .105). These school districts serve nearly 5% of U.S. public-school students. HDBSCAN identified 582 schools with both high climate risk and high susceptibility. Climate vulnerability among U.S. urban schools is spatially uneven. Identifying schools with the highest combined risk and susceptibility provides a foundation for targeted interventions such as greening and HVAC upgrades to support resilience and protect student wellbeing.",

The review demonstrates\nhow racial bias, especially racial stereotypes, impacts results through routine behaviors, policy\ndecisions, and algorithmic systems, drawing on multidisciplinary research from several fields,\nincluding psychology, criminal justice, education, media, and technology. Eberhardt&#39;s research\nshows how perception and behavior are influenced by implicit associations, and how these biases\nbecome more pronounced when they are ingrained in official organizations.This review critically\nsynthesizes empirical findings across sectors, including disparities in school discipline, racialized\npolicing, skewed media portrayals, and algorithmic discrimination in artificial intelligence. It\nalso highlights recent methodological innovations, such as natural language processing and field-\nbased experiments that help uncover and measure structural bias. The paper identifies key\nimplications for institutional reform and outlines future research directions, including global\napplications and participatory approaches. The central argument is that dismantling racial bias\nrequires not only shifting individual attitudes but transforming the systems that reproduce\ninequality. By situating psychological research within broader societal structures, this review\ncalls for institutionally grounded interventions that are empirically supported, ethically informed,\nand socially responsive.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw criticism from the international community and can be counterproductive to shoring up power and legitimacy. To avoid this, states may employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. By only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented action, existing research undercounts repression. The author recalls his experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

          "authors": "Cleber Ranieri Ribas de Almeida",
          "abstract": "This study presents documentary evidence suggesting that the poem “Relógio do Rosário” (1951), by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, was written in response to Pope Pius XII’s radio addresses condemning existentialists. The central thesis is that the poem was conceived and structured to mirror the form of Greek tragedies, especially Sophocles’ Antigone. Accordingly, the voice that speaks throughout the couplets—reflecting on pain, love, chastity, existence, and nothingness—is that of a tragic chorus, likely composed of young existentialists from Rio de Janeiro at the time. This chorus responds to the “sound,” which, according to the interpretation proposed here, represents the radio broadcast of the Pope’s voice during the proclamation of the Dogma of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven (1950). Contemporary news sources report that this proclamation ceremony was transmitted globally and heard by four hundred million people. The chorus’s response is dramatized following the tragic structure of ancient Greek plays, being rhetorically divided into prologue, parodos, episodes, stasima, and exodus, and employs the dramatic technique of teichoscopy to allude to historical events occurring offstage. The philosophical content of the choral reply is drawn from Schopenhauer’s Philosophy of the Will, specifically from Heraldo Barbuy’s 1938 Portuguese translation of The World as Will and Representation. In addition to adopting Barbuy’s writing style, Drummond reworks several of the translation’s now-forgotten images and metaphors.",

          "authors": "Evangelos Christou; Antonios Giannopoulos; Ioanna Simeli",
          "abstract": "This study examines how social media platforms influence tourism marketing strategies, consumer perceptions, and travel behaviors, addressing their sustainability implications. It aims to evaluate the current state of research on social media in tourism marketing, identify dominant trends, assess empirical evidence of impact, and critically highlight research gaps. The analysis focuses on three core marketing outcomes: destination image, travel intention, and user engagement—and includes a section examining sustainability considerations across environmental, sociocultural, and economic dimensions. The study uses a systematic critical review of 147 peer-reviewed academic articles published between 2015 and 2025, combined with a meta-analysis of 38 quantitative studies that report statistical effect sizes. The meta-analysis uses a random-effects model to compare the influence of different platforms and study contexts. Moderator variables include geographic region, platform type, and methodological design. Findings show that social media marketing has a statistically significant positive effect on destination image (Cohen’s d = 0.61), travel intention (d = 0.54), and user engagement (d = 0.43). The analysis also reveals geographic bias, limited research on emerging platforms, and a lack of longitudinal and ethical inquiry. Findings suggest that tourism researchers and marketers may have to adopt more context-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and ethical approaches. Critical sustainability concerns emerge, including “overtourism”, cultural commodification, digital inequities, and algorithmic biases. Further studies may focus on specific platform-related behaviors, long-term impacts, and integrated online strategies appropriate for global tourism diversity. Lastly, this paper advocates for context-sensitive, interdisciplinary, and ethically grounded approaches to ensure sustainable digital tourism marketing strategies.",

An ideologically extreme donor with private information about candidate ideology and quality can advertise on behalf of a candidate. Advertising reveals information about candidate quality to voters, who can learn from either donor-funded or neutral advertising. Voters update negatively about candidate ideology when ads are known to be donor-funded. Dark money suppresses source information and allows donors to advertise candidate quality while simultaneously concealing the ideological motivations behind ad funding. However, dark money leads voters to be suspicious of all advertising, which can end up harming voter welfare.",

          "authors": "Martin Lakomý; Filip Majetić; Muradiye ATEŞ",
          "abstract": "Extending working careers is a major European policy goal, but the role of individual resources in retirement timing remains underexplored. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply Bourdieu’s theory of capitals as a framework for understanding how resources (economic, social, and cultural capital, including their dimensions) affect retirement decisions over time. The presented study uses PCA and time-lagged regression on panel data to explore how forms of capital help older workers (N=15,527) to remain working across three successive periods. The results show that wider community social capital, alongside human, health and digital capital (domains of cultural capital), indeed help older adults to extend their working lives. The impact of other forms of capital (economic capital and two types of social capital) diminishes once relevant control variables are included, and the findings are robust across different time spans. Moreover, the diversity of the European context is captured in separate models for four regions, which identified several region-specific differences. Overall, Bourdieu’s framework proves relevant in the current situation of population ageing and the digitalisation of economies. The paper suggests that policymakers should reflect on resource inequalities when developing measures to support longer working lives for those able to continue, while ensuring alternatives for those facing significant barriers.",

          "authors": "Florencia Torche; Alisa Feldman; Tyler McDaniel",
          "abstract": "Marital surname choices reflect deeply embedded, often unspoken gender norms. According to the marital exchange/bargaining approach, women are more likely to adopt their husband’s surname when they hold lower status—measured by education or earnings—relative to their spouse. In contrast, the compensatory gender display approach suggests that women may also take their husband’s name when their status exceeds their husband’s, to compensate for their deviation from traditional gender roles. Using natality data from 2000 to 2021, we find consistent evidence in support of compensatory gender display. Women in different-sex marriages are more likely to take their husband’s surname both when they have lower and when they have higher educational status than their spouse, with the likelihood increasing as the educational gap grows. Notably, wives with more education than their husbands have remained especially likely to adopt their husband’s name over the past two decades—even as women have increasingly outpaced men in educational attainment and such marriages have become more common. These findings highlight the enduring power of gendered expectations and reveal how traditional norms continue to reinforce male dominance in the symbolic realm of naming, despite women’s rising status.",

          "abstract": "The discipline of Migration Studies should be dismantled. Migration Studies has made major achievements in explaining why people move across borders and how societies and states adapt and respond to the movement and settlement of people. However, the discipline possesses a deeply problematic and irreparable ontology. Its focus on the 'migrant' and 'migration' as objects of study necessarily predispose the discipline to statist and anti-migrant forms of study. Many previous works have diagnosed this problem and posed conceptual and methodological means of resolving them. This paper explains why these solutions have not works. Migration Studies' ontology continues to be reinforced by the disciplinary apparatus of Migration Studies institutions and associations. Hence, the paper calls for the dismantling of these institutions and associations and proposes ways in which research on human mobility, state power and territory might develop in less politically problematic ways.",

          "abstract": "Deaf scholars have long worked at the margins of academic institutions not designed for them. Designated deaf academic spaces – where deaf ways of knowing, teaching, and communicating are centred – remain rare, especially in transnational contexts. This study explores what becomes possible when such a space is created, presenting Dr Deaf as a case study. Drawing on interviews with participants and teachers, we show how deaf epistemologies and pedagogies are enacted through practices such as cross-stage responsibility - horizontal and vertical mentoring – and academic becoming, as deaf scholars shape and affirm their identities. Central to this is realignment: the structural, pedagogical, affective, and linguistic reconfiguration of academic space that centres deaf perspectives. We also identify a distinct deaf rhythm that emerges in this space. While Dr Deaf is context-specific, its values offer a flexible framework for imagining and sustaining other deaf academic and broader educational spaces.",

This study examines the relationship between anxiety and health-related AI use among U.S. college students, using data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study. Results indicate that students with higher anxiety scores were significantly more likely to use AI for health purposes and to access professional mental health services. Among students who use AI for health, those with greater anxiety were also more likely to report using formal mental health services. Gender and academic fields also influenced AI use. Female students were less likely than male students to use AI for health purposes, despite being more likely to seek professional help. Students in health-related and STEM fields reported greater AI use than those in the humanities and arts. These findings highlight the importance of designing responsible AI tools that account for students’ mental health needs and emphasize the need for further research into how students engage with these tools during periods of psychological distress.",

The links between reporting a meaningful experience with and undertaking advocacy and conservation behaviours was particularly strong, with these relationships remaining significant even after human-nature connection was controlled for.\n5.\tPublic policy can do more to promote meaningful experiences in nature to enhance human-nature connection, wellbeing, and environmental stewardship.

Drawing from firsthand observations, documented incidents, and interactions with protesters, administrative officials, and peers, the research highlights how hate-laden stickers, verbal threats, and institutional inaction shape a hostile academic climate. By weaving together personal narrative and scholarly frameworks on hate speech, higher education policies, and antisemitism, the study reveals a troubling dissonance between the university’s stated commitment to inclusivity and its inadequate responses to overt acts of discrimination.\n\nThrough detailed descriptions of unfolding events—from the initial appearance of incendiary slogans to meetings with administrators—the analysis illuminates how deeply entrenched biases can circumvent legal and procedural safeguards. In reflecting on emotional responses and the complexities of positionality, the autoethnographic lens underscores the human impact of hostile environments and the gaps in institutional support. The findings urge higher education stakeholders to reevaluate their protocols for handling hate speech and discrimination, calling for comprehensive measures that protect vulnerable groups and encourage critical engagement with contentious geopolitical issues. This work ultimately argues that acknowledging and actively combating antisemitism in academic settings is crucial for fostering genuine inclusivity and upholding the values of open, respectful scholarship.",

          "abstract": "The ability of voters to elect politicians into office who can bring about desired or positive outcomes, i.e., voter competence, is subject to continual debate in political science. One camp argues that voters are largely ignorant of policy outcomes, showcasing when constituents are driven by their identity rooted in affective attachments to social groups. This contrasts the substance-based view, which presents evidence that policy issues and other objective outcomes drive voter behavior. I argue that both sources of motivation can drive behavior, but show how context determines which source increases in influence on decision-making. In contexts where there is greater attribution of substantive outcomes to incumbent actions, this component is weighed more heavily. In contexts where policy outcomes are “noisier,” the identity component attains more weight in decision-making. I design a novel randomized controlled experiment and find evidence for the argument.",

Such models are criticised on the grounds  that conservatism may spring from private and rigid adherence to the status quo, instead of strategic concerns about coordination. We address this by modeling agents with varying pay-off and long-term memories, using an experience-weighted attraction model. When negotiation is costly, agents playing a pure coordination game can coordinate around one spontaneously emerging “status quo” move, whose existence stabilises “flexible conservative” strategies, playing the status quo move by default but open to negotiation, and “rigidly conservative” strategies that invariably play the status quo. This model explains two empirical phenomena—why conservative strategies can remain stable for a minority only, and bounce back once suppressed—without assuming conformity, group identification, or risk aversion.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring population-level life satisfaction is critical for effective and responsive policy planning, yet in many regions of the Global South, this remains a major challenge due to limited or delayed survey infrastructure. This study demonstrates that machine learning models can reliably predict life satisfaction using a combination of mood-based survey data and digital behavioural signals from search engine keyword trends. Applying least-squares boosting ensembles to UK longitudinal data (2020–2024), we find that mood indicators explain 72% of variance (R² = 0.72), while Google Trends search data achieves an inferior but notable accuracy from digital behavioural indicators alone (R² = 0.623) Although developed in a UK context, the framework is designed for adaptation to majority world settings, with low computational requirements, mobile-first compatibility, and a modular structure. We also address key ethical and technical considerations—such as the digital divide, cultural specificity, and data sovereignty—to support equitable implementation. This work offers a scalable, low-cost pathway to real-time well-being monitoring and agile policy response, empowering governments and NGOs with culturally grounded, data-driven insight where it is most urgently needed.",

This scoping review addresses the education adoption of drone technology between 2018 and 2025 based on UAV applications, pedagogical strategies, and associated challenges. PRISMA-ScR and thematic content analysis of 36 peer-reviewed articles accessed through Scopus informed the review. The findings indicate that, although UAVs are applied extensively in higher and STEM education, their application in primary and interdisciplinary education is very low. Drones facilitate student participation, allow real-world data collection, and dissociate theory from practice but are limited by teacher training issues, the law, and expense. Pedagogical designs such as experiential, inquiry, and challenge-based learning were adopted universally when drones were employed for learning. This review concludes that UAVs are appropriate pedagogical tools but need broader incorporation into curricula and the generation of ethical standards. Follow-up research needs to respond to closing the under-researched areas, deepening professional training, and inclusive policymaking for fully embracing the learning capacity of drones.",

Employing a mixed-methods approach, it integrates qualitative data from expert interviews with quantitative responses from 391 participants to assess both the potential and limitations of AI personalization strategies. Thematic analysis highlights AI's capacity to facilitate adaptive, real-time marketing and enhance short-term engagement. However, it also reveals persistent challenges, including over-personalization, privacy concerns, and diminished consumer autonomy. Quantitative analyses found no significant associations between AI personalization and customer loyalty or satisfaction, nor between AI use frequency and perceived effectiveness. Notably, only AI’s predictive accuracy showed a weak but significant relationship with customer satisfaction, suggesting limited explanatory power for traditional personalization metrics. Ethical concerns and privacy risks emerged as key drivers of consumer skepticism, reinforcing the need for transparency and data control. The findings challenge assumptions that personalization alone drives customer loyalty and call for context-aware, ethically grounded marketing strategies. FMCG marketers are advised to adopt hybrid models that balance technological capabilities with consumer trust, autonomy, and long-term engagement.",
