          "title": "How Journalists Can Foster Humble Inquiry in their Work and their Readers",
          "authors": "Musa al-Gharbi",
          "abstract": "On its face, journalism is a project that requires humble inquiry: reporters have to speak on matters that are fluid, complex, dynamic, and ambiguous – they have to turn in the “first draft of history” even as the “facts” continue to evolve. They must also convey “the facts” in a manner that is concise, compelling, and accessible to non-specialized audiences, often working under tight deadlines, and engaging with stakeholders who have their agendas, which may diverge from those of the readers, the publication, or the journalists themselves. Put simply, this is very difficult work. And “getting it right” often requires a willingness to check one’s assumptions, recognize and admit errors, and subordinate one’s vision and preferences to those of editors and audiences. This chapter will describe some failures and opportunities of news media to promote humble inquiry. It will discuss how journalists may foster HI in their own work and how journalists can encourage HI in their readers.",

          "authors": "Fieke Jansen",
          "abstract": "Until recently, environmental harms were largely absent from internet governance discussions and their study. This article offers an analysis of how the environmental impact of internet infrastructure is discussed in the IETF to argue that sustainability becomes a justification regime for the internet's existence and growth in a world in crisis. Taking a discard studies approach, I explore what is and what must be discarded for the internet to continue to operate. These insights allow me to expand on Liboiron concept of ‘scalar mismatch’ to illuminate that limits to growth are directly at odds with the values that have shaped the internet. The internet governance community has not come to grips with the idea that the network is an environmental problem in itself; rather, the belief in growth, abundance of natural resources, and sustainability through innovation shapes their understanding of sustainability. This paper straddles infrastructure studies, internet governance studies, and environmental social sciences, and shows how an environmental lens to infrastructure studies allows us to connect the global governance debates with local conflict over resources.",

          "authors": "Jesica Formoso; Nicolas Palopoli; Irene Vazano; Paz Míguez; Julián Buede; María Cristina Nanton; D.I. Burin; Laura Acion",
          "abstract": "Open Science (OS) has gained prominence as a framework for more transparent and equitable research, but few studies have directly examined the barriers faced by researchers in Latin America. Understanding these obstacles is crucial not only to systematize the challenges to OS implementation but also to design and evaluate targeted training initiatives that address them. In this study, we combined qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the perspectives of Spanish-speaking researchers participating in an OS training program. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses allowed us to categorize perceived barriers into four domains: cultural resistance and perceived risks, knowledge and training gaps, structural limitations, and institutional constraints. Quantitative analyses using cumulative link mixed models revealed that participation in the training was associated with significant increases in knowledge and implementation of OS practices, along with higher ratings of their perceived importance. Together, these results show that training interventions can help mitigate some of the reported barriers, while also providing systematic evidence to guide policies and institutional reforms needed for sustainable OS adoption in the region.",

          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "This paper contributes to meta-research on how clinical claims should be made transparent, reproducible, and auditable under open-science practices. We present a transferable Evidence–Values–Accountability (EVA) framework and use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a testbed to analyze how research evidence, patient values, and institutional accountability can be structurally linked without endorsing specific therapies. The framework operationalizes transparency through repository-ready artifacts—checklists, prompt-preservation templates, preregistration pathways, and workflow logs—that document reasoning, evidence weighting, consent/risk communication, and human oversight. We map EVA to reporting and oversight elements (e.g., data availability, AI-use disclosure, and referral criteria) to reduce ambiguity at the research–practice interface and to improve meta-evaluation of clinical narratives. CAM is analytically useful because heterogeneity, cultural framing, and evidence gaps make reproducibility and governance challenges salient; recent AI-amplified misinformation (e.g., a bromism case) further illustrates why provenance and disclosure matter. Although demonstrated on CAM, the framework is domain-agnostic and intended for broader health research. By foregrounding research transparency and accountability rather than therapeutic claims, this work advances meta-research on how clinical knowledge is generated, communicated, and audited within open science, and offers concrete tools that health systems and journals can adopt.",

          "authors": "Konrad Hinsen",
          "abstract": "Since its beginnings in the 1940s, automated reasoning by computers has become a tool of ever growing importance in scientific research. So far, the rules underlying automated reasoning have mainly been formulated by humans, in the form of program source code. Rules derived from large amounts of data, via machine learning techniques, are a complementary approach currently under intense development. The question of why we should trust these systems, and the results obtained with their help, has been discussed by early practitioners of computational science, but was later forgotten. The present work focuses on independent reviewing, an important source of trust in science, and identifies the characteristics of automated reasoning systems that affect their reviewability. It also discusses possible steps towards increasing reviewability and trustworthiness via a combination of technical and social measures.",

          "authors": "Wilco Emons; Klaas Sijtsma; Lex Bouter",
          "abstract": "Background: This article reports on prevalence of preregistration of empirical studies presented at three editions of the World Conference on Research Integrity (Hong Kong, 2019; Cape Town, 2022; Athens, 2024) at the time of abstract submission, and the association of preregistration with the characteristics of the study and of the researchers submitting the abstract. \n\nMethod: During registration and abstract submission, applicants were invited to answer questions on preregistration of their study and their academic background. Information collected varied somewhat across conferences, as our insights developed over time. Because of modest sample sizes, we only present descriptive analyses of the prevalence of preregistration and its association with the study’s research theme, and the applicant’s career stage and academic rank. \n\nResults: The prevalence of preregistration among presenters of empirical research did not improve across the three WCRIs, and stagnated on average at a modest 28 percent. The verifiability of claims of preregistration did improve over time, however, and increased from 44 to 88 per cent of the abstracts of empirical studies that claimed to have preregistered. . Reasons given for not preregistering varied highly, but little faith in its usefulness and unfamiliarity were frequently mentioned. Younger researchers tended to preregister more often than others, and researchers with a biomedical background preregistered more often. \n\nConclusions: Preregistration of research integrity studies still is not common, and the trend over time suggests stagnation at a rather low level. Reasons for not preregistering participants were too varied to extract one clear-cut solution. We suggest to simplify the preregistration process and propose that funding agencies, research institutes and scholarly journals should demand preregistration of empirical studies.",

          "authors": "Mahmoud Medhat Elsherif; Steven Frisson; Linda Wheeldon; James H Smith-Spark",
          "abstract": "Purpose: The Lexical Quality Hypothesis (LQH) posits that differences in the precision of orthographic, semantic, and phonological word representations affect language processing. While LQH components are typically investigated in reading, their role in resolving cognitive conflict remains unknown. This study applies the construct of lexical precision to the traditional naming Stroop task, a gold-standard to quantify cognitive conflict resolution specifically investigating its influence in dyslexia and stuttering. \nMethod: Stroop interference was measured in 84 neurotypical readers, 50 dyslexic adults and 30 adults who stutter (AWS). All participants completed a naming Stroop task, together with a suite of individual difference measures that were analysed using a Principal Component Analysis, which established measures of phonological precision and lexical precision. \nResults: The data showed that, on average, dyslexic adults and AWS showed significantly larger Stroop interference effects compared with neurotypical adults. Crucially, the magnitude of the Stroop interference was moderated by lexical precision. Dyslexic adults and AWS who scored higher on the lexical precision component showed Stroop interference levels similar to the neurotypical adults, while those with lower precision demonstrated a significantly larger Stroop interference. However, the level of Stroop interference did not differ between AWS and dyslexic adults. \nConclusions: The results indicate that an imprecise lexical representation underpins the difficulties in cognitive control mechanisms that are independent of the specific neurodivergent groups.",

          "authors": "Hideyuki Hoshi; Miho Fuyama; Tomohiro Ishizu",
          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Across five studies (N = 7,075) we use the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to document a stereotype linking White Americans to the trait “rich” and Black Americans to the trait “poor” among Americans of various racial groups. Building on an unexpected finding of stronger White–rich/Black–poor stereotyping among third-group individuals (e.g., Latine and Asian Americans) relative to Black and White Americans, we hypothesized that biased social sampling from network homophily might produce this stereotype. Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups. Overall, these findings suggest that social relationships are critical to understanding how individuals form and maintain stereotypes about groups that are unequal in wealth and status.",

          "authors": "Elliott Bonal",
          "abstract": "This work introduces the concept of an \"experiential space\", a space of all possible sensory experiences. Indeed, an experience is represented as a point in \"experiential space\" and is given by the output of a \"binding function\" applied to the solution to a neural network coding equation, introduced in \"Predicate Coding\" (Bonal, 2025),  for the sensory nervous system at a given time. This work aims to address the \"Neural Binding Problem\", understood here as explaining the unity of conscious experience yielded through the activity of a distributed system, such as the sensory nervous system. Finally, this model yields testable hypotheses, such as: (i) TMS-induced perturbations to regions responsible for processing a subset of perceivable predicates should selectively distort corresponding dimensions in  experiential space ; (ii) The implementation of a Brain-Computer Interface directly interacting with the sensory nervous system, would yield phenomenal representations coming from the interface within the experience's coordinates ; (iii) The presentation of a gradually changing sequence of stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher path-average speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval  ; (iv)  The presentation of unchanging stimuli followed by a rapid change in stimuli with diverse predicate values during a fixed time interval should yield a higher distance speed within the experiential space, than the presentation of unchanging stimuli during the same fixed time interval.",

          "abstract": "How do the social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills essential for navigating life's challenges differ across age, from childhood to adulthood? This cross-sectional study investigated age-related differences in SEB skills and their gender variations using a large sample (N=31,315, ages 10-70). There were four key findings. First, there were temporary and modest decreases in some skill domains during early adolescence, possibly reflecting “adolescent disruption.” Second, despite these temporary declines, mean levels of all SEB skill domains increased with age, with most skill domains (Self-Management, Social Engagement, Cooperation, and Emotional Resilience) improving markedly during adolescence and early adulthood. This is broadly consistent with “maturation” in the personality trait literature. Third, there was considerable heterogeneity in age-related patterns when assessing specific skill facets. Fourth, there were some gender differences: men and women varied in age-related differences for Cooperation and Innovation skills, and non-binary youth reported lower initial levels on most skills but showed greater positive change during adolescence and early adulthood. These patterns show both parallels and distinctions with developmental principles derived from the personality trait literature, such as adolescent disruption and adult maturation. These findings provide the most comprehensive map of SEB skill development to date and should be used to inform future longitudinal studies and the design of developmentally-timed interventions.",

          "abstract": "Partners of transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals face a unique set of relationship experiences and challenges, one of which may be a renegotiation of their own sexual identity. The current study explored how sexual fluidity beliefs, relationship satisfaction, and LGBTQ+ community connectedness were associated with sexual satisfaction among partners of TGNB individuals (n = 175; 72% cisgender women) via an online survey. Results showed that a minority of participants (27%) shifted their sexual identity label in response to having a TGNB partner; when shifts did occur, they were most often to broader labels. Relationship satisfaction was the strongest predictor of sexual satisfaction, and individuals who reported higher LGBTQ+ community connectedness reported higher relationship/sexual satisfaction relative to before their partner’s TGNB identity disclosure. Relationship satisfaction fully mediated the effect of LGBTQ+ community connectedness on sexual satisfaction. However, sexual fluidity beliefs were not associated with sexual satisfaction. The findings point to the ways in which relationships including a TGNB partner show similar patterns to those identified in other types of relationships, as well as highlight the importance of LGBTQ+ community connectedness for well-being in partners of TGNB individuals.",

          "abstract": "While time flows uniformly, many factors influence memory for temporal information. The current study examined how cross-event interconnection and goal-directed, agentic engagement impacted the temporal structure of memory for a virtual escape room game played with friends. We found that after controlling for the actual temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that shared contextual overlap. Notably, within these causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found. Further, participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory and increased temporal integration between the contextually-related events compared to participants who contributed less. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and that agentic task engagement modulates how real-world experiences are remembered.",

          "title": "Cognitive reappraisal changes cognitive evaluations more than affective experiences",
          "authors": "Henna Vartiainen; Erik C Nook",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy that involves changing one’s interpretation of a situation to change its emotional impact. Cognitive reappraisal studies typically assess changes in valence ratings following reappraisal as the primary dependent variable, but scholars have recently documented that valence ratings can take two forms: affective valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s hedonic internal feelings) and semantic valence (i.e., the positivity/negativity of one’s cognitive evaluation of the stimulus). Because typical rating instructions do not distinguish between these forms of valence, it remains unknown how strongly cognitive reappraisal shifts either one. We address this gap through two preregistered studies. In Study 1, N=155 participants completed a classic cognitive reappraisal task in which they either responded naturally to or cognitively reappraised negative images. Critically, we manipulated whether participants rated either affective valence, semantic valence, or “default” valence (conventional instructions). Reappraisal significantly improved valence ratings in all conditions, but reappraisal most strongly influenced semantic valence and least strongly affective valence. Interestingly, default valence behaved most similarly to semantic valence, suggesting that existing reappraisal studies largely document changes in semantic evaluations, more than affective experiences. Study 2 (N=105) replicated these effects within-subjects. These results extend research on affective and semantic valence by demonstrating that they vary in their responsiveness to regulation. Additionally, they suggest that existing research likely overestimates the impact of reappraisal on felt emotional experiences, prompting new perspectives on past findings and more focused methods for assessing the hedonic impact of emotion regulation.",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying belief strength in heuristics-and-biases tasks is crucial yet methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce an automated method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically measure and manipulate belief strength. We specifically tested this method in the widely used “lawyer-engineer” base-rate neglect task, in which stereotypical descriptions (e.g., someone enjoying mathematical puzzles) conflict with normative base-rate information (e.g., engineers represent a very small percentage of the sample). Using this approach, we created an open-access database containing over 100,000 unique items systematically varying in stereotype-driven belief strength. Validation studies demonstrate that our LLM-derived belief strength measure correlates strongly with human typicality ratings and robustly predicts human choices in a base-rate neglect task. Additionally, our method revealed substantial and previously unnoticed variability in stereotype-driven belief strength in popular base-rate items from existing research, underlining the need to control for this in future studies. We further highlight methodological improvements achievable by refining the LLM prompt, as well as ways to enhance cross-cultural validity. The database presented here serves as a powerful resource for researchers, facilitating rigorous, replicable, and theoretically precise experimental designs, as well as enabling advancements in cognitive and computational modeling of reasoning. To support its use, we provide the R package baserater, which allows researchers to access the database to apply or adapt the method to their own research.",

          "authors": "Ginevra D'Ottavio; Alana Sullivan; Jonathan Chow; Yavin Shaham",
          "abstract": "Social connection is a fundamental animal need, and its maintenance primarily depends on the rewarding nature of positive social interactions. A central feature of several medical conditions, including neuropsychiatric disorders, is decreased interest in positive social interactions and a tendency toward social isolation, which can in turn worsen these conditions. \nNumerous studies using animal models have identified brain mechanisms underlying both unconditioned and conditioned (using conditioned place preference) social interactions, where the interaction is imposed by the experimenter. In contrast, much less is known about the brain mechanisms involved in volitional, rewarding social interactions that are initiated by the animals themselves. This is critical as social interactions between humans are often voluntary. Early studies showed that rats will perform a volitional operant response to gain access to social interaction with a peer. More recently, the operant social self-administration procedure has been used to investigate the brain mechanisms of rewarding social interaction in mice, rats, prairie voles, and hamsters.\nIn this review, we summarize behavioral and neurobiological studies that have used the operant social self-administration procedure. We then discuss how this model has been used to study the effect of volitional social interaction across neurodevelopmental disorders, addiction, stress, pain, and inflammation, including its role in drug self-administration and relapse in rats, the identification of heroin-addiction–vulnerable individuals, and to study how pain and social stress disrupt volitional social interaction. We conclude by briefly discussing future research directions and potential clinical applications.",

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, four overarching themes were formulated: (1) Negative Prior Experiences with Mathematics, (2) Misconceptions of Course Content, (3) Statistical Fragility, and (4) Student-Tutor Interaction. The findings show how early difficulties with mathematics and misaligned expectations about psychology as a discipline undermine fragile confidence when encountering statistical concepts, often resulting in hypervigilance and self-doubt. Tutor communication, class size, and assumptions about baseline competence further shaped students’ experiences, intensifying anxiety. This research provides a nuanced investigation of how students conceptualise statistics in their psychology journey, and offers suggestions and recommendations for applied practice.",

          "abstract": "Repetitive threat-neutralization is a common behavior pattern across anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that contributes to functional impairment. However, laboratory studies of this behavioral phenomenon are scant. In the present study, we examined effects of anxiety-related disorders and anxiety sensitivity on repetitive threat-neutralization behavior. Adults recruited from the community (n=40) with and without anxiety-related disorders completed clinician-administered and self-reported anxiety assessments and the Tap-to-Safety Task. Task stimuli included a threat cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety cues (CS-) never paired with shock, and safe stimuli varying in similarity to the CS+. The task included choice trials, in which participants could repeatedly tap a button to reduce risk of shock, while also reducing accumulation of reward points. In an extinction phase, shocks were no longer administered. We conducted linear mixed-effects models to examine differences related to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety disorder diagnosis in repetitive threat-neutralization behavior across stimulus types. Participants with greater anxiety sensitivity showed more adaptive neutralization behavior to the true threat-cue as well as more unnecessary neutralization to the former threat-cue. Those with anxiety-related disorders showed more neutralization behavior to the former threat-cue. Anxiety sensitivity and anxiety-related disorder status were both associated with less-steep declines in neutralization behavior across trials of extinction, consistent with the hypothesis that neutralization behaviors would persist in safe situations for anxious individuals. These findings suggest that the TTS task captures anxiety-related individual differences in extinction of repetitive threat-neutralization behavior, and provides an adaptable tool for probing threat-related behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Mental health concerns among early-career researchers (ECRs) have gained attention, but prevalence and severity estimates remain fragmented. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis to quantify the burden of psychological distress in this population (PROSPERO: CRD42024596813). A total of 139 studies and four primary databases were identified (k = 212, N = 128,684) via Scopus and supplementary searches through 31 December 2024. Based on established diagnostic thresholds, pooled prevalence estimates indicated that 28.9% (95% confidence interval 25.3–32.7%) of ECRs met the criteria for at least one mental health syndrome or symptom. Specifically, 28.9% (25.4–32.5%) met criteria for depression, 29.1% (25.4–32.9%) for generalized anxiety disorder, 24.9% (20.6–29.4%) for an eating disorder, 21.4% (17.2–26.0%) for alcohol abuse, 18.2% (14.2–22.6%) engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury, and 17.5% (14.2–21.0%) reported suicidal ideation. Complementing prevalence estimates, analyses of normalized severity scores indicated that ECRs experienced mild degrees of depression, anxiety, and moderate degrees of stress. Severity estimates for eating disorders and suicidal ideation did not exceed clinical cut-offs. Moderator analyses indicated that the type of syndrome and the type of measurement scale explained the largest part of the variance in both the prevalence and the severity models. Most individual-level factors, such as gender, ethnicity, academic discipline, country, career stage, social support, and supervisor relationship, did not significantly moderate prevalence or severity estimates. Age showed a small, but significant association with lower prevalence (β = -0.01, CI -0.03 – -0.0009). Higher study quality and random or full sampling were also associated with lower severity and prevalence levels of psychological distress. These findings underscore both the need for structural reforms and for the implementation of evidence-based support services and interventions for ECRs.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) provide deaf individuals with access to auditory feedback from their own voice during production. This experiment investigated whether typical hearing participants can use CI simulated speech feedback for perceptual learning and sensorimotor control of speech. CI simulation was achieved via noise vocoding, a technique that degrades the spectral detail in a speech signal in a manner similar to a CI. 32 participants took part in the experiment. First, participants were tested on their recognition of noise vocoded sentences before and after a training task; either perception training, where participants listened to noise vocoded sentences while reading matching text; or production training, where participants read aloud sentences whilst hearing their own voice noise-vocoded in real-time. Both groups of participants then underwent a speech motor adaptation paradigm in which formants were perturbed in real-time noise vocoded speech auditory feedback. Both perception and production training tasks resulted in significant improvements in recognition of noise vocoded sentences, with no effect of training type. Speech motor adaptation however was not significant at the group level in response to the formant perturbations. This suggests that successful perceptual learning for degraded speech is not sufficient for successful sensorimotor learning with degraded auditory feedback.",

          "abstract": "Canonized in psychological scholarship is a specific narrative about the origins of experimental psychology. Within this narrative, Wilhelm Wundt and William James are frequently presented as dual progenitors of the experimental method. A widespread presumption is that these methods radiated from the United States and Germany outwards to other regions. However, broader evidence, drawing from the medieval Arab world and from later instantiations of laboratory psychology in Japan, China, India, and Argentina, demonstrates that experimental methods in psychology were developed and adapted for a range of contexts and purposes in other world regions. In these regions, laboratory psychology methods were marshalled to successfully effect major social and structural reform. These works are almost entirely absent from the canon of scholars associated with the birth of experimental psychology, yet their impact, like that of James and Wundt, has endured for over a century. The paper analyzes how the prevailing narrative describing the genesis of experimental psychology has been an organizing factor in the field. Recognizing a broader genealogy recognizes the accomplishments of psychological pioneers around the world, articulates the range of impacts that experimental psychology can achieve, and expands the hypothesis space of experimental psychology.",

While traditional laboratory-based eye-tracking protocols have generated a large body of findings based on well-controlled stimuli, modern methods now offer the ability to collect gaze data at much larger scale and with more naturalistic stimuli. Powerful computational tools also enable new analyses of high-dimensional data, incorporating feature annotation of the stimuli and model-based evaluation of gaze. These advances in both data collection and analysis are providing new insights into individual differences in both health and disease. Here we discuss four key approaches to modeling eye movement data: saliency-based attention phenotyping, data-driven gaze pattern identification, supervised machine learning classification, and unsupervised clustering. We highlight their advantages in psychiatry research, as they inform better understanding of visual attention, provide more fine-grained characterization of individual differences, and make more powerful clinical predictions. Finally, we address key methodological considerations in applying the methods and take stock of future opportunities on the horizon.",

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing they were of equal competence. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through selectively accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation, rather than differences in priors. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood (3- to 5-years of age) is a period marked by significant developmental changes in the brain. This development underlies age-related improvements in several domains – including language, memory, and socioemotional skills. However, assessing changes in brain structure and function during this period using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) poses several challenges. For example, difficulty remaining still, maintaining attention for long periods and non-compliance in performing behavioral responses in the scanner are particularly prevalent issues. Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques over the past decade have significantly improved success rates for pediatric neuroimaging studies. For example, shorter scan durations and real-time monitoring and correction of motion during scanning have proven especially valuable in acquiring reliable data. However, developmental researchers must still be creative in order to adequately prepare young participants for the scanning environment and, subsequently, ensure the data acquired can be used to address the questions of interest. The success of these sessions has become paramount with the onset of large, multi-site consortium studies such as the HEALthy Child and Brain Development study, which seek to track normative and atypical brain development across the first ten years of life. To this end, the current report provides a pediatric neuroimaging protocol to improve young children’s scanning experience and developmental neuroimaging data quality.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation strategies play a critical role in helping people manage stressors and maintain psychological well-being. Understanding the efficacy and boundary conditions of regulatory strategies—as they are implemented in response to stressors in daily life—is especially important for college-aged students, a population that has been experiencing chronically high levels of depression and anxiety in recent years. Here, we utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture college students’ use of multiple emotion regulation strategies in response to idiosyncratic, real-world stressors, as well as the effects of strategy use on momentary stress levels and momentary affect. Following a preregistered analytic plan, we first combined two EMA samples from Rice University and Bard College (N=159) to examine effects of strategy use on momentary affect. We also investigated the influence of factors that could interact with strategy use, namely momentary fluctuations in mental exhaustion and people’s general propensity to experience distress in the first place. Some results were consistent with our preregistered, a priori hypotheses, with rumination negatively associated with momentary affect, but use of other strategies did not significantly predict changes in momentary affect. Contrary to our predictions, efficacy of reappraisal slightly increased at higher levels of mental exhaustion. Exploratory analyses revealed that the number of adaptive strategies positively predicted momentary affect and the number of maladaptive strategies negatively predicted momentary affect. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on the variable effects of emotion regulation strategies in real-world contexts. Our findings also speak to the dynamic interplay between strategy type/tactic, situational factors, and individual characteristics to drive changes in momentary affect.",

Using large language models (LLMs), we developed an automated pipeline to detect and classify spontaneous false memories. Across two validation experiments, we demonstrate that human-AI agreement matches inter-human reliability in detecting and cataloging memory distortions. We show that false memories reflect two distinct phenomena which are driven by separable semantic factors: similarity to prototypical narrative patterns drives factual errors (distortions of actual content), whereas contextual surprise drives confabulations (entirely fabricated details). Through this combination of large-scale naturalistic data and AI-powered automation tools, we reveal memory processes that controlled laboratory paradigms cannot easily capture and illuminate the complex dynamics of human (mis)remembering in real-world contexts.",

We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

This research aimed to develop and validate standardized measures of EBJW and VBJW in English. Following item generation and selection, an initial list was administered to a US sample (n = 311). Subsequently, a refined list was administered to a second US sample (n = 276). The final measures demonstrated excellent reliabilities and strong convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. For instance, egocentric selfishness was negatively related to VBJW but not to EBJW, and VBJW explained variance in egocentric selfishness beyond what was accounted for by General Belief in a Just World. This underscores the potential of these concepts and measurements to elucidate mechanisms underlying various justice-related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a perspective grounded in critical psychiatry and decolonial epistemologies, synthesising interdisciplinary scholarship and lived experience testimony to interrogate the diagnostic construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a site of iatrogenic harm and epistemic violence. Clinical discourse commonly positions long-term therapeutic engagement as a risk factor for “dependence,” framing care recipients as the locus of complication. Rather than accepting this premise, we locate harm within systemic, relational and epistemic practices embedded in psychiatric culture. We argue that conditionality, pathologising interpretations of support needs and punitive framings of self-advocacy produce iatrogenic harm, whereas consistent and validating therapeutic relationships foster safety and autonomy. Using a decolonial theoretical lens, this work critiques the misogynistic origins of the “dependence myth” and traces how Western attachment theory has been universalised to pathologise kinship forms outside nuclear family models, particularly in Indigenous, Black, migrant and collectivist communities. We further highlight how sensory processing differences are neglected in BPD discourse despite their significant role in self-injury, suicidality and embodied distress, calling for an expanded framework beyond relational psychodynamic explanations. Diagnostic bias toward sexually and gender diverse people is examined as a continuation of psychiatry’s historic regulation of gender and sexuality through personality pathology paradigms. Ultimately, we contend that the BPD construct functions less as a neutral clinical category and more as a colonial, cisheteronormative, and neuronormative governance technology that produces pathology through stigma, epistemic control, and carceral logics. Reframing BPD as a diagnostic instrument of social regulation rather than a disorder located within individuals opens space for care grounded in relational justice, cultural flexibility, sensory attunement, human rights, and epistemic humility, rather than the castigating of Western social nonconformity and the enforcement of compliance with normative behavioural conditioning.",

This can impact the desired error rates in statistical hypothesis testing. Robust tests like the Mann–Whitney U test and robust linear regression do not rely on assumptions such as normality and equal variances. Using them can counteract non-replicated findings that are just due to data anomalies, such as extreme values and outliers, which occur differently across studies. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives. Restricting to a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids generating multiple results, thus counteracting fishing for the desired, which can occur subtly. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and many robust methods are readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what it is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

Across thematic focus, moral foundations, personal values, and emotional tone, most differentiation arose between churches, with smaller effects between denominations, and minimal variation between counties. Churches differentiated their sermons across several dimensions, including the use of high-arousal positive emotions and traditional moral values. Denominations differed in their endorsement of liberal versus conservative values and ritual content. Our findings suggest that churches and denominations differentiate their messages to serve distinct niches in America’s religious marketplace, offering new insights into the cultural dynamics of religion.",

Phase 2 (N = 918; ~9,086 responses; U.S.-only) replicated all scenarios and added four extensions: (a) a human-to-human comparison condition for every action, (b) Likert ratings (1–7) of perceived kindness alongside preferences, (c) random assignment to one of four between-subject survey versions (Robot→Human Preference; Robot→Human Likert; Human→Human Preference; Human→Human Likert), and (d) gender demographics. Across phases, results show that choices are not statistically random; clear patterns emerge at both the category and scenario levels.

          "abstract": "The decline in science interest during adolescence is a well-documented phenomenon; however, its dynamics within Latin American educational systems remain underexplored. This cross-sectional study investigates the trajectory of Attitudes Toward Science and Science Identity among 1,147 students in grades 4-8 from public and private schools. Using validated instruments, we employed linear regression models to analyze trends and Cohen’s d to pinpoint critical transition points, with analyses stratified by gender and school type. Results revealed a non-linear trajectory, characterized by a significant decline in most attitude and identity constructs during the transition to secondary school (6th-7th grade), followed by a rebound in the 8th-grade cohort. This decline was more pronounced among girls, particularly in self-efficacy and Science Identity. While both school types showed a similar decrease in Science Identity, private schools exhibited a protective effect on students' self-efficacy and perceived utility of science. Findings indicate that the attitudinal decline is not linear but concentrated in key transitions and is significantly moderated by gender and school context.",

          "authors": "Vanessa Radtke; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Self-control is essential for managing actions, yet its exertion is perceived as effortful. Performing a task may require effort not only because of its inherent difficulty but also due to its potential for inducing boredom, as boredom has been shown to be self-control demanding itself. So far, the extent of self-control demands during boredom and its temporal dynamics remain elusive. We employed a multimethod approach to address this knowledge gap. Ninety-five participants took part in an easy and hard version of the Stroop task. During both tasks, they indicated several times their perceived task difficulty, boredom, boredom-related effort, difficulty-related effort, overall effort, and fatigue. We tested whether pupil size, as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort, was predicted more accurately by difficulty- and boredom-related effort together than by task-difficulty-related effort alone. The best model fit included boredom-, difficulty-related effort, and their interactions with task type (easy, hard Stroop). Tonic pupil size increased during the easy Stroop, while phasic pupil size decreased with greater boredom-related effort in both tasks. Greater difficulty-related effort was linked to increases in tonic and phasic pupil size in the easy, but not in the hard Stroop. Finally, boredom-related effort in the Stroop predicted performance in a subsequent flanker task. Our results provide preliminary support that enduring boredom may not only be perceived as effortful but also be reflected in psychophysiological changes. Moreover, it may influence subsequent behavior. This underscores the importance of considering boredom as a potential confound in self-control research and broader study designs.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., “Limited Prosocial Emotions”) characterize a particularly severe group of antisocial youth. “Secondary” CU traits, as opposed to “primary,” are distinguished by co-occurring anxiety and are theorized to reflect an acquired phenotype that develops through an interaction between heightened emotional sensitivity and prolonged adversity exposure. The aim of this study was to test this pathway in a large, diverse sample spanning late childhood (age 9-10) to middle adolescence. Methods. Data were drawn from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, with youth (N = 11, 880; Mage = 10; 48% female) assessed annually over five timepoints. Retrospective and prospective analyses examined the effects of emotional sensitivity and different forms of adversity on the development of CU traits. Results. Retrospective analyses showed no main or interactive effects of emotional sensitivity and adversity during late childhood in predicting secondary CU traits by adolescence. Instead, a significant interaction (B = .21, SE = .06, p &lt; .001, RRR = 1.24) was found such that higher overall adversity and emotional sensitivity together increased risk for primary, not secondary, CU traits. Prospective analyses among emotionally sensitive (≥90th percentile) youth with no CU traits (n = 365, age ~10) similarly showed no forms of cumulative adversity predicted increases in or the onset of “elevated” CU traits after four years. Conclusions. Findings did not support a distinct adversity-linked pathway to secondary CU traits via emotional sensitivity. Instead, results were consistent with alternative models in which secondary CU traits reflect a comorbid profile marked by broader clinical severity or overlapping liabilities (e.g., negative affectivity, internalizing risk).",

          "abstract": "Clothing size labels have been shown to influence women's mood, self-esteem, and body satisfaction. This study examined the effects of different sizing nomenclatures—specifically color-based versus category-based labeling—on women's body satisfaction, weight concerns, feelings of fatness, and mood. Participants attended a lab-based session in which their body measurements were taken, and size feedback was provided according to their assigned labeling condition. State mood, feeling fat, weight concern, and body dissatisfaction were measured at three time points: before measurement, after measurement, and after receiving feedback. Contrary to expectations, the results showed no significant changes across time points, nor any interactions between labeling conditions and time. These findings challenge previous research linking clothing size feedback to women's body image and emotional well-being, suggesting that the format of size labeling may not meaningfully affect body image outcomes. While some participants expressed a desire to reform the current sizing system, many remained indifferent to the nomenclature used.\nFuture research should explore other aspects of clothing experiences, such as fit, garment type, and shopping context—to better capture the complex relationship between clothing and women's body image and mood.",

The model achieves stable synchronization with parameters λ = 0.9 and G = 0.015, suggesting that long-range field effects may complement local synaptic connectivity in enabling large-scale neural integration.

Participants completed the task either alone or in groups of five with different types of social information and resource speeds. Contrasting earlier work, participants in groups outperformed solitary individuals, but only when payoff information was available. High-resolution visual field data and movement trajectories revealed that payoff visibility prompted adaptive recalibration of visual information flow, thereby enabling flexible adaptation. Computational models of fine-grained movement decisions and agent-based simulations showed that payoff information let participants dynamically identify and selectively respond to reliable social cues, thus unlocking the group's collective potential.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how acceptance, rejection, and repetition of social feedback shape implicit physiological responses and subjective stress evaluations in a naturalistic, fictional setting. Thirty-nine student teachers performed dyadic “Yes, And” (acceptance) and “Yes, But” (rejection) theatre improvisation exercises while heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin conductance responses (SCR), facial muscle activity (zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii), and electrocortical activity indexed by frontal alpha asymmetry (FAAS), as well as self-reported stress were recorded. Across all improvised dialogue exercises, transient HR deceleration indicated a robust orienting response, while rejection elicited anticipatory HR slowing before stimulus onset, suggesting threat-related preparation. Zygomaticus major activity was higher in acceptance than rejection. Zygomaticus major activity, pre-stimulus HR, and self-reported stress decreased with repeated exercise.  Together, the findings of this psychophysiological investigation of the “Yes, And” principle of theatre improvisation demonstrated that fictional social interactions evoke psychophysiological responses, and that repeated exposure of improvisation exercises can partially attenuate them. These findings contribute to improvisation pedagogy and experimental paradigms in social neuroscience, and may also be applied to therapeutic applications by mapping how social encounters modulate embodied responses and self-reported stress in a fictional, psychologically safe context.",

          "abstract": "Visual memory and visual imagery are closely intertwined cognitive functions, yet whether visual memory necessarily deteriorates when visual imagery is impaired remains unresolved. Aphantasia, the inability to voluntarily generate mental images, provides a compelling model to address this issue. However, previous reports of preserved or subtle deficits in aphantasia may have stemmed from tasks with low cognitive demands, coarse measures, and memory content lacking fine-grained demands, thereby limiting sensitivity to genuine impairments. Using high-load paradigms and continuous precision measures with mixture modelling, we tested colour memory, a domain requiring fine-grained representation, to examine whether these conditions would reveal pronounced impairments in aphantasia. Experiment 1 (20 aphantasic, 20 controls) tested colour memory for six sets of 20 objects (15 meaningful, 5 meaningless). Meaningless objects were included to further minimise verbal labelling. All object colours were sampled from the Hue–Saturation–Value (HSV) space, a perceptually uniform colour space. Recall was assessed using a continuous colour wheel, and performance was analysed with a computational mixture model that decomposed response errors into retrieval success (whether a colour was retrieved) and precision (how accurately it was remembered). Results revealed that aphantasic individuals showed markedly larger errors than controls, driven by reduced retrieval success rather than precision. Moreover, error magnitude and retrieval success correlated with several imagery dimensions (e.g., object imagery, spontaneous use of imagery), whereas retrieval precision was not. Experiment 2 (18 aphantasic, 20 controls) further tested whether deficits extend beyond colour using an analogous size-memory task with a slider. No group differences were observed in size error, retrieval success, or precision, and no correlations were observed between memory and several imagery-related aspects. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that visual imagery is indispensable for retrieval success but not for precision when accessing visual memory traces for object colour, and that this indispensability may not extend to all object features.",

          "abstract": "We tested whether the acquisition of specific elements of knowledge in a climate crisis class related to real-world collective action. We studied undergraduate participants (N = 133) in a climate crisis class (intervention condition) and participants not enrolled in the class (control condition). All were required to answer questions about their knowledge at two time points (separated by nine weeks), while we measured real-world collective action in the intervention condition through the 9 weeks as well as several self-reported beliefs. First, as preregistered, we found that some knowledge items as well as self-reported collective efficacy increased significantly for the intervention compared to control participants. Second, in the intervention group itself, and contrary to our preregistration, there were no significant relationships between knowledge / belief elements and real-world collective action, even though many participants engaged in substantial action. These results raise questions about how analytic knowledge of the climate and ecological predicament is measured, and how it is taught. They also point to the need for research of this kind to also measure how non-analytic elements, such as group dynamics, drive collective action participation. Finally, the study pioneers new methods for measuring real-world collective action in a class setting that goes beyond typical studies of hypothetical intentions to act.",

The scale showed face, content, convergent, and criterion-related validity and was internally reliable.

A sample of young adults (n=144) spanning the social dysfunction spectrum completed measures that capture different forms of psychopathology relevant to social dysfunction, from which two dimensions – namely Social Negative Affect (SNA) and Social Disengagement (SD) – were extracted using Principal Components Analysis. Participants additionally completed a variety of clinician-rated and self-reported social functioning measures that were aggregated into one overall social functioning score. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the unique contribution of SNA and SD and their interaction on overall social functioning. SNA and SD explained unique variance (Δr2=46.3%), indicating that elevated SNA and SD levels predicted worse social functioning. The SNA-by-SD interaction was positive and explained significant additional amounts of variance (Δr2=2.9%), indicating a less-than-additive effect on social dysfunction. These effects remained significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. The findings suggest that examining social behaviors and affect simultaneously is important for understanding social functional outcomes in clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I) is designed to alter interpretation biases (IBs) and may have potential for reducing stress reactivity in individuals with social anxiety. However, evidence for such transfer effects remains inconsistent and largely restricted to specific cognitive or self-report outcomes. Physiological responses, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and salivary cortisol, have received disproportionately limited attention in CBM-I research, despite their relevance to the social anxiety symptom spectrum. Moreover, previous studies have rarely employed comprehensive experimental designs that directly compare positive, negative, and control training conditions. To address these gaps, the present study compared the effects of three CBM-I training conditions (positive, negative, neutral) on changes in IBs and on self-reported and physiological responses to a standardized laboratory stressor (anagram task). The sample included N = 87 individuals with moderate levels of social anxiety. Results showed that CBM-I successfully modified IB in a condition-congruent direction. However, stress-related outcomes changed similarly over time across all conditions. Self-reported stress and heart rate increased, whereas heart rate variability decreased. Cortisol levels remained unchanged. These findings suggest that although CBM-I can modify IB, such changes may not readily translate into reduced acute stress reactivity. Factors such as training intensity, alignment between training and stressor, and the sensitivity of stress markers may moderate this transfer. Future research should refine CBM-I protocols and measurement approaches to better elucidate the mechanisms linking cognitive change with stress physiology.",

Yet despite their influence, these frameworks remain largely verbal and underspecified, limiting their capacity for falsifiable predictions. Here, we introduce a set of computational models that formalise key dual-process assumptions within an evidence-accumulation framework. Each model instantiates distinct mechanisms of working memory, inhibition, and confidence-based regulation and is evaluated against data from two-response bat-and-ball reasoning tasks. Six model variants—ranging from single-process “default” to confidence-regulated architectures—were compared using indices of accuracy, response time, and confidence. All models reproduced core reasoning signatures, but even the simplest captured many qualitative patterns, revealing that common verbal assumptions can be implemented by multiple mechanistic architectures. These findings underscore that while dual-process theories capture essential intuitions about intuitive–analytic dynamics, they remain underdetermined without formal specification. Computational modelling provides the necessary precision to advance dual-process theory from a descriptive dichotomy toward mechanistic explanation.",

Foraging tasks, during which participants visit contexts with diminishing reward rates, examine this type of decision-making by measuring when individuals choose to switch contexts. It is widely known that humans and other animals perform suboptimally in these tasks. However, the precise nature of this suboptimality, and its links to other behaviourally relevant traits, remain unclear. Here, we developed a foraging task to disambiguate the impacts of initial reward rates and reward rate changes. We investigated how foraging behaviour differs with age and relates to apathy and depression, which are key factors known to influence reward-based decision-making, while controlling for cognitive factors. In addition to overstaying, we found that participants performed more suboptimally as reward decay rate increased, and that many participants expressed a heuristic preference for staying in the single best condition. Moreover, overstaying was strongly associated with higher scaling of stay durations to each condition, and this overstaying/scaling behaviour was positively associated with age but negatively associated with depressive symptoms. No associations were found between foraging behaviour and apathy. Together, our results suggest that people may counterproductively interpret staying in a patch as persistence in reward extraction, which would explain the tight link between overstaying but high sensitivity to reward conditions, and their association with depressive symptoms.",

From the third trimester fetuses perceive sounds already influencing the fetal brain. \nAim: The study investigates how the length of intrauterine language exposure, indexed by gestational age (GA), and overall maturation, indexed by birth weight (BW), affect newborns’ brain activations to linguistic stimuli.\nApproach: Data from 14 near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies testing responses to different auditory sound patterns in 192 1-4-day-old newborns were pooled together and analyzed to assess the impact of GA and BW on changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR).\nResults: Results showed that, for HbO, activations in both considered conditions were larger in the Temporal than in the Frontal areas, irrespective of BW or GA. For HbR, increased BW led to more positive, thus less strong, activations in the frontal and more negative, thus stronger, activations in the temporal regions of the left hemisphere, while in the right hemisphere the opposite pattern was observed. Besides, when considering effect sizes reflecting discrimination abilities, these were more strongly associated with BW in the frontal regions, while in the temporal regions they were more strongly associated to GA. Critically, HbR was overall more strongly correlated with prenatal experience and maturation than HbO, challenging the exclusive use of HbO in newborn studies.\nConclusions: The findings suggest a differential impact of BW and GA on brain activations, reflecting their roles in biological maturation and auditory discrimination, respectively. Overall, the study suggests that both the length of prenatal experience and maturation play significant roles in shaping newborns’ hemodynamic responses.",

In experiments, data are from trials which are nested in conditions, tasks, and individuals. Data at the trial level is quite noisy, so much so that even averages on critical contrasts are subject to excessive measurement error. In this paper, we develop hierarchical factor models where the first level are linear models that account for trial noise and are parameterized with separate, latent individual-by-task scores. The second level consists of factor models on latent individual-by-task scores. Because the model is hierarchical, Bayesian analysis is convenient and conceptually straightforward. We provide development with good computational properties. The advatages of the model are that (a) correlations across tasks may be both disattenuated and localized fairly precisely; (b) uncertainty from both variability in individuals and across trials may be accurately assessed; and (c) factor structures may be recovered even in high-measurement-error contexts.

We discuss theoretical and statistical concerns with controlling for baseline SLEs when predicting subsequent (in)dependent stress. First, (in)dependent stress is a composite formative construct comprised of completely different SLEs aggregated at each assessment wave, such that the formative latent construct is fundamentally different at each time point. Second, temporal precedence of psychopathology relative to SLEs is already established during assessment via careful dating of stressor onsets. Third, given that SLEs are discrete, time-limited experiences, temporal continuity of SLEs cannot be assumed or, in the case of independent stressors, is actively precluded. Fourth, partialing out variance shared among SLEs over time is problematic because shared variance potentially underlies the direct stress generation effect, or moderating effects that are critical for examining group differences. With limited exceptions, controlling for baseline SLEs is not recommended. Future stress generation research will benefit from the use of statistical approaches that are aligned with this more precise conceptualization of (in)dependent stress as a formative variable.",

          "abstract": "Measuring the processes that influence eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—is essential for understanding and fostering it effectively in applied contexts.  Using the Situated Assessment Method, we conducted a pre-registered study where 251 UK adults judged their eustress across 20 previously evaluated real-life challenging situations (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”), along with nine influential processes (e.g., coping, fulfilment) taken from the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).  Participants also completed trait-level measures for eustress, distress, and stress mindsets.  We observed reliable individual differences, substantial situation effects, and large individual-situation interactions in eustress judgments.  The nine influential processes correlated strongly with situated eustress, explaining a median variance of 83% in individual-level regressions.  Individual measures of eustress, averaged across situations, correlated with trait eustress and stress-is-enhancing mindsets but were unrelated to trait distress.  Exploratory factor analyses on situational and trait-level processes revealed a dominant general factor that strongly correlated with individuals’ eustress judgments.  Our findings align with existing theories of stress, contrast different types of eustress measurement, and provide rich descriptive profiles for personalized and context-sensitive interventions to foster eustress when desirable.",

There is a critical need to appraise the evidence supporting these programs, particularly whether they benefit students in crisis intervention and prevention. This need is particularly urgent given documented misapplication and overuse of physical restraint, which is a common component of these programs. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the research in support of crisis management programs that target PK-12 students with disabilities who display challenging behavior in educational settings. We conducted database searches, ancestral searches, and website searches of organizations that produce crisis management programs to identify published and unpublished studies evaluating the programs. Our search process yielded just six studies evaluating five of 23 commercially available crisis management programs. Given the scarcity of supporting studies, none of the programs meet currently established thresholds for evidence-based practice in special education. Our review identifies a critical need for rigorous research on these programs to inform practice and policy, ensuring student safety and wellbeing. Consumers should exercise caution in adopting these programs based on claims made by the programs’ producers.",

However, across literatures, effort-performance relationships seem to be less straightforward than they initially appear, highlighting instances under which effort and performance can become decoupled. Here, we review four broad factors that contribute to apparent decoupling: (1) system limits, (2) inefficiency and noise, (3) measurement mismatches, and (4) motivational misdirection. We show how these factors can underlie instances of concurrent decoupling (real-time) and prospective decoupling (over time) in the cognitive, as well as in the physical domain. By framing these factors ontologically as structural, stochastic, epistemic, and psychological sources of decoupling, we identify commonalities in effort-performance relationships across research fields. We highlight how they can account for apparent non-linearities, trade-offs, and plateaus in the effort-performance relationship. This perspective can serve as a transdisciplinary agenda for studying effort–performance dynamics, helping researchers and practitioners to better understand effort-performance (de)coupling.",

Across three experiments, we gave U.S. Democrat and Republican voters (N=5,230) a chance to lie anonymously to double their own or another participant’s earnings. For selfish dishonesty (Experiment 1), people lied equally to benefit themselves regardless of whether it harmed an in-group or out-group member. For coalitional dishonesty (Experiment 2), however, people lied significantly more to benefit in-group than out-group members (9 percentage-points), despite not personally benefiting from lying. Experiment 3 successfully replicated these findings, and revealed that people overestimated out-group dishonesty more than in-group dishonesty. In conclusion, intergroup coalitional dishonesty drives moral decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Children are remarkably efficient learners compared to our most advanced computational models of learning. One key difference is that children seem to leverage regularities in the activities (e.g., eating) in which they participate to learn about words or objects (e.g., “pomegranate”), even under skewed, long-tailed distributions. While everyday activities have long been theorized to be important as supports for children’s learning, our understanding of the types, frequencies, and rhythms of these activities has been out of reach due to both a lack of naturalistic video datasets and the necessity for manual annotations. Here, we use the recent release of a large, egocentric dataset of children’s everyday experience (BabyView) (N=31 children, N=868 hours) and capitalize on innovations in video question-answering (VideoQA) models to quantify the what and where of children’s everyday experiences. Using these models, we classify both the activities (e.g., eating, dancing, exploring) and physical locations (e.g., living room, garage) in the infant view and generate natural-language descriptions for contiguous 10-second videos across the entire dataset. Notably, we find that (a) some activities and locations occur much more frequently than others, yet (b) there is wide variation across children. Moreover, (c) activities and locations exhibit structured transition probabilities (e.g., cooking often precedes eating), and (d) may decompose into distinct sub-clusters (e.g., different subtypes of reading). Compared with prior work analyzing static image content, our work highlights the advances possible by using VideoQA models to analyze the dynamic nature of children’s experiences. Our results provide a better understanding of children’s learning input in everyday contexts, informing developmentally-inspired models of early learning and cognitive development.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing concern about climate change, current action remains insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Psychological research finds that publics often overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact individual climate actions (e.g., recycling) and underestimate high-impact behaviours (e.g., flying less). However, the prevalence of these misjudgements among climate-concerned individuals and their connection to behaviour remain unclear. Developing this understanding is crucial, as such misperceptions could cause motivated individuals to prioritize low-impact climate actions over high-impact behaviours, limiting societal potential to mitigate climate change. Using one study in the UK (N = 294) and two studies in the USA (N = 790 and N = 406), we find that even climate-concerned individuals systematically overestimate the impacts of low-impact actions and underestimate high-impact actions, with consistently moderate to large effect sizes across all behaviours examined. We also find an association between perceived impact of climate actions and behavioural engagement, suggesting that such misperceptions hinder efforts to reduce climate change. We explore several explanations for these misperceptions. We find that most of the dominant causes proposed in the literature do not explain participants’ misperceptions of impact. We do, however, find some evidence suggesting that misinformation about specific behaviours, false conceptualisations of the causes of climate change, familiarity with pro-climate behaviours, and the perception that climate action is driven by self-serving intentions are related to misperceptions of the impacts of climate actions among those most concerned about climate change.",

          "abstract": "Everyday stressor exposure is a dynamic, high-risk event that increases the likelihood of smoking lapses. Stressor diversity quantifies between-person differences in how everyday stressors are dispersed across multiple domains (e.g., financial stressors, health stressors). There are two competing perspectives on the implications of stressor diversity for how affect and behavior respond to stressor exposure (i.e., stressor reactivity). A chronicity of stressor perspective predicts that low stressor diversity would be associated with higher stressor reactivity. By contrast, an uncertainty of stressor perspective predicts that high stressor diversity would be associated with higher stressor reactivity. Using ecological momentary assessment data in 171 individuals who smoke cigarettes daily (mean age = 49.43, SD = 11.22; 59.6% women; 64.3% Black/African American), we tested the extent to which stressor diversity moderated the within-person associations between stressor exposure and negative affect, craving, and smoking. Results indicated that stressor-reactivity was greater for those with higher levels of stressor diversity. These findings support the uncertainty of stressors perspective on stressor diversity, suggesting that individuals with higher stressor diversity will have greater stressor-reactivity and struggle to proactively cope with stressors because of the unpredictable nature about which stressor will emerge next.",

Drawing on longitudinal data (n = 222) collected in the US at eight time periods over the first eight years of life, we present a snapshot of the intergenerational evolved nest: a model of species-normal childhood experiences and wellbeing across two generations. Maternal early life experiences of nested care were associated with equivalent experiences for their children from age four to six, as well as multiple measures of maternal wellbeing, including attachment, depression, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and stress. Maternal wellbeing correlated with child wellbeing and evolved nest experience. Child evolved nest experience was linked with lower anxiety and greater social engagement from age four to eight. Our findings highlight the critical importance of providing nested care for the wellbeing of today’s children, who are tomorrow’s parents, and therefore the potential long-term benefits of the intergenerational evolved nest.",

The challenge of AI alignment is thus an interdisciplinary one that involves not only a technical challenge for computer science but one with important ties to the psychology of moral values, decision-making, and trust. Early work identified a static set of universal values, without considering the key questions of to whom and to which values AI should be aligned. This perspective paper challenges the notion of universal alignment and instead argues for dynamic, context-specific alignability across different domains, tasks, and users. Specifically, we emphasize the need to go beyond traditional pluralism and rethink how AI alignment can be achieved through a qualitative and quantitative research process that involves identifying context-specific values, developing alignable AI algorithms using limited human feedback, and evaluating alignment through assessing both an AI’s values and actions, while considering how humans trust and delegate to the AI. We discuss several paths forward for our proposed framework, including the potential ethical and societal implications of context-specific alignability, and draw on examples ranging from chatbots to value-aligned decision-making in the medical triage domain.",

          "abstract": "Mental health and wellbeing are core components of a healthy life. However, emotional stress and mental health problems are on the rise through societies and cause a significant burden of suffering. In the following, we present our watershed framework for optimizing wellbeing and mental health through lifestyle interventions. Emerging evidence also shows that mental health is not only a determinant of quality of life but a powerful driver of longevity, influencing biological aging processes, disease vulnerability, and overall healthspan. This framework is based on the recognition that mental health is comprised of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that the factors have interdependent relationships amongst them, so that positive changes in one of them can have cascading effects on the others, with the potential to improve the psychological capital of an individual. Our framework consists on nine elements that we consider as hallmarks of mental health and wellbeing, and these hallmarks are structured in three interdependent layers. The first layer is formed by foundational factors which are fundamental for wellbeing and mental health, and include circadian rhythms; sleep recovery along with social connections. The second layer is named wellbeing catalysts and includes elements of wellbeing that can have powerful positive effects on mental health, and include stress resilience, vitality, cardiovascular health, immune health, and the gut-brain axis. The third layer is named as thriving factors and it consists of cognitive performance and positive emotions, which are the elements that are most often associated with a thriving mind. In our framework, we highlight the interactions between the factors and we provide a roadmap to structure comprehensive lifestyle interventions aimed at boosting mental health and wellbeing. Strengthening mental health and wellbeing addresses key biological and behavioral determinants of healthy aging, which are increasingly recognized as critical modulators of longevity trajectories.",

Participants filled out questionnaires, completed interpretation bias tasks, and underwent neuro-psychophysiological assessments. Active CBM-I trained positive resolutions of ambiguous social scenarios, while the sham version used neutral scenarios.\nThe primary outcome, i.e., scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), decreased across time in both groups, without group differences. The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation decreased only in the active group. Interpretation bias shifted more strongly toward positive outcomes in the active group. Autonomic measures confirmed sensitivity to stress induction but did not differentiate between conditions. Electrophysiological results paralleled subjective ratings, as participants exhibited ambivalent responses to socially relevant stimuli but clearly differentiated responses toward neutral stimuli. Baseline correlations indicated strong convergence across self-report and interpretation tasks. Mediation analyses showed that reductions in negative interpretations mediated the effect of the training group on LSAS scores at follow-up.\nThese findings identify interpretation bias as a modifiable mechanism underlying social anxiety and underscore its role as a transdiagnostic marker.

          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal (CR) is one of the most widely studied emotion regulation strategies and is considered central to psychological well-being. Given its protective role in mental health, a growing body of research has examined factors that influence the effectiveness of CR. However, prior studies have been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, typically relying on artificial or experimentally induced stressors, which may limit ecological validity of the findings. The present study aimed to address this gap by investigating CR in the context of real-world stressors. We recruited 100 young adults who used a mobile application, ReApp, to record their daily stressors and practice CR three times per day, over a three-week period. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of CR is highly context-dependent, and certain aspects may be more relevant and contributing to CR effectiveness than the other. Specifically, higher positive affect and greater stressor severity were associated with more effective CR. By contrast, higher negative affect and lower reappraisal affordance predicted reduced CR effectiveness. We provide the first evidence that CR effectiveness varies across stressor domains, suggesting it may be better suited to some types of real-world stressors (i.e., health-related stressors) than others (i.e., lack of resources). In contrast, neither subjective stress nor the time spent on generating reappraisals influenced CR effectiveness. Being the first outside-laboratory study examining contextual factors contributing to CR effectiveness, these results carry clinical implications, suggesting that CR trainings may be optimized by adjusting practice to specific contextual factors, and warrant the need for further research.",

          "abstract": "A variety of difficult situations can elicit stress responses, yet little research has systematically characterized the features that make situations threatening and challenging.  In a pre-registered study, we developed a normed set of situations and established features associated with threat and challenge.  Using an open-source large language model (LLM), we first generated 20 situations that represent common stressors for UK adults (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”).  We then asked 81 UK adults to evaluate each situation on dimensions of threat, challenge and eight theory-derived features (e.g., intrinsic difficulty), aggregating their judgments into a 10-dimensional feature profile for each situation.  We also tested whether an open-source LLM could reproduce human feature profiles and feature relationships.  In the human data, we observed highly reliable feature profiles for the situations that exhibited low threat and moderate challenge overall, while varying reasonably.  The eight features were surprisingly similar in how they correlated with threat and challenge (as opposed to exhibiting inverse patterns), explaining high variance in each.  Unsupervised clustering identified four coherent groups of situations that illustrate different ways threat and challenge can manifest in daily life.  Although LLM judgments approximated human judgments at the aggregate level, their accuracy varied substantially across situations and measures such that LLM judgments failed to capture structural relationships observed in the human data.  These findings advance our understanding of situational features underlying threat and challenge, while illustrating the potential and current limitations of LLMs as tools for psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Person-environment fit has been a subject of interest in personality psychology. In recent years, remote work has emerged as important workplace environment. This study examines the association between remote vs. in-person work and well-being, and how personality, age, and other socio-demographic factors moderate these associations. Over one month, 560 participants, who engage in both remote and in-person work, completed a daily diary. Using multi-level models, we examined intra-individual well-being differences between home and workplace days. Participants reported better mood, but greater loneliness on home-office vs. workplace days, while satisfaction levels were similar. HEXACO traits and socio-demographics accounted for some individual differences in well-being. Higher emotionality amplified loneliness on home-office days compared to workplace days. Age did not moderate well-being differences. Overall, findings indicate that work environments (remote vs. office) are related to within-individual well-being differences. Personality traits and socio-demographic characteristics, aside from living with children and working hours, played a limited role. These results suggest that well-being differences across working locations are generalizable across a large age range, different personality characteristics, and socio-demographic groups.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: In spite of Vocational Education Training (VET) being a significant part of French \neducational system, this educational track is considered as less prestigious compared to general \neducation. This negative perception of VET could lead to a number of emotional problems in \n2\nstudents in these schools, including higher anxiety, and lower wellbeing and self-esteem. The \ncurrent study applied network analysis to map the complex links among various anxiety-related \ntraits in four large samples of VET students, thereby identifying targets for potential educational \ninterventions. \nMethods: 28 questionnaires tapping into anxiety-related psychological constructs, such as self￾esteem, parental beliefs and school adaptation, were completed by 4 groups of VET students aged \nfrom 15 to over 20 (mode: 16). The sample included 3069 females in ASSP schools (nursing and \ncaring); 2108 females and 1772 males in Commerce schools (sales and management); and 2262 \nmales in MELEC schools (electricity and maintenance). We used Gaussian Graphical models \n(GGMs) that allow to build sparce models of links among multiple variables and detect targets for \ninterventions via identification of the most central nodes.\nResults: Our findings replicated gender differences shown for investigated constructs in previous \nstudies (Cohen’s d from 0.06 to 0.7): males showed higher self-esteem and math grades, whereas\nfemales reported higher anxiety and error sensitivity but stronger endorsement of mastery approach \nachievement goals. GGMs showed some differences in network structure, including in centrality \nindices and clusters of nodes for males and females. The most central nodes were self-reported \nmath competence for females in ASSP group, self-regulation for females in Commerce, and \nmastery approach goals for males in both MELEC and Commerce groups.\nDiscussion: The results obtained with GGMs could be used to plan further translational research \nas they allow to formulate hypotheses regarding chains of connections among multiple traits and \npotential transfer effects of educational interventions in males and females with different \neducational majors.",

          "abstract": "Recent research has aimed both to disentangle the cognitive mechanisms that support learning—particularly the roles of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM)—and to characterize the dynamic processes that govern decision-making during learning. These two endeavors were integrated with the reinforcement learning working memory Linear Ballistic Accumulator (RLWM-LBA) model. \nThe RLWM-LBA offers a unified framework to investigate how RL and WM contribute to learning and how these processes unfold over time to shape choice behavior. Specifically, it remains unclear whether neural processes of evidence accumulation identified in perceptual decision-making are also present in learning and how such a process is associated with RL and WM. \nTo address these questions, we analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data from 510 participants performing a stimulus-response association task. Using a Bayesian hierarchical RLWM-LBA model combined with event-related potential (ERP) analyses, we explored whether neural signatures of RL and WM persist when captured with RLWM-LBA model and whether a neural signal of evidence accumulation, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), could be identified within this learning context.\nOur findings confirm previous reports by identifying distinct neural correlates for RL and WM. Importantly, we demonstrate a neural signature corresponding to internal uncertainty about learned action policies that closely resembles CPP signals documented in perceptual and preference-based decisions. These results provide robust evidence that the neural dynamics of decision-making during learning adhere to established evidence accumulation mechanisms and highlight how RL and WM processes dynamically shape learning and choice behavior.",

          "abstract": "Facial trustworthiness impressions influence important social decisions, including economic choices, decisions to hire and criminal justice outcomes. Most research has focused on the face attributes associated with various impressions, implicitly regarding these impressions as stable over time. However, our perception is dynamically shaped by past visual experience through two opposite serial effects: negative aftereffects (bias away from the past) and serial dependence (bias towards the past). Here, we investigated how first impressions of trustworthiness are biased by our past visual experience.  Specifically, we tested how basic stimulus properties such as exposure duration to previous face, feature similarity, and spatial proximity to previous faces determine the direction and strength of the biases. \nWe found that (1) exposure duration determined the direction of the bias with negative aftereffects following prolonged adaptor exposure and (positive) serial dependence after brief adaptor exposure. Furthermore, (2) increased identity similarity between previous and current faces enhanced attractive biases, whereas different identities led to repulsion. Finally, (3) relative spatial distance in world-centre coordinates between adaptor and test faces modulated the strength of serial dependence but not negative aftereffects. \nOur paradigm enabled us to provide evidence for, and to dissociate, attractive and repulsive serial biases in trustworthiness impressions. Our findings demonstrate the specific conditions under which these impressions can be dynamically shaped by past experience, depending on time, space, and feature similarity. Importantly, the fact that serial effects are determined by basic stimulus properties of time, space, and feature similarity indicates that these biases cannot be entirely explained by high-level factors such as decision or memory.",

          "abstract": "Psychological assessments play a significant role in both clinical decision-making and the interpretation of research findings, with the quality of these inferences depending on the validity of the measures used. Recent evidence suggests there are gender differences in the presentation of autism, raising concerns about the validity of existing autism tools to measure autistic traits in women and the subsequent implications for clinical inferences and research. This study explored the perspectives of autistic women on the relevance of existing autism questionnaires to their lived experience, alongside additional input from gender-diverse individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB). Through interviews, focus groups, and online surveys, 22 autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals shared their experiences using and perspectives on the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, 14-item Ritvo Autism &amp; Asperger Diagnostic Scale, and Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. The interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, identifying two overarching themes: (1) questionnaires measure only one way to be autistic, and not in an autism-friendly manner, and (2) enhancing questionnaires’ relevance for autistic women and individuals socialised as female: key missing experiences to include. The findings suggest that some of the most frequently used autism measures may not fully capture the experiences of autistic women and AFAB gender diverse individuals. Significant gaps were identified, indicating that important aspects of the participants’ lived experiences were missing. Furthermore, concerns were raised about the questionnaires’ lack of relevance to the autistic population as a whole. The findings underscore the non-satisfactory content validity of these tools for measuring autism in autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals. This highlights the need for their refinement to better reflect contemporary understandings of different presentations of autistic traits, particularly the impact of gendered experiences, in a way that avoids the introduction of possible new biases and remains relevant and accessible to autistic individuals.",

Three main factors emerged: partners’ uncertainty, relationship uncertainty and behavioral ambiguity.

During the FLCP, participants completed a modified auditory n-back task every 10 minutes and were concurrently required to avoid obstacles in the OBS condition.\nResults When corrected for movement speed, participants on average failed to avoid between 5.3% and 8.1% of obstacles over the 210s period. Concurrently, during the OBS condition, a reduction in working memory performance of 7.0-15.1% was observed across the FLCP (p &lt; 0.001, ω² = 0.207). On average, the OBS condition elicited greater Rating Scale of Mental Effort scores than the CON condition (p=0.019, ω2 = 0.155).\nConclusion We have demonstrated how dual-tasking can lead to significant and less favourable changes in performance parameters (decreased auditory working memory performance, obstacles hit, increase in mental effort, and likely increase in physical workrate).\nApplication We encourage researchers and practitioners to consider representative design when translating research to practice. Personnel within physically demanding occupations should consider ways to minimise dual-tasking within their roles or mitigation strategies to maintain cognitive performance.",

Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly. However, the research also shows how empowering positive healthcare interactions can be, and a number of participants engaged in menstrual activism by resisting menstrual taboo. By highlighting the experiences of young women in menstrual health communication, this research contributes to our understanding of the pervasive impact of menstrual stigma and patriarchal norms of femininity, while shedding light on the potential to harness change through supportive healthcare interactions and everyday menstrual activism.",

          "abstract": "Background: Using substances before the age of 15 is a key risk for requiring substance use treatment later in life. The school and neighbourhood contexts may be important for adolescent substance use. Identifying contexts and factors associated with substance use among adolescents is therefore a public health priority.\n\nMethods: We investigated current vaping, smoking, alcohol consumption, and illicit drug use, in 30,920 adolescents aged 12-15 attending 100 schools and living across 1,539 neighbourhoods in South-East England. Cross-classified multi-level models were used to evaluate the relative importance of school and neighbourhood contexts, before investigating determinants of substance use. Previous (more than 30 days ago) use was assessed in sensitivity analyses.\n\nResults: The school-only context yielded the best model fit and predicted the most variance across substances (ICC range 6% to 8.4%). Several patterns pertaining to inequalities in substance use emerged (e.g., increased age associated with amplified odds of any substance use, particularly illicit drugs, although the magnitude and direction of associations varied by substance and subgroup. Findings emphasised the importance of peer relationships (e.g., peer pressure, bullying) and coping motives (e.g., internalising symptoms) as potential risk factors for vaping, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Strong parental and teacher relationships and school-based factors (e.g., strong sense of school belonging), were protective against all substances. \n\nConclusion: Differences between schools matter more than differences between neighbourhoods for adolescent substance use, and indeed, neighbourhood-only models likely overestimate the importance of this developmental context. Preventive efforts should target modifiable determinants including peer pressure and relationships with staff.",

In this paper we use the term mental health as an overarching construct, defined here as encompassing both cognitive performance and affective wellbeing, explored in relation to environmental factors. Evidence across neuroscience, psychology, physiology, and public health shows that spatial properties of our environment can modulate stress physiology, affect, attention, memory, and social cognition. Yet, no standardised instrument translates these multisensory dynamics into measures that quantify environmental qualities, enabling linking them to context-specific outcomes. Certification schemes (e.g., WELL, LEED, BREEAM) have advanced practice, but do not directly measure how specific spatial or contextual features impact psychology or physiology. Here, we introduce the NeuroDesign/NeuroArchitecture Index (NDIX), a theoretically grounded framework for evaluating how the built environment impacts mental health. The NDIX operationalises six domains; safety and accessibility, cognitive capacity, offering possibilities for sensory experiences, emotional states, social experiences, and naturalness. It integrates a domain-referenced self-report of user experience with standardised profiling of environmental features, generating domain specific and overall percentage scores for research and practice. The first pilot in a controlled indoor environment showed feasibility and theory-consistent sensitivity, providing initial support for the NDIX framework. Future research will extend validation across office, educational, and urban contexts and incorporate biomarkers (e.g. from wearables, neuroimaging).",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation involves integrating multiple spatial cues, yet the role of feedback in this process remains poorly understood. We examined how corrective feedback affects spatial navigation using landmarks and self-motion cues. Participants performed a spatial localization task under four conditions: landmark-only, self-motion-only, combination (both cues available), and conflict (cues incongruent). Behaviorally, feedback in single-cue conditions reduced response bias and decreased the weight assigned to landmarks, without affecting response variability. Feedback in the combination condition reduced response bias in that condition but induced no other changes. Cognitive modeling revealed that feedback in single-cue conditions reduced sensory biases, which, however, did not translate to greater cue integration. This feedback also reduced the weight assigned to landmarks in different-cause judgments, aligning cue weighting with the maximum-likelihood-estimation principle. This adjustment was accompanied by altered subjective evaluation of cue reliability. Collectively, our findings suggest that rather than enhancing sensory precision or cue integration, corrective feedback shapes spatial cue integration through recalibration mechanisms at multiple levels: aligning perceived spatial location with the true target to reduce sensory bias and adjusting the perception of cue reliability to optimize cue weighting. These findings have broader implications for understanding feedback-driven changes in perceptual and cognitive processes.",

Experiment 2 investigated whether instructional scaffolding (visual imagery versus background information) could enhance the effectiveness of embodied imagery. Experiment 3 involved a 10-week intervention using embodied imagery in authentic classroom settings. Results indicated that: (a) embodied imagery significantly improved students’ poetry learning outcomes—particularly their emotional interpretation—compared to general imagery and free learning conditions; (b) visual imagery scaffolding further enhanced the effectiveness of the embodied imagery strategy; and (c) prolonged classroom interventions employing embodied imagery significantly benefited students with lower prior knowledge.

          "abstract": "When calling an image before the mind's eye, people often do not include basic properties of the mental scene. For example, when imagining a person knocking a ball off a table, people may neglect to consider the color of the ball. This \"non-commitment\" in imagery has been part of ongoing debates on the nature of mental imagery in philosophy and cognitive science, but the central question of its origin remains open. It is possible that this lack of detail in the imagination reflects actual non-commitment, as one constructs a hierarchical mental scene. But it is also possible that people do form highly detailed mental images, but fail to notice, encode, or recall properties of the image, for the same reasons that they do not notice, encode, or recall details of real scenes in direct perception. We tested these contrasting hypotheses across three experiments (N=3,895 total). First, we compared non-commitment patterns in mental imagery with the details that participants failed to notice in briefly presented real images. We found no correlation between properties that were non-committed to in the imagination, and those missed under rapid perception, indicating that non-commitment does not simply arise from perceptual noise. Next, we examined the temporal unfolding of mental imagery, and found consistent evidence of a hierarchical pattern: core entities and spatial relations, then physical properties, then surface details like color and texture. Attempts to interrupt or constrain scene construction did not change the hierarchical ordering. We suggest the results support a hierarchical partial-scene construction account of mental imagery.",

          "abstract": "We conducted three experiments to investigate whether previously observed differences in the perceived blurriness of words versus nonwords reflect early perceptual processes or post-perceptual cognitive factors such as memory. Building on Lupyan’s report that familiar words appear less blurry than scrambled letter strings at the same blur level in perception, we designed a forced-choice paradigm featuring an immediate “perceptual” block, where both stimuli remained visible during the judgment, and a “memory” block, where one stimulus disappeared before participants responded. Results of all experiments showed that, although nonwords were consistently more likely than words to be judged as blurrier than the word target, this difference was statistically robust only under the memory condition. This result suggests that higher-order processes, specifically memory-based reconstruction, may intensify the perceived sharpness of words. By contrast, in an immediate perceptual context, the same word–nonword effect was either not present or not significant, indicating that strictly bottom-up perceptual sharpening due to familiarity may be weaker than previously assumed. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between immediate perceptual mechanisms and post-perceptual influences such as memory or decision biases when assessing top-down effects on vision as well as the importance of timing manipulations.  All three experiments also demonstrated a sharpening effect of memory for both words and nonwords, consistent with previous research.",

However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed and an updated search in July 2025, yielding an initial sample of 1,831 articles, of which 194 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 130 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to August 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

          "abstract": "The EZ-diffusion model (EZ-DDM) uses a method of moments to provide closed-form estimators for the drift-diffusion parameters from summary statistics. In previous work, we showed that using the sampling distributions of these statistics enables the implementation of an hierarchical extension of the EZ-DDM, supporting scalable Bayesian inference in cognitive psychometrics applications. However, the summary statistics used in EZ-DDM implementations (mean and variance) are sensitive to contaminant data points, limiting its utility in real-world applications with contaminated data. To address this, we develop and test a variation on the EZ-DDM in which we replace the summary statistics with robust alternatives: we substitute mean RT with median RT and RT variance with an estimate derived from the interquartile range. We illustrate the effectiveness of this substitution in a simulation study using a within-subject t test design across varying sample sizes and effect sizes. The robust variant matched the diagnostic accuracy of the original EZ-DDM for uncontaminated data but remained stable under contamination, unlike the standard model. This extension preserves efficiency while adding robustness in real-world applications. We recommend the use of the robust EZ-DDM in practical applications.",

          "abstract": "Optimal stopping problems provide a framework for studying decision-making under uncertainty, balancing the trade-off between information sampling and decision commitment. We investigated deviations from normative strategies in human decision-making and examined the neural mechanisms underlying decision commitment versus sampling using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants viewed sequences of beads drawn from fictitious urns and attempted to infer the majority bead colour in each urn, while their EEG activity was recorded. After viewing each bead, participants could choose to sample more by drawing another bead (draw choice) or to stop sampling and infer the contents of the urn (urn choice). A Bayesian ideal observer model and parametrised models were used to predict participant behaviour. Participants undersampled relative to the ideal observer, particularly in the more uncertain condition where the proportion of bead colours was close to chance (60/40 or 0.6), with the model better capturing behaviour in the easier 80/20 (0.8) condition. P300 amplitudes showed larger responses for urn choices and a gradient of increasing amplitude as draws approached commitment. Larger frontal ERP responses were also observed under higher uncertainty (0.6 condition). Beta oscillatory activity was stronger for urn choices in the high uncertainty condition, with fast beta (20–30 Hz) activity driving final commitment to a decision. Beta power was further predicted by model-derived action values. By integrating behavioural, computational, and neurophysiological data, this study advances our understanding of active information sampling versus decision commitment in reward-related probabilistic environments.",

          "abstract": "Mental imagery-based simulations of threat can evoke “as-if-real” emotional and motivational responses, which may alter top-down pain processing. This study investigated the impact of mental imagery simulations of threat on endogenous pain modulation in n = 71 healthy participants using a cuff-pressure algometry protocol. In block one, participants were assessed on their baseline pain detection threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), and their conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses. In the second block, participants underwent the same procedures again but were randomly allocated to imagine the dominant leg cuff as being made of bubble wrap (benign imagery condition; n = 36) or metal wire (threat imagery condition; n = 35). In between blocks, participants went to a separate room to interact with a piece of real bubble wrap or metal wire around their legs, facilitating mental imagery generation in Block 2. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, mental imagery impacted CPM effects for pain detection threshold (PDT), which was significantly reduced in the Wire relative to the Bubble-wrap condition. Mental imagery did not influence pressure pain tolerance (PPT).  These results indicate that mental simulation of threat impaired threshold-based CPM responses. Our data suggest that mental simulation of threat may contribute to dysfunctional central pain processing which may be relevant to the maintenance of clinical pain conditions.",

          "abstract": "Wishful thinking or desirability bias refers to instances where the desire for an outcome inflates the expectation that it will occur. Although studies have demonstrated influences of outcome desirability on people’s predictions, the cognitive mechanisms behind such an effect have remained unclear. Both biased criteria for evidence judgment and biased evidence search/accumulation have been suggested as possible mechanisms. In the present work, we used drift-diffusion modeling to examine on which levels of processing desirability has its impact. Participants (N=147) made predictions about the color of a randomly selected square from 2-color grids. Crucially, certain color outcomes were made more desirable than others, and the strength of evidence was manipulated by varying the proportion of desired-color squares in the grid. We found that both manipulations—and their interaction—significantly affected predictions. More importantly, drift-diffusion model analyses showed that outcome desirability resulted in a judgment-level bias, where participants required less evidence to predict a desired outcome. Notably, we also found that desirability impacted the evidence accumulation process itself. Participants more readily construed evidence as supporting the desired outcome, indicating that desirability had a top-down influence on how prediction-relevant evidence was accumulated. The present results have implications for existing accounts of how desire impacts expectations and highlight the utility of drift diffusion modeling as a tool for assessing the mechanisms underlying motivated biases.",

          "abstract": "In various cultures, across history and at many different spatial scales, humans produce a rich variety of geometric shapes. Recent work has put forward a concrete proposition for a Language of Thought (LoT) underlying the mental representation of geometric shapes in contemporary humans. Initial experiments, based on a comparison of baboon and human performance in an intruder task, suggested that this ability could be unique to humans. Here, to deepen our understanding of the evolutionary origins of geometric representations, we compared humans and baboons (Papio Papio) in a delayed geometric match-to-sample task with a broad array of shapes. Crucially, the presentation speed was manipulated so that, on slow-paced trials, animals were given more time to reflect on the shapes. The shapes were sampled from our proposed LoT and spanned a range of predicted geometric complexity under that model. Although the overall pattern of behavior was still strikingly different in humans and baboons, when presentations were slower, we did find a small contribution of the LoT representations in baboons, although weaker than in humans. In both species, longer looking time increased the effect of the LoT-based predictor. While humans used the ability to self-pace to modulate their looking time, thus benefitting from longer exposure times for more complex shapes and rendering this geometric complexity effect visible, baboons did not.",

Since the test used driving clips filmed in Australia from the left side of the roadway, the validity of the test for use in samples in the United States is not known. A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed. The new test used ten video clips, each 8 seconds in duration, which participants viewed before indicating how much slower or faster they would drive in the same scenario. In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

          "abstract": "Menstrual leave is an emerging reproductive health organisational policy gaining attention in Europe but research remains limited. Drawing on 45 semi-structured interviews with menstruating and non-menstruating workers, we applied thematic analysis to explore workplace perceptions of menstruation and menstrual leave policies (MLPs). We found that menstruation was widely positioned as taboo in the workplace, with participants both experiencing and anticipating stigma. Menstruating was associated with incompetence, emotional instability, and unprofessionalism – as contradictory to ideal worker norms and expectations. Although participants could identify and acknowledge potential benefits of MLPs, they also expressed reluctance and even women participants felt reticent. In particular, women participants would refrain from using them and were concerned about misuse. Our research contributes to work and organisational psychology by highlighting how ideal worker norms fuel menstrual stigma which in turn enables the stigmatisation of menstrual leave policies. Interventions that align with diffusion of innovations theory could increase awareness of menstruation and decrease menstrual stigma in the workplace to prepare workplaces before implementing menstrual leave policies.",

Contrary to this dominant perspective, we argue that the RewP is an independent EEG feature that selectively responds to positive RPE and is superimposed over a common background signal. We further propose that the RewP signals a goal-prediction error: it is elicited by abstract signals instead of hedonic “rewards”.   This goal prediction error appears to be produced by a critic-like architecture associated with the actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning. This perspective emphasizes the role of the RewP in goal attainment and cognitive control, as opposed to a simple indicator of reward receipt.",

Despite its pervasive influence on decision-making and mental health, it remains unknown whether global confidence is formed through similar or distinct processes across cognitive domains. Here we employ a novel gamified approach to compare how global confidence is formed in the domains of memory and perception. In memory, we found that both local accuracy and confidence contributed to global confidence, whereas in perception, global confidence was predicted by local confidence alone. By comparing the formation of global confidence across domains, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning self-evaluation, paving the way for the development of metacognitive interventions in education and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Error monitoring allows individuals to detect and adapt to mistakes, a process critical in high-stakes environments such as team sports. While widely studied at the individual level, people also monitor and respond to others’ errors. However, research on athletes has largely focused on individual errors. Furthermore, monetary-based manipulations in non-sport studies limit their applicability to team sports. To address these challenges, the present study investigated social post-error adaptations in padel, a doubles racket sport, using a social version of the Eriksen flanker task. Forty-six padel players alternated between action execution and observation under two conditions, once alternating with their teammate and once with an opponent. Results revealed distinct behavioral adaptations to teammates’ and opponents’ errors. Participants showed post-error slowing following teammates’ errors, but post-error speeding following opponents’ errors. Exploratory analyses indicated that individual differences in cohesion were associated with reduced post-error speeding in the opponent condition. Accuracy remained high across conditions, with no significant post-error accuracy effects. These findings demonstrate that, even outside the complexity of gameplay, the teammate-opponent relationship modulates athletes’ error responses, revealing that it is grounded in social cognition. By combining a controlled experimental paradigm with a team sport context, this study not only extends prior monetary-based research to an ecologically valid setting, it also offers insights for coaches, sport psychologists and performance analysts on how social dynamics shape athletes’ behavioral adaptations.",

          "abstract": "As students progress through school, they are expected to increasingly regulate their attention, behaviour and learning. While some meet these demands with ease, others face ongoing challenges that can hinder their academic success. Research has identified four key concepts in this area: executive functions (EF), metacognition (MC), self-regulation (SR) and self-regulated learning (SRL). Although these constructs are conceptually related, they have often been examined in isolation due to disciplinary and methodological divides, resulting in fragmented accounts that obscure their dynamic interplay. This review addresses this issue by providing a comparative overview of EF, MC, SR and SRL in terms of their definitions, how they are operationalised and the research designs used. Based on this synthesis, we introduce the EMERGE model of learning, which positions these constructs along a continuum ranging from more biologically grounded mechanics (e.g. EF) to more culturally shaped pragmatics (e.g. strategy knowledge in SRL). The model highlights both shared mechanisms and distinct functions and conceptualises SR in learning situations as an integrative construct. Building on this framework, we propose two guiding hypotheses: the stage-setting hypothesis, which emphasises long-term developmental interplay; and the compensatory hypothesis, which focuses on short-term interactions that predict learning outcomes. Together, these perspectives highlight the need for longitudinal, experimental and hybrid designs to capture developmental and dynamic processes. The EMERGE model thus aims to bridge fragmented research traditions, improve diagnostics, and inform interventions that effectively support students in meeting the growing demands of self-regulated and adaptive learning.",

Most empirical work in the developmental domain has used dance movements to explore the development of general emotional expressivity and understanding. Since aesthetic emotions are not disparate from everyday emotions, the research exploring those relationships between dance behaviors and emotional and social development can be considered a stepping-stone for first insights into the development of the aesthetic experience of dance in childhood. In this chapter, we present an overview of research exploring expressive dance movements with children, and discuss how such approaches can be adapted to investigate the ontogeny of dance-related aesthetic experiences. We further provide an overview of methods and open research questions for a developmental empirical framework of dance aesthetics.",

          "abstract": "Gait impairments following stroke are prevalent and persistent, often affecting walking ability, body perception, and quality of life. Movement sonification—mapping body motion to sound—has shown promise for modulating sensorimotor function. This multiple-case experimental study investigated the effects of movement sonification using metaphorical sound on gait, body perception, and emotional state in three individuals with chronic stroke. Using an ABAC design, participants walked with real-time auditory feedback delivered via an interactive walking-interface system (SoniBand) across four conditions: baseline, “Wind” sound, return to baseline, and “Mechanical” sound, presented in a counterbalanced order. Gait parameters (symmetry, step frequency, velocity, and acceleration) were assessed alongside self-reported body perception and emotional state. Exposure to the “Wind” sound condition led to consistent improvements in walking velocity and symmetry, as well as enhanced perceptions of body lightness, speed, flexibility, and physical capability. Accelerometer data indicated carry-over effects from the sound condition in gait symmetry and step regularity. These findings support the potential of metaphorical sound sonification to influence internal models of movement and facilitate sensorimotor adaptation in stroke survivors. This study underscores the malleability of body perceptions through auditory feedback and highlights the value of personalized, perceptually grounded interventions in neurorehabilitation.",

Yet, it remains unclear whether the control processes implemented when reducing cross-language interference are similar to those when reducing within-language interference. Since prior research has shown contradictory results, we set out to investigate this issue further based on a combination of language switch costs, as a measure of control processes resolving cross-language interference, and Stroop incongruency, as a measure of control processes resolving within-language interference. Relying on a range of statistical techniques, the results across three experiments, including a replication of Experiment 1 of Liu et al. (2019), testing three different groups of bilinguals (i.e., Dutch-English, Arabic-English, and Chinese-English) showed no clear interaction between language switch costs and Stroop incongruency, and neither was this pattern influenced by language dominance. These results are more in line with the claim that control processes implemented to reduce cross- and within-language interference are separate or occur in separate stages of processing.",

          "authors": "Norbert Vanek",
          "abstract": "Research on language and olfaction presents a paradox. Language appears to support the formation of odor categories, yet it can also hinder odor recognition through verbal interference, highlighting that different olfactory processes get affected in distinct ways. The question, then, is not about whether language and odor processing in humans are inevitably linked, but about understanding the circumstances under which language either promotes or hinders olfactory processing, particularly in the domains of odor categorization and memory. To unmask the nature of this delicate balance, this article reviews empirical studies that point to a verbal enhancement of forming new odor categories and contextualizes it alongside experimental outcomes showing how odor memories can get verbally skewed. Findings from both angles are nested within prominent theories including attribute differentiation, dual coding, ad hoc cognition and attentional tuning. The research reviewed here sits at the crossroads of language and olfaction. It offers fresh insights into how language scaffolds the organization of the mind, and it also outlines promising directions for future research. The main aim is to bring together two contrasting strands of research to investigate how language both facilitates and disrupts olfactory processing. The designs of studies in this article were inspired by Asifa Majid’s outstanding contributions to cognitive science and honor her dedication to community building, particularly in exploring how diverse linguistic and cultural contexts affect olfactory cognition.",

This study introduces an embodied imagery strategy, which encourages learners to simulate poets' emotional and mental states, and examines its effectiveness for improving middle school students' classical poetry learning outcomes. Experiment 1 compared the effects of embodied imagery, general imagery, and free learning strategies on poetry learning. Experiment 2 investigated whether instructional scaffolding (visual imagery versus background information) could enhance the effectiveness of embodied imagery. Experiment 3 involved a 10-week intervention using embodied imagery in authentic classroom settings. Results indicated that: (a) embodied imagery significantly improved students’ poetry learning outcomes—particularly their emotional interpretation—compared to general imagery and free learning conditions; (b) visual imagery scaffolding further enhanced the effectiveness of the embodied imagery strategy; and (c) prolonged classroom interventions employing embodied imagery significantly benefited students with lower prior knowledge. These findings suggest embodied imagery as a promising instructional approach to enhance middle school students’ semantic comprehension and emotional engagement in classical poetry learning.",

We investigated potential mechanisms underlying this effect, examining the role of autobiographical memory and cognitive functioning. 120 individuals aged 20-91 were assessed on subjective time perception for the preceding decade and year, the quantity and significance of autobiographical memories from those periods, and overall cognitive status. Results confirmed the specific age-related increase in perceived temporal acceleration over the past decade. However, no significant association was found between perceived time passage over the past decade and either the number or subjective value of memories. Contrary to assumptions, older adults reported more vivid and meaningful recollections. Instead, reduced cognitive functioning, and specifically lower ability to form new memories as assessed through delayed memory recall, emerged as a significant mediator of accelerated time perception with age. Findings suggest that age-related cognitive decline leading to reduced ability to encode novel memories, rather than diminished autobiographical memory content, is a critical factor in the subjective experience of time compression in older adults.",

          "abstract": "Food preparation plays a key role in shaping how people perceive meat: It helps people to dissociate meat from its animal origin and allows them to eat meat without experiencing conflict. However, experimental research in this area mostly disregards or confounds two food preparation steps: disassembling and cooking. To test how disassembling and cooking affect perceptions about meat dishes, we conducted secondary analyses of a sample of omnivores from a U.S.-representative dataset (N = 1,189). In this study, participants indicated meat perceptions (self-report) in response to a picture of one meat dish that varied in the degree of disassembling (i.e., whole parts vs. chopped/minced) and cooking (i.e., raw vs. cooked). Leveraging this experimental setup, multi-level analyses revealed that disassembling and cooking reduced compassion elicited by meat dishes. Disassembling also decreased general emotional arousal, while cooking reduced negative evaluations, conflict experiences in felt ambivalence, and specific negative emotions such as disgust and anger, while increasing valence perceptions more generally and the desire to eat the dish. Moreover, psychological network analyses showed that the relations of meat-related perceptions with each other do not differ significantly between food preparation steps. By offering nuanced insights into how food preparation affects conflict experiences as well as other affective and attitudinal meat-related perceptions, this research offers various theoretical and practical implications. We therefore discuss key considerations for future research on meat-related perceptions and identify when and which interventions may be most necessary and effective in encouraging reduced meat consumption.",

Despite its pervasive influence on decision-making and mental health, it remains unknown whether global confidence is formed through similar or distinct processes across cognitive domains. Here we employ a novel gamified approach to compare how global confidence is formed in the domains of memory and perception. In memory, we found that both local accuracy and confidence contributed to global confidence, whereas in perception, global confidence was predicted by local confidence alone. By comparing the formation of global confidence across domains, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms underpinning self-evaluation, paving the way for the development of metacognitive interventions in education and psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "A common maxim holds that “context is everything”. This perspective transformed the field of emotion-regulation, which evolved from understanding which regulation strategies people use, to understanding how strategy use varies by context (i.e., strategy-situation fit). Theoretical accounts suggest contextual features are crucial in guiding people’s selection of emotion-regulation strategies. However, empirical evidence is isolated in piecemeal studies with inconclusive results. To comprehensively explore context-dependent emotion-regulation, we need data on emotion-regulation across many contexts, at scale. Combining 11 experience-sampling datasets in an integrative analysis (NID=1,720, Nobservations=134,470), we examined how regulation strategy use varies as a function of three theory-derived contextual features—intensity, controllability, and social features (i.e., the presence and closeness of others). We found limited support that context matters for daily emotion-regulation strategy use. Our study provides a well-powered foundational step to test a theory central to emotion-regulation research, and highlights the complexity of capturing strategy-situation fit in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Spatial cognition refers to how people transform physical spatial information into mental representations and manipulate it to do further spatial computation and reasoning. Previous research has demonstrated that frames of reference (FORs) in the physical space could distort the spatial representations to influence memory of spatial relations. However, it remains unclear whether FORs could also influence attentional allocation among the spatial representations. To addressed this issue, we examined the attentional shifting within or between different spatial regions, which were affected by the same versus different FORs. In Experiment 1, a modified double-rectangle cuing paradigm was adopted. Two human figures in complementary colors were presented to establish two object-centered spatial FORs, which divided the external space of objects into a central region (influenced by two FORs) and two outer-side regions (primarily influenced by a single FOR). Cues and targets were presented in the same region or different regions. Results showed faster attentional shifting within the same region than between different regions. In Experiment 2, one human figure was replaced as a cross, and the within-region advantage was replicated. Overall, these findings suggest that object-centered FORs could be employed to collectively organize space and shape attentional allocation in objects’ external space.",

          "abstract": "Emotions can greatly influence cognitive processes, such as reading. However, recent studies on the interaction between emotions and reading comprehension provide a murky picture with contradictory claims. Here, we offer one explanation for this phenomenon, that is, the influence of emotion is dependent on different attention goals during reading comprehension. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated question types that were presented to participants prior to reading to evoke different attentional goals. By utilizing an advanced eye movement analysis method Eye Movement with Hidden Markov Models (EMHMM) with co-clustering, we discovered two representative attention patterns from eye fixations: an expanded, globalized attention pattern and a more focused, localized attention pattern. The subsequent analysis showed that globalized pattern led to better comprehension accuracy for summative questions, and localized pattern facilitated detailed question answering. Moreover, negative emotion induces more localized attention for detailed questions only, which could further explain its facilitation effect in detailed question answering. Our findings suggest that the impact of emotions on reading comprehension is shaped by the attention goal of the task. This suggests that emotion appears to guide attention in ways that either support or hinder comprehension depending on what the higher-level goal is.",

          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone. It requires form.",

We find that, on average, nano-targeting does not perform better than an overall \"best message'', but that nano-targeted messages were more persuasive than the best message for individuals who were already supportive of climate action. We also discover backlash effects from \"mis-targeting'', and find an important asymmetry: being randomly assigned messages predicted to be far from one's best policy has stronger dissuasive effects than the persuasive effects of being shown one's best message. Together these results suggest that these technologies may not be practical for most actors, but may be effective for entrepreneurs who aim to dissuade, demobilize or polarize.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

This paper addresses these questions by comparing African and European democracies using five rounds of the Integrated Values Survey and nine rounds of the Afrobarometer. We apply age-period-cohort-interaction models to assess generational support for democracy and openness to authoritarian alternatives; we also differentiate democratic trajectories across regions. In Africa, the dominant pattern is a general downward trend in democratic support and rejection of authoritarianism, in some cases led by younger cohorts. In Europe, although cohort effects continue to reflect declines in democratic support that were concentrated among younger age groups in the past, support for democracy subsequently recovered among more recent cohorts.  However, some European electoral democracies show a rise in openness to authoritarianism, especially among young cohorts.",

Counteradaptation highlights how adaptive moves in one domain—\nwhether foreign extraction, ‘development’ apparatuses, or climate policy regimes—create new\npressures that compel situated responses elsewhere. Case studies of fishing communities, timber\nand gold frontiers, and informal urban settlements show how counteradaptation reframes\nhabitability as a contested threshold and exposes the limits of technocratic adaptation toolkits.

          "authors": "Abel Aussant",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, states throughout Europe have begun implementing universal culture vouchers for young adults to boost cultural participation. Little is known about the effects of these large-scale subsidies, specifically whether they are truly an effective means of widening participation. This article addresses this question by evaluating the French ‘pass Culture’, a €300 stipend for cultural consumption offered to all 18-year-olds. Drawing from the fields of the sociology of culture and cultural economics, this study aims to determine whether an increase in purchasing power for cultural goods can influence participation. The empirical analysis is based on an econometric examination of a large-scale survey examining cultural participation and the use of ‘pass Culture’. The results reveal that while the voucher does not affect participation in institutional highbrow cultural activities like museum visits, theater, or opera attendance, it significantly increases engagement with commercial popular culture, including cinema and comic book reading. These findings suggest that financial barriers are not the primary obstacle to consumption in cultural capital-intensive activities. However, financial constraints do appear to contribute to non-participation in popular cultural life among certain youth demographics. The article then discusses the theoretical implications of these findings for our understanding of the relationship between cultural consumption, cultural policies, and social inequalities.",

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), I employ standard fixed-effects (FE) models and fixed-effects individual slopes (FEIS) to estimate the causal effects of personal and partner retirement on life satisfaction. The findings show that retirement substantially increases life satisfaction, a result that remains robust across methodologies and specifications. For partner retire￾ment, accounting for heterogeneous trends by health status reveals an overall positive effect, driven by men. Moreover, women appear to be worse off when their husbands retire while they remain in the workforce, whereas the opposite holds for men. To my knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of both personal and spousal retirement on life satisfaction using the SOEP. The results provide robust evidence that partner retirement affects life satisfaction, highlighting the importance of understanding retirement as a life course event with intra-household spillover effects that extend beyond the retiring individual.",

          "abstract": "Population aging and increasing family diversity raise concerns about women’s financial security in later life, as a greater share do not live with a breadwinning spouse. Women’s financial security is particularly jeopardized in conservative welfare states that limit women’s options to accrue independent pension entitlements. This study examines women’s work–family life courses and financial security in later life in two conservative welfare states with distinct pension policies: West Germany with a Bismarckian pension system and the Netherlands with a more universalistic pension system. Drawing on SHARELIFE data, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods to link work-family life course typologies to individual pensions, survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. Findings show that the work-family life courses in the two countries strongly resembled each other, characterized by a strong care orientation and weak labour force attachment of married mothers. However, women with care-oriented life courses receive substantially higher individual pensions in the Netherlands, which grant Dutch women higher financial autonomy. In contrast, women’s survivor benefits and household income were slightly higher in West Germany, affording a higher living standard but less financial autonomy, and a higher risk of poverty following a potential separation compared to the Netherlands.",

A large body of scientific research has shown that nature markets regularly do not achieve their environmental objectives, and provides generalisable lessons to support their ongoing improvement. The scale of the biodiversity crisis and the enduring popularity of nature markets means it is now critical to stop reproducing the same mistakes. Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five rules which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks. Lastly, we outline critical evidence-based actions that can be taken to push nature markets towards greater integrity.",

We describe the process of carrying out participatory research using the method of board game hacking. Hacking is a creative research method and mode of critical play that involves participants unmaking and remaking games by doing things like changing the game rules, creating new components, making new pieces for the game, or new art, and combining the different elements of the game in new ways. This experience was messier than we had envisaged when designing and pitching the project for our funders, Game in Lab and the Libellud Foundation, who are industry-based funding bodies promoting the scientific study of games. The semi-contained chaos in the room punctured the confidence of our written research proposal, which naïvely described a neatly complementary interaction of games and young researchers. This chapter is a reflection on what we learned as researchers, and an examination of the relationships that unfolded between research, game hacking and activism.",

          "abstract": "How do authoritarian regimes implement unpopular economic reforms without triggering destabilizing unrest? Prevailing theories suggest that governments must either repress dissent, concede through meaningful policy reversals, or ignore unrest and risk backlash. This paper introduces the concept of temporary concessions: short-term, strategic policy reversals later re-implemented to demobilize protest while maintaining reform and regime stability. I argue that regimes deploy temporary concessions when repression is costly or externally constrained, and ignoring protest risks escalation. By disrupting protest momentum and introducing a collective action problem among protesters, tem porary concessions make demobilization the individually rational choice. Evidence from subsidy reforms in Jordan and Egypt, combined with a nationally representative survey experiment, shows that these tactics defuse unrest even when citizens doubt their durability, challenging prevailing models of authoritarian responsiveness and resilience under economic liberalization.",

          "abstract": "Climate change and the depletion of the Earths natural resources are among the largest challenges humanity currently faces. In light of this, the planned German Longitudinal Environmental Study (GLEN) aims at investigating the incentives, restrictions, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie human-environment interactions. In doing so, the GLEN project aims to provide a foundation for evidence-based environmental policy assessments and guidance. The project will build up a large-scale panel study of the adult population in Germany in which the same individuals will be repeatedly observed over time using a standardized and stable online survey instrument. Due to its longitudinal design and the linkage of the collected survey data to geospatial information on respondents social and ecological environments, the panel will be well suited to analyzing natural experiments such as regional policy measures (e.g., price changes, information campaigns) and exposure to local environmental conditions (e.g., extreme weather events). In addition, the panel\nwill be used as a platform for survey experiments to investigate trade-offs in environmental preferences, consumption decisions, and the acceptance of environmental technologies and policies. With this design, GLEN will meet the urgent need for data suitable for causal research and simulations in the environmental social sciences. With occasionally refreshed samples, it will also allow for the monitoring of trends in environmental concern and behavior, focusing on diverse social, political, economic, and psychological aspects. Accordingly, GLEN is primarily understood as a data infrastructure for environmental research across all social science disciplines. Key questions that can be addressed with the data include: What influences environmental concern, behavior, and the acceptance of technologies and policies to protect the environment? What consequences do environmental policies and changing environments have for social inequalities, and how does that affect (perceived) environmental justice? As a long-term project, GLEN will cover the period between 2024 and 2035, and thus the period in which decisive policy measures to replace fossil fuels are set to be implemented in accordance with international agreements. In sum, the project includes three work streams to pursue three closely related goals: (I) First and foremost, the project will generate a data infrastructure for the environmental social sciences, to be used not only in Germany, but also internationally. (II) The project team will utilize the data for substantive environmental social science research. (III) The project will provide evidence-based policy evaluations and guidance with regular policy reports and embedded experiments. The project team requests funding for the first 3-year period of the planned long-term project.",

This challenging research context provides a methodological petri dish from which to examine common ethical challenges inherent in CBPR work. Here we discuss how praxis aligned with the concepts of relationality, embeddedness and embodiment contain both tension and promise in complex research contexts. We depict how relational authenticity was facilitated by flexibility and informal interactions and was further enhanced by deeply-engaged, physical presence that enkindled hope even when hope was hampered by limited agency.

Tax compliance was strikingly high, with about 80 percent of liable taxpayers meeting obligations despite limited administrative capacity. Military recruitment targets were likewise consistently met despite avoidance and poor health. Spikes in head tax rates significantly increased tax-related protests, prompting colonial authorities to moderate rates in times of crisis and adjust burdens to perceived district affluence. Yet local shocks such as droughts or crop price collapses were largely ignored. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

Many IOs assume a trade-off between expertise and representation, where the former increases capacity and the latter increases legitimacy. However, this paper provides evidence that geographic representation can enhance bureaucratic information capacity. Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies. These findings highlight that prioritizing geographic balance in IOs may positively impact both legitimacy and capacity.",

We implement a pre-registered field experiment embedded in a real-world citizens’ assembly on wealth inequality in Austria. Using a three-group-design comparing assembly participants, non-selected volunteers, and a population sample, we isolate the causal effects of taking part in a citizens’ assembly from self-selection into participation. We find that while participating in the citizens’ assembly substantially improves factual knowledge about the wealth distribution and promotes convergence around specific tax policy proposals, notably a EUR 1 million allowance, it has no measurable effect on political efficacy or broader civic engagement. We also document significant political self-selection: individuals willing to participate in the citizens’ assembly were already more engaged and supportive of redistribution than the general population. These findings suggest that while deliberative formats can foster informed convergence on policy proposals, their ability to mobilize broader publics is limited – especially if they primarily engage the already supportive and, as in this case, lack institutional anchoring that might facilitate spillover into more institutionalized political arenas.

          "abstract": "Writing in the sciences transcends the notion of sticking to the data. Writing is a complex transformation of a wealth of semi-ordered information into a clear and persuasive scientific story. The formalised form of a research article contains this story and, if published, legitimises it. This empirical study provides a nuanced, empirically-driven appreciation of scientific writing before writer and text are mediated by the competition for and accounting of authorship. It builds on a qualitative study of writing (n=22) and elucidates essential features of writing such as the hermeneutics of the scientific story, different modes of writing as iteration and collaboration, spanning across levels of seniority and position. Furthermore, this study delivers a new perspective on professional scientific writers—trained scientists who provide writing-as-a-service but often remain invisible in attributions of authorship. The structure of this article is as follows. The introduction provides an overview of the literature and elaborates the central research questions (1). We then define our area of research in terms of actors and discuss our research design (2). Thereafter (3), we present and contextualise empirical findings along central themes such as: the writing journey, the division of labour in scientific writing, the meaning of style and storytelling, the relation of writing practices and authorship, and the position of the scientific writer. Finally (4), we conclude, expounding on the intermediatory functions of scientific writing in the broader context of knowledge production, and provide a comprehensive outlook.",

Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, Europe has experienced an increasing number of devastating floods. In 2023 alone, 26 flood events were reported in the first nine months of the year. Two of such events were the floods that hit the Italian regions of Emilia Romagna in May 2023 and Tuscany in November 2023. Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

To answer this question, we present a systematic review of studies focusing on sexism as a predictor of political attitudes and voting behaviour. In two databases (Scopus and Web of Science), we identify 97 relevant studies, including 42 on the 2016 US presidential elections. The review shows that particularly modern and hostile sexism played a role in Trump's election. However, few other research questions have been answered with similar certainty. Our review discovers gaps in the literature and proposes further directions for this growing research field. To enable future comparative research, we discuss best practices for measuring sexism and show the variety of ways in which sexism is operationalized.",

Apart from its health economic impact, cognitive decline may affect the quality of life (QoL) and affective states of individuals. From a measurement perspective, it is of high importance to use quality-assured measurements to derive valid and reliable results. This paper investigates to what extent improved memory metrics can be exploited to investigate the strength of correlation between memory ability, depressive symptoms, and well-being. It also aims to shed light on earlier heterogeneous results through the application of quality-assured measurements. In this paper, we analyzed associations between memory ability, measured by the new and more accurate NeuroMET Memory Metric (NMM), and depressive symptoms and wellbeing of the same individuals measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the WHOQoL-BREF of older individuals (n=332, ranging from healthy controls to patients with dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with a mean age of 72 years). While decreased memory ability was moderately associated with more depressive symptoms (Pearson R = -0.36), it was only negligibly associated with worse well-being (associations with WHOQoL-BREF and subdomains ranging between R = 0.08 and 0.12), which is partly in line with previous studies. A group-wise analysis revealed that these effects were stronger for individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Our study leveraged measurements scales and models with improved accuracy.",

Drawing from lived experience, I explore how simple acts of care—like adjusting a cup of tea or offering a gentle hug—can build trust and emotional connection between staff and residents. I reflect on moments of challenge and growth, particularly in understanding residents' preferences, building rapport, and responding to non-verbal cues. Central to the narrative is the concept of “huggerholics”—residents who welcome warmth and affectionate gestures—and the emotional reciprocity this role offers. This piece highlights how aged care work, especially in hospitality roles, can be a source of meaning and healing, not just for those being served but also for those serving. Through this reflection, I hope to contribute to a richer understanding of person-centred care and the importance of emotional labour in aged care settings.",

          "authors": "Hitoshi Akimoto",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Beached Whale Hypothesis, a conceptual framework linking nationalism to collective cognitive disorientation. Drawing analogies from marine strandings, it interprets socio-political extremism as a product of affective and informational imbalance. The proposed Tensional Realignment Model (TRM) offers a neurocognitive explanation for how societies recalibrate emotional, temporal, and structural equilibrium through distributed tension management. Integrating insights from affective neuroscience, ecological systems theory, and social dynamics, the study situates nationalism as an emergent symptom of affective compression under digital acceleration. By comparing the global diffusion of the MAGA movement with the evolution of Japanese online nationalism, the paper frames digital populism as a “magnetic realignment failure.” The TRM thus proposes a post-national governance approach that sustains adaptability and emotional diversity by restoring systemic oscillation between affective and informational poles.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "A paradox of hominization needs to be resolved: Homo erectus experienced a\ndoubling of brain volume, yet the development of its cognition took eons. In almost\ntwo million years of brain growth, Homo erectus made only a few technological\ninnovations. Therefore, in Homo erectus, it seems that the biological process\nof mutation and selection for the evolution of the cerebrum was primarily\nresponsible for the increase in cognition, rather than the accumulation of experience.\nThe only significant difference between the monkey and human brain is as follows:\nthe proportion of the association cortex increased to 80% during the evolution\nof Homo erectus. But how can a mere increase in the number of non-specific\nneurons in the association cortex of Homo erectus explain the cognitive advances\nthat can be observed? The partial patterns of sensory perception that the connectome\nfeeds to the association cortex are evolved intracortically into higher cognitions\nby means of unspecialized neurons. These information-providing neural patterns\ncan only be evolved – not calculated – because they are subject to the properties\nof a complex brain system; and they can only be evolved processual because\nthe association cortex has a non-specific character – it selects information patterns\ninstead of neural structures.\nThus, the greater the number of neurons, the more pattern attractors of order acquisition\ncan be formed, and the higher the cognition. Their number was probably\nnot sufficient in Homo erectus to continuously develop complex cognition. The\nextreme time periods for innovations in Homo erectus therefore suggest that its\ncognitive advances were not due to a cumulative learning process, but primarily\nto the genetically determined increase in brain size and thus neurons. Homo erectus\nwas not human.\nBefore brain growth stopped in archaic Homo sapiens, a systemic change must\nhave taken place in the evolving cerebrum. For in the human brain – which remains\nconstant – we recognize an unlimited potential for cognition and, above all,\ncreativity that is lacking in Homo erectus.",

          "abstract": "American democracy is entering a period of structural exhaustion. The institutions that once formed citizens and carried meaning, responsibility, and authorship of a common life still function – schools, universities, workplaces, congregations, hospitals, etc. Yet they no longer enable people to govern together and see themselves reflected in the world in any meaningful sense. Civic energy persists, but it leaks through frameworks that can no longer turn that energy into durable public life. The result is not only distrust in government but a deeper collapse of civic faith.\n\nThis paper advances civic architecture as a framework for understanding and repairing the exhaustion – the structural civic breakdown of American institutions. The paper argues that democracy depends not simply on participation but on design: the deliberate construction of institutions that embed authorship, distribute power, and sustain civic responsibility across generations.\n\nDeveloped conceptually through democratic theory, civic studies, and the Black intellectual tradition, the framework is illustrated through an institutional example at Huston–Tillotson University (HT), a Historically Black University (HBCU) in Austin, Texas. There, the Politics Lab of the James L. Farmer House (Farmer House) demonstrates how students and educators can translate frustration into durable authorship, showing what it means to design for democracy within existing institutional life.\n\nDemocracy cannot survive on energy alone.

Results of a pre- registered survey (n= 5,685) across six countries (Brazil, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the UK, and the US) suggest that negative attitudes towards AI-based recommender systems and distrust in social media companies are most strongly associated with algorithmic resistance. A comparative analysis further reveals that users from Brazil are least likely to disengage from SMPs on ethical grounds.

The model integrates six voting mechanisms (Plurality, Approval, Borda, IRV, STV, PR with D'Hondt and Sainte-Laguë divisors), a multi-round coalition protocol with binding/non-binding contracts and side-payments, turnout and ballot-error realism, and networked interaction on Erdös–Rényi, Barabási–Albert, and Watts–Strogatz graphs with homophily. Agents use reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, A2C, A3C) with a social-welfare objective based on the inequality-averse Atkinson function, augmented by fairness regularizers (representation loss, participation fairness, envy-freeness proxy) and explicit participation costs. We report diagnostics-rich evaluations covering representation and proportionality (e.g., Gallagher, Loosemore–Hanby), fragmentation (effective number of parties), strategic behavior, coalition stability, and welfare/inequality. Classic regularities emerge—e.g., two-bloc competition under Plurality (Duverger-consistent), greater proportionality and fragmentation under PR, and differential seat allocation under D'Hondt vs Sainte-Laguë—providing face validity. The framework delivers a reproducible virtual laboratory for mechanism comparison, institutional design, and welfare–fairness trade-off analysis at population scale.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this interdisciplinary study is to contribute to the field of disaster and climate conflict research. For this purpose, I qualitatively examine for the first time the impact of the devastating flood of 2010 on the conflict in Pakistan, more specifically the regional capacity of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), in the administrative units of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK). Also, I introduce the concept of state capacity into the debate, review its impact on the conflict and examine its possible contribution to the debate. I hypothesise that the concept of state capacity can explain the conflict better than the influence of disasters. This is tested with the help of a document analysis and expert interviews. Prior findings from mostly quantitative studies, such as the complex, bidirectional nature of the relationship between disasters and conflict or the concept of the unnatural disaster, were qualitatively confirmed and further explored in this study. It becomes clear that while the flood can provide benefits to the TTP and prolong the conflict, it cannot fundamentally change the outcome of the conflict. In this context, the key finding of this study is the importance of state capacity for the complex debate around disasters and climate conflict. More research in this direction is recommended, as the topic is expected to become much more relevant due to the increasing number and intensity of extreme weather events in the coming decades.",

Using the European Commission's Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs as a case study, I provide evidence that increasing representation of bureaucrats from a member state increases the accuracy of that state's economic forecasts. This effect, which I call ``national expertise,\" decreases as member state representation within the Commission increases and is most pronounced for large economies.

          "abstract": "The role of media in producing territorial stigma is a central concern for urban researchers. This study investigates how one of the most stigmatised areas in the Netherlands, the Bijlmer, has been portrayed in newspaper media over a period of 35 years, and how this portrayal relates to structural changes in the district. The concepts of core and event stigma are employed to understand the temporal dimensions of stigma production. The corpus includes 22,934 articles from the five largest Dutch newspapers that referenced the Bijlmer since 1990. Hierarchical topic modelling and sentiment analysis are used to detect topical representations of the Bijlmer. The findings indicate that in the 1990s two news peaks regarding the Bijlmer crash have been important in raising its (inter)national status, whereas the Bijlmer has also suffered from core stigmatisation on various crime and social issues. In addition, the findings suggest an intricate relation between structural changes in the Bijlmer and media attention. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the relevance of core and event stigma, employing novel techniques in research on territorial stigma, and investigating the relation between structural neighbourhood conditions and media representation.",

          "authors": "Thi Xuan Dieu Phan",
          "abstract": "Food is central to the dignity, well-being, and quality of life of older adults living in residential aged care. Yet in many facilities, food waste remains widespread and under-addressed, often viewed as inevitable in institutional settings. This study offers a reflective, practice-based exploration of food waste in aged care, grounded in the author’s work as a catering assistant and support worker across multiple facilities in South Australia. Drawing on structured fieldnotes and direct observations, the paper identifies three main categories of food waste—plate waste, kitchen overproduction, and expired stock—and explores the operational, cultural, and behavioural factors driving these inefficiencies. Key causes include inaccurate meal ordering, overproduction habits, limited staff feedback mechanisms, and poor interdepartmental communication. The study proposes a set of low-cost, staff-informed strategies to reduce waste while enhancing care quality. These include personalised portioning, consistent ordering protocols, resident feedback loops, and systems for safe food repurposing. It also underscores the importance of supportive leadership, workplace culture, and valuing catering roles as central to person-centred care. By centring frontline staff experiences, this paper reframes food waste as not merely a logistical issue, but a matter of care quality, communication, and organisational sustainability. Findings suggest that food waste reduction can reinforce—not compete with—person-centred approaches by respecting resident preferences and improving mealtime satisfaction. This study contributes to the broader conversation on aged care reform by offering insights from daily practice. It highlights how simple, context-sensitive changes can advance both environmental and social goals in residential care.",

Secondary aims were to examine content overlaps between scales developed specifically for older persons (age-specific) and age-generic scales psychometrically evaluated in older populations, as well as between positively and negatively worded items and between scales targeting well-being and QoL.\nMethods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Items from included scales were categorised using a framework for well-being and QoL scales. Descriptive statistics illustrate the content distribution, and Jaccard index estimates content overlap.\nResults: A total of 744 items from 35 scales were included. Among the age-specific scales for older persons (n =19), the most common dimensions were personal circumstances, personal relationships, and physical health. For age-generic scales (n =16), activities and functioning, personal relationships, and self-acceptance were most prominent. Average content overlap was 0.42 (range 0.22–0.55) for age-specific scales, indicating moderate overlap.\nConclusion: While there is some consistency in content across age-specific well-being and QoL scales for older persons, notable heterogeneity remains.

          "authors": "Nanna-Katrine Gram Lange",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of policy efforts, the gender gap in entrepreneurship remains persistent across national contexts. Recent research suggests that these disparities begin early in life, many years before labour market entries. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 23 Danish adolescents aged 13–15, this paper explores how gendered self-concepts and possible selves contribute to the shaping of young people’s perceptions of entrepreneurship. Using a sociological framework that combines theories of doing gender, self-concept, and future orientation, the study finds that girls’ disinterest in entrepreneurship is not rooted in lack of ambition or ability, but in identity misalignment. While girls tend to articulate detailed and socially validated futures, often linked to professions related to care, entrepreneurship appears incompatible with these roles unless it is shown to reinforce who they already want to become. In contrast, boys are more likely to describe vague or flexible future selves, leaving room for entrepreneurship to emerge as a possible option. The findings challenge deficit-based understandings of early gender gaps in entrepreneurship and point to entrepreneurship as one among several possible selves. Ultimately, entrepreneurship becomes meaningful only where it coheres with young people’s evolving sense of who they are and might become.",

Although early definitions recognised the importance of traditional literacy (the ability to read and write) for engaging in digital practices (Gilster, 1997), this connection is often overlooked in recent scholarship, policy initiatives, and digital literacy frameworks. This article draws on ethnographic data from two secondary schools in England to present a case that highlights the relationship between traditional and digital literacies, underscoring the importance of acknowledging and better understanding their interplay. Situated within a socio-technical approach and complemented by Rosenblatt’s transactional theory of reading (1978, 1986, 1995) to conceptualise technology-as-text and user-as-reader, the article presents analysis of three classroom vignettes to illustrate how students’ interactions with an “adaptive” EdTech platform intended to support literacy learning are shaped by their traditional literacy skills. Our analysis identifies a series of transactional breakdowns between reader and text, each marking a moment in which no meaningful transaction can occur due to insufficient consideration of how traditional and digital literacies intersect. Framing EdTech as a straightforward solution to literacy challenges without attending to the nuanced and context-specific ways students engage with such technologies ultimately risks reinforcing the very disparities they seek to address.",

Using an original survey instrument on a representative sample of the Italian population of residents in Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, we investigate individuals’ climate adaptation and mitigation responses, including their preparedness against extreme climatic events and the determinants of such preparedness, their perception of flood risk likelihood across key life domains, their support for green policies, and their intention to adopt mitigation measures. We further examine whether targeted risk communication can enhance these climate adaptation and mitigation responses through two pre-registered randomized experiments testing the causal impact of flood risk information on the same set of outcomes. Our findings reveal that respondents were highly unprepared, with around 70% per cent of the sample having never taken any action to equip their home to handle extreme climatic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the provision of information on floods’ risk through an effective video message significantly improves individuals’ pro-environmental behavior, their perception of the danger of floods, and their intention to vote for a political coalition that will prioritize on combating climate change. Providing information on flood risk can thus contribute to promoting the vast support for the necessary actions to address the climate crisis.",

          "authors": "Brett Binst; Annelien Smets; Lien Michiels",
          "abstract": "As the internet, smartphones, and review platforms transform how travelers discover urban attractions, understanding this process is critical for harnessing a sustainable urban attraction space. Yet urban discovery remains poorly understood and existing research is fragmented. To address this gap, we adapt Leiper’s tourist attraction systems framework to study urban discovery. Our grounded theory analysis on 126 interviews resulted in five distinct discovery modes: instrumental-rational, go-with-the-flow, social, flaneur, and habitual. Besides richly describing these modes, we identify personal, social, contextual, demographic, and affective factors influencing them. We illustrate how playful discovery modes—go-with-the-flow, social, and flaneur—are compatible, leading to mixed discovery modes, while the remaining modes are incompatible. These findings challenge the dominance of rational choice models by revealing a broader spectrum of discovery behaviors. They also provide a foundation for designing a more inclusive urban attraction content space and offer strategic implications for urban attraction management.",

          "authors": "Mireille Hildebrandt",
          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",

          "abstract": "Background: Underpinning ongoing colonisation of the lands now known as Australia, scientific racism in colonial research delivered flawed results by building Indigenous inferiority into methodology to produce dehumanising conclusions of First Nations Peoples. Scientific racism facilitated exclusion of First Nations Peoples from systems design and development; foregrounding ways exclusive and enforced colonial health systems cause First Nations health and wellbeing inequality. Inequities in foot health contribute to this inequality. This work describes and documents a process of First Nations-led authentic co-design for foot health research. This study represents ways and means to develop culturally responsive foot health research as judged by First Nations Peoples which will translate into improved and more responsive ways of delivering foot care. \nMethods: Non-Indigenous and First Nations Peoples sought authentic First Nations-led co-design process in foot health research methods, a governing First Nations Advisory Group, and broader First Nations governance and ethics approvals. Indigenous methodology, data sovereignty, and redistribution of power were imperative in ways of working. First Nations-led co-design developed culturally responsive semi-structured interviews to collect data. Talking with ten registered health practitioners who work closely with lower limb and foot health represented the right mix of participants and enough data to convey a more complicated mosaic of multi-faceted stories. First Nations expertise informed analytic induction and the use of inductive reasoning and constant comparison to identify common and overarching themes, and to perform thematic analysis.\nResults: Authentic First Nations-led ways of working in cross-sectional qualitative study design are documented. Results of data analysis following these ways of working will be published subsequently.\nConclusion: This work provides insights into working right ways in research which will underpin good foot health services with and for First Nations Peoples. The paper highlights ways of working that empowers First Nations Peoples in authentic co-design. First Nations-led foot health research changes ways of working to counter inequities in foot health caused and maintained by ongoing colonisation and systemic racism. This study provides qualified voiced lived experience which foot health researchers must listen to and receive learning and direction from.",

          "abstract": "Social belonging is a fundamental human need, which people experience to varying degrees in the workplace. Interventions to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues—ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: convergent, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and divergent, to colleagues from different network communities. Participants in a non-profit organization (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development program with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either convergent or divergent groups. Consistent with pre-registered expectations, convergent-condition participants reported more group solidarity and—three months post-intervention—more persistent ties to fellow group members and greater social belonging. Using computational linguistics and machine learning techniques to impute survey responses, we further show that convergent-condition participants experienced greater belonging than did a synthetic control group. Yet, pointing to the tradeoffs of the two forms of exposure, divergent-exposure participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality, independent of fellow-group-member ties. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.",

          "authors": "Daria Markava",
          "abstract": "While Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools keep gaining popularity among users from around the globe, their vast majority is developed in the west, mainly the US. Although plenty of studies have shown that NLP tools don't perform equally well in different languages and cultural contexts, little research has been conducted on the broader consequences of such performance disparities. By using the evidence from previous research, this study aims to bridge this gap and explore how NLP and the existing cultural hierarchies can be mutually constitutive. This paper first reviews existing literature on the NLP tools' performance in relation to underrepresented languages and non-western cultures. It then takes a critical theory approach to examining the broader cultural implications of the shortcomings identified during the review. More specifically, this work uses the concept of technoculture proposed by Leila Green, to connect the technological and cultural aspects of NLP, and refers to Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to explore how the bias in NLP tools reinforces dominant cultural narratives overrepresented in the training data. This study argues that NLP applications play a role in reinforcing the dominant norms, ideals, and ways of expression as universal, thus marginalizing alternative worldviews and imposing normative standards of communication onto the users of different backgrounds. The analysis concludes that, as the popularity of NLP tools keeps growing worldwide, their influence on what is perceived as \"common sense\" will increase too. This study emphasizes the importance of ensuring equitable representation of the user base throughout the whole NLP development pipeline.",

          "abstract": "La crisis financiera global de 2008 marcó el inicio de una década dominada por políticas de austeridad fiscal en gran parte del mundo desarrollado. Este documento presenta una revisión narrativa cualitativa de una extensa colección de literatura académica para sintetizar la evidencia sobre los efectos multifacéticos de la austeridad. Siguiendo un enfoque temático inspirado en las directrices PRISMA, se examinan las consecuencias económicas, sociales y políticas de estas medidas. El análisis revela un consenso mayoritario sobre los efectos recesivos de la austeridad, especialmente cuando se implementa durante crisis económicas, con multiplicadores fiscales negativos que a menudo exacerban la contracción del PIB. Socialmente, la austeridad se asocia con un aumento de la desigualdad, impactos negativos en la salud pública, consecuencias de género desproporcionadas y un debilitamiento de las redes de seguridad social. Políticamente, la evidencia vincula la austeridad con la erosión de la confianza en las instituciones, un aumento del populismo y la inestabilidad electoral. A pesar de la narrativa política que presenta la austeridad como una necesidad inevitable para la sostenibilidad fiscal, la literatura académica subraya sus altos costos y su cuestionable eficacia, abogando por enfoques de política económica más contextualizados y equitativos.",

          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in GLSL-based compute shaders that perform parallelized particle simulations and spectral mapping have contributed to the rise of audio-visualizers for mainstream use. This is primarily due to their non-code programming customizability and multimodal input accessibility. Stem-separation features possible in softwares such as Touchdesigner, Ableton Live, Max/MSP, and more pose the question of whether these audio-visualizers could bridge the physiological gap for DHH individuals in sonic environments. Using three different tests: lyric detection, post-listening visual correspondence, and heart rate synchronization, this study empirically serves to find practical evidence, when combined with biological, neurological, and cognitive research in music, on the extent to which audio-visualizers bridge this gap. It was determined through these three tests that yes, participants engaged with the dynamic variety of songs at an increased rate when provided access to the Touchdesigner particle displacement audio-visualizer, attributing perceptual and attentional changes to the multiple distinguishable aspects within the visualizer. I dive into how these findings might be applicable to various music environments that want to increase engagement to DHH individuals, or how these individuals might go about listening to music themselves.",

          "abstract": "Human collectives flourish when minds coordinate around shared expectations—what this paper terms coherence. Contemporary neuroscience demonstrates that coherence arises through three nested mechanisms:\n(1) the ACC–PFC loop achieves error closure, resolving internal conflict and prediction mismatch;\n(2) linguistic entrainment synchronizes cortical oscillations between speakers and listeners, producing shared rhythm; and\n(3) inter-brain synchrony appears during cooperative behavior, reflecting cross-person prediction.\nIntegrating hyperscanning, conflict-monitoring, and language-oscillation studies reveals that vigilance cues—threat, guilt, ambiguity—maintain amygdala and ACC activation, whereas resolution cues—trust, forgiveness, prosodic rhythm—recruit vmPFC regulation, promoting oxytocin release and cross-brain coupling. Coherence therefore represents an energy-efficient predictive-coding solution that minimizes uncertainty across agents. We outline measurable biomarkers and ethical applications for public health, digital design, and education, arguing that forgiveness and rhythmic reciprocity constitute biological prerequisites for sustainable social order.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transition to remote learning in K-12 education, exposing wide disparities in districts’ ability to sustain instruction. Much of the existing research highlights household-level inequities such as broadband access and parental support, but less is known about the institutional capacity of districts themselves. This study examines whether pre-pandemic administrative capacity, including digital infrastructure, budget transparency, and organizational planning, shaped districts’ ability to adapt during the crisis. Using publicly available panel data from 2018 to 2022 and a difference-in-differences (DiD) regression design, this study tests whether districts with stronger pre-2020 capacity achieved higher levels of remote learning success, measured through engagement, instructional weeks, and related outcomes. Results show that districts with higher administrative capacity prior to the pandemic delivered more resilient instruction and mitigated participation losses, particularly in lower-income contexts. These findings suggest that building institutional capacity before a crisis can reduce educational inequality and strengthen preparedness for future disruptions.",

Adopting reverse listing would not be straightforward; key issues include the social legitimacy of resulting laws, ensuring effective law enforcement, and the treatment of trade from alternative (i.e., non-wild) sources. Reverse listing is not a panacea for protecting biodiversity from overexploitation, and a combination of approaches is needed to effectively regulate the world’s wildlife trade.",

          "abstract": "Uncertainty in project deliverables remains a pervasive source of IT project failure, yet its structural origins are rarely operationalized. Sambamurthy and Zmud (2017) proposed a conceptual model linking IT project uncertainty to two fundamental dimensions: (1) the clarity or ambiguity of project deliverable specifications and (2) the number, diversity, and power of stakeholders involved. Despite its strong resonance with practice, this framework has not been empirically developed or tested.\nThis paper extends and operationalizes the Sambamurthy–Zmud model by defining measurable constructs for project deliverable specification clarity and stakeholder structure complexity and by theorizing their joint effect on IT project risk. Drawing on information processing theory, stakeholder theory, and socio-technical systems perspectives, the paper argues that IT project uncertainty is not merely a descriptive condition, but a primary driver of project risk. A conceptual model and testable hypotheses are proposed to guide future empirical research and managerial practice in digital transformation projects.",

          "abstract": "The year 2020 had its challenges with the extensive spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and civil disobedience movements highlighting already existing threats and grievances of the Nigerian people. Across the country, pockets of protest demonstrations were organised calling for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit in the Nigerian Police Force. The protest, while disregarding COVID-19 safety protocols prohibiting mass public gatherings, came up after graphic footage of an alleged shooting of a young Nigerian man in Ughelli area of Delta State  on the 3rd of October 2020 was released to the public. \n\nThis paper focuses on the motive behind the Nigerian youth’s blatant disregard of the COVID-19 measures during the ENDSARS protest of October 2020 and the implications of such civil disobedience on future peaceful protest movements, peace and security and Nigeria’s democracy. It examines whether non-violent civil disobedience is justified when the government fails to fulfill its social contract to protect citizens' rights and maintain order. In addition, the paper discusses how the use of force and suppression by security forces during peaceful protests violates human rights, aggravates insecurity, and undermines democratic principles. The paper concludes with recommendations on how to better protect citizens' rights in all situations, particularly concerning the right to peaceful protest.",

While spatial models emphasize external factors driving party behaviour, less attention has been given to internal party choices. This article innovates by proposing that parties differentiate between and make distinct strategical decisions regarding their ideological core and peripheral policy areas. We argue that parties maintain continuity in their ideological core while exhibiting greater flexibility in modifying their periphery. Using the Manifesto Project Corpus and an XLM-RoBERTa-based language model, we analyse manifesto sections to distinguish core from peripheral segments. Our findings show that parties take clearer stances in their ideological core while adapting their periphery more flexibly, with niche parties displaying this pattern more strongly than mainstream parties. Electoral setbacks lead parties to adopt more extreme peripheries, while cores remain stable. These results highlight the strategic importance of the core–periphery distinction in party communication and suggest that studies of party competition should consider where policy shifts occur within parties’ electoral programs.",

We estimate the effect of climate exposure on climate lobbying instances (extensive margin), amount (intensive margin), and targets (political entities). We find that more exposed companies, especially in terms of opportunities and regulation, are more likely to lobby. The type of climate exposure, both absolute and relative to industry peers, dictates whether firms lobby, how much they spend on lobbying, and their choice of government target.

          "authors": "Christopher Buckley; Guillaume Jacques",
          "abstract": "We present the largest and most wide-ranging survey to date of archaeological spindle whorls, across more than 350 sites in East Asia, including China, southeast Asia, the Himalayas, and the Silk Road routes. Hand spindles were used to produce yarn in the quantities necessary for loom-woven textiles, and they are an indicator of the emergence and spread of this technology. We demonstrate that loom weaving arose in three distinct zones in China, and that wool-spinning technology was introduced later by pastoral/nomadic peoples arriving from the West. We introduce a novel workflow for the analysis of archaeological data, based around estimated moment of inertia of whorls, and we demonstrate its application. We find that there are differences in whorl types and trends between the three zones, corresponding to differing motivations for producing yarn; for warmth and protection (in the north) and fine textiles for status (in central and southern regions). The appearance of weaving is linked in broad terms with the advent of rice and millet agriculture, but more closely with the sedentary lifestyles necessary for extended bast fiber processing and weaving sequences. We show that whorl moments of inertia are markers of Liangzhu culture sites in the lower Yangtze river, and map the emergence and collapse of this early stratified culture. We also review the usefulness of spindle whorl shapes as cultural markers and comment on the opportunities and limitations of this approach.",

          "abstract": "While cultural evolution has matured into a fully-fledged field, the science of cultural transmission remains underdeveloped. Most existing models still rely on naive assumptions of discrete trait imitation, while more complex transmission models for continuous traits are virtually non-existent. This paper fills the void by introducing a continuous transmission model that integrates biased transmission, conformity, and three distinct variance components into a single probability density function; one that still draws inspiration from the original biometric models that shaped early thinking about biological inheritance at the end of the 19th century.\nParticipants played a trivia-style guessing game in an app, being exposed to the answers of previous participants (“cultural parents”) and providing numeric estimates (“cultural offspring”) that serve as a continuous heritable trait for analysis.\nThis approach yields clear evidence for three key features long hypothesized to distinguish cultural from biological inheritance: people conform to majority input, aligning with mutually similar social cues; they systematically adjust their estimates toward the correct answer (guided variation); and their estimate variance is not constant, but scales with the variance of presented cues. All three effects can be reliably estimated within a single generative model.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms, such as TikTok, have rapidly transformed digital media consumption, with billions of active users worldwide. Their design features, such as algorithmic personalization, endless scrolling, and rapid novelty, have raised concerns about mobile overuse and its associated adverse effects on well-being. However, evidence on whether short-form videos increase mobile usage remains limited. To address this gap, we estimate the causal effect of short-form video platforms on mobile usage behavior using individual-level data (N=1,764) drawn from a representative panel of U.S. mobile device users. Specifically, we compare TikTok adopters to adopters of Instagram/Facebook during the period when short-form video was the key distinguishing feature of TikTok (i.e., before these competitors introduced their own short-form video products), thereby shedding light on the effect of exposure to short-form videos. We find that using short-form video platforms significantly increases total mobile usage duration (up to 17%) and reduces average time away from the mobile phone (by -20%), but does not consistently affect the number of daily sessions. Effects are disproportionately higher among individuals who previously used their phones less, relative to those with higher baseline usage. Contrary to fears about nocturnal overuse, effects are only significant during daytime hours. Surprisingly, older individuals have significantly larger increases in mobile sessions per day from usage of short-form video platforms compared to younger individuals. Altogether, our results show a behavioral mechanism through which short-form video platforms contribute to mobile overuse, offering new insights into theories of digital addiction and highlighting the importance of promoting healthier digital engagement.",

While existing research has explored the interplay between political knowledge and affective polarization, this study introduces a novel theoretical distinction between political knowledge and political overconfidence. Using American National Election Studies (ANES) data from 2020 and 2024 (N = 6,323 and N = 3,030), we develop a scale to measure political overconfidence and explore its relationship with affective polarization. Our findings reveal a consistent correlation between political overconfidence and heightened levels of affective polarization (β = 14.1–35.7, p &lt; 0.05), whereas political knowledge exhibits smaller, less robust associations (β = 4.6–4.9). This pattern holds across partisan groups, though the strength of the association varies significantly, with the overconfidence effect more than doubling between 2020 and 2024. These results highlight the importance of political overconfidence in understanding affective polarization in an era of information abundance and suggest the need for further exploration into whether political overconfidence mediates, moderates, or covaries with other drivers of partisan animosity.",

          "authors": "Minh-Xuan A. Truong",
          "abstract": "Den Stora Älgvandringen (DSÄ), Sweden’s annual livestream of the spring moose migration, provides a rare counterpoint to platform cultures organised around speed, novelty, and metrics. This article conceptualises DSÄ as a digital campfire: a ritual ecology of attention and companionship grounded in ecological temporality and more-than-human presence. Drawing on a multi-sited qualitative corpus (programme archives, chat transcripts, and public Facebook discussions), the analysis shows how participation layers together silent dwelling, conversational companionship in chat, and year-round tending by core “flamekeepers” who welcome newcomers, share knowledge, and maintain continuity across seasons. Rather than centring spectacle or narrative climax, DSÄ organises collective watching around waiting, uncertainty, and seasonal return, cultivating arts of attentiveness and shared memory. Situated in public service media, the livestream stands outside monetisation logics, which affords editorial independence while exposing the project to political and budgetary pressures. The value that emerges is durational and relational: presence as participation, rhythm as meaning, and co-presence with more-than-human life as a public good. The article advances three contributions: it specifies the digital campfire as an analytical concept distinct from brand-led uses of the term; it demonstrates how slow, multispecies media can sustain communal care and informal expertise; and it reframes value in digital culture in terms of continuity and ecological attunement rather than virality and reach.",

          "abstract": "Studies on gene-by-family SES interaction (GxSES) in educational outcomes have produced mixed results. This study builds on a sociocontextual perspective, emphasizing that genetic influences are shaped by broader social forces besides family, including gender and institutional context. For example, some of the previous sociogenetic studies indicate that particularly early school tracking suppresses the genetic influences. We analyzed gene-by-environment interactions (GxE) by parental education and children's gender using large twin registers from Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands employing non-parametric gene-environment interaction models. Our results indicated that genetic influences in Germany were weaker and shared environmental effects stronger than in other countries. We did not find significant gender differences in genetic or environmental effects on educational attainment in the studied countries. Analyses of GxSES revealed that the interactions depend on gender and country context. For example, in some countries, we observed negative interaction among women, with the genetic effect being weaker among children from high-SES families. Among men, the results indicate that GxSES can have either a positive or a negative direction. We conclude that the institutional context and gender can shape gene-environment interactions related to educational attainment. \n\nKeywords: genes, environment, gender, education, family SES, educational tracking",

This study distinguishes itself from previous research - which has primarily relied on conceptual, qualitative, or survey-based methods - by utilizing Google Trends data from 2004 to 2022 in the US. Using these data, the study innovatively constructs a series of time-series variables to examine Americans' interest in the Second Coming. The findings reveal several key insights. First, public interest in the Second Coming has been generally declining, with a modest resurgence observed since 2019. This trend aligns with previous survey-based research. Second, U.S. public perception of signs of Jesus’ Second Coming shifted over time. From 2017–2019, only Middle East events and the 2017 eclipse were viewed positively as signs of the Second Coming. From 2020–2022, war, famine, gospel preaching, and Middle East events were seen as signs, while Trump-related false prophecies and eclipse overreach reduced interest. Christian persecution remained insignificant throughout. These conclusions are supported by fundamental analysis and contribute to the broader understanding of Christian beliefs in the US. This study makes a unique contribution to the literature on American Christian perspectives by providing novel empirical evidence.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to an array of negative health outcomes, but the bulk of research in this area has not focused on investigating ACEs in a Native American context. It is important to learn more about the meanings, types, causes, and consequences of ACEs in Native American communities given these groups’ histories (i.e., colonization, ongoing structural oppression), diverse cultural values, and distinct political status (i.e., sovereign nations). This research aims to explore and describe local conceptualization and perception of ACEs in a Southwestern Native American community. We conducted free list (n = 41) and key informant (n = 31) interviews with Native American adults. Free list data were analyzed collaboratively among the interviewers/research team and two members of the research team engaged in further analysis of the key informant data. Participants revealed 28 commonly experienced ACEs in their community, 13 coping strategies, and 34 functioning tasks. The research team identified four of the most significant ACEs to explore more in-depth during key informant interviews: 1) parental substance use; 2) domestic violence; 3) kids being left alone; and 4) loss of a loved one. Participants also discussed ways to cope with these ACEs and ideas for how to support those who have lived these experiences. The findings are an important start to building an evidence base for understanding and intervening on ACEs in Native American communities.",

ACEs are correlated with a variety of health problems, among them substance abuse and suicidal behaviors. Despite historical and contemporary efforts to assimilate and eradicate American Indian communities and cultures, these communities are resilient and continue to benefit from unique cultural strengths and values surrounding health today. The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) leverages tribal sovereignty to implement programs and policies to address health inequities in their community. The Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health supported work toward health equity in the community through developing the My Pathway to Healing intervention aimed at supporting adults struggling with substance abuse and/or suicidal behaviors by addressing trauma, including historical trauma and ACEs.\nMethods: This pilot randomized trial will assess the feasibility and preliminary impacts of the My Pathway to Healing intervention with a two-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. We will use stratified randomization and 1:1 allocation to assign participants to receive either the intervention or the current standard of care (those randomized to receive standard of care will be offered the intervention upon completion of the study). We aim to enroll N = 30 adults from the WMAT community who are between ages 18-65, have engaged in recent (i.e., past 90 days) suicidal, self-harm, or binge substance use behavior, who have experienced at least two ACEs, and who are currently experiencing elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Participants will be recruited through the local community-based suicide surveillance system by Community Mental Health Specialists. Analysis will be conducted to assess feasibility of implementing a larger trial in the future and whether the intervention decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress and increases hopefulness and communal mastery. \nDiscussion: The My Pathway to Healing intervention leverages WMA cultural strengths and fills an important gap in programming available to older adults in the WMAT community. This trial will yield results on the utility of a multi-problem approach to addressing similar issues stemming from historical and contemporary trauma.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04585906.

This study aims to systematically synthesize and analyze empirical evidence regarding the performance of BAZNAS across three key dimensions: efficiency, effectiveness, and governance, amidst the rapid wave of digitalization. This research employs the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol. Through a search process across the Scopus, Google Scholar, and SINTA databases, 40 relevant journal articles published between 2015-2025 were identified and analyzed in-depth. The synthesis results show a consensus that BAZNAS is effective in its poverty alleviation programs (as measured by the CIBEST Model and NZI) but faces challenges in operational efficiency (identified via DEA/SFA studies) and uneven implementation of governance. A research gap was found, namely the lack of studies integrating these three performance dimensions to explain their reciprocal relationships. As its main contribution, this study proposes an integrated conceptual framework that positions governance (GCG) as a fundamental independent variable influencing operational efficiency and program effectiveness, with digital technology adoption acting as a moderating variable. This framework can serve as a reference for future empirical research.\nKeywords: BAZNAS, Systematic Literature Review, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Zakat Governance, Conceptual Framework, PRISMA.",

To date, no national studies have chronicled the financial, material, or psychological stressors that U.S. social work students experience during field practicum. To address this gap, student advocates and participatory action researchers collaboratively developed and administered a cross-sectional online survey of BSW and MSW students undertaking field placements in Spring 2023. The analysis sample (N = 635) was geographically diverse, with individuals residing in 40 states across the country. Comparatively more respondents lost weight due to food insecurity (15.4%) than received payment for their practicum labor (12.8%). More than half of respondents reported experiencing housing insecurity (56.8%) and/or clinically significant depression symptoms (56.2%). One quarter reported that their field placement organizations had unfair personnel practices or that they were expected to work beyond scheduled placement hours. Students from underserved backgrounds reported disproportionate financial hardships.

To date, there are no national studies in the U.S. of the basic needs and wellbeing of students in field education.

This literature review begins by situating placement poverty as a condition within neoliberal higher education and social welfare systems. Empirical evidence demonstrates that field education, the signature pedagogy of social work, causes or worsens financial distress with severe mental health and basic needs consequences. Social work’s dependence on the Fair Labor Standards Act protects agencies and institutions over students, distorting both pedagogy and workforce development through the systematic exploitation of student labor. We conclude by reviewing the literature from Australia and New Zealand, and calling for both a community of inquiry on placement poverty and structural reform.

I demonstrate that the classic irrelevance result--that the cost of financial hedging does not impact the choice of currency invoicing--rests on the assumption that sellers set prices ex-ante and fulfill any order size ex-post. I show that when quantities are also sticky, in the sense that the order quantity is in part pre-specified, then financial hedging affects the optimal currency of invoicing choice. My theory incorporates the cost of FX financial hedging into the classic theory of optimal currency choice, which relies on real hedging. I show that the optimal currency choice takes into account the relative ability of buyers and sellers to bear exchange rate risk. This financial hedging channel generates feedback between macroprudential policies, such as capital controls, and the optimal currency of invoicing.  I highlight a \"dollarization dilemma\": capital control policies that aim to reduce dollar borrowing are partially offset by an endogenous substitution into dollar-invoiced trade, which amplifies the local economy's exposure to the dollar's movements.",

          "abstract": "Heatwaves have emerged as a pressing environmental and public health issue, including in\nhistorically temperate regions poorly acclimatized to extreme heat. Despite this urgency,\nlittle is known about the social processes shaping heat exposure and limiting people’s ca-\npacities to adapt. Focusing on England, this paper examines travel behaviour adaptations\nto summer heatwaves from 2007–2019 and the heat-vulnerability factors shaping responses.\nA multi-level modelling approach links England’s National Travel Survey with ERA5 cli-\nmate re-analysis data to examine patterns of stay-home and medical-trip-making. Overall,\npeople widely shelter at home during extreme heatwaves yet are slightly more active during\nmoderate ones. Distinguishing across heat-vulnerability factors, people working or having\nworked in manual/routine occupations are less likely to shelter at home during extreme\nheatwaves, older individuals remain more active during moderate heatwaves while those\nwith mobility difficulties are more likely to withdraw into their homes, and medical services\nare sought more by home-renters and less by non-White individuals.",

          "authors": "Georg Lorenz; Claudia Neuendorf; Camilla Rjosk",
          "abstract": "Heterogeneity is a key contextual factor shaping social structure, inequality, and cohesion. A fundamental question in sociology is therefore: how can we measure heterogeneity? Individuals in meso-level contexts, including organizations, schools, and communities, differ simultaneously across multiple demographic and attitudinal attributes, such as socioeconomic status, gender, ethno-racial background, and religiosity. These differences can overlap or cut across each other. Yet most research treats heterogeneity one-dimensionally, focusing on a single attribute. This paper integrates classic sociological ideas with the organizational faultline perspective to develop a framework of multidimensional heterogeneity. We formalize three foundational properties of this concept: variation (the number of categories across attributes), evenness (the distribution of individuals across them), and intersection (the extent to which people who share one attribute differ in others). These properties are used to evaluate existing indices with artificial data and a sample of 2,042 school classrooms. Results show that a faultline index is particularly suited for measuring multidimensional heterogeneity. By clarifying what indices measure and guiding researchers in selecting those that fit theoretical concerns, this paper advances research on diversity, cohesion, and stratification.",

Se utilizó un diseño mixto con triangulación, combinando un componente cuantitativo basado en técnicas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural y un modelo BERT para clasificar los comentarios, y un componente cualitativo que reconstruyó una cronología de eventos y analizó la relación entre los picos de conversación digital, los paros de transportistas y la cobertura mediática Los resultados revelan que la conversación digital no se activa por delitos aislados, sino por la ocurrencia de paros que obligan a los medios tradicionales a cubrir el tema, generando un aumento abrupto de la interacción en línea. Las narrativas más frecuentes se centran en la crítica al Estado y en las demandas de medidas punitivas, lo que evidencia una ciudadanía indignada y favorable a soluciones de seguridad más estrictas. La reacción mediática se presenta como tardía y reactiva, lo que retrasa la incorporación del problema en la agenda pública y prolonga la sensación de desprotección Este trabajo aporta un marco replicable para el estudio de fenómenos de criminalidad en entornos digitales y demuestra el papel de la protesta social como detonante de la visibilización y discusión en línea, ofreciendo insumos para comprender cómo la presión ciudadana configura la agenda mediática y política.",

We argue that there are serious legal, ethical, and practical pitfalls associated with the informal dissemination of DHS data. While the future of existing DHS datasets remains in flux with many stakeholders interested in preserving this resource, the global health and demographic research community should diversify its use of data sources, invest in strengthening data infrastructure in LMICs, and share data management and use practices publicly to accelerate research progress. Although interim funding by the Gates Foundation buys time to develop a new model of both data collection and data ownership and distribution, the need for a permanent, sustainable home for DHS data continues to be paramount.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the multigroup Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca (mKBO) decomposition, a methodological innovation that extends the traditional KBO approach beyond binary group comparisons. While conventional KBO decompositions require potentially arbitrary choices of reference groups that can significantly affect results, the mKBO generalization uses the sample average as a standardized reference point. This approach allows researchers to decompose differences between each group and the sample average into components attributable to differences in characteristics (endowment effect), differences in returns to those characteristics (coefficient effect), and their interaction. We address methodological challenges unique to multigroup settings, including specification issues, situations of biased sampling, and conceptual challenges relating to the use of interactions or effect heterogeneity. We illustrate the method’s utility through an analysis of racial income disparities in the United States, demonstrating how education prevalence and returns create patterns of cumulative advantage for White and Asian Americans while reinforcing disadvantage for other racial groups.",

Building on this foundation, we demonstrate how macro-level regularities, including those empirical patterns accurately identified by Marxism, emerge and evolve from micro-level mechanisms. Ultimately, this research develops theoretical tools such as \"Social Internal and External Adaptation and Their Co-adaptation\" and the \"Social Ripple Model,\" applying them to interpret several contentious historical issues. This study aims to transcend the traditional dichotomy between reductionism and holism, establishing a mechanistic theoretical framework for sociology that is compatible with contemporary natural sciences.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The study aims to shed new light on current fertility behavior by examining the relationship between housing tenure, perceived housing satisfaction, and fertility intentions in the Nordic countries.\nBackground: The declining fertility rate in the Nordic countries since the 2010s has challenged previous fertility theories. Among the many factors that may influence fertility behavior, housing has gained increased attention. Yet the link between housing and fertility intentions in the Nordic context remains insufficiently investigated.\nMethod: We use microdata from the Generations and Gender Survey - Round 2 Wave 1 for Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (N = 13,420) collected in 2020–2022. Logistic regression is used to assess variation in the housing-fertility relation by country, age, and parity.\nResults: Homeownership is positively linked to fertility intentions in Norway and Sweden, unrelated in Finland, and negatively associated in Denmark, likely reflecting Denmark’s tenure-neutral housing system and extensive rental sector. Housing satisfaction shows no overall association, but negative associations emerge among the youngest (18–24) and oldest (40–44) age groups.\nConclusion: Combining objective measures of tenure with subjective housing satisfaction provides a more nuanced understanding of how housing conditions intersect with fertility intentions in the Nordic countries. The results underscore the importance of institutional context and life-course stage in shaping the housing-fertility relationship.",

Researchers capitalize on this legal requirement through data donation studies, where they ask users to request their personal data from an online platform and then share them as part of a survey. We experimentally tested two strategies to boost participation in a pre-registered study with over 2000 YouTube, Instagram or LinkedIn users from Germany: we varied (1) how we invited people, either framing the study as a web survey or directly describing it as a data donation study, and (2) the motivational appeals highlighting either prosocial advantages or personal gains from donating data.\nWe found that neither study framing nor motivational appeals significantly affected people's willingness to donate data or their actual donation rates. However, framing the study from the start as data donation research led to significantly more people starting the study. Our results demonstrate that researchers need to consider how they design invitations to data donation studies, while revealing that study framing or motivational appeals fail to increase respondents' willingness to donate or their actual donation behavior.",

          "abstract": "Accurate mortality forecasts are central to policy, insurance, and demographic research. Yet most existing approaches rely on age–period models, limiting their ability to capture the real experiences of birth cohorts. We address this gap by developing and evaluating new models for cohort mortality forecasting. Specifically, we extend the Lee–Carter framework with two cohort-specific variants and introduce Cohort Constrained P-splines (CCP-splines), a flexible method that embeds demographic constraints into a smoothing framework. Out-of-sample validation demonstrates that CCP-splines outperform not only the cohort LC variants but also the conventional diagonal Lexis approach, which derives cohort patterns from classic Lee–Carter age-period forecasts. Applications to eight populations confirm the advantages of CCP-splines, showing improved fit, reduced bias, and more reliable uncertainty estimates. By combining statistical rigour with demographic knowledge, this study provides a practical and flexible framework that positions CCP-splines as a new benchmark for cohort mortality forecasting.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how different types of newspapers in three distinct national contexts—the UK, Germany, and Sweden—report about polarization, and whether such coverage may in itself contribute to fuel further polarization. Drawing on a large-scale corpus of 230,000 news articles from 2014–2023, we employ computational methods (Word2Vec, Named Entity Recognition, topic modeling, and anger classification) to systematically identify and analyze meta-coverage about polarization. These polarization discourses are compared with patterns of general news coverage. Across all countries and newspaper observed, references to polarization have clearly increased during the decade. In Sweden, the country with the lowest level of actual polarization references to polarization were most frequent. Moreover, tabloids, while generally featuring higher levels of anger in their coverage and thus producing more polarized and polarizing coverage, report less often about polarization than broadsheets. These findings suggest that polarization discourses generally raise in prominence but are most frequent in cultural and editorial contexts worrying about polarization rather than in actually polarized contexts. This underscores the need for nuanced, cross-national perspectives that investigate how media frame and write when discussing potentially polarized issues.",

          "abstract": "The study of charisma, variously referred to as “leadership,” “charm,” or “dominance,” is now pursued by a variety of subfields. Although such work has provided new insights into how charismatic people present themselves, this proliferation of terminology and data has produced few, if any, advancements in our understand of what charisma is. In pursuit of a consilient, and substantive, advancement in our theoretical understanding of the nature of charisma, this paper accomplishes four objectives. First, we review and synthesize empirical and theoretical work over the last several decades as it relates to charisma and related concepts. Next, we introduce a novel reframing of charisma which can parsimoniously account for existing findings—charismatic figures are disproportionately attending to, and directing others’ attention toward, peoples’ ideal selves. We then leverage this interpretation to suggest a novel insight—situations, and not just individuals, can be charismatic. Finally, we conclude with a description of ten testable hypotheses which can plausibly deepen our theoretical understanding of charisma.",

          "abstract": "Mass mobilization has a profound impact on regime stability and democratization. Yet, predicting mass mobilization has received far less attention than predicting armed conflict, despite its clear practical and policy relevance. Predicting protests is still uncommon, particularly at subannual levels with wider geographical coverage due to limited granular data. I propose a new data source to both measure levels of contention and predict protest activity: changes to Wikipedia pages. Topics discussed in society, such as human rights, media freedom, elections, censorship, or food security, are also reflected and debated online on relevant Wikipedia pages. Wikipedia data are available in real time, provide global coverage, and are relatively easy to source and process, which makes them exceedingly attractive for near-real time forecasting and early warning systems. I test my argument by predicting both pro- and anti-government protest incidences and numbers at the country-month level. Empirical evidence suggests that Wikipedia page changes offer a promising new approach. The new measures are compared with more traditional indicators to illustrate the added value and show that Wikipedia data help improve our ability to predict protests both on their own and in combination with other models. The findings contribute to research on repression and resistance as well as ongoing efforts to forecast protests.",

          "abstract": "The sibling correlation, or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), is a widely used omnibus measure of the total impact of family background on socioeconomic outcomes in social stratification research. A growing literature compares these correlations across subgroups defined by family-level characteristics (e.g., race, parental education) to test theories of social reproduction, such as parental compensation or reinforcement. In this note, I highlight the ambiguities involved in meaningfully interpreting such subgroup variation. I first define the theoretical estimand of intergenerational transmission that researchers are arguably most interested in, and then formally demonstrate why group-specific ICCs do not identify this estimand. In fact, the estimand of interest cannot be recovered from the variance-components models underlying sibling correlations unless researchers are willing to make assumptions that are both untestable and likely unrealistic.",

          "abstract": "This study examines gender differences in financial stress and anxiety among U.S. college students and evaluates whether financial stress predicts anxiety, and whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Data from the 2023–2024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being.  Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning. Interventions targeting financial stress may improve both emotional well-being and academic performance, particularly for students facing elevated financial and psychological vulnerability.",

Results indicate that students with higher anxiety scores were significantly more likely to use AI for health purposes and to access professional mental health services. Among students who use AI for health, those with greater anxiety were also more likely to report using formal mental health services. Gender and academic fields also influenced AI use. Female students were less likely than male students to use AI for health purposes, despite being more likely to seek professional help. Students in health-related and STEM fields reported greater AI use than those in the humanities and arts. These findings highlight the importance of designing responsible AI tools that account for students’ mental health needs and emphasize the need for further research into how students engage with these tools during periods of psychological distress.",

This research investigates the utilization of various machine learning algorithms to forecast stroke risk, with a specific emphasis on tackling the widespread issue of class imbalance found in stroke prediction datasets. We conduct a thorough assessment of the performance of several models, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression, analyzing both the original imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset created using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Our results indicate that although the initial accuracy of the models on the imbalanced dataset was substantial, the implementation of SMOTE provided a more accurate evaluation of model efficacy, with Random Forest attaining the highest accuracy at 92%. This study highlights the critical role of class balancing methods such as SMOTE in improving the predictive capabilities of machine learning models within medical applications. The findings of this research carry considerable implications, as enhanced stroke prediction models can facilitate better patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation through timely interventions.",
