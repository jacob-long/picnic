However, children must also build a cognitive and neural system that can support efficient use of this information for real-time language processing.  To address this gap, the present study aimed to identify neural systems supporting real-time word recognition in school-age children (2nd to 4th graders). We investigated the relationships between real-time word recognition and brain structure (cortical thickness and area), focusing on how these links are influenced by age and language ability. Our analysis revealed two key dimensions of word recognition: Activation Rate, the speed at which lexical candidates accrue evidence, and Competition Resolution, the ability to suppress irrelevant candidates. Cortical thickness emerged as a crucial factor, with thinner regions supporting more efficient processing and no relations were found to cortical area Cortical thickness of the ventral brain regions were primarily associated with Activation Rate, while cortical thickness of the dorsal regions were linked to Competition Resolution, with stronger involvement in younger and less skilled children. Individual variability in brain structure was robustly linked to real-time language processing, even after accounting for age and language ability. These findings underscore the importance of cortical thickness in efficient lexical processing and highlight the need for refined behavioral indices in neurocognitive research.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted emerging adult first-year college students’ daily lives and well-being. Adaptive emotion regulation (ER) is crucial for this developmental transition phase during challenging times. We assessed 1,796 ecological momentary assessments from 76 first-year students (aged 18–20, 71% female, 46% white) during the Spring 2020 COVID-19 campus lockdowns. Multilevel model results revealed that specific Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) based ER behaviors were associated with greater momentary well-being. We then contextualized participants’ likelihood to engage in ER behaviors based on day of the week and human interaction. We found that engaging in ER behaviors increased or decreased based on these factors; specifically,  participants were more likely to do nearly all the DBT ER behaviors if they recently interacted with others. This study contributes an ecologically valid understanding of how emerging adult first-year students navigate their emotional experiences and well-being within the confines of daily life during a pandemic.",

In this study, we used audience segmentation analysis through the Six Americas Short Survey to identify groups of climate opinion holders within a representative sample of Australians. We had 4857 participants tell us what it would take to change their current opinions about climate change and leveraged OpenAI’s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) to identify the presence or absence of themes (Nothing, Evidence and Information, Trusted Sources, Action, and Unsure) and subthemes in their responses. GPT performed at near-human levels, proving to be a highly useful tool for thematic analysis. Our analyses revealed that strong climate denialists and believers tended to display greater dogmatism, with increased likelihood of stating that nothing would change their mind and lower likelihood of being unsure. Results also highlighted the need for diverse forms of evidence and information and the importance of trusted sources of information across audience segments. These findings provide support for GPT’s utility in managing large datasets in the social sciences and offer participant-informed insights into climate opinion change.",

          "abstract": "To fulfill goals, humans make use of cognitive control, which is a suite of processes to\nplan and manage thoughts and actions. One such process is response inhibition, which entails\nstopping a response as goals change. Traditionally, response inhibition is measured in\nexperiments in which humans have unilateral responsibility for stopping the action. However, in\nthe real world, humans are increasingly sharing control with artificial intelligence (AI), with the\nparadigmatic case being partially automated cars. We designed an experiment that models the\nsharing of control between humans and AI in partially automated cars and found that when\nhumans (N=40) share control with an automated system that usually stops, human response\ninhibition is impaired when the automated system fails. This reveals a specific cost of sharing\ncontrol to human response inhibition, suggesting that the benefits of partial automation should\nbe weighed against the costs of impaired human cognitive control.",

          "authors": "Nick Fox; Matt N Williams; Stephen Robert Hill",
          "abstract": "Previous research has found positive correlations between manifestations of psychological distress such as anxiety, depression, stress, and belief in conspiracy theories. However, it remains unclear whether these relationships represent causal effects. We therefore tested whether anxiety, depression, and stress affect (and are affected by) belief in conspiracy theories in a preregistered longitudinal study. We sampled participants from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (N = 970), with seven monthly waves (October 2022 to March 2023). Using a multiple indicator random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we found support for only one of 15 preregistered hypotheses: a small cross-lagged effect of anxiety on belief in conspiracy theories. We also found no evidence of belief in conspiracy theories itself provoking psychological distress. Our findings provide grounds for scepticism of the notion that beliefs in conspiracy theories are often motivated by psychological distress or feelings of “existential threat.”",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated into professional settings, yet little is known about its use in school psychology. As AI technologies continue to evolve, understanding how school psychologists are incorporating them into their practice is essential for guiding ethical and effective implementation. This study surveyed 199 school psychologists across the United States to examine their current use of AI, attitudes toward its application, and perceived ethical and practical concerns. Results indicate that while some practitioners have adopted AI for tasks such as report writing, data analysis, and communication, many remain hesitant due to concerns about privacy, bias, and the need for clear professional guidelines. Despite growing interest in AI’s potential to enhance efficiency and streamline workflows, formal training and institutional policies on AI use remain limited. Findings highlight the need for clearer guidance, professional development opportunities, and ethical considerations to ensure AI’s responsible integration into school psychology.",

We studied undergraduate participants (N = 133) in a climate crisis class (intervention condition) and participants not enrolled in the class (control condition).

First, as preregistered, we found that some knowledge items as well as self-reported collective efficacy increased significantly for the intervention compared to control participants. Second, in the intervention group itself, and contrary to our preregistration, there were no significant relationships between knowledge / belief elements and real-world collective action, even though many participants engaged in substantial action. These results raise questions about how analytic knowledge of the climate and ecological predicament is measured, and how it is taught. They also point to the need for research of this kind to also measure how non-analytic elements, such as group dynamics, drive collective action participation.

          "authors": "Martin Skov; Marcos Nadal",
          "abstract": "Can art improve health and wellbeing? The rapidly growing art therapy literature claims that there is solid evidence that engaging with art ameliorates mental and physical disorders and increases wellbeing. This claim is used to justify numerous arts-based clinical interventions and health policies, so it deserves thorough scrutiny. Here we show that the evidence cited in favor of the efficacy of art therapy interventions is conceptually and methodologically flawed. Conceptually, experiments investigating the effects of arts-based interventions on health do not include appropriate tests nor control conditions that would allow demonstrating that the putative effects actually owe to the healing power of art: (i) they fail to define what art is, making it impossible to compare the effect of “art” and “non-art” stimuli and activities on health and wellbeing; (ii) they fail to demonstrate that “art” stimuli and activities elicit a distinct class of “art” experiences that modulate the mechanistic causes of disorders; (iii) and they fail to include causal manipulations of physiological processes believed to be mechanisms of action that could prove that art-induced processes affect the etiology of disorders. Methodologically, most studies cited as proof for the efficacy of art therapy lacked such common clinical trial procedures as defining the therapeutic agent, randomizing group assignment, controlling for patient or researcher allegiance, controlling for the effects of other concurrent interventions and medications, comparing art-based interventions to other kinds of interventions, or conducting and reporting statistical analyses appropriately. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence that art objects and activities can induce physiological changes to the human nervous system that result in health improvements and wellbeing. We discuss why proponents of art therapy have neglected these problems and the ethical implications for patients who are treated using art therapy.",

          "abstract": "Social problems and competencies are important characteristics that affect the developing child and important outcomes later in life. However, the development of social problems and competencies among children with a parental history of alcohol use disorder (COAs) is not well understood. Therefore, the current study aimed to describe the developmental trajectories of social problems and competencies in COAs and non-COAs. \nChildren and adolescents between the ages of 8 to 12 and their parents participated in a longitudinal study. Children completed the Youth Self Report, and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Questionnaire. The Youth Self Report and the Child Behavior Checklist were completed annually for three years, while the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were completed at Time 1. \nLatent Growth Curve Modeling was used to assess the effect of COA and sex on the development of social problems and competencies over time. There were significant interactions between sex and COA on child reports of social problems and parent reports of social competencies. \nResults suggest that COA girls may be particularly at risk for concerning social development trajectories in youth. Future studies should determine what aspects of living with a parent with an alcohol use disorder led to COA girls having difficulties with healthy social development. This may inform resources and aid these children during critical developmental periods.",

Method: This longitudinal investigation examined the pursuit of self-identified goals in 893 students attending 14 US universities across 4 timepoints spanning 2 years using multi-level random-intercepts cross-lagged panel modeling. Between-persons, welcoming accountability, personal responsibility, and goal progress satisfaction were positively associated. Results: At the within-person goal-level, welcoming accountability and personal responsibility predicted higher subsequent levels of each other. However, satisfaction with goal progress only predicted subsequent welcoming accountability. Exploratory analysis of goal types revealed that participants reported more accountability, responsibility, and progress satisfaction for approach (versus avoidance) goals. Interpersonal (versus intrapersonal) goals involved greater welcoming of accountability and progress satisfaction. Conclusions: This cybernetic approach to studying welcoming accountability in goal pursuit advances personality science and accountability theory.",

          "authors": "Joris Mulder; Julius M. Pfadt; Eric-Jan Wagenmakers",
          "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product-moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the re- search community.",

          "abstract": "Instruments for rating socioemotional behavior with a strong theoretical basis, broad coverage of behaviors, and adequate validation are rare. Here, the Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI) Form SERI (Socio(E]motional Regulation Inventory) was employed in a longitudinal population-based sample of Finnish twins at age 17 to study: (1) the structure of self-ratings on self-regulation of socioemotional behavior, (2) construct, criterion, concurrent, and predictive validity of the scales, as well as invariance analysis and (3) genetic and environmental factors contributing to individual differences in self-regulation. A bi-factor for behavioral and emotional self-regulation was interpreted as representing a p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity), and respective scales were formed for both. Behavioral regulation in each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale (comprising subscales for Hyperactive/Inattentive, Aggressive, and Anxious behavior) and a Prosocial behavior scale. Self-ratings on these scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14. Twin modeling indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors. The inventory can be used for self- and sibling ratings in population studies.",

          "abstract": "People vary widely in how strategically they guide their attention during visual search. What drives this variation? We contrasted two possibilities: one in which individuals are predisposed to attend to different stimulus aspects, and another in which individuals flexibly choose their strategies depending on the task parameters. Using the Adaptive Choice Visual Search (ACVS) paradigm, we measured participants’ search strategies while probing various display features to index how participants attended the displays. Experiment 1 showed that participants who attended the stimulus properties that are essential for the optimal strategy—specifically, the numerosity subset information—exhibited more optimal performance. In Experiment 2, we made the subset information irrelevant for optimal task performance and found no relationship between attention to the subsets and search optimality, which is consistent with the strategic choice account. Experiment 3 encouraged attention to the subset information without explicitly requiring optimal search. Results showed a boost in optimality, suggesting that overcoming a reluctance to engage in numerosity judgments fosters better strategy use. Overall, these results help to explain individual variation in attentional strategy use, with optimal searchers judiciously directing their attention to process the critical stimulus properties while non-optimal searchers avoid doing so.",

Results from dynamic structural equation modeling\nshowed that at the within-person level, higher than average levels of inconsistent discipline were\nlinked to higher than average levels of CU traits the next day. Among adolescents with higher\nperson-mean levels of parental warmth and non-harsh discipline, daily parental warmth and non-\nharsh discipline were protective against CU traits. Moreover, among adolescents with higher\nperson-mean levels of parental warmth, adolescent CU traits also evoked lower parental warmth\nthe next day. These findings have significant implications for understanding daily fluctuations in\nparenting behaviors and adolescent CP and CU traits, and inform novel parenting-based\ninterventions that capitalize on recent advances in mobile and other technology.",

          "authors": "Jason Geller; Yanina Prystauka; Sarah Elizabeth Colby; Julia R. Drouin",
          "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Purpose: Family navigation (FN) has emerged as a promising intervention for reducing barriers and addressing social and economic inequities in autism service delivery. Little is known regarding the implementation and effectiveness of FN for children with autism. The aims of this scoping review are to: (1) summarize the breadth, quantity, and characteristics of the existing literature on FN for children diagnosed with autism; (2) describe the models and outcomes of FN for this population; and (3) identify knowledge gaps and provide directions for future research.\n\nMethods: Authors used the Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews. Searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science, resulting in identification of 479 papers. Two independent raters completed title/abstract and full text screening, followed by extraction of pertinent data using a researcher-developed tool. Synthesis of results involved content and constructs analysis and descriptive numerical summaries.\n\nResults: 17 publications met inclusion criteria. Seven studies evaluated FN programs delivered by a professional or peer navigator. Three studies assessed FN tools. Overall, the studies reported positive impacts on family activation, family well-being, parental knowledge, and service utilization. Navigator programs were generally found to be feasible and acceptable. However, none of the navigator programs addressed their effect on wait times to services or child-specific outcomes. \n\nConclusion: FN is a promising intervention for improving family outcomes and increasing service utilization. Further research is needed to establish best practices, identify child- and family-centered outcome metrics, and promote scalability and sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. A network theory of tobacco withdrawal posits between-person differences in how withdrawal symptoms causally influence one another across time. Individuals with densely connected symptom networks that facilitate the perpetuation of withdrawal symptom activity across time are theorized to have more difficulty quitting due to intense withdrawal experiences that persist even after the events instigating initial increases in withdrawal intensity are no longer present. Method. Here, we test this theory by constructing withdrawal symptom networks using ecological momentary assessment data in 123 individuals who smoke cigarettes daily from a period during which they were smoking as usual and test the extent to which between-person differences in these networks predict change in smoking behavior during a 10-day smoking abstinence period.  Results. Individuals with symptom networks facilitating sustained withdrawal symptom intensity after symptom perturbation exhibited a less pronounced decrease in smoking between the smoking as usual and smoking abstinence period. Conclusions. Results support a network theory of tobacco withdrawal and highlight the significance of inter-symptom interplay in smoking cessation outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Humans have thousands of thoughts daily, often shaped by personal memories, goals, and environmental cues, that are deeply intertwined with emotional functioning. Our study explored if, how, and when common patterns of naturally occurring thought predict differences in emotion regulation (ER) ability across people and settings and, ultimately, well-being. Specifically, we examined how ongoing thought patterns shape ER variability—the ability to dynamically adjust and apply different emotion regulation strategies based on situational demands or personal goals—and negative affect in everyday life. Over seven days, 120 participants completed 3,286 experience sampling surveys to measure their ongoing thoughts, ER variability, and negative affect in daily life (data collected in 2023–2024). Principal components analysis identified common ‘thought patterns’, which we used to predict participants’ real-world ER variability and negative affect. One specific thought pattern—characterized by negative, intrusive, and distractive content—was linked to lower ER variability. This thought pattern also predicted increased negative affect, as captured by higher levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness and reduced social/emotional support, with the impact moderated by momentary ER variability. Social activities, such as texting or engaging in conversations, similarly mitigated the harmful effects of this thought pattern on well-being in daily life. Our findings illuminate how thought patterns influence ER dynamics and negative affect in complex real-world settings. They also underscore the protective power of social interactions, both digital and in-person, and the importance of enhancing flexible ER approaches to reduce the adverse effects of intrusive negative thoughts on mental health.",

          "authors": "James Lavers",
          "abstract": "Resistance to change is often attributed to habits, regression, cognitive rigidity, or avoidance behaviors, but these explanations fail to account for situational, unconscious behavioral overrides. This paper introduces Unconscious Clusters of Behavioral Artifacts (UCBAs)—developmentally anchored fallback responses that emerge under performance-based stressors or novel challenges requiring adaptation, bypassing adaptive adult responses. Unlike habits (Wood &amp; Rünger, 2016) or learned helplessness (Seligman, 1975), UCBAs are not passive; they actively redirect behavior into previously reinforced but outdated coping strategies. Rooted in psychosocial development (Erikson, 1950), stress-adaptive learning (Admon et al., 2020), and behavioral inhibition mechanisms (Gray &amp; McNaughton, 2000), UCBAs function as a neurocognitive safety mechanism, prioritizing predictability over progress. Unlike personality pathology (McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006), they are situational and reversible, overriding conscious intent without indicating chronic dysfunction. This framework positions UCBAs as distinct from existing models (Pittig et al., 2023; Diamond, 2013), illustrating how they override conscious intent rather than merely inhibiting action. The paper explores UCBA mechanisms, their implications for coaching and therapy, and strategies for disrupting these behavioral loops through structured intervention. Recognizing UCBAs expands our understanding of unconscious resistance, providing new pathways for behavioral adaptation and performance growth.",

Surveys contained questions measuring avoidant coping and number of dependent stressors experienced. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models were analyzed at both sites.\nResults\nResults from both samples indicated that students who tended to use avoidant coping also reported more dependent stressors overall.

          "abstract": "An important challenge in second language acquisition is learning how to produce novel sounds. Visual-acoustic feedback training has been shown to improve second language production, but it is still unclear whether training on isolated sounds transfers to words and is maintained over time. Forty-six Spanish speakers were trained to produce unfamiliar French vowels /e/-/ɛ/ through exposure to either single- or multiple-talker stimuli. On each trial, they heard a vowel, produced it, and received feedback showing the position of their vowel and the target in the acoustic space. Both groups showed improvements in vowel production, which transferred to words and were maintained twelve days later. However, better generalization – more accurate production when repeating vowels after an unfamiliar speaker - was maintained only in the multiple-talker group. This study shows that visual-acoustic feedback training is an effective method for improving second language production as the gains of such training demonstrate three key features for pedagogical practice: transfer, generalization and maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

          "authors": "Alexey Koshevoy; Jakub Szymanik",
          "abstract": "Both functional and lexical categories in natural languages are believed to be shaped by domain-general pressures for efficient information transmission and simplicity of representations. However, the origins of this simplicity-informativeness trade-off remain unclear, with previous research suggesting that it may stem from learning, communication, or both. In this paper, we propose that the domain-general bias for convexity -- a property whereby if a word applies to two objects in the conceptual space, it must also apply to all the objects between them -- fosters the optimization of this trade-off. Convexity, previously hypothesized to constrain the meanings of both content and logical words, likely reflects a fundamental property of cognitive representations shared across species, as evidenced by similar patterns in non-human animals. Using a gradual measure of convexity, shown to predict learning outcomes in artificial language learning experiments, we present evidence that color systems with the highest degree of convexity optimally balance simplicity and informativeness across different formulations of these measures. Additionally, we demonstrate that convexity is sensitive to rotations in color systems, with attested color systems exhibiting the highest degree of convexity. These findings suggest that the simplicity-informativeness trade-off emerges from the convexity of underlying representations, explaining why this trade-off is observed in both functional and content words, as lexicalization is likely constrained by convexity. Moreover, this explanation offers a more parsimonious account of why languages exhibit efficient phenomena like the simplicity-informativeness trade-off, relying solely on a single domain-general bias that applies across a broad range of linguistic categories.",

          "abstract": "Body dissatisfaction is closely linked to low self-esteem, reduced well-being, as well as mental health issues, and eating-related pathologies, which are increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly among women. Understanding gender differences in body dissatisfaction is therefore an important issue. Previous studies often rely on small, non-representative samples from single developed countries.\nThis study aims to analyze gender differences in body dissatisfaction using two large-scale international surveys, covering 70,000 teenagers aged 15 to 16 across 9 countries and 200,000 teenagers aged 11 to 16 across 41 countries. \nGirls report significantly higher body dissatisfaction than boys, regardless of Body Mass Index, socioeconomic background, age, or country. Additionally, for girls, body image concerns appear more central, with body dissatisfaction showing stronger negative associations with life satisfaction and self-efficacy compared to boys. Within countries, the gender gap is more pronounced among high-performing students, teenagers from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, older teenagers, and those with higher BMI.\nThe gender gap in body dissatisfaction varies across countries, primarily driven by greater variability in girls' body dissatisfaction. Countries with larger gender gaps also show wider gender disparities in life satisfaction, eating disorders and depression. \nNotably, body dissatisfaction satisfies the Gender Equality Paradox, with larger gender differences in more developed countries, mainly due to higher dissatisfaction among girls.\nWe also examine the role of social norms. Stereotypes associating women more with physical appearance than abilities are more prevalent in more developed countries. Moreover, these stereotypes are associated with greater body dissatisfaction among women and larger gender differences in body dissatisfaction. Our analysis suggests that these stereotypes may at least partly explain the Gender Equality Paradox in body dissatisfaction.\nBy identifying the patterns and drivers of gender differences in body dissatisfaction, this study provides a foundation for more effective strategies to address this important issue.",

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

A bi-factor for behavioral and emotional self-regulation was interpreted as representing a p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity), and respective scales were formed for both. Behavioral regulation in each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale (comprising subscales for Hyperactive/Inattentive, Aggressive, and Anxious behavior) and a Prosocial behavior scale. Self-ratings on these scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14. Twin modeling indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors.

The correlation between TMD symptoms and depression was significant even among the participants without a TMD diagnosis.

          "abstract": "Large language models and their use for text analysis have had a significant impact on psychology and the social and behavioral sciences in general. Key applications include the analysis of texts, such as social media posts, to infer psychological characteristics, as well as survey and interview analysis. In this tutorial paper, we demonstrate the use of the Python-based natural language processing software package transformers (and related modules from the Hugging Face Ecosystem) that allow for the automated classification of text inputs in a practical exercise. In doing so, we rely on pretrained transformer models which can be fine-tuned to a specific task and domain. The first proposed application of this model class is to use it as a feature extractor, allowing for the transformation of written text into real-valued numerical vectors (called \"embeddings\") that capture a text's semantic meaning. These vectors can, in turn, be used as input for a subsequent machine-learning model. The second presented application of transformer models is the end-to-end training (so-called \"fine-tuning\") of the model. This results in a direct prediction of the label within the same model that directly maps the text to the embeddings. While in the second case, results are usually better and training works more seamlessly, the model itself is often not directly interpretable. We showcase an alleviation of this issue via the application of post-hoc interpretability methods by calculating SHAP values and applying local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) in an attempt to explain the model's inner workings.",

It allows those reading a final research report to know which aspects of a study were decided before sight of the data, and which were added later. This enables informed evaluation of the severity with which scientific claims have been tested. We, as the British Neuropsychological Society Open Science Group, conducted a survey to explore awareness and adoption of open science practices within our field. Neuropsychology involves the study of relatively rare or hard-to-access participants, creating practical challenges that, according to our survey, are perceived as barriers to preregistration. We survey the available routes to preregistration, and suggest that the barriers are all surmountable in one way or another. However, there is a tension, in that higher levels of bias control require greater restriction over the flexibility of preregistered studies, but such flexibility is often essential for neuropsychological research. Researchers must therefore consider which route provides the right balance of rigour and pragmatic flexibility to render a preregistered project viable for them. By mapping out the issues and potential solutions, and by signposting relevant resources and publication routes, we hope to facilitate well-reasoned decision-making and empower neuropsychologists to enhance the transparency and rigour of their research.",

This study aims to assess the frequency, motivations, and perceived effectiveness of LLM use for mental health support or therapy-related goals among U.S. residents with ongoing mental health conditions who have used LLMs in the past year. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18-80 with internet access who had used at least one LLM in the past year and reported having an ongoing mental health condition. Participants completed an anonymous 35-question online survey, covering patterns of LLM use, reasons for use, perceived effectiveness, comparison with human therapy, and problematic experiences. Survey responses suggest substantial adoption of LLMs for mental health purposes, with 48.7% of participants using them for psychological support within the past year. Users primarily sought help for anxiety (73.3%), personal advice (63.0%), and depression (59.7%). Notably, 63.4% of users reported improved mental health from LLM interactions, with high satisfaction ratings for practical advice (86.8%) and overall helpfulness (82.3%). When comparing LLMs to human therapy, evaluations were generally neutral to positive, with 37.8% finding LLMs more beneficial than traditional therapy. Despite concerns, only 9.0% of users encountered harmful responses.",

Using an online survey designed in consultation with autistic people, we examined reasons why autistic adults living in the UK did not seek help from the National Health Service (NHS) when they last experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Participants who disaffirmed having sought help from the NHS (n = 754) were able to select from a prepopulated list of 20 reasons why and to enter their own. The three most commonly endorsed reasons were ‘I tried to cope and manage my feelings by myself’, ‘I did not think they could help me’, and ‘The waiting list is too long – no point’. Endorsement of reasons differed significantly with gender identity, age group, and degree of lifetime suicidality. Four themes emerged from analysis of free-form responses: NHS is ineffective, NHS as antagonistic, Fear and consequences, and Barriers to access.

          "abstract": "Insight, or the ‘Aha’ experience, is pivotal in the appreciation and engagement with various cultural products. This article explores how the feeling of insight contributes to the success of riddles and whodunits, two popular products with a strong cross-cultural appeal. We report a series of five experiments manipulating the probability of experiencing an insight when solving, or being provided with the solution of a riddle or a short whodunit story. Participants are more likely to declare wanting to consume and to share material that generates more insight. We also observe that many participants choose to consume a new riddle or a new whodunit instead of immediately finishing the experiment, but that only High Insight riddles, and not whodunits, were significantly preferred. These results suggest that feelings of insight play an important role in shaping some popular cultural products.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the content, consistency, and accuracy (i.e., convergence with self-assessment) of stereotypes about recreational users of common psychoactive substances. In Study 1 (N = 470), participants rated a typical occasional user of one of seven substances (cannabis, MDMA, heroin, LSD, cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol) on personality traits, values, and other attributes. Results revealed distinct and highly consistent stereotypes across substances. Study 2 (N = 1,163) assessed stereotype accuracy by comparing them to self-reports from an international sample of substance users. Accuracy (based on overall and distinctive similarity) was generally low, with cocaine user stereotypes revealing the highest accuracy. Modest accuracy was also found for MDMA, amphetamine, and heroin. These findings highlight the prevalence of consistent yet largely inaccurate stereotypes about recreational substance users in society. The discrepancy between stereotype agreement and accuracy is discussed in the context of the origins of these stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression have been shown to exhibit persistent underconfidence. The origin of such metacognitive biases presents a puzzle, given that individuals should be able to learn appropriate levels of confidence from observing their own performance. In two large general population samples (N = 230 and N = 278), we measure both “local” confidence in individual task instances and “global” confidence as longer run self-performance estimates while manipulating external feedback. Global confidence is sensitive to both local confidence and feedback valence – more frequent positive (negative) feedback increases (respectively decreases) global confidence, with asymmetries in feedback also leading to shifts in affective self-beliefs. Notably, however, global confidence exhibits reduced sensitivity to instances of higher local confidence in individuals with greater subclinical anxious-depression symptomatology, despite sensitivity to feedback valence remaining intact. Our finding of blunted sensitivity to increases in local confidence offers a mechanistic basis for how persistent underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance.",

          "abstract": "The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the ‘desperation threshold model’ (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or ‘cliff’, a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a ‘rock bottom’, a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people’s main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.",

This study seeks to address this gap by examining the impact of training with an AI-powered mobile application on nonnative sound perception and production. Participants completed a pretest assessing their ability to discriminate the second language English /iː/–/ɪ/ contrast and produce these vowels in sentence contexts. The intervention involved training with the Speakometer mobile application, which incorporated recording tasks featuring the English vowels, along with pronunciation feedback and practice. The posttest mirrored the pretest to measure changes in performance. The results revealed significant improvements in both discrimination accuracy and production of the target contrast following the intervention. However, participants did not achieve native-like competence. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-powered applications in facilitating speech acquisition and support their potential use for personalized, interactive pronunciation training beyond the classroom.",

Triggered by Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) reports, the intervention encouraged participants to activate their (digital) social support networks. \n\nMethods: Twenty-five participants completed 2,689 EMAs and received 377 JITAIs over an 18-day intervention period, including a micro-randomized trial design to compare four strategies to trigger an intervention: Fixed cutoff points of distress variables, personalized thresholds (through Shewhart Control Charts) of distress variable, momentary support need, and no intervention. \n\nResults: The results showed high feasibility, with participants completing 85% of EMA surveys, low study-related attrition rate (7%), and reporting minimal technical issues. Engagement and perceived helpfulness were heterogenous and moderate, with participants seeking support in one-third of triggered instances. JITAIs triggered by self-reported need for support were rated as more appropriately timed, helpful, and effective for promoting support-seeking behavior compared to those based on distress indicators, despite being triggered less frequently. Barriers such as time constraints and perceived unavailability of support providers likely affected support seeking behavior, as indicated by additional qualitative analyses. Exploratory effectiveness analyses indicate Cohen’s d effect sizes between 0.06 - 0.14 in reducing distress after JITAIs were received. \n\nConclusion: These findings demonstrate that a social support JITAI is feasible to implement, with high compliance and minimal technical issues. Yet, further research is needed to evaluate the JITAI’s effectiveness and to optimize trigger strategies in addressing individual needs and barriers to engagement.",

          "abstract": "Background: From time to time in life, people have to weigh losses and gains that occur at different points in time, a process called intertemporal choice. When faced with intertemporal choices, people's subjective value assessments of costs and benefits decrease over time, which is the phenomenon of delay discounting. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an individual's emotion and field cognitive styles on individual delay discounting. Method: College student from a university in Shandong were recruited to conduct the Embedded Figure Test. From these students, field-independent and field-dependent individuals were classified to complete the delay discounting task. Results: Delay discounting was larger for field-dependent individuals than for field-independent individuals; individuals' delay discounting was reduced in the positive emotion state compared to the negative emotion state. Importantly, for field-independent individuals, they had comparable delay discounting between the positive and negative emotion state. Whereas for field-dependent individuals, the delay discounting is larger in the negative emotion state than positive emotion state. Conclusions: Field cognitive styles modulate the emotion effect on individuals' delay discounting. Field-dependent individuals are more likely to choose immediate small rewards in the negative emotion state and delayed large rewards in the positive emotion state. Field-independent individuals have similar probabilities of choosing the rewards across both emotion state.",

          "authors": "Margaret Catherine Macpherson; Amber Brown; Lynden K Miles",
          "abstract": "As a foundation of social interaction, interpersonal coordination is boosted in prosocial contexts but undermined by negative situations. Exactly how social factors shape coordination is, however, unknown. Previous literature demonstrates that for coordination to emerge people must attend to their interaction partners. This evidence, however, draws from sterile laboratory studies employing heavy-handed manipulations of little interpersonal relevance. By contrast, in more naturalistic contexts subtle differences in how people attend to themselves and others (e.g., a lingering glance vs. a suspicious side-eye) can profoundly change the course of interaction. Understanding how social factors shape interpersonal coordination therefore requires consideration of aspects of attentional behaviour that better characterise everyday interaction. To this end, the current research employed virtual reality (VR) to explore how two core features of social attention, focus (self vs. other) and partner gaze (direct vs. averted), influence the spontaneous coordination of arm and head movements. The results indicated that: (i) coordination was enhanced in the other (cf. self) focus condition; and (ii) coordination was diminished in the averted (cf. direct) gaze condition. These findings provide novel evidence to indicate that the emergence of interpersonal coordination varies as a function of the everyday attentional behaviours that punctuate naturalistic social exchange. Of broad theoretical note, here we demonstrate that the among the factors constraining interpersonal coordination, the distribution of attention between self and other plays a meaningful role.",

          "abstract": "We employed a modified battery of cognitive and social tests from psychological sciences intended to reflect key components of teamwork. These tests were given to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to examine the capabilities of LLMs to contribute to teamwork. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. Language models performed well on action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These moments are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teams. Finally, LLMs had unique behaviours for interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how ‘off-the-shelf’ LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

          "abstract": "Given that emotional expressions are essential for navigating our social world, it is imperative that measures of facial expression recognition ability are psychometrically rigorous and easy to administer. Unfortunately, most studies to date have used face images of prototypically posed expressions, which lack the nuance and variation of real-life expressions and are often perceived as fake. To address the need for a more ecologically valid measure of expression recognition, we introduce the Naturalistic Expression Recognition Task (NERT), modeled after an established posed expression labeling task. We investigated whether the NERT shows expected associations with empathy and general cognitive ability, and whether these associations align with those found for the corresponding posed expression task, despite differences in the realism and perceived genuineness of the expressions. Across three studies, we found that the NERT had strong psychometric properties that make it well suited for examining individual differences in expression recognition ability. While both the NERT and the posed expression task showed similarly sized positive associations with measures of cognitive and affective empathy, the NERT exhibited a stronger positive association with cognitive ability than did the posed expression task. Our findings suggest that naturalistic expressions—which are more nuanced and varied than posed expressions—can offer equally, if not more, robust insights into expression recognition ability. The NERT serves as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to enhance the ecological validity of their studies by incorporating naturalistic stimuli.",

In Study 2 and 3, psychology students (n=181)  and acting students (n=41) imagined events from a first-person, third-person, and fictional person perspective. Feelings of realness were closely related to, and often predicted by, ease of the imagining and one’s absorption into the imagining, with a differential supportive role of vividness and emotion, providing partial evidence for the fluency theory of reality monitoring. Trait absorption and fantasy proneness were both associated with greater felt realness of imaginings, but the more fictional the imagining, the more fantasy proneness supported feelings of realness.",

These findings aim to inform strategies to improve care and promote inclusivity in the healthcare system.\n\nObjective: This study explores the healthcare experiences of caregivers of individuals with ASD in Myanmar. It identifies challenges in communication, support, and service delivery while highlighting gaps in current care strategies. By examining caregivers' perspectives, the study aims to offer insights that will help shape patient-centered care practices that address the medical, emotional, and social needs of individuals with ASD. The ultimate goal is to promote inclusive, empathetic healthcare that enhances long-term outcomes for both individuals with ASD and their families.\n\nMethodology: A survey-based approach was used to collect data from caregivers of individuals with ASD in Myanmar. The survey included structured questions designed to assess caregivers' experiences with healthcare services, communication practices, and the challenges they faced. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis to uncover recurring patterns and key insights. This mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive understanding of the caregivers' experiences and highlighted areas for improvement in patient-centered care.\n\nResults: The survey revealed several challenges faced by caregivers of individuals with ASD in accessing and navigating healthcare. Quantitative data showed that a majority of respondents reported difficulties with communication between healthcare providers and patients. Many caregivers also expressed concerns about unmet needs related to sensory sensitivities and behavioral issues, which are common in individuals with ASD. The thematic analysis of qualitative responses further highlighted a lack of tailored care, insufficient provider training, and the need for greater caregiver involvement in decision-making. These findings underscore the importance of adopting inclusive, patient-centered care practices that consider both the medical and non-medical aspects of ASD care.\n\nConclusion: Adopting a patient-centered care approach and utilizing the biopsychosocial model can significantly enhance care for individuals with ASD. By addressing the unique health challenges faced by individuals with ASD through empathy, communication, and collaboration, healthcare providers can offer more effective and inclusive treatment. The study highlights the need to better support caregivers and patients by providing tailored care that respects their experiences and individual needs. Additionally, reducing stigma and promoting understanding about ASD are essential for improving long-term health outcomes and the overall quality of life for individuals with ASD. Ultimately, the findings emphasize the importance of fostering an inclusive, compassionate healthcare environment that supports both patients and their families.",

          "abstract": "Many online content providers use \"personalization\" algorithms to generate recommendations that are individually fine-tuned for users’ interests. However, these algorithms have also been criticized because tailoring content to specific users necessarily restricts the diversity of content, leading to reinforcement of existing beliefs. Here, we investigated the degree to which personalization can hinder learning in the context of learning about novel categories. Our results show that personalized learners developed inaccurate representations about the categories and reported inflated confidence about incorrect decisions for what they have never or rarely studied before relative to non-personalized learners. The results suggest that personalization algorithms may contribute to distorted representations of information, which in turn causes inaccurate generalizations, such as stereotypes.",

          "authors": "Andrew Jessop; Julian Pine; Fernand Gobet",
          "abstract": "According to chunking theories, children discover their first words by extracting sub-sequences embedded in their continuous input. However, the mechanisms proposed in these accounts are often incompatible with data from other areas of language development. We present a new theory to connect the chunking accounts of word discovery with the broader developmental literature. We argue that (a) children build a diverse collection of chunks, including words, multi-word phrases, and sub-lexical units; (b) these chunks have different processing times determined by how often each chunk is used to recode the input; and (c) these processing times interact with short-term memory limitations and incremental processing to constrain learning. We implemented this theory as a computational modelling architecture called CIPAL (Chunk-based Incremental Processing and Learning). Across nine studies, we demonstrate that CIPAL can model word discovery in different contexts. First, we trained the model with 70 child-directed speech corpora from 15 languages. CIPAL gradually discovered words in each language, with cross-linguistic variation in performance. The model’s average processing time also improved with experience, resembling the developmental changes observed in children’s speed of processing. Second, we showed that CIPAL could simulate seven influential effects reported in statistical learning experiments with artificial languages. This included a preference for words over nonwords, part words, frequency-matched part words, phantom words, and sub-lexical units. On this basis, we argue that incremental chunking is an effective implicit statistical learning mechanism that may be central to children’s vocabulary development.",

Therefore, we conduct a victimization study and quantify the extent of unemployment stigma and its relationship to self-efficacy using survey data from a representative sample of 2,098 jobseekers. Study 1a finds high levels of acute, daily, and anticipated stigmatization and low levels of stigma internalization, with avoidance being a common behavioral strategy. Study 1b uses k-means clustering and uncovers three distinct profiles of stigma exposure that vary by age, family situation, and receipt of social benefits. Study 1c shows that these profiles predict differences in self-efficacy, independent of key demographic factors. The findings highlight the vulnerability of younger, single, welfare recipients who are most at risk for stigma and low self-efficacy.",

The present research (Study 1, N = 209; Study 2, N = 611; Study 3, N = 638) conducted in France, home to Western Europe’s largest Muslim community, failed to confirm the role of GRD in explaining variations in radicalism. Earlier research showed that GRD predicts activism, and that activism is positively correlated with radicalism. Consequently, we hypothesized and found that group membership (Muslims vs non-Muslims) is related to activism (not radicalism), that GRD mediates this relation between group membership and activism, and that GRD is predictive of radicalism only indirectly, via activism. The results also confirm that group-based contempt is uniquely predictive of support for violence, unlike group-based anger. The theoretical, methodological and policy implications of these findings are discussed.",

          "authors": "Florentin Woergoetter",
          "abstract": "Humans often interact with each other during daily life and many times one finds that one person (at least for some time) takes the lead while the other follows. Different from usual experimental settings in a lab, this happens without external influences and in a time-continuous manner. While knowledge that gazes onto the object to be manipulated precede a then-following manipulation action emerged long ago, little is known how gaze- and hand movement patterns develop in complex interactive scenarios where one person needs to consider the other’s action when planning their own.\nTo address this question in this study we investigate predictive, planning-related behavior during a two-player (Leader and Follower) table-top game. In this game – called “do-undo” – the Leader has to perform pick and place actions, following simple rules, to change the configuration of objects on the table. The Follower then has to use different objects to re-create the object-configuration back to the one that had existed before the Leader had acted. We track eyes, hand-movements and individual objects on the table and determine relations between eyes and hands of both players, with emphasis on the differences in behavior of Leader and Follower. Data is recorded using a setup where gaze tracking is combined with multicamera tracking of motion of the subjects and of the configuration on the table. The game proceeds without any external trigger signals and we address the problem of finding accurate time-points for phasing of the cooperative manipulation by using touch sensors on the hands of the players to record touching and untouching events by which we can unequivocally define the different temporal (inter-)action intervals for analysis.\nWhile gaze clearly precedes manipulation in all cases, we find clear differences in eye-movement patterns of Leader and Follower. The Leader makes more and earlier gazes on the objects to be manipulated. In a substantial proportion of trials, the Leader is predicting by his gaze not only their own, but also the required potential Follower-actions before their own manipulation. Also, the gaze data shows that the Leader takes more interest in re-checking the outcome of the do-undo manipulation pair. Indications of trying to memorize a configuration are also found in the gaze pattern of both. In addition, we often find sequences of alternating gazes towards objects and location where to put, which are much more expressed by the Leader than by the Follower. Intriguingly some patterns show that players pre-plan over longer periods and not just for their next action.\nThis clearly indicates different decision-making and planning characteristics for Leader as compared to Follower, which happen not only for own plan but also for potential action plans by the other shining a light on the complex cognitive processes that exist in daily human-human interaction.",

Using five experience sampling datasets (N = 750, aged 11–25, 59.17% female, 25,834 observations) that repeatedly assess emotion differentiation and emotion regulation variability, we examined their interaction and impact on emotion intensity. Surprisingly, moments of heightened emotion differentiation were followed by more stable use of regulation strategies (lower variability), while moments of higher emotion regulation variability were followed by less emotion differentiation. Both heightened differentiation and regulation variability preceded contra-hedonic outcomes, such as increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions. These findings were robust across different types of emotion regulation variability (intensity or switching) and valences of emotions (positive or negative). In the short term, emotion differentiation predicts reduced regulation variability and may bring unpleasant changes in emotion intensity.",

          "authors": "Felix Haiduk; Nick Harley; Tudor Popescu",
          "abstract": "Humans are unique among social animals in having both music and language. A key approach to studying their evolution is identifying shared traits, like vocal learning or entrainment, across species and mapping them onto phylogenetic trees (Honing et al., 2015). Related to these traits, cross-cultural research revealed near-universal features specific for or shared by music and language (Savage et al., 2015). However, many crucial traits emerged after our split from chimpanzees, limiting this method's explanatory power. Understanding the evolutionary sequence and interaction of these traits could refine hypotheses about protolanguage and protomusic systems and their evolutionary relation. We propose adapting an evolutionary systems biology (ESB) framework aiming to identify causal interactions in evolving systems and define their possible evolutionary trajectories. Using dynamical systems modeling, this approach provides mechanistic explanations for phenotypic development and evolutionary transitions. The key domain to assess evolvability and robustness are the component dynamics of the system - in the original ESB framework gene expression dynamics linking genotype to phenotype (Jaeger &amp; Monk, 2021). In transferring this approach, we suggest investigating the domain of predictive dynamics mediating between cognitive traits (\"genotypic\") and spectrotemporal features (\"phenotypic\"). Here we attempted an ESB implementation by investigating predictability in song, instrumental music, and recited and descriptive speech from a cross-cultural dataset (Ozaki et al., 2024). We conceptualise predictive dynamics as interface between song/speech acoustics and cognitive capacities/goals and quantified it using the information-theoretic model IDyoMS (Pearce, 2005). This model operationalises auditory perception through \"viewpoints\" like pitch and duration. We computed information content and entropy across viewpoints and examined the resulting networks with graph-theoretic measures. We found that mean information content increased from descriptive to recited speech to song and instrumental music, forming a continuum with the highest predictability in instrumental music. However, we also observed that both network topographies and observed predictive patterns were similar between conditions, suggesting that construction and choice of viewpoints is highly influential. We also found song and speech to differ in specific subnetworks, suggesting that the same set of perceptual dimensions may still lead to different predictive dynamics. We propose that a framework from ESB can be applied to cognition to gain empirical insight into music and language evolution. We will discuss current limitations and future directions of operationalising predictive dynamics using information-theoretic viewpoint networks to investigate the evolutionary differentiation of song and speech.",

          "abstract": "Vocabulary knowledge is foundational to educational success, but significant gaps exist between students from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with reading disabilities and their peers. These gaps have cascading effects, as children with lower vocabulary knowledge are less likely to acquire new words through independent reading and are less responsive to vocabulary instruction methods like read-alouds and explicit teaching. The effectiveness of explicit instruction relies on individualization, which typically places substantial demands on educators and thereby hinders the adoption of evidence-based methods. A potential solution is using audiobooks supplemented by explicit and individualized remote instruction from paraprofessionals. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) intervention study in which children listened to audiobooks along with text, either alone or with scaffolded instructional support. Third and fourth-grade students (N = 314, age: mean (SD) = 9.47(.56) years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (Audiobooks-Only, Audiobooks+Scaffold, or active control) for 8 weeks. Participants in the two audiobook intervention groups showed significant improvements in receptive and expressive vocabulary, while the active control group showed no improvement. The effectiveness of the intervention varied based on reading ability and socioeconomic status (SES): poor readers benefited only in the Audiobooks+Scaffold group, whereas children from lower-SES backgrounds improved with audiobook access alone, especially if they were already proficient readers. Additionally, the Audiobooks+Scaffold group spent more time listening to recommended audiobooks during the study. These findings suggest that text-supplemented audiobooks, particularly when combined with personalized support, can be a valuable tool for supporting vocabulary development in struggling readers.",

          "abstract": "Stereotypical biases are readily acquired and expressed by generative AI, causing growing societal concern about these systems amplifying existing human bias. This concern rests on reasonable psychological assumptions, but stereotypical bias amplification during human-AI interaction relative to pre-existing baseline levels hasn’t been demonstrated. Here, we use previous psychological work on gendered character traits to capture and control gender stereotypes expressed in character descriptions generated by Open AI’s ChatGPT. In four experiments (N=782) with a first impressions task we find that unexplained (‘black-box’) character recommendations using stereotypical traits already convey a potent persuasive influence significantly amplifying baseline stereotyping within first impressions. Recommendations that are counter-stereotypical eliminate and effectively reverse human baseline bias, but these stereotype challenging influences propagate less well than reinforcing influences from stereotypical recommendations. Critically, the bias amplification and reversal phenomena occur when ChatGPT elaborates on the core stereotypical content, although ChatGPT’s explanations propagate counter-stereotypical influence more effectively and persuasively than black-box recommendations. Our findings strongly imply that without robust safeguards generative AI will amplify existing bias. But with safeguards, existing bias can be eliminated and even reversed. Our novel approach safely allows such effects to be studied in various contexts where gender and other bias-inducing social stereotypes operate.",

Study 1 found that the very same behavior is regarded as less reflective of the true self when it is performed online. Study 2 showed that this effect is not merely a matter of perceived impression management. Study 3 found that there is a general tendency such that behavior is seen as more reflective of the true self when it is performed in an environment regarded as “natural.” In Study 4, a manipulation that led participants to see online behavior as more natural had a downstream effect on the degree to which this behavior was seen as reflecting the true self. Taken together, these results suggest that people’s judgments about online behavior are not simply a reflection of idiosyncratic facts about the online sphere in particular but are instead driven in part by a far more general psychological process involving perceptions of naturalness.",

          "authors": "Jumpei Yamashita; Haruo Oishi; Takatsune Kumada",
          "abstract": "Introduction: The traditional RIASEC model organizes occupational preferences into a circular structure with two orthogonal dimensions: People-Things and Data-Ideas. In contrast, a more recent model of occupational personality traits (O-E-A) emphasizes Openness to Experience (Openness), Extraversion, and Agreeableness within a three-cluster circular arrangement, which does not follow the R-I-A-S-E-C order. Do these frameworks represent distinct constructs or share an underlying structure?\n\nMethods: This study investigated whether applying RIASEC's relative, within-person scoring procedure to the O-E-A framework, originally based on absolute scoring, could reveal shared orthogonal dimensions: People-Things (A-S-E to C-R-I) and Data-Ideas (E-C to I-A). The analysis involved reanalyzing large-scale data in which participants rated themselves on the Big Five personality traits and on their preferences for 13 O-E-A job categories. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) and canonical correlation analyses (CCA) were conducted to explore the relationships between these variables, with job preferences transformed into relative values.\n\nResults: Extraversion and Openness emerged as the most influential predictors of 13 relative preferences in the MLR analysis. The CCA revealed two orthogonal preference dimensions corresponding to People-Things (Extraversion-Introversion) and Data-Ideas (Openness-Closedness). The RIASEC sequence emerged within the relativized O-E-A framework, revealing two orthogonal axes: Extraversion (C-R-I to A-S-E) and Openness (E-C to I-A).\n\nDiscussion: These findings suggest that discrepancies between the O-E-A personality model and RIASEC preferences may partly arise from differences in scoring methods. Relative scoring highlights how individuals prioritize one job domain over another, revealing a shared motivational structure underlying both frameworks. These results support integrating personality-based occupational insights with traditional preference models.",

          "authors": "Sofiia Rappe; Markus Werning",
          "abstract": "Over the past several years, there has been a shift in the researchers’ thinking about the functional role of episodic memory. Rather than focusing on how memory represents the past, recent literature often presents memory as ultimately dealing with the future–helping the organism to anticipate events and increase its adaptive success. However, the distinct contribution of episodic (as opposed to semantic) memory to future-oriented simulations remains unclear. We claim that episodic memory yields adaptive success because of its crucial role in singular counterfactual causal reasoning, which thus far has been mostly ignored in causal reasoning literature. Our paper presents a causal inference model based on the predictive processing framework and the minimal trace account of episodic memory. According to our model, evaluating the cause of an event involves (i) generating an episodic memory related to the said potential cause, (ii) constructing a counterfactual scenario through inhibition of the relevant part of the past episode, and (iii) temporal evolution followed by alternative model evaluation. We further discuss our approach in the developmental context.",

Across experimental and naturalistic studies, we examined if more additive (to start something new or do more) than subtractive advice (to stop or do less) is given when humans and artificial intelligence give mental health advice. Compared to subtractive advice, additive advice was recommended more frequently and was rated as more effective and feasible by recipients. Several moderators of this effect are explored: Older people are more additive than younger people, who we are advising (e.g., strangers/friends) matters, as does the type of pre-existing mental health-affecting activities (e.g., gambling versus avoiding exercise). People feel that they are overburdened and yet we often tell them to do more. When helping people with their mental health, advice givers must balance what can be added to life with what needs to be removed.",

          "abstract": "When studying mood or affective state, it is useful to collect free-text input from participants relevant to their mood alongside traditional assessment batteries. Quantifying free-text data in relation to quantitative measures remains a challenge. We propose a novel application of an Elo rating system for analysing verbatim human text descriptions of emotionally salient experiences. By using crowdsourced pairwise comparisons, our approach preserves the richness of free-text data while generating a quantitative representation. We apply the same approach to various LLMs to compare their performance against humans. Regression analyses indicate that rankings generated by LLMs  predict human rankings, demonstrating strong explanatory power across models. Applying LLMs to this task offers the added advantages of greater efficiency and lower cost. We discuss the potential applications of this method in human research and explore critical considerations regarding the use of LLMs in emotionally relevant tasks.",

          "abstract": "The author reviews psychologist Eric Turkheimer’s 2024 book \"Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate.\" Turkheimer is known for taking a critical position within the field of behavioral genetics. While mentioning several important limitations, Turkheimer upholds the validity of the heritability concept, twin studies, and adoption studies. The author notes that “heritability” is a disputed concept, and briefly describes what he sees as the invalidating aspects of behavioral and psychiatric genetic twin and adoption studies. He then reviews Turkheimer’s analysis of DNA-based (molecular genetic) behavioral research methods such as linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association (GWAS), and polygenetic score (PGS) studies. The first two methods ended in failure. Although GWAS and PGS researchers have claimed many “gene-behavior associations,” Turkheimer shows that, after decades of attempts, DNA-based research has failed to uncover genetic variants shown to cause human behavioral differences. Disagreements between Turkheimer and behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin are also examined. The author, though not Turkheimer, concludes that DNA-based research failure provides additional evidence that the critics of twin studies, adoption studies, and the heritability concept were right all along. As the behavioral genetic paradigm unravels, the social and behavioral sciences should begin working on a new environmentally focused post-behavioral genetics developmental paradigm.",

          "abstract": "In many languages, count nouns trigger a comparison by number (e.g., too many strings), while mass nouns typically do not (e.g., too much string). However, object-mass nouns like furniture exhibit mass syntax but often support a comparison by number (e.g., too much furniture → too many items; Barner &amp; Snedeker, 2005). Some theories argue that object-mass nouns lexically specify individuation, making them semantically like count nouns in that they induce a comparison by number (Bale &amp; Barner, 2009), while others propose that only count nouns force numerical comparisons, leaving object-mass nouns open to contextual shifts (Rothstein, 2017; McCawley, 1975). We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing English quantity judgments for object-mass nouns to (1) collective count nouns, and (2) French judgments for translations of object-mass nouns. In each case, we found that object-mass nouns behaved like count nouns, and were no more susceptible to contextual effects. These findings support the view that object-mass nouns and count nouns specify individuation to the same extent.",

We test the hypothesis that believers will differ in their willingness to apply karmic explanations to their own experiences compared to the experiences of other people, such that they are more willing to explain their own positive experiences as caused by their own karmic merit (to satisfy self-enhancement motives), while being more willing to explain other people’s negative experiences as karmic punishment for others’ misdeeds (to satisfy justice motives).\nMethods: In three studies (total N = 2041), we ask participants to recall events believed to have been caused by karma in their own life, and events believed to have been caused by karma in the lives of other people, and we code whether these descriptions of karma-caused events are primarily positive or negative, using a combination of human coders, sentiment analysis, and participants’ self-reported evaluations of the events.\nResults: Results consistently show that positive experiences are more likely to come to mind when they think about how karma influences their own life, but negative experiences are more likely when thinking about other’s karma, although this difference was weaker in Singapore and India than in the United States. \nConclusions: Results are consistent with predicted self-enhancement biases in karmic attributions, and show how personal motivations predict willingness to adopt supernatural explanations for specific life events.",

Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy.

          "abstract": "Salience models for complex scenes typically aim to explain heatmaps or scan-paths. While heatmaps potentially conflate fixations serving different functions, scan-paths aim for a level of detail which is hard to attain. We introduce a novel approach, based on the premise that most fixations target objects and belong to three functionally meaningful classes: Detection fixations (D), foveating an object for the first time; Inspection fixations (I), successively targeting object details; and Return fixations (R), revisiting an object, e.g., to refresh its representation in memory. To test the hypothesis that these classes capture distinct fixation profiles, we reanalysed a large dataset of scene fixations. We computed separate heatmaps for D, I, and R and found significantly higher inter-observer consistency within than between classes. Across fixations landing on different semantic features, the proportion of D, I, and R fixations varied consistently, and a semantic salience model trained to predict each class independently learned diverging distributions of feature weights. Further, we found a shift from D to I and R across viewing time, in line with their functional interpretation and previous findings on ambient and focal viewing modes. We tested and confirmed that the dynamics of this shift varied as a function of trial duration. Finally, we found that the D, I, R classification could be approximated with a simple spatial heuristic, extending its applicability to images without object metadata. We propose the D, I, and R classification as a simple but powerful tool to functionally classify scene fixations and provide well documented code to implement it.",

However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide individual learning—whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted ‘actor-critic’ models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.",

Participants either vocalized spontaneously generated words or let their mind wander during 2 to 3-minute runs, and were instructed to report thought transitions with a key press. We first validate this subjective mental event segmentation, which enables us to measure the duration of coherent thought episodes. We then turn to model comparison to show that the timing of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold mechanism. We further find that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the accumulation rate – negatively correlates with participants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering, highlighting the role of mental impulsivity in thought transitions.",

Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), has been widely used for scientific research. Yet, few studies have explored their potential to advance social science research. This research evaluates how effectively ChatGPT can mimic responses from real human participants on online crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), Prolific, and CloudResearch. We replicated 22 studies published in top psychology journals between January 2023 and June 2023. Since ChatGPT 4.0’s cutoff date is September 2021, its training database does not include articles published after that time. The current research is among the first to use ChatGPT to replicate social science studies whose conclusions have not been included in the training database of ChatGPT. This unique methodology strengthens the credibility of our findings and establishes a more robust foundation for applying AI in simulating human behavior. The results show that ChatGPT successfully replicates about 93.2% (20.5/22) of the findings from these studies. While conducting these studies (assuming each study is a typical 5-minute online experiment with 300 participants) on online crowdsourcing platforms could take approximately 11 days and cost around $3,960, using AI through a platform we term “AITurk” could reduce the time to about 11 minutes and the cost to $132. That is, AITurk achieves about 93.2% accuracy of real human participants’ responses on online crowdsourcing platforms, with about 1/1440 time and 1/30 cost. Based on these findings, we suggest that ChatGPT can be an effective tool for social science research, especially for conducting preliminary research and evaluating the replicability of existing studies.",

A paucity of studies examines structural similarities and differences in affect at the between- and within-person levels, and few have done so with short-form versions of the PANAS. This study investigates the multilevel factor structure of the 10-item PANAS-SF in a sample of young adults (n = 272) measured daily consecutively over one month. Additionally, dynamic relations between positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms, stress, and physical symptoms were examined. Results support a 3-factors within and 2-factors between multilevel structural model. Distinct dynamic relations were observed among positive, negative affect, stress, and physical symptoms at the within-level. Positive and negative affect were correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, and physical symptoms at the between-level. Findings indicate the need to disentangle structural components of positive and negative affect when conducting intensive longitudinal studies to examine correlates linked to dynamic affective processes.",

          "abstract": "Leisure activities engagement could promote freshmen’s well-being by providing social support and improving positive mood. Little is known about the day-to-day variability in leisure activities and stress and their links to daily well-being. Using a month-long daily diary design among 273 Canadian freshmen (Mage = 18, 73% female, 32% White), this study investigated the relations between daily leisure activities, stress, and well-being. Multilevel modeling revealed that daily leisure activities showed concurrent positive effects on daily well-being, whereas daily stress had negative effects. There were substantial inter-individual differences in these links, which were partly explained by coping orientations and person-average levels of stress. Engaging in more diverse leisure activities was related to better well-being. The findings demonstrate the immediate beneficial effects of leisure activities on well-being in everyday life, and provide interventions with amendable targets to promote freshmen’s positive socioemotional development during their transition to university.",

          "abstract": "Despite the salient impacts of daily experiences, scarce research has measured various daily minor experiences and evaluated their influences on adolescent well-being in their daily life. This study assessed the exposure to multiple aspects of daily hassles and uplifts in adolescents’ daily lives, and examined the links between the level, types, and diversity of these exposures and adolescents’ daily physical and mental well-being. Ninety-nine adolescents (12–17 years old, M = 14.6, 51.5% White, 53.5% female) completed a 30-day daily diary study. Multilevel modeling revealed different associations between the level and types of daily hassles and uplifts and adolescent well-being on the same day. Experiencing diverse daily hassles was linked with more emotional problems, and experiencing diverse daily uplifts was related with lower negative affect. The findings underscore the importance of including level, types, and diversity of both daily hassles and uplifts in research to better characterize adolescents’ daily experiences. The findings also highlight the concurrent and potential cumulative effects of daily minor social events and mundane experiences in adolescent development in their daily lives.",

          "authors": "Catherine M. Hicks; Carol S Lee; Kristen Foster-Marks",
          "abstract": "In this research study, we share original empirical research with 3000+ software engineers and developers across 12+ industries engaged in the transition to Generative AI-assisted software work. We bring a human-centered approach to pressing questions that engineering organizations are facing on the rapidly-changing possibilities of AI-assisted coding. How are developers impacted by changing demands on their roles? Where might there be emerging equity &amp; opportunity gaps in who has access to these new development capabilities? What are the risks to the quality of technical work, and the developer productivity, thriving, and motivation which drive that technical work? From this work we present a new evidence-based framework to help developers, engineering managers, and leaders as they grapple with failure to thrive in the transition to AI-assisted work: AI Skill Threat. AI Skill Threat describes developers’  fear, anxiety, and worry that their current skills will quickly become obsolete as they adapt to AI-assisted coding. Our framework also predicts when and why AI Skill Threat emerges: engineers who maintain a strong belief in competition and the demonstration of “innate brilliance” are more likely to report AI Skill Threat. However, engineers who report the presence of learning cultures and belonging are less likely to report AI Skill Threat. Finally, we document new and emerging equity and opportunity gaps for software teams adopting new tooling practices. AI Skill Threat is higher for Racially Minoritized developers, who also rate the overall quality of AI-assisted coding outputs significantly lower. Both female developers and LGBTQ+ developers were significantly less likely to report plans to upskilling for new AI-assisted workflows. These and other emerging differences point toward a critical need to understand how organizations ensure that AI-assisted coding adoption is equitable and accessible, and that key insights from developers with important perspectives on the risks of AI-assisted coding are heard.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Research on alcohol use disorder has exclusively focused on either its symptom-level mechanisms--the network perspective-- or sociodemographic determinants--epidemiological research. Moreover, such research failed to stratify analyses for important person-level factors (e.g., sex or ethnicity). Here, we combine network and epidemiological research and stratify analyses by person-level factors. \n\n\nMethod: Using Bayesian inference, we estimated (1) a logistic regression model predicting past-year alcohol consumption from various sociodemographic factors within a large, multiethnic, urban sample in the Netherlands (complete sample: N = 22,164), (2) a cross-sectional network model of alcohol use symptoms and sociodemographic factors among alcohol drinkers of the same sample (drinkers: N = 10,877), and (3) stratified networks at the sex- and ethnic- levels in the same drinkers subsample. \n\nResults: All of our examined sociodemographic factors predicted past-year alcohol consumption (in order of magnitude: religion, sex, education, employment, perceived ethnic discrimination, and age). Our Bayesian analysis of networks revealed three notable patterns. First, religion was uniquely and negatively related to adverse alcohol use problems (such as having an injury due to drinking). Second, socioeconomic proxies (education and employment) were positively related to binge drinking, but negatively related to its adverse effects (such as 'needing a drink in the morning'). Finally, employment and education were particularly negatively related to alcohol use symptoms within male and female networks, respectively. \n\nConclusion: \nOur results suggest that alcohol use symptoms are differentially related to sociodemographic factors and that these effects are moderated by sex and ethnicity. Our highlighted network links and Bayesian methodologies could prove useful for future research and prevention and intervention efforts on alcohol use disorders.",

          "abstract": "When studying spontaneous or learned emotional responses to social stimuli, research has traditionally relied on simplified stimuli repeatedly presented on a computer screen in standardized laboratory environments. While these studies provided important insights into social perception and cognition, their restricted ecological validity may impede the extrapolation of findings to everyday social contexts. Here we developed a novel immersive virtual reality scenario that permits the examination of social approach- and avoidance behavior under naturalistic circumstances while at the same time maintaining full experimental control. Using a combination of a social conditioning procedure with a social approach-avoidance test, we conducted two experiments (both with N = 48 female participants) to investigate how individuals differing in trait social anxiety adapt their behavior after a single encounter with an either friendly or unfriendly virtual agent. In addition to overt approach and avoidance behavior, we acquired subjective ratings, eye-tracking data and autonomic responses. Overall, we observed significant effects of the social conditioning procedure on autonomic responses and participants’ exploration behavior. After initially increased attention, participants exhibited avoidance of social threats as indicated by a higher interpersonal distance and decreased visual attention towards the negatively conditioned virtual agent in the test phase. We found no association between hypervigilance and trait social anxiety but observed higher fear ratings and enhanced avoidance of social threats in participants with elevated anxiety levels. Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of immersive virtual environments for examining social learning processes under conditions resembling real-life social encounters.",

Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories.

          "abstract": "Humans are inherently social creatures, yet considerable variability exists in our social behaviours. It is unclear what factors contribute to this variability. Given the complex and abundant sensory stimuli present in our daily environments, differences in sensory processing abilities may contribute to the variation observed in social behaviours. Individual differences in sensory processing may have significant effects on an individual's capacity to navigate social settings and may influence the development and expression of social competence. In this study, we investigated the relationship between one form of sensory processing difference, Decreased Sound Tolerance (DST), and social competence. Existing literature suggests that it is common for individuals with DST to engage in social avoidance behaviours to mitigate exposure to distressing sounds. However, limited research explores the potential relationship between DST severity and social competence. As such, a sample of 2095 undergraduate students completed an online survey designed to assess their DST severity and social competence. Initially, to parse the variability in social competence, scores on the multidimensional social competence scale (MSCS), underwent a k-means cluster analysis. This analysis yielded four unique social profiles based on seven social competence domains (e.g., social motivation, emotion regulation etc.). Misophonia and hyperacusis questionnaires were then used to evaluate differences in DST across the social profiles. The results indicated varying severity levels of both misophonia and hyperacusis across the four social profiles, with the individuals who reported the highest social competence exhibiting the lowest levels of DST. These findings highlight the potential relationship between sensory processing differences, such as DST, and social functioning.",

Bringing the concept of state resilience from fields such as security studies or economics to the social psychological literature on conspiracy beliefs, we conducted three studies (N = 42,643 participants nested in 51 countries, N = 297 UK participants, and N = 268 UK participants). Results showed that higher scores on the State Resilience Index (Study 1) and higher perceived state resilience (Studies 2 and 3) predicted lower COVID-19 (Study 1), climate change-related and generic conspiracy beliefs (Studies 2 and 3). The importance of state resilience as a macro-level predictor of conspiracy beliefs in the social psychological and policy-making domains is discussed.",

During and after the public goods games, participants reported their perceptions, expectations, and evaluations of each other through round-robin ratings. Due to the extensive assessments of personality and incentivized social behavior included in the GIPO data, these data are suitable for investigating the links between personality traits and prosocial and cheating behavior. Furthermore, they can be analyzed to gain a fine-grained picture of the perceptions, expectations, and evaluations that precede or follow behavior in economic games. Finally, researchers might want to use the GIPO data to investigate the psychometric properties and in particular the validity of the personality measures we used. To facilitate use of the data, we made the anonymized GIPO data publicly available. Taken together, the GIPO data are a publicly available rich resource for investigating the links between personality and incentivized social behavior.",

However, the ability of human researchers to synthesize vast datasets and model intricate relationships is limited. Thus, this study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs; Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1, and GPT-4) to identify variable relationships in social psychology, assessing their reasoning capabilities relative to both domain experts and non-domain experts. Therefore, we collected 56 meta-analyses of social psychology published in 2024, from which we extracted 247 variable relationships. We tasked LLMs and human experts to infer variable relationships based on variable definitions and compared their inferences with relationships reported in the meta-analyses, while also examining the impact of task difficulty, self-reported confidence levels, and relationship type on model performance. Our findings indicated that LLMs and domain experts performed similarly in identifying simple variable relationships (e.g., linear relationships and difference tests). However, the identification of more complex relationships, particularly moderating effects, presented a challenge for both. Furthermore, domain expertise significantly enhanced identification accuracy. Although a correlation was observed between model confidence and accuracy, it was not a strong predictor. Increased task complexity consistently reduced the performance of all LLMs. This study empirically examines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, suggesting potential roles and limitations of algorithmic tools in social science, providing new evidence for data-driven academic practices.",

          "abstract": "Pedagogy is a powerful way to learn about the world, and young children are adept at both learning from teaching and teaching others themselves. Theoretical accounts of pedagogical reasoning suggest that an important aspect of being an effective teacher is considering what learners need to know, as misconceptions about learners’ beliefs, needs, or goals can result in less helpful teaching. One underexplored way in which teachers may fail to represent what learners know is by simply “going through the motions” of teaching, without actively engaging with the learner’s beliefs, needs, and goals at all. In the current paper, we replicate ongoing work that suggests children are sensitive to when others are relying on automatic scripts in the context of teaching. We then look at the potential link to two related measures. First, we hypothesize that sensitivity to a teacher’s perceived automaticity will be linked to classic measures of pedagogical sensitivity and learning – specifically, how children explore and learn about novel toys following pedagogical versus non-pedagogical demonstrations. Second, we hypothesize that the development of Theory of Mind (and age differences more broadly) relate to these pedagogical sensitivities. Our online adaptation of the novel toy exploration task did not invoke pedagogical reasoning as expected, and so we do not find robust links between these tasks. We do find that Theory of Mind predicts children’s ability to detect automaticity in teaching when controlling for age. This work thus highlights the connections between sensitivity to teaching and reasoning about others’ knowledge, with implications for the factors that support children’s ability to teach others.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Speech discrimination outcomes vary widely in cochlear implant recipients, but reasons for this variability are not well explained by patient history factors alone. Neuroplastic reorganisation after both deafness and cochlear implant switch-on can affect how new recipients adapt to electrical hearing. In this study, we evaluate the associations between speech understanding outcomes and stimulus evoked activation of cortical language processing areas. Design: 43 newly implanted post-lingually deaf adult cochlear implant recipients were recruited to the longitudinal study. Participants attended two research visits: the first conducted within one-month of device switch-on, and the second conducted one-year after device switch-on. At each visit, we evaluated speech understanding outcomes in noise and cortical activation using functional near infrared spectroscopy during a passive listening task, during which a story was told in either an auditory or visual-speech (lip-reading) condition. Results: We found statistically significant correlations between poorer speech understanding outcomes  one year post device switch-on and large activations in the superior temporal gyrus contralateral to the device in response to both auditory- (F(1, 30) = 11.297, R2 = 0.274, p = 0.002) and visual-speech (F(1, 30) = 18.216, R2 = 0.38, p &lt; 0.001) stimuli tested within one-month of switch-on. However, these significant associations were not observed using activation data from the one-year mark. Furthermore, we found no association between changes in activation of the superior temporal gyrus contralateral to the device and changes in speech understanding outcomes over the first year of implant use. Conclusions: Our evidence highlights that neuroplastic changes which occur following adult-onset deafness play an important role in how cochlear implant recipients adapt to their devices after switch-on. The relationship between neuroimaging measures made within one-month after device switch-on and speech understanding outcomes at one-year can potentially enable triaging of recipients to improve clinical management of implant recipients.",

How do people use this \nlearning flexibly in novel social situations? We propose people use maps of social \nknowledge (representing similarity between traits) to generalize trait impressions and \npredict behavior in new domains and contexts, a prediction we test across three \nexperiments. First, in a pilot study, we demonstrate that conceptual similarity between traits \npredicts situation-specific inferences of trait relevance. In Experiment 1, participants \nlearned about targets (described either as humans or non-human slot machines) whose \nbehavior in a task revealed sociability, and later, made choices about which partners to \nchoose in decision making tasks relevant to other traits. Trait similarity (i.e., between the \noriginal context and novel contexts) shaped partner choice, but critically, this relationship \nwas socially specific: participants generalized social learning based on trait similarity when \ninteracting with other humans but not with slot machines. In Experiment 2, participants \nwere given explicit trait labels describing potential partners. Here, we observed that trait \nsimilarity continued to influence generalization across an expanded set of traits and task \ncontexts, above and beyond the mere valence similarity of traits. While Exps. 1-2 \ndemonstrate trait-based generalization in decision-making, Experiment 3 demonstrated \nthat trait-based generalization occurs with relative spontaneity.

In this first of two studies, 95 participants operated a highly parameterised multi-drone dual-task simulator of a real-world prototype system, using data from field trials. The primary task involved monitoring a 30-minute underwater REA, fixing drone navigational (“drift”) errors to induce attention, and the secondary task involved anomaly detection (image classification) of underwater images to simulate post-mission analysis. Participants periodically reported trust and SA. We assessed trust, attention, and SA in different auditory environments. Bayesian multilevel modelling found that trust remained stable despite intermittent errors, induced attention did not improve situational awareness, and tone-based alerts in noisy environments led to faster responses to drone errors.",

One promising approach is enhancing workers’ emotion regulation skills. Although previous literature suggests promise, the long-term effectiveness of this approach is unknown. The present study evaluated a scalable intervention that taught reappraisal—an emotion regulation strategy that alters how individuals interpret challenging situations. We tested this intervention nationwide among low- and middle-income workers (e.g., drivers, teachers, food service workers) in early education, one of the most stressful and under-resourced sectors in the United States. Study 1 (n = 1,967), a pre-registered field survey, found positive correlations among reappraisal use, emotional well-being, and job performance. Study 2, a pre-registered longitudinal field experiment (n = 4,054), found lasting improvements in some emotional well-being and workplace outcomes (e.g., job performance, quit intentions, and impatient decision-making) from the reappraisal intervention (vs. active control) six months later. These studies provide the first evidence of reappraisal’s durable effects over time in the workplace, establishing it as a scalable and enduring strategy for improving worker well-being and performance across diverse occupational settings.",

          "abstract": "The “truth sandwich” correction format, in which false information is bookended by factual information, has frequently been presented as an optimal method for correcting misinformation. Despite recurring recommendations, there is little empirical evidence for enhanced benefits. In two pre-registered experiments (total N = 1046), we evaluated the effectiveness of the truth sandwich correction format against a “bottom-loaded” refutation format, in which the misinformation is first presented prior to factual statements. In Experiment 1, participants first rated belief in cancer misinformation. The misinformation was then corrected using the truth sandwich, corrected using a bottom-loaded refutation, or left uncorrected (control). Participants subsequently rerated their belief in the claims. Experiment 2 replicated and extended Experiment 1 by including a two-week test delay. We found that both correction formats were highly effective. However, there was no evidence that the truth sandwich format enhanced the effectiveness of corrections either immediately after reading or after a two-week delay period, with Bayesian analyses providing consistent evidence for a null effect of correction format. We repeated our analyses isolated to participants who endorsed complementary and alternative medicines, given this subgroup is particularly likely to believe cancer misinformation. We again found no evidence for any superiority of the truth sandwich correction format. These findings suggest that clear and detailed corrections can be powerfully effective against misinformation regardless of format, and advocacy for the truth sandwich correction above other simpler formats are unwarranted.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn as they use the same base-10 place value system of whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, e.g., 0.8 &gt; 0.26.  Accordingly, children and adults perform worse when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs like 0.8 vs. 0.26 than Consistent ones like 0.86 vs. 0.2. This effect is typically attributed to the conflict between the number of digits and the magnitude of the decimal. But it could also result from students activating the whole number referents, i.e., the corresponding whole numbers without the decimals points (e.g., 8 vs. 26). We recently developed a stimulus set that can distinguish between these explanations by leveraging numerical distance effects. As in previous studies, our stimuli vary on the rational distance between pairs of numbers, and in our prior studies (Rosenberg-Lee, et al. 2023), we found that performance is lower for close comparisons (0.3 vs. 0.21, distance = 0.09) than far (0.8 vs. 0.26, distance = 0.54). However, we also varied the whole distance between the pairs, that is, the distance between the whole referents. Holding rational distance constant, participants were worse on problems where the whole distance was larger (0.9 vs. 0.81 =&gt; 9 vs. 81, whole distance 72) than smaller (0.3 vs. 0.21 =&gt; 3 vs 21, whole distance = 18), suggesting they were activating the whole referents. In this study, we use functional MRI during decimal comparison to identify brain systems related to rational distance and whole distance processing in university students (n=21). We anticipated that rational distance would modulate the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which is implicated in numerical magnitude processing for whole and rational numbers, while frontal regions involved in working memory (middle frontal gyrus) and cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) would process interference from whole distance. Interestingly, we did find rational magnitude sensitivity in the IPS, but only for Consistent comparisons, while the ACC was sensitive for rational distance only for Inconsistent comparisons. We found sensitivity to whole distance in the IPS and insula. These results contribute to growing evidence that whole number referents are automatically activated during decimal processing and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. Further, these results highlight the unique challenges that decimals present for learners and point to the need for educators to emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than current practices which highlight similarities.",

          "abstract": "The “truth sandwich” correction format, in which false information is bookended by factual information, has frequently been presented as an optimal method for correcting misinformation. Despite recurring recommendations, there is little empirical evidence for enhanced benefits. In two pre-registered experiments (total N = 1046), we evaluated the effectiveness of the truth sandwich correction format against a “bottom-loaded” refutation format, in which the misinformation is first presented prior to factual statements. In Experiment 1, participants first rated belief in cancer misinformation. The misinformation was then corrected using the truth sandwich, corrected using a bottom-loaded refutation, or left uncorrected (control). Participants subsequently rerated their belief in the claims. Experiment 2 replicated and extended Experiment 1 by including a two-week test delay. We found that both correction formats were highly effective. However, there was no evidence that the truth sandwich format enhanced the effectiveness of corrections either immediately after reading or after a two-week delay period, with Bayesian analyses providing consistent evidence for a null effect of correction format. We repeated our analyses isolated to participants who endorsed complementary and alternative medicines, given this subgroup is particularly likely to believe cancer misinformation. We again found no evidence for any superiority of the truth sandwich correction format. These findings suggest that clear and detailed corrections can be powerfully effective against misinformation regardless of format, and advocacy for the truth sandwich correction above other simpler formats are unwarranted.",

Increasing studies examined the dynamic associations between momentary fluctuations of anxiety and well-being, primarily focusing on the severity of general anxiety. Scant research has explored the co-fluctuations between different anxiety symptoms and mental health outcomes. \nMethod: Using eight items selected from the Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) scale, the current study evaluated the multi-level factor structure and assessed the subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and panic disorder (PD) in a sample of non-clinical young adults (N = 271, Mage = 18 years, 72% female, 68% non-White) who participated in a 30-day daily diary study. This study also measured participants’ emotional and peer problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and stress by the College Chronic Life Stress Survey.\nResults: Between persons, GAD, SP, and PD were positively correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, as well as emotional and peer problems. Within persons, both SP and PD were positively associated with stress, peer and emotional problems on the same day. Across days, there was positive reciprocal relation between PD and stress, whereas negative reciprocal link was observed between SP and emotional problems. \nConclusion: Current findings showed dynamic and distinct patterns in the associations between different anxiety symptoms and several mental health outcomes, which emphasizes the need to disentangle between- and within-person variation of anxiety symptoms with intensive longitudinal designs.",

Constructions are typically considered non-compositional units that have arisen from compositional ones. The process of a unit gradually becoming a construction is called constructionalisation. Once constructionalised, a form-meaning pair can undergo various changes both on the form and on the meaning side, ranging from changes in frequency and combinatorial preferences to significant changes in meaning. This process is referred to as constructional change. Constructionalisation and constructional change go hand in hand: Constructionalisation is the result of constructional changes, and changes in already constructionalised units can give rise to new constructions. A recurrent question that is frequently discussed in the literature, however, is when exactly we can speak of a ‘constructionalised’ unit, i.e. a new construction.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The poor mental health of Australian adolescents is considered a public health\ncrisis. Development of brief screening tools to identify adolescents at high risk of Major Depressive\nDisorder (MDD) is consequently a high research and clinical priority. To address\nthis gap, the current study aims to investigate the extent to which the self-report Strengths\nand Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) accurately identifies 11-17-year-olds in the community\nwho meet diagnostic criteria for MDD. Methods: Data was from the Second Australian\nChild and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. The sample included 2,967\nadolescents aged 11 to 17 years who answered the SDQ and for whom MDD was evaluated\nwith the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV). To develop the\nscreening tool, seven prediction models were examined: (1) logistic regression (total score);\n(2) logistic regression (total score including prosocial behaviours); (3) logistic regression\n(subscale scores); (4) logistic regression (item scores); (5) logistic LASSO regression (item\nscores); (6) Markov Blanket-based logistic regression (item scores); and (7) XGBoost (item\nscores). Predictive performance was evaluated with the Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic Curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC),\ncalibration, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Results: A 3-item\nscreening tool (identified by the Markov Blanket-based logistic regression) performed the\nbest and achieved appropriate predictive performance (AUROC=0.73; AUPRC=0.16; sensitivity=\n67.5%; specificity=70.9%; and PPV=10.8%). Conclusion: A 3-item screening tool\ndisplayed appropriate predictive performance to identify MDD among Australian adolescents\naged 11 to 17 years in the community. Future studies should externally validate the\nproposed tool so it can be implemented in clinical practice.",

In nine pre-registered experiments (N=313 total), we examined the capacity limits of mentally simulating the movement of objects in the mind's eye. In a novel Imagined Objects Tracking task, participants continued the motion of animated objects in their mind up to a pre-defined point. When tracking one object in the imagination (Experiment 1a), participants gave estimations in line with ground truth. But, when imagining two objects (Experiment 1b), behavior altered substantially: responses were fit best by the predictions of a Serial Model that simulates only one object at a time, as opposed to a Parallel Model that simulates objects in tandem. The serial bottleneck is not due to response/motor limitations (Experiment 2), and is reduced - but not eliminated - by adding extremely strong grouping cues (Experiment 3). Additional studies and analyses validated that seriality is not due to factors like noise or lack of motivation, and is found also for hyper-simplified physics and naturalistic occlusion (Experiments S1-S5). Altogether, we find that the capacity of moving imagined entities is likely restricted to a single object at a time.",

Shorter rhythmic cycles were learned and recalled by Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians, while longer ones posed challenges.

          "abstract": "Personality pathology presents unique challenges in adolescence, a critical period for developing social autonomy and complex peer relationships. Yet, little research examines how these vulnerabilities unfold in daily life. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment (AA) study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female) aged 12–21, capturing 13,190 interactions over 14 days. Using Contemporary Interpersonal Theory and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we modeled links between personality pathology, perceptions of others’ and participants’ interpersonal behavior, and mentalizing. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) revealed that personality pathology was associated with lower daily social satisfaction in youth. Self-reports linked pathology to reduced perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, personality pathology was not associated with lower average mentalization but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Higher pathology strengthened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance, driven by Antagonism, while Psychoticism showed the reverse pattern, weakening this association. Detachment reduced the association of mentalizing and perceived warmth, and negative affectivity weakened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance. Findings highlight the dynamic nature of interpersonal dysfunction in adolescent personality pathology. Recognizing maladaptive patterns early may guide interventions that stabilize social interactions and promote mentalizing in ways that foster connection rather than control, reducing long-term challenges.",

For transgender and/or nonbinary (TNB) young adults, cissexism—the system of power relations that marginalizes TNB people in favor of cisgender people—may contribute to controlling partner dynamics. However, mechanisms linking cissexism to controlling partner dynamics remain underexplored. Using data from a cross-sectional online survey of romantically partnered U.S. TNB young adults (N=393; 18-30 years old; 50% nonbinary; 56% people of color), we tested two mediation pathways from interpersonal cissexism to controlling partner dynamics: (1) a cissexism-related beliefs pathway, in which cissexist rejection contributes to beliefs that may cause young adults to feel socially and emotionally dependent on romantic partners, and (2) a material-need insecurity pathway, in which cissexist discrimination contributes to material-need insecurity, leaving young adults dependent on romantic partners for needs such as food and housing. We tested individual paths using generalized linear models, then tested mediation pathways using natural effects mediation analysis, adjusting for age, gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, and partner gender. The cissexism-related beliefs pathway was not supported. However, results supported the material-need insecurity pathway—namely, cissexist discrimination was positively associated with controlling partner dynamics (b=0.15; P=.012), with a significant joint indirect effect via material-need insecurity (food insecurity and housing instability; b=0.05; P=.022). Reducing TNB young adults’ vulnerability to controlling partner dynamics may require structural changes (e.g., laws, policies, norms) to prevent cissexist discrimination and material-need insecurity.",

One of the most striking displays of change blindness is shown\nin the work of John Grimes (1996), which demonstrated that if items in an image are altered at\nthe exact moment a participant moves their eyes, changes often go unnoticed. However, little is\nknown about participants’ awareness of changes in this task, and surprisingly, the work itself has\nnever been replicated. Here, we replicate and extend the work of John Grimes. Using a new set\nof stimuli, we conducted two experiments in two separate laboratories (the University of Florida\nand Lingnan University in Hong Kong) to facilitate “simultaneous replication” of this\nphenomenon. In our first experiment, we replicated the work of John Grimes and showed that\nparticipants miss retroactively obvious changes to visual scenes on approximately half of the\ntrials. Additionally, on “miss” trials when an (unnoticed) change occurred, participants were\napproximately equally likely to select awareness of either the pre-change or post-change feature\nin the image. Fixation position played a critical role in modulating awareness in the task: failing\nto refixate changed items after the change occurred significantly increased the miss rate. Further,\non miss trials, not looking at the changed item made it more likely to report awareness of the prechange item, but fixating the item after the change increased the likelihood of selecting the postchange attribute. In our second experiment, we ran the same task using image pairs where the\nchanges were meaningful or incongruent. Images with either a meaning change or scene\ncongruence change were noticed at higher rates than neutral changes, and the higher the degree\nof meaning or congruence-related change, the more likely a change was detected. Together, these\nresults replicate the work of John Grimes, reveal gaze-contingent correlates of change detection\nin our tasks, and can inform current theories (e.g., Higher-Order Theory) of visual awareness.",

          "abstract": "Background. Enduring mental health conditions typically begin in adolescence. Social adversity (e.g., discrimination, bullying, trauma) may disrupt the development of healthy social learning processes and self and other beliefs. We tested the impact of prior social adversity and current social exclusion on paranoia, self and other beliefs and latent social learning processes in UK adolescents (15-17 years, n=502), using pre-registered hypotheses (AsPredicted #154322), causal Bayesian models, and exploratory analyses. Study Design. An experimental design tested (a) whether social exclusion interacted with prior social adversity to increase paranoia, (b) whether this occurred due to activating negative self and other beliefs, and (c) whether this was moderated by cognitive flexibility (i.e., moderated-mediation). Cognitive flexibility, alongside computational processes of social information generalisation, were assessed using The Intentions Game (Barnby et al., 2024). Study Results. Social exclusion triggered paranoia, which was intensified by prior social adversity, and substantially reduced latent belief flexibility about the self and others, inhibiting learning and subduing other-to-self generalisation (social contagion). Negative self and other beliefs were a mechanism through which social adversities lead to paranoia in the context of exclusion. Prior exposure to discrimination amplified state paranoia irrespective of inclusion/exclusion. Conclusion. Social adversity enhances susceptibility to paranoia following a social exclusion manipulation, in part due to activating negative self and other beliefs. Failure to detect pro-sociality in others, impacted by the rigidly with which negative self and other beliefs are held, as well as by discrimination in particular, likely exacerbates and maintains paranoia. Findings directly inform likely profitable intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of contextual factors on mind wandering (MW) by leveraging an online platform for an established laboratory task. We investigated how direct performance feedback, information about task progression, and the feeling of being monitored influenced performance indices in a task used to investigate the effect of MW on executive control. Our results indicate that specific performance feedback, and not general positive feedback, consistently improved performance, while neither impacted self-reported MW. Conversely, feedback on task progression and the feeling of being monitored increased self-reported MW, possibly reflecting participant self-awareness due to contextual distractions. Intriguingly, information relaying task progression also substantially increased performance. These findings highlight the potential of performance feedback to reduce the negative effects of MW on task performance in an online setting. Additionally, the findings suggest that information about task progression, as well as the notion of being monitored during the experiment can influence task focus and should be taken into consideration when investigating fluctuations of attention during cognitive tasks.",

          "authors": "Michaela Bocheva; Dobromir Rahnev",
          "abstract": "Confidence leak (i.e., confidence serial dependence) is a phenomenon where confidence from a previous trial predicts confidence in a current trial independent of current choice or accuracy. Confidence leak has been shown to robustly occur across various cognitive domains and tasks. However, it remains unclear what factors, if any, modulate the strength of the confidence serial dependence. Here we investigate whether switching the motor response in a perceptual decision-making task influences the strength of the confidence leak effect. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch using their left or right hand, with the response hand being randomly cued on each trial. We found that switching the response substantially weakened the confidence leak effect. We further replicated this finding in a second experiment in which left-hand responses were given using a keyboard and right-hand responses were given with a mouse. In both experiments, we also found that confidence leak was weaker whenever the left hand was used in the previous trial, suggesting that lack of motor fluency reduces the strength of confidence serial dependence. These results demonstrate that switching the motor response weakens serial dependencies and imply that the action required to make a choice can impact one’s metacognitive evaluations.",

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, traditional decision-making models and wisdom cultivation methods fall short. Emulating exemplars or relying on mental shortcuts and habits may help in some situations but often fail with ill-defined problems and transformative decisions. We propose that cultivating metacognition—the ability to reflect on and regulate one's thoughts, goals, and emotions—is key to navigating these challenges. Metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, and open-mindedness help individuals discern complex situations, consider multiple viewpoints, and adapt their decision-making. Though not a cure-all, metacognition represents a promising frontier in cultivating wisdom. Insights from philosophy, psychology, and contemplative traditions suggest a range of interventions to foster metacognitive skills and enhance wise decision-making amid radical uncertainty. We call for a paradigm shift in how we approach judgment and decision-making, inviting researchers and practitioners to explore the untapped potential of metacognition in navigating life’s most complex challenges.",

The cross-linguistic component in this analysis is relevant, because languages differ in how they carve up the space of universal quantification.

We discuss how these quantifier-specific usage patterns lead to quantifier-specific developmental trajectories and challenges.",

          "authors": "Ansgar D Endress; Maureen de Seyssel",
          "abstract": "Learning statistical regularities from the environment is ubiquitous across domains and species. It might support the earliest stages of language acquisition, especially identifying and learning words from fluent speech (i.e., word-segmentation). But how do the statistical learning mechanisms involved in word-segmentation interact with the memory mechanisms needed to remember words -- and with the learning situations where words need to be learned? Through computational modeling, we first show that earlier results purportedly supporting memory-based theories of statistical learning can be reproduced by memory-less Hebbian learning mechanisms. We then show that, in a memory recall task after exposure to continuous, statistically structured speech sequences, participants track the statistical structure of the speech sequences and are thus sensitive to probable syllable transitions. However, they hardly remember any items at all, with 82% producing no high-probability items. Among the 30% of participants producing (correct) high- or (incorrect) low-probability items, half produced high-probability items and half low-probability items~--- even while preferring high-probability items in a recognition test. Only discrete familiarization sequences with isolated words yield memories of actual items. Turning to how specific learning situations affect statistical learning, we show that it predominantly operates in continuous speech sequences like those used in earlier experiments, but not in discrete chunk sequences likely more characteristic of early language acquisition. Taken together, these results suggest that statistical learning might be specialized to accumulate distributional information, but that it is dissociable from the (declarative) memory mechanisms needed to acquire words and does not allow learners to identify probable word boundaries.",

Despite extensive research on the costs and benefits of these states, our understanding of the relationship between mind-wandering, boredom, attention, and memory remains limited. In the current study, we examined the impact that mind-wandering and boredom during encoding have on recognition. In particular, we investigated what impact mind-wandering and boredom have during the encoding of visual stimuli on the pupil old/new effect during recognition. We used an incidental memory task and measured mind-wandering and boredom with thought probes during encoding. Furthermore, we used the pupil old/new effect, assessed via eye-tracking, as a measure of recognition memory. We found a significant effect of boredom on recognition memory and observed the pupil old/new effect in participants regardless of instances of mind-wandering or boredom during encoding. Our findings point towards different mechanisms that underly mind-wandering and boredom’s obstruction of attention during stimuli encoding and their effects on stimuli processing. In addition, these findings reinforce the idea of the pupil old/new effect as a reliable measure of recognition memory as it remained consistent irrespective of attentional lapses due to mind-wandering and boredom.",

          "abstract": "We examine how first language (L1) Spanish listeners with varying levels of experience with English recalibrate their phonemic category boundaries following exposure to second language (L2), American English-accented Spanish. Specifically, we examine changes to voice onset time (VOT) boundaries, which are often positively-shifted when produced by American English-accented Spanish speakers (as compared to L1 Spanish speakers). Our results demonstrate that listeners make adjustments to their phonemic category boundaries following exposure to accented words with the critical sounds in onset position (e.g., “bailar” and “parir”, meaning “to dance” and “to give birth”, for the /b/ and /p/ phonemic categories). In many cases generalization of phonemic learning was also observed, such that boundaries for categories that were not presented in training were also adjusted. Surprisingly, however, there were cases in which boundaries for trained categories did not show adjustments; for example, listeners trained with items for all places of articulation (POAs) showed recalibration of their bilabial and alveolar boundaries but not their velar boundary. Also notable was the role of the Spanish listeners' experience with English: More experienced listeners showed more positively-shifted (English-like) boundaries in the pre-test session. This suggests that more experienced listeners may have rapidly identified the American English-accented Spanish and applied their English category boundaries accordingly. We conclude that listener accommodation of L2 accent is supported by a phonemic recalibration mechanism, and that experience with the L1 of an L2-accented speaker facilitates rapid recalibration of phonemic categories.",

One manifestation of this is the rich pattern of semantic similarity effects found in immediate serial recall tasks. These effects differ from the effects of similarity on other dimensions (e.g., phonological similarity), which renders them difficult to explain. We propose a comprehensive mechanistic explanation of semantic similarity effects by extending a standard connectionist architecture for modeling immediate serial recall to incorporate semantic representations. Central to our proposal is the selective encoding of categorical features shared among multiple list-items. The selective encoding of shared semantic features is made possible via a tagging mechanism that enables the model to encode shared feature retrospectively. Through this category-encoding mechanism, our model accounts for the majority of semantic similarity effects. Our results imply that working memory represents semantic information in a more restricted way than phonological information.",

Van Elk and Blanke (2014) demonstrated that vestibular stimulation modulates spatial perspective taking. This study aims to replicate and expand this finding. Therefore, twenty participants performed a mental body transformation task while seated on a chair that rotated alternately in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction. Each participant completed trials during both the acceleration and deceleration phases of the chair rotation. During the acceleration phase, an interaction was observed between chair rotation direction and implied mental body rotation direction, indicating a congruency effect: Reaction times were faster when the implied mental body rotation direction matched the chair rotation direction during the acceleration phase. This was not found in the deceleration phase. These findings are consistent with those of the original study. Furthermore, a three-way interaction between chair rotation direction, implied mental body rotation direction, and rotational phase was discovered, which was not examined in the original study. This suggests that the previously noted interaction varies between the acceleration and deceleration phases. These findings support that vestibular stimulation modulates spatial perspective taking but also highlight the impact of the rotational phase on this process.",

We find that more highly educated people are significantly more culturally similar to WEIRD countries, such as the Anglosphere and Western Europe. Contrary to a general account of cultural transmission, education did not predict cultural similarities to other large, culturally and politically influential countries, such as China, Russia, and India. Contrary to modernization theories, income and self-reported subjective status did not show the same pattern of WEIRD cultural similarity.

The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states (“deep-being” mode) in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.",

          "abstract": "Clinical differentiation between adolescent suicidal self-harm (SSH) and nonsuicidal self-harm (NSSH) is a sig- nificant challenge for mental health professionals, and its feasibility is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine whether adolescent SSH can be differentiated from NSSH based on a holistic multimodel domain analysis (HMDA) of individual, psychological, sociodemographic, and environmental data without relying on intent and acquired capability for suicide. The study also sought to compare the compatibility of the HMDA result with four theories of suicide: the interpersonal theory of suicide, the three-steps theory, the inte- grated motivational-volitional model, and the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction. This cross- sectional study analyzed data from a nationwide survey conducted from 2017 to 2019 in Norway. The sample included 26,904 adolescents (mean age=15.01; 29.9 % males), who self-reported suicidal and nonsuicidal self- harm. The meta-learner classification model reached an AUC of 77.0 % and a 70.0 % for both sensitivity and specificity in differentiating the two conditions. Exploratory factor analysis suggested eight factors for clustering the important risk and protective indicators: 1) disordered eating and future orientation, 2) sleep disturbance, 3) orientation toward affects and self, 4) risk-taking behavior, 5) peer relationships, 6) victimization, safety, and security, 7) family relationships, and 8) substance use. These factors emphasize that domains central to adolescent physical, personal, social, and expected future well-being provide invaluable information about risk of suicidal and self-destructive behavior. The results also indicated that despite their high comorbidity, adolescent SSH and NSSH are multifaceted and can be differentiated without relying on suicide-related information. These findings fully supported the theory of adolescent suicidality and self-destruction and partially supported the ideation-to-action theories.",

This study examined college students’ reading patterns across different mediums, purposes, and contexts. Data from 922 students of US universities revealed distinct patterns in reading habits and preferences. Students engaged in an average of 1.68 hours of pleasure reading and 4.16 hours of news consumption weekly. Graduate students reported more extensive reading habits (8.61 hours/week) compared to undergraduates (5.55 hours/week). Medium preferences varied significantly by purpose: students favored paper formats for leisure reading (53.79%) but showed a strong preference for screens in academic contexts (76.04%) and news consumption (80.03%). This digital dominance in academic reading persisted despite evidence suggesting better comprehension with paper materials, likely driven by the accessibility and cost advantages of digital texts. Analysis of COVID-19’s impact revealed that 37% of students increased their leisure reading during lockdown, primarily as a stress management strategy. The study also uncovered distinct multitasking patterns: while 36.9% reported reading for pleasure without other activities, only 23.5% maintained singular focus during academic reading. These findings suggest that supporting student success requires understanding and adapting to evolving patterns of textual engagement, particularly as institutions navigate the balance between digital accessibility and optimal learning conditions.\nKeywords.

          "abstract": "Previous research on emotion regulation abilities has primarily focused on individual strategies and their association with (a lack of) well-being and psychopathology. Recent frameworks add emphasis to the importance of a context-sensitive and goal-dependent approach to emotion regulation, defining emotion regulation flexibility as the ability to adaptively adjust emotion regulation strategies based on contextual demands and personal goals. Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

However, to date, no validated measure has existed with which to quantify TNB identity support in romantic relationships. We used a four-stage process to develop and evaluate a multidimensional measure of TNB identity support from romantic partners. First, we generated items based on prior qualitative research, then used cognitive interviews with six TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to refine the items. Second, we piloted 59 items in a survey of 321 TNB people (16 years and older) reporting on current or recent romantic relationships. Using those data, we performed exploratory factor analysis to identify subscales, then selected 19 items based on factor loadings, item-subscale correlations, α-if-item-deleted, discrimination parameters, and item information curves. Third, we used weekly diary survey data from 299 romantically partnered TNB young adults (ages 18-30 years) to perform confirmatory factor analysis and assess reliability at the within- and between-relationship levels. Results indicate that the 19-item Transgender/Nonbinary Identity Support from Partners Scale (TISPS) assesses five forms of TNB identity support—Facilitation [of identity exploration], Identity Validation, Celebration, Allyship, and Understanding—with a consistent factor structure and good reliability at the between-relationship level. Psychometric results were poorer for weekly within-relationship variation, suggesting that TISPS subscales have suboptimal properties for assessing short-term change. The TISPS can be used in clinical and community settings and future research on the role of social support in TNB mental health.",

          "abstract": "What differentiates a happy day from a typical one? Answering this question can help to identify the building blocks of a happy life, but little is known about what makes some days better than others. To identify the ingredients of a good day, we used interpretable machine learning techniques to assess how time spent on over 100 activities predicted whether Americans rated their day as typical or “better than typical.” Using data from the 2013 (N = 9286) and 2021 (N = 6196) waves of the American Time Use Survey, we identified clear tipping points that distinguish better days from typical ones. Socializing was one of the most important activities for having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing had little impact. Time spent with friends, in contrast, had an almost boundlessly positive effect. The impact of working was also highly time contingent. We found that working for up to six hours had no impact on whether people rated their day as better than usual. When individuals worked for more than six hours though, the effects rapidly turned negative. Taken together, our results suggest that good days emerge from the constantly shifting value of time; each minute in a day represents a choice between competing opportunities, with clear tipping points when benefits diminish and costs mount.",

The inefficiencies are evident with peacebuilding and humanitarian aid efforts (Horwood, 2025; Riemer &amp; Schmitz, 2021). This article proposes a transdisciplinary framework to overcome such challenges. This framework was informed via a cross-functional research synthesis, including 77 practice-partner identified texts representing international frameworks, indices, and organisational repositories associated with human need, manmade and natural systems, and humanitarian and peacebuilding tenets that inform global policy and intervention. The academic literature review identified current barriers that prevent effective conceptualisation, measurement, and analysis with wellbeing and peacebuilding, and was coded to develop a Universal Object Needs Framework (UONF). The tenets/areas of inquiry within the 77 texts were then coded against the UONF to confirm they were all effectively represented.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive conflict is a broad phenomenon ranging from classic stimulus-response incompatibility to moral dilemmas. Traditionally, cognitive control theories have focused on conflict detection and resolution as competition at the response level. Instead, the conflict between representations at the perceptual level has remained largely unexplored within this framework. Here, we call attention to the fact that perception itself necessarily involves conflict resolution. Is there a common ground to unify theories of cognitive conflict and control with the theories of perception? We propose that shifting the focus away from motor representations and considering conflict awareness could provide a new perspective for the integration of cognitive conflict across different levels of representation, including the case of perceptual conflict.",

          "abstract": "Learning about the social expectations tied to upcoming social roles can prompt a strong drive for personal change, yet effective adaptation requires balancing this external pressure with the preservation of stable self-views. Here, we use computational models to provide a mechanistic account of how individuals at the onset of significant life transitions utilize their self-concept to modulate self-role dissonances during social role learning. We conducted two studies with distinct populations at the onset of important life transitions: first-year university students and pregnant women. Participants engaged in a learning task where they first provided self-ratings for different traits and then estimated how these traits would apply to an individual well-adapted to their forthcoming social role and received trial-by-trial feedback about their estimations of role-specific traits from reference groups (i.e., senior university students and experienced mothers). We hypothesized that individuals would employ strategies to minimize dissonances between their current self-concept and role expectations during the learning process. We formalized a series of computational models including strategies that straightforwardly integrate social expectations about new roles to more complex strategies that involve leveraging the current self-concept against the pure incorporation of role-related information. The best-performing computational model indicated that the self-concept acts as a modulatory mechanism, guiding the integration of incoming role information to minimize conflicts between existing identities and role-related expectations. Critically, comparative analysis of computational parameters indicated that this strategy was strongly accentuated in individuals learning about forthcoming social contexts. Our work provides a mechanistic perspective on role learning that could inform interventions to support individuals facing important life transitions.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation poses a substantial societal challenge, including in the Global South. However, to date, the vast majority of research into understanding and countering misinformation has taken place in the Global North, and the practical, methodological, and financial complications of doing research with underrepresented groups in Global South countries pose substantial limitations. For this study, we developed five humorous, live-action “prebunking” videos starring a well-known influencer from India, each tackling a different manipulation technique often used on Indian social media: spoofing, decontextualization, the perfect solution fallacy, emotional manipulation, and scapegoating. We hypothesized that the videos would significantly improve people’s ability to correctly identify these techniques in news and social media content in an online pilot study (N1 = 547), two field studies (N2 = 4,272, N3 = 1,676), and a large-scale study on YouTube (N4 = 129,710). We find limited support for our main hypotheses, observing some significant but no consistent improvement in technique discernment. In a series of focus group discussions (N5 = 33) and an additional randomized controlled trial (N6 = 827), we explore why this is the case. We find that, while the videos were considered highly entertaining and useful by the majority of viewers, the item rating tasks we administered (evaluating a series of social media posts) were an unfamiliar method of efficacy assessment for our participants. We discuss how interventions can be best designed and measured in contexts where assumptions from the Global North may not apply.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study explores individual experiences during Floatation-REST (Reduced Environmental Stimulation Technique), focusing on the perception of silence, darkness, and gravity. In Floatation-REST, an individual lies on the surface of highly saline water in a dark and silent environment, which typically leads to profound physical and mental relaxation. Prior research on Floatation-REST highlighted its benefits for both physical and mental health in otherwise healthy individuals as well as anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in people with a spectrum of anxiety and stress-related disorders.\nMethods: To delineate the float experience, a qualitative-empirical approach was employed engaging ten healthy participants, each of whom completed a 60-minute float session followed by a focused interview on the perception of silence, darkness, and gravity. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and MAXQDA software.\nResults: Silence was largely perceived as pleasant, evoking feelings of security, relaxation, and trust. Silence heightened sensitivity to auditory stimuli and deepened awareness of thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations. Darkness, although generally experienced as less pleasant than silence, similarly facilitated enhanced introspection and mental-process awareness. Regarding gravity, sensations of weightlessness and the dissolution of body boundaries were associated with mental relaxation, security, and a feeling of lightness. \nConclusions: Floatation-REST is being employed in studies to induce altered states of consciousness (ASC), as well as in therapeutic contexts to treat mental disorders. Similar to our study, future work could selectively focus on exploring the impact of the three major aspects of the floatation experience we assessed on ASC and therapeutic success.",

          "abstract": "In popular media, accurate climate information and climate disinformation often coexist and present competing narratives about climate change. As climate disinformation can undermine public support of climate policies and trust in climate science, it is crucial to understand what leads to exposure and acceptance of climate disinformation. Whereas previous research examined the effects of disinformation on climate beliefs, little is known about how people seek climate-related content (Pro- or Anti-climate) and how this varies between cross-cultural contexts. In a preregistered experiment, we studied how individuals sequentially sample and process climate-related information and disinformation. Participants from the U.S., China and Germany (Ntotal = 2226) freely sampled real-world climate related statements. Across 15 rounds, participants decided between two boxes containing Pro-climate or Anti-climate statements, respectively. Overall, reading a statement influenced climate concern in all countries. Participants preferred the box that was better aligned with their initial climate beliefs, and this confirmatory tendency intensified in later rounds. While climate concern was mostly stable, in the U.S., climate concern levels and box choices mutually reinforced each other, leading to greater polarization within the sample over time. The paradigm offers new perspectives on how people process and navigate conflicting narratives about climate change.",

          "abstract": "Researchers and laypeople alike have traditionally viewed personality as being highly stable across the lifespan. Although recent research has supported personality’s malleability, it is unclear how lifespan changes in personality traits compare to changes in other individual differences and how the public perceives this relative stability. Here, we investigate these perspectives using a multimethod, comparative approach across personality and other individual differences. In an online survey with a US-representative sample (n = 887), we found that laypeople believe personality traits change significantly less across the lifespan than other variables from domains like health and well-being. In contrast, using data from eight longitudinal panel studies (n = 166,971), we found that changes in personality were similar to many other commonly studied aspects of life, even surpassing lifespan changes in life satisfaction, self-esteem, subjective health, and church attendance, among others. Together, our results highlight that the durable view that personality traits are among the most stable aspects of life is at odds with the empirical reality. Given the implications of personality change and beliefs about personality change for future outcomes and successful interventions, it is crucial to effectively disseminate evidence to foster accurate beliefs about personality change.",

The current study delves into this contrast, seeking to understand how art is perceived and appreciated in museums and on a digital medium (like a computer screen). Across two experiments at the Barnes Foundation and Penn Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we explored how the aesthetic engagement of paintings and artifacts is influenced by the physical context in which an artwork is encountered and by the characteristics of the viewer. Our findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional impacts of artworks on viewers, as well as the viewers’ overall aesthetic experiences are comparable across physical museum spaces and digital platforms. However, participants reported gaining more understanding from art viewed in museums, compared to participants who viewed art in the lab. Art experience and openness to experience influenced aesthetic impacts and ratings differently in the museum and in the lab. Overall, routes to broader valuations of liking were more similar than different between the museum and lab contexts, whereas patterns of impacts that might lead to new knowledge or understanding gained differed between museum and lab contexts. As digital technologies are increasingly integrated into diverse processes in museums such as collections management, curation, exhibitions, and education and learning, our research highlights how museums can leverage digital expansion to achieve their missions as centers of learning and education.",

Whereas some people justify existing systems of power to maintain the status quo, others seek to challenge those systems, believing that existing systems distribute power inequitably across social groups. We aimed to establish a new psychological construct that reflects and accounts for how marginalized groups are not merely passive recipients of other people’s prejudice but form attitudes that resist and reconstrue status inequalities. In seven studies (N = 1,973), we developed and validated a measure to assess stigmatized groups’ attitudes toward dominant groups: the Upward Resistance Scale (URS). We examined LGBQ people’s attitudes toward heterosexual people, racial minorities’ attitudes toward white people, women’s attitudes toward men, poor people’s attitudes toward the wealthy, and fat people’s attitudes toward thin people. We found that the extent to which participants acknowledged status discrepancies between their ingroup and the dominant outgroup, they felt greater upward resistance toward the dominant outgroup. Our findings suggest that the 14-item URS is valid and reliable for detecting individual differences in beliefs about dominant groups and the status and privilege that they occupy.",

This manuscript explores one suggested TTE of intergroup contact affecting political attitudes and behaviours mediated via intergroup ideologies in a multi-verse approach combining several intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours indicators. We used three waves of the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC), a representative large-scale annual survey (N = 2,863), and random-intercept cross-lagged panel models as advanced analytical methods. We found numerous stable between-person associations between intergroup contact, intergroup ideologies and political attitudes and behaviours. We did not find consistent longitudinal evidence supporting a within-person process of intergroup contact affecting intergroup ideologies and in turn political attitudes and behaviours, as proposed by the cognitive liberalisation hypothesis. We contextualise our findings in the existing literature as well as the emerging TTE research and provide suggestions for future",

          "abstract": "Continuous flow and evidence accumulation models have recently been combined to provide an integrated account of decision and motor mechanisms engaged in choice reaction time tasks. According to this account, muscle activation is essentially determined by the evidence accumulation decision variable through a continuous decision-to-motor transmission of information. However, it remains unclear whether and how this framework can be extended to situations that impose a time lag between the commitment to a choice and the expression of that choice through actions. Such situations have been studied using response signal (RS) decision tasks featuring a short delay between the offset of the stimulus and a signal to respond. The present work integrates recent developments in decision-making, working memory, and motor control research to extend models of immediate decision reports to delayed decision reports. We assumed that the evidence accumulation decision variable transitions to sustained activity after hitting a threshold to achieve the short-term maintenance of the selected choice. The level of sustained activity then constitutes the starting point for a second phase of accumulation, in which subjects sample evidence from the RS to activate the muscles. We tested predictions from the theory at the behavioral and muscle activation levels in three RS decision tasks featuring manipulations of stimulus duration, delay duration, and foreknowledge of the stimulus-response mapping. Muscle activation was measured using electromyography. The theory provided a unified account of empirical effects.",

          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

Study 1 was a conceptual replication of previously observed relationships between insight puzzles, the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and the Verbal Cognitive Reflection Test (VCRT). Study 2 examined differences between analytical and insightful tasks using self-report insight scales. Five dimensions of insight were measured: suddenness, confidence, pleasure, the aha! experience, and arousal. \nResults showed a clear and positive correlation between insight puzzles and reflective tests (CRT, VCRT) in both studies, these supporting results from previous studies. Additionally, no differences in feelings of insight were observed between insight puzzles and the Cognitive Reflection Test. However, feelings of insight were greater for the VCRT than for insight puzzles. This suggests that the experience of insight may not be exclusively tied to a specific type of problem; rather, it may reflect a style of problem solving that can emerge in various task contexts.",

          "abstract": "Research and practice aimed at enhancing state motivation through job assignments that align with workers' trait motivations have demonstrated significant benefits. \"Occupational personality traits\" refer to Openness to experience (O), Extraversion (E), and Agreeableness (A) factors, which are associated with personality traits and occupational preferences. These traits facilitate the assessment of motivation and enable comparative analyses of the effectiveness of personality versus preference, as they share core semantics (i.e., O, E, or A) but differ in situational characteristics (i.e., broad everyday personalities versus occupation-specific preferences). This study examines occupational personality traits as indicators of an individual's trait-like motivation. We asked workers to rate both the person (i.e., their trait motivation for various jobs) and the environment (i.e., their actual occupation) using occupational personality traits and their current work motivation state. Polynomial regression with response surface analysis revealed that the motivational state was highest when person and job ratings aligned across the O, E, and A factors. This alignment effect was independently significant for O personality, E preference, and A preference, suggesting that specific factors dominate depending on the situation's breadth or occupational specificity. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing job assignments that align with employees' inherent motivational orientations, utilizing factor-specific constructs to foster a more motivated workforce.",

Male adults scored higher on instrumental harm and showed lower diversity endorsement, with AI engagement linked to stronger utilitarianism but weaker diversity support. Given males greatly outnumber females in the AI workforce, our findings suggest that AI-builders are likely more utilitarian and less diversity-endorsing than -users. However, results from adolescents indicate that, particularly for utilitarianism, these differences may converge for future cohorts depending on the composition of the workforce. Our findings underscore that a more diverse AI workforce is crucial for aligning moral and diversity preferences with broader societal values.",

Our study provides preliminary evidence and can act as a blueprint for future explorations of how conversations with LLMs can change attitudes on meat consumption and related topics.",

          "abstract": "Facial emotional expressions are interactive signals that communicate intentions. Previous research has shown that sending a facial emotional expression influences the evaluation of response expressions, but the mechanisms behind this effect remain unclear. In a preregistered experiment, 68 participants were asked to send an emoji (happy, neutral, angry) to a virtual agent in front of them, whereupon the agent reacted with either a smiling or frowning facial expression. Valence and arousal ratings were obtained and mimicry responses to the agent’s expression were measured via facial EMG of the Zygomaticus and Corrugator muscle. The results show that being smiled at is more pleasant and elicits greater Zygomaticus activation when the smile is received as a response to a happy emoji compared to an angry emoji. In contrast, being frowned at is less pleasant and increased Corrugator activity when the angry expression is received as a response to a happy compared to an angry emoji. Finally, we found that sending an emoji resulted in activation of facial muscles corresponding to the valence of the emoji. The results support the role of affiliative mechanisms in the exchange of facial expressions but also demonstrate that persons are sensitive to the congruency between emotional signals of sender and receiver. These effects might be driven by physiological feedback. By implementing digital emotional expressions the present study dissects the communicative act from the motor display of a facial expression and thus allows to probe mechanisms behind social interactions in real and digital worlds.",

          "abstract": "Perceptions of competence affect important social outcomes, and economic status cues embedded in clothes influence these perceptions. However, the role of individuals’ stereotypes in shaping these judgments remains unclear. This research investigates how economic status stereotypes affect competence judgments based on clothing cues across two cultural contexts. In studies conducted in Singapore (n=98) and the U.S. (n=208), participants judged the competence of individuals paired with expensive- or inexpensive-looking clothes. Participants’ economic status stereotypes were measured using questions about rich and poor people’s competence. In both studies, individuals with stronger economic status stereotypes showed a greater tendency to judge those in expensive-looking clothes as more competent. This effect manifested differently across cultures: in Singapore, it was driven by stereotypes about rich people’s competence, while in the U.S., it centered on stereotypes about poor people’s incompetence. These findings highlight how economic status stereotypes shape social perceptions universally and in culturally specific ways.",

Yet, almost nothing is known about the long-term consequences of turning to AI for companionship. In the present study, we surveyed 2149 participants in four Western countries, tracking their chatbot use and loneliness across 12 months. Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we modeled within-person changes in chatbot use and loneliness across four time points. We found evidence for a bi-directional relationship: Feeling lonelier predicted increased chatbot use, and increased chatbot use, in turn, predicted increased loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong causal conclusions; our findings are akin to a smoke alarm, providing an early warning signal of a potential problem, rather than direct evidence of fire.",

          "abstract": "Much of our understanding of language processing has been informed by controlled laboratory experiments abstracted from the real world demands of naturalistic communication. Interactive language use “in the wild” involves synchronizing numerous verbal and non-verbal behaviors between interlocutors. Conversation partners synchronize verbal production through modulations of rate, amplitude, lexical-semantic complexity, affective tone, and many other dimensions. Much remains to be learned about how to measure linguistic alignment in naturalistic interactions. We developed an open-source R package (ConversationAlign) capable of computing novel indices of alignment and main effects of language use between interlocutors across 30 psycholinguistic dimensions (e.g., valence, concreteness, frequency, word length). We describe operations of the ConversationAlign workflow, including its primary functions of cleaning transcripts and transforming raw language data to simultaneous time series objects aggregated by interlocutor, turn, and conversation. We present a use case of ConversationAlign applied to interview transcripts between American radio legend, Terry Gross, and her many guests over the span of 15 years (Fresh Air Archive, 2001). We identify caveats for use and potential sources of bias (e.g., polysemy, missing data, robustness to brief language samples). We close with a discussion of potential applications to better understand lexical alignment.

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-reaching, global impacts on families that continue to be felt, particularly in education. Past research has documented changes in parents’ involvement in their children’s education during, as compared to before, the COVID-19 pandemic. It is often assumed that these changes are due to the increased burden placed on parents due to education being moved online in an effort to prevent disease spread. Despite this widely accepted assertation, the current study is the first to empirically investigate and support that the amount of time children were in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s learning during the pandemic. This was done in the present preregistered study with data on 833 parents from across the United States with twin children in kindergarten through twelfth grade during the 2020-2021 school year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that parents of children who spent a higher percentage of the school year in online learning were more involved in providing schoolwork help to their children than parents of children who spent less of the school year in online education. Additionally, time spent in online education was associated with parents having less positive feelings towards their children’s school and teachers. These results held when controlling for parents’ education level and children’s grade level, each of which also predicted parental involvement. Thus, it appears that time spent in online education predicted parents’ involvement in their children’s education during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this differed by various factors of parental involvement.",

These are interventions aiming to increase uptake of or adherence to health protective behaviours. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics and effects of these interventions. Methods: For the review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for studies on behavioural interventions. Out of 690 identified articles, 35 studies were considered relevant for this review. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) (Higgins et al., 2019). Results: The majority of studies researched the effects of interventions on social or physical distancing, handwashing, or face coverings. Many studies explored the effects of different types of messages, for example, promoting health protective behaviours. Message-based, online interventions were most common, but largely showed small to negligible effects. Some studies explored other intervention types such as coaching sessions and found moderate to large effects. Conclusion: While the results of these studies indicate that some interventions increase adherence, large heterogeneity in study and intervention design make it difficult to interpret and compare the effects of different interventions. Both an improvement of methodological rigour and standardisation efforts are needed to make behavioural research usable for policy design.",

          "abstract": "Imagine reading a shopping list: words such as apple, banana, and pear immediately create a strong sense of coherence, forming a predictable semantic context so that when the word orange appears, it is readily anticipated. In contrast, when the list begins with only apple followed by orange, the prediction is weaker despite semantic closeness. To capture this effect experimentally, participants (n = 20) performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one prime (short condition) or three semantically related primes (long condition). This design allowed us to examine how local semantic predictability accumulated across multiple primes. Our results showed that repeated exposure to semantically related primes substantially accelerated decision-making — an effect we attribute to faster evidence accumulation for semantically similar prime-target pairs, as quantified by a drift-diffusion model. Our results thus extend our understanding of language prediction to minimal contexts, demonstrating that top-down facilitation can emerge rapidly from just a few preceding items. This study advances our understanding of how prediction shapes language processing and demonstrates the relevance of hierarchical decision-making models in behavioral research.",

Relationships between other cognitive abilities and motor speech outcomes were also reported, however, there were significant gaps in the literature and heterogeneity in the measurements used. In addition, only five studies contained the highest quality evidence. Cognition, and potentially executive abilities specifically, may affect speech articulation in healthy aging and in MCI.

          "abstract": "To what degree might speech perception be affected by factors external to the speech signal? Here we consider whether listeners consider the value of individual talkers (e.g., a person that is important to the listener versus a passing stranger) when learning the idiosyncrasies of their speech, perhaps by directing their attention to the more “valuable” talker. In general, talker-specific phonetic recalibration has proven to be remarkably robust, leaving open how permeable it is to domain-general influences like attention and reward. The current study asked whether the magnitude of the talker-specific learning effect was modulated by an external reward intended to bias listeners to prioritize one talker over the other. Using an established paradigm, participants learned idiosyncratic pronunciations of the /s/ and /ʃ/ fricatives by two talkers—“Jane” and “Austin.” Over multiple experiments, participants were more likely to receive a few additional cents for one talker compared to the other following correct responses during exposure. We hypothesized that participants would show greater phonetic recalibration to the high-reward talker compared to the low-reward talker. Our results showed that participants did not show a difference in the degree of learning based on the value of each talker, suggesting that lexically guided perceptual learning is robust to external rewards. This finding opens discussions into the role of reward and attention in talker-specific phonetic recalibration, and how domain-general factors influence speech perception more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behaviour. They appear to document a continuous practice of non-figurative mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex, ordered and symmetric markings such as cross-hatchings. To inform discussions of the possible function of the engravings, we conducted a two-part experimental study. Based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements, we used a transmission chain experiment to reconstruct the cultural evolutionary trajectory of the engraved marking. Each transmission chain was seeded with drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings. We then conducted five experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the changes to the drawings and compared these results to a similar analysis of the original engravings. The drawings became increasingly easier to discriminate and increased in their perceived intentionality over the experimental generations. There was no evidence of a systematic change in drawing saliency or memorability, and the drawings did not acquire stylistic properties over the experimental generations. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the transmission chain drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlight the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behaviour. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analysing trajectories of early symbolic behaviour.",

          "abstract": "The warming of Earth’s surface temperatures poses a serious threat to the Earth’s ecosystem.  In 1996, world leaders agreed to limit this temperature rise to a maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while aiming to keep warming below 1.5°C. In order to achieve this, changes the consumption behaviours of households and individuals are needed. To encourage such change, websites have emerged which attempt to persuade individuals to adopt more sustainable behaviours.  This study explores twenty participants’ experiences using such websites.  The study employs a qualitative, longitudinal design, and utilises the think aloud method to examine the experience of using two web-based tools, Get-Greener and Climate Hero.  The study also investigates participants’ reflections on the sustainable behaviours recommended by these tools. During the two-week period, eight participants made small behavioural changes, six of which were recommended by the tools.  Key findings highlight the importance of persuasive design elements: feedback on current behaviour via footprint calculations, customised recommendations that consider personal circumstances, and ongoing support are valued by participants.  Participants preferred small, easy-to-implement ideas, highlighting barriers to larger-scale changes such as cost, limited access to sustainable alternatives, logistical issues, and a lack of clarity about what is sustainable.  Despite a general desire to adopt sustainable practices, intrinsic motivations such as convenience and financial considerations often outweighed pro-environmental intentions. Additionally, government leadership and social norms significantly influenced attitudes toward sustainability.  Participants expressed a need for clearer guidance and collective societal support to overcome these challenges.",

Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: positive inner speech, negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed.",

          "abstract": "EEG studies show that stimuli requiring withholding a response (Nogo) elicit larger frontal N2 and frontocentral P3 event-related potentials (ERPs) than stimuli requiring a response (Go). However, the functional significance of these components remains debated due to overlapping neural processes and potential confounds in Go/Nogo tasks. One concern is that Nogo trials are typically less frequent than Go trials to induce a stronger response tendency. Since N2 and P3 are modulated by stimulus frequency, some argue that Nogo effects may reflect a response mismatch signal from infrequent Nogo trials. To test this, Eimer (1993) manipulated Go/Nogo trial frequency, using a 75/25 ratio in Experiment 1 and a 50/50 ratio in Experiment 2. While the N2 and P3 effects were numerically larger in Experiment 1, they remained robust in Experiment 2, with both components showing greater amplitudes for Nogo trials. These findings contradict the response mismatch hypothesis and emphasize the importance of equating trial frequency in Go/Nogo studies. Eimer (1993) also manipulated spatial attention to determine whether the N2 effect reflects an automatic (i.e., attention-independent) process. Results showed that N2 effects were modulated by attentional cues, ruling out a purely automatic process and highlighting the role of processes that affect initial stimulus detection and discrimination in these tasks. The present study replicates Eimer’s Experiment 2 from and assess the robustness of the results across analysis pipelines. Moreover, it will extend the original analyses by determining whether 50/50 Go/Nogo paradigms reliably induce prepotent response tendencies. As part of the #EEGManyLabs project, 5 labs will independently replicate the original study, ensuring high statistical power. Results will be integrated via meta-analysis, offering insights into the replicability of classic EEG findings and N2/P3 sensitivity to stimulus frequency and spatial attention in Go/Nogo tasks. The large dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future meta-analyses.",

          "abstract": "We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Student well-being is a multidimensional construct encompassing physical and mental health. However, its assessment in educational contexts remains fragmented, failing to comprehensively understand the diverse factors that shape students’ experiences. This gap is particularly pronounced for cognitively strong students (CSS), whose unique intellectual, emotional, and social challenges are frequently overlooked by traditional approaches.\nObjective: Current work introduces a methodology - aligned with ethical scientific expectations - to develop a holistic understanding of student well-being by integrating multimodal data. The approach will uncover key patterns that influence well-being and academic performance, offering actionable insights to guide targeted interventions in educational settings.  \nMethods: The framework, developed through an extensive literature review and refined using the Delphi method, integrates three core components: physiological measures (e.g., heart rate variability and sleep data) to detect stress; self-reporting tools for qualitative insights; and survey instruments to capture psychological stressors and socio-economic influences. While broadly applicable, it emphasizes CSS-specific stressors. \nResults: We collect qualitative and quantitative data based on self-reports and physiological measures. Large language models are leveraged for sentiment analyses of qualitative data. Classic machine learning techniques analyze physiological data and integrate quantitative data from multiple modalities. This approach aims to identify patterns in stress and coping mechanisms, offering insights into broader dimensions of well-being.  \nConclusion: This research advances AI-driven educational tools, with an ethically grounded, data-driven approach to support student development, particularly for CSS.",

While earlier work looked at pseudo-discrimination on an item-by-construct basis, we introduce pseudo-factor analysis to enhance scale design. Pseudo-factor analysis is a data-less, model-based approach to evaluating aspects of a latent construct’s measurement model, such as dimensionality and the relations between factors and their indicators. Across two studies using Five and Six-factor personality frameworks, a variety of sentence transformer models, and three encoding approaches (i.e., atomic, atomic reversed, and macro), pseudo-factor analyses recovered theoretically expected structures. These pseudo-factor structures were strongly related to their established empirical factor structures based on factor analyses of human ratings in prior published research. We suggest that Pseudo-Factor Analysis is a viable method for checking and potentially modifying scale items after item generation and before item trialing. We provide a Shiny application for calculating pseudo-factor analysis parameters and related psychometric estimates.",

          "authors": "Saanvi Kumar",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nThere is an increasing rate of comorbidity with alcoholism and mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, especially among young adults, the demographic with the largest proportion of heavy drinkers. This study compares semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug, and naltrexone, which is FDA-approved for treating alcoholism, in treating comorbid alcoholism and anxiety using self-reported data from Reddit posts.\n\nMethods\n\nReddit API was used to extract Reddit posts relating either of the drugs (naltrexone and semaglutide) to either of the disorders (alcoholism and anxiety) as well as posts discussing the side effects of each drug. A script was created in Python to use Reddit API and automatically label the posts using a list of keywords, which was developed by running the script and manually checking portions of the data. For each drug, the effectiveness in treating a disorder was compared to ineffectiveness, and low/moderate side effects were compared to high side effects. The Chi-square test was applied to check for significance.\n\nResults\n\nAn analysis of 1,214 posts showed that Semaglutide was more effective than naltrexone at treating alcoholism as 100% of posts reported semaglutide to be effective compared to 75.67% of posts for naltrexone. Although the percentage of posts reporting the effectiveness of naltrexone for anxiety was greater at 68.97% compared to 63.83% for semaglutide, a chi-square test found that these differences were not statistically significant. Semaglutide had less intense side effects than naltrexone as 63.76% of the posts discussing semaglutide side effects found them to have a high intensity compared to 73.14% of posts discussing naltrexone side effects.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the rising comorbid condition of anxiety with alcoholism, semaglutide is a promising alternative to naltrexone for treating patients with alcoholism. It also appears to be a safer alternative, which could encourage more people to seek out treatment. Future studies can conduct clinical trials with treatment-seeking patients to affirm it, especially for comparing the two drugs for alcohol effectiveness. Other GLP-1 drugs and other mental health disorders in alcoholism comorbidities should also be explored.",

          "authors": "Tavneen Sandhu; Sarah Rebecca Saju; Ruien Wang; Anita Tusche",
          "abstract": "Are humans naturally inclined to help others, or are we more focused on ourselves? How does the brain decide whether to put someone else’s needs ahead of our own? Helping, sharing, and cooperating are key human behaviors that have shaped societies and allowed civilizations to thrive. These prosocial actions often involve giving up something—like time, effort, or resources—to benefit others. Despite the personal cost, prosocial actions play a crucial role in building relationships, improving well-being and health, and tackling global challenges like climate change. Prosocial behavior is a complex concept with many layers. Researchers from psychology, neuroscience, economics, and other fields use a range of tools and methods to study it. This chapter explores human prosociality in several ways. It looks at how researchers measure prosocial behavior, examines the brain regions involved in making prosocial decisions, and discusses the factors that influence when and why people act in prosocial ways. Specifically, it outlines how environmental influences like stress and culture, along with individual differences such as age and genetics, shape prosocial behaviors. Finally, the chapter explores exciting trends and future directions in research, helping us better understand what drives humans to care for one another.",

          "abstract": "Impairments in reward-related behavior in everyday life are characteristic of major depressive disorder and closely linked with anhedonia. While previous research has suggested a negative relationship between reward-related behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia, findings across clinical and non-clinical studies are mixed. \nWe conducted three online studies, recruiting a combined 629 nonpatient online participants. The studies consisted of an exploratory study, a preregistered replication, and data from a separate study utilizing a distinct learning task. Participants completed reinforcement learning tasks where they learned to select either the more rewarding response or more rewarding stimulus, as well as a large set of self-report measures of symptoms and traits. Contrary to expectations, we observed a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms across all three studies. General depression symptoms showed one positive association and two null associations with performance. Our results contrast with the assumption of a negative association between reinforcement learning behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia. Instead, our results suggest that in large non-selective samples, anhedonia symptoms can be positively associated with reward-guided learning and decision-making.",

          "authors": "Ioana Marinescu; R. Thomas McCoy; Tom Griffiths",
          "abstract": "People can learn new concepts from a small number of examples by drawing on inductive biases that favor some hypotheses over others. These inductive biases have previously been captured by Bayesian models that use symbolic representations such as logical formulas to define prior distributions over hypotheses. But does this imply that people must be using symbolic representations when solving these problems?  We show that it is possible to create an artificial neural network that displays the same inductive biases as symbolic Bayesian models without making use of explicit symbolic representations. Our approach is based on distilling a prior distribution from a symbolic Bayesian model via meta-learning, a method for extracting the common structure from a set of tasks. This approach is used to create an artificial neural network with an inductive bias towards concepts expressed as short logical formulas. Analyzing results from previous behavioral experiments in which people learned logical concepts from a few examples shows that neural networks trained via meta-learning are able to capture human performance. These results suggest that while symbolic models are an effective tool for giving an interpretable description of human inductive biases, they do not imply that people must be using symbolic representations in order to make inferences that align with those inductive biases.",

          "abstract": "Background: Bipolar disorder is a prevalent mental health condition which remains challenging to diagnose accurately. The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to be elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder. Additional primary studies have emerged since the most comprehensive previous meta-analysis on this topic by Solmi et al. (2021), warranting an updated synthesis of evidence.\t \nAims: This study aimed to compare IL-6 levels in blood or plasma in patients with bipolar disorder versus healthy comparison groups by meta-analysis. \t\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted, incorporating recent studies, and addressing methodological limitations, such as skewed data distributions, and differences between mood states. Random-effects models, with and without inverse variance weighting, were used. The systematic search included observational studies published between 1993 and 2023. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore variations in IL-6 levels across mood states (manic, depressive, euthymic or mixed).\t \nResults: This study included 62 scientific articles. A meta-analysis with default weighting showed that IL-6 was higher in patients (standardized mean difference 0.77 [0.46, 1.08]), but in presence of high heterogeneity (I2=96.92%). A meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting showed a smaller difference between patients and controls (0.37 [-0.03, 0.80]. Subgroup analyses suggested elevated levels of IL-6 in manic states. \t\nConclusions: IL-6 levels were elevated in bipolar patients versus healthy comparison groups, though effect sizes were smaller than previously reported and not statistically significant when using inverse variance weighting. Uncertainty remains concerning any role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.",

          "abstract": "The intricate interplay between visual art, aesthetic appreciation, and human cognition has long captivated artists and scientists. One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is the ability to maintain focus on a specific goal over time,\nbut lapses in attention are frequent. Many theories have attributed these lapses to a\ntransient failure of control in maintaining the goal in mind. However, these proposals\nhave been challenged because recent findings have shown more engagement of\ncognitive control during states more prone to lapses. We hypothesized that lapses occur\nduring periods of high competition between goals, requiring stronger cognitive control.\nTo test this goal-competition hypothesis, we developed a Switch-Continuous\nPerformance Task in which subjects alternated task goals between blocks—either\nswitching or holding the same goal—in an effort to manipulate periods of higher and\nlower competition between goals. Participants viewed a bilateral display showing a\nscene (indoor/outdoor) and a face (male/female) on each trial. At the start of each 20-\ntrial block, a cue instructed participants to perform either the scene task (e.g., press for\nfrequent indoor scenes, not infrequent outdoor scenes) or the face task (e.g., press for\nfrequent male faces, not infrequent female faces). Results showed more attention lapses\nduring switch than repeat blocks, suggesting that lapses occur during periods of high\ncompetition between goals. In a second study, we monetarily rewarded performance on\nonly one task (scene or face) to create unequal competition between goals. We found\nthat switching to an unrewarded goal—but not a rewarded goal—produced more lapses.\nTogether, these findings support the goal-competition hypothesis as an explanation for\nthe occurrence of sustained attention lapses.",

          "abstract": "Case conceptualization informs clinical decision making by generating hypotheses about predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors that are continually updated with new information from ongoing treatment. This study applies a novel data-driven approach to formalize this process with personalized network estimation through prior elicitation and Bayesian inference. It is the first study to assess the clinical utility of this approach in a sample of twelve psychotherapy patients, primarily treated for depression, along with their respective therapists.\nPatients employed the PECAN (Perceived Causal Networks) method to create personalized \"prior networks,\" mapping how they perceived their symptoms to interact. Intensive longitudinal data were then collected six times daily over 15 days (N = 935). Bayesian inference was used to update these prior networks using the collected longitudinal data, resulting in personalized \"posterior networks.\"\nBoth PECAN and longitudinal assessments were evaluated feasible and acceptable. The posterior networks scored highest in face validity. Patients emphasized the personal relevance of these networks, while therapists noted their value in guiding the therapeutic process. However, prior, posterior, and data-driven networks showed significant dissimilarities. These differences may stem from patients’ limited insight into symptom interactions, insufficient power in the longitudinal data, or variations in self-perception. Despite these discrepancies, this study demonstrates the potential for integrating two methods to create personalized networks. Future research should refine this formalization process to develop more robust, hypothesis-driven strategies that improve case conceptualization.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of the present research was to investigate the temporal dynamics of the core cognitive vulnerability and individual internalizing symptom characteristics and to explore the role of negative events in relation to the core cognitive vulnerability and symptoms.\nMethods: Adopting a network approach, we fitted a multilevel vector autoregressive model to ecological momentary assessment data from 223 university students collected over 21 days – modelling associations between the core cognitive vulnerability, perceived event negativity, and 12 internalizing symptoms.\nResults: In the between-person network, core cognitive vulnerability was positively associated with the avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, indicating that those with higher levels of core cognitive vulnerability on average tended to avoid anxiety-provoking situations more severely on average. In the contemporaneous network, momentary core cognitive vulnerability was associated with various momentary symptoms. In the temporal network, increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the severity of three specific symptoms – anxious mood, fear, and feeling like a failure. Interestingly, momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the perceived event negativity, but perceived event negativity did not predict subsequent increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability.\nConclusions: Our findings show that the core cognitive vulnerability is differentially associated with symptoms at the between-person and within-person levels of analysis. On a moment-to-moment basis, core cognitive vulnerability temporally precedes and influences the severity of emotional symptoms and perceived event negativity. We discuss study implications and outline directions for future research to clarify the etiology of internalizing psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Monte Carlo simulation studies are the de facto standard for assessing both classical and modern statistical methods. In traditional simulation studies, researchers have full discretion over data generation and often create simulated data with a high degree of smoothness and limited dependencies among variables. Under such conditions, the performance of statistical methods may not indicate their real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel AI-based simulation framework that leverages generative AI (GenAI) to create realistic synthetic data and incorporate them into Monte Carlo simulation studies. In particular, we focus on simulation studies with sequential data (e.g., action sequences from process data) and demonstrate our approach by evaluating the predictive performance of an example statistical method. Our framework consists of five key steps: (i) pre-processing input data, (ii) training GenAI models on input data, (iii) assessing synthetic data quality, (iv) conducting AI-based simulations, and (v) evaluating simulation results. We also perform robustness checks on both synthetic data quality and simulation outcomes by modifying specific steps of our approach. Overall, the proposed AI-based simulations outperform traditional simulations in generating realistic synthetic data and providing a more accurate evaluation of the real-world performance of statistical methods.",

          "abstract": "This study presents empirical evidence suggesting that consciousness, specifically during meditative states, influences quantum interference patterns without collapsing quantum states. Using IBM's quantum processors, we developed and implemented experimental protocols to assess how different consciousness states affect quantum measurements. Our results demonstrate that meditation significantly alters quantum interference (p=0.025, Cohen's d=-2.88) while having minimal impact on coherence or entanglement. Individual meditation sessions suppressed interference by 73.3% on average, while synchronized meditation enhanced interference by 340%. Furthermore, these effects gradually dissipate following meditation with a characteristic relaxation time (τ) of approximately 74 minutes. These findings challenge von Neumann-Wigner collapse interpretations while supporting a Quantum Bayesian (QBism) model where consciousness modifies quantum probability distributions without forcing collapse. We present a mathematical framework integrating QBism with our empirical findings and discuss implications for quantum mechanics, consciousness studies, and information theory.",

          "abstract": "According to the normative standpoint, decision-making under risk, as it is traditionally instantiated in choice among fully described probabilistic lotteries, should not be affected by the disclosure of outcomes (feedback).  Yet, contrary to this normative prescription, empirical studies have repeatedly reported that risk preferences are affected by immediate presentation of choice outcomes. The consensual and intuitive hypothesis is that feedback affects risk preferences via a learning process, whereby experienced outcomes alter the representation of subjective values. However, despite a relatively large body of published studies, available evidence does not allow robustly establishing the direction and the impact of feedback on key decision variables, namely risk propensity and expected value maximization, limiting our ability to establish a clear cognitive mechanism. Here, we ran seven behavioral experiments, tailored to address this gap and found that the presence of feedback consistently increases risk-taking, without any detectable impact on expected value maximization. Crucially, fine-grained analyses of the temporal dynamics of the effect of feedback directly falsified one of the currently most influential models of the role of experience in decisions under risk, and challenges any instantiation of the learning hypotheses. These results rather favor of an attitudinal effect, induced by the anticipation of feedback information. Epistemic curiosity and regret avoidance may drive this effect in partial and complete feedback conditions, respectively.",

However, because HiTOP is based on analyses of standardized symptom criteria and close-ended survey items, it may just reflect the structure of available measures.  This study provides a novel test of HiTOP’s generalizability by comparing it to the structure of psychopathology derived from the natural language people use when talking about their mental health.  For our analysis, we obtained 87,007 naturalistic descriptions of mental health from &gt;55,625 unique users on 27 online Reddit forums (i.e., subreddits).  We used text embeddings in large language models to represent common themes of posts in the subreddits, each dedicated to a different diagnosis or maladaptive trait.  Semantic similarity of posts across subreddits was quantified with a cosine similarity matrix. We then fit exploratory factor models to this matrix and examined the hierarchical structure with a bass-akwards approach. Results showed the natural language structure of psychopathology closely corresponds to the HiTOP model, with factors resembling internalizing, detachment, thought disorder, substance use, antagonism, and somatoform spectra at the lowest level of the hierarchy.  The higher-order factors diverged from HiTOP, including a linguistic p-factor that reflects variation in attribution of problems to internal vs. external sources.  Overall, the emergence of HiTOP spectra from natural language offers unique evidence for its validity and clinical utility.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale online studies with healthy adults have documented consistent associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric traits and metacognitive biases. Here, analysis of existing and new large-scale datasets reveals that such correlations are largely driven by surface-level dimensions of questionnaire-filling behaviour: systematic rating biases and inattentive responding. Specifically, a bias to report positive or negative values in self-report scales generalizes to confidence ratings, producing spurious correlations between the two. Additionally, systematic over-confidence among inattentive responders produces spurious positive correlations between confidence and the endorsement of rare symptoms. We show that previously identified transdiagnostic dimensions of “anxiety-depression” and “compulsivity and intrusive thought,” both shown to correlate with decision confidence, map neatly onto these two biases of questionnaire-filling behaviour. In a pre-registered experiment, we further show that decision confidence and self-reported obsessive-compulsive tendencies are correlated with independent measures of inattentive and biased responding. Taken together, we find an alarming degree of influence of inattentive and biased responding over both self-report psychiatric measures and confidence ratings. When not accounted for, these factors produce a mirage of apparent metacognitive alterations in mental health. We discuss concrete precautionary measures that are needed to control for these biases.",

Drawing from quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and metaphysical idealism, this model resolves paradoxes such as the observer effect, non-locality, and memory as real-time access.

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

Although these doctrines do not enjoy widespread support in current philosophy of science, they continue to influence psychological science through their effect on research practices and its, often implicit, methodological principles. In this paper, we argue that at least five of these principles hamper progress in psychology. Epistemic freezing refers to unhelpful conservatism in the use of psychometric measurement techniques; testing myopia concerns the focus on hypothesis testing at the expense of other research practices; data fixation is the belief that data are what require explanation, and that gathering novel and surprising data is key to scientific progress; smallism is the preference for reductive explanation; and mirrorism denotes a focus on developing true theories as opposed to developing pragmatically or epistemically useful ones. We argue that adherence to these principles, and to the research practices that go with it, puts psychological science at risk of stagnation, and we call for a broad discussion to reassess and adapt them.",

However, we need comprehensive and robust methodologies to identify gaps and inefficiencies in service provision to shape policy, ensure efficient allocation of resources and support those most in need. Here we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study involving evaluation of health, mental health, and human service use among Victorian young people, with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs. \nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort is youth aged 12-25 years during the time period January 2018 to November 2023. Data for individuals aged 5-11 and 26-53 during this period will also be included, to allow for examination of early years factors and an older adult comparison group. The data sources and data linkage methodology are described. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical characteristics of young people, their broader health and human service use behaviour and typical pathways through care, that could not be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

In East Asian cultures death is heavily tied to rigorous cultural practices and rituals, and so are grieving processes. This scoping review is the first to explore the potential impact of grief rituals for bereaved people from East Asia. A systematic review of existing literature was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of A reference was selected if: a) the study was conducted in either an East Asian or Southeast Asian country, b) described post-funeral rituals, and c) addressed grief outcomes. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify common themes when carrying out death rituals. Ten studies were included for review. Quantitative findings revealed correlations between funeral satisfaction and physical health, as well as funeral satisfaction and decreased distress over time. Qualitative studies suggested the following themes: 1) death as taboo, 2) family support, 3) public display of grief, and 4) continuing bonds. Our scope review suggests rituals as a mechanism for recovery from the death of a family member. Mourning rituals do not just provide support at the time of death but also help them adjust over time. Mental health providers can consider addressing identified ritual themes when working with grieving clients of East Asian cultural backgrounds.",

This study will investigate if UAP sighting\ndistributions exhibit fractal scaling spatially and temporally. Using\nNational UFO Reporting Center data, we will calculate fractal\ndimensions and Hurst exponents, comparing these to aircraft flight\npatterns. Significant fractal patterns will support hypotheses of\nscale-invariant UAP behavior, while non-fractal results will suggest\nconventional explanations, advancing empirical UAP analysis.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have gained scientific traction\nthrough declassified footage and civilian reports spanning decades,\nrevealing behaviors like rapid scale shifts and object splitting [1].\nThese patterns, documented in sources like the National UFO Reporting\nCenter (NUFORC), suggest potential fractal properties—self-similar\nstructures observed in systems from galaxy distributions to biological\nnetworks [2]. Fractal analysis offers a rigorous, empirical approach\nto study UAP without assuming their nature, addressing a gap in\nquantitative assessments of such phenomena.\n\nThis research will test whether UAP sightings exhibit fractal scaling,\nmotivated by eyewitness accounts of geometric objects splitting (e.g.,\nfrom 1 to 12 units) and mathematical patterns like iterative scaling\n(0.3333333333, ÷10, ×9), hinting at multi-scale dynamics [3].\nTheoretical constructs, such as string theory’s 11 dimensions or\nspeculative infinite-dimensional frameworks, inspire this inquiry,\nthough they remain untestable here [4]. We will focus on two research\nquestions: do UAP spatial distributions show fractal clustering, and\ndo their temporal patterns display long-range dependence? Hypotheses\nare:\n\nHypothesis 1: UAP sighting locations will yield a fractal dimension D\n&lt; 2, unlike uniform distributions (H0: D = 2).\n\nHypothesis 2: UAP sighting times will show a Hurst exponent H &gt; 0.5,\nindicating persistence (H0: H = 0.5).\n\nThese predictions, detailed in Table 1, will be tested using NUFORC\ndata against aircraft controls. Significant fractal metrics will\nsuggest non-random, scale-invariant patterns; non-significant results\nwill align UAP with conventional phenomena. Bayesian methods will\nensure robust interpretation of all outcomes, avoiding over-reliance\non null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nWe will extract UAP sighting data from NUFORC and aircraft flight\nrecords from the FAA. Spatial analysis will use the box-counting\nmethod, overlaying grids (1 km to 1,000 km) to estimate D via N(δ) ∝\nδ^(-D). Temporal analysis will apply DFA to daily sighting counts,\ncalculating H over scales of 10 to 1,000 days. Positive controls will\ninclude random point distributions (D ≈ 2, H ≈ 0.5). Data collection\nand analysis will not be performed blindly to the conditions of the\nexperiments.\n\n\n\nEthics Information\n\nThis study will use anonymized, publicly available data, requiring no\nethical approvals or participant consent.\n\n\n\nPilot Data\n\nA preliminary analysis of 5,000 NUFORC sightings (2010–2020) will\nyield D ≈ 1.7 and H ≈ 0.65, differing from random baselines (D = 2, H\n= 0.5). Full details will be in Supplementary Information.\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe study will employ comparative observational design, analyzing UAP\nand aircraft data for fractal properties (Table 1).\n\n\n\nSampling Plan\n\nWe will sample ≥1,000 UAP sightings post-2000 with valid coordinates\nand timestamps, excluding duplicates. Aircraft data will match this\nsize. Power analysis, based on pilot r = 0.3, ensures 95% power at α =\n0.05 with N = 1,000.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\n\nSpatial D and temporal H will be computed for UAP and aircraft data.\nDifferences will be tested using Bayesian inference (Bayes Factor &gt; 10\nfor H1 or H0). Preprocessing will normalize spatial data by population\ndensity. Contingencies: if data are non-normal, we will use robust\nBayesian models.\n\n\n\nData Availability\n\nRaw data will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with pilot\ndata available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nCode Availability\n\nPython/R scripts will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with\npilot analysis code available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nCompeting Interests: The author declares no competing interests.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] National UFO Reporting Center.

          "abstract": "The topic of genetic influence is an understudied area in play research. We propose that play research can draw on behavioural genetics methodologies to investigate individual differences in children’s play. Studies applying behavioural genetic methods seek to understand how genes and the environment work together to impact behaviour, and this is an area that remains relatively unexplored in play research. In doing so, we can extend what is known about the forms, functions and origins of play in child development. To invite play researchers to consider behavioural genetics methods, we share an overview of quantitative genetic methods like twin studies, genome-wide association studies, and polygenic studies and present possible applications to play research. We suggest that variables related to children, their parents, and their genetic propensities can be used to explore linkages between play, child development outcomes and the environment.",

          "abstract": "Objective: There remain large variations in cochlear implant outcomes which are poorly explained by patient history factors. This study aims to better understand how different neural limitations along the auditory processing pathway are associated with speech understanding outcomes.\nDesign: 43 cochlear implant recipients (44 ears) were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study to evaluate limitations at various locations along the auditory processing pathway. At the periphery, intra-cochlear neural health was estimated using focused psychophysical thresholds. Higher-order across-electrode intensity discrimination ability was assessed using psychophysical “spectral tilt”. At the cortical level, cross-modal activation of the auditory cortex was assessed using functional near infra-red spectroscopy. Speech understanding outcomes were evaluated in competing multi-talker babble noise at one-year post device switch-on.\nResults: We found that greater abilities to discriminate smaller across-electrode stimulation intensities (R2 = 0.138, p = 0.047) and smaller cross-modal activations of the auditory cortex (R2 = 0.216, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with better speech understanding outcomes in cochlear implant recipients. Furthermore, both measures contributed significantly to better predict speech understanding outcomes in a multiple regression model (Adj R2 = 0.312, p = 0.009).\nConclusion: The results suggest that recipient-specific neural factors contribute significantly towards individual differences in speech understanding outcomes. Different recipients can be affected by different limitations, which can be identified using these tests, and therefore lead to potential patient-specific methods to improve their speech understanding.",

Understanding the predictors of afterlife beliefs is crucial for gaining insight into religious tenets and their broader impacts on individuals and societies. This retrospective longitudinal study used the first wave of nationally representative data from the Global Flourishing Study, covering 22 countries (N = 202,898), to examine 13 potential childhood predictors of afterlife belief in adulthood. We applied modified Poisson regression to analyze how these predictors influenced afterlife belief. Random-effects meta-analyses aggregated results for the 11 common predictors across all countries. Our results indicated that religious service attendance at age 12 was the most consistent predictor of afterlife belief in adulthood. Negative early experiences—such as childhood abuse and feelings of being an outsider—along with a strong maternal relationship, were linked to higher levels of afterlife belief. Additionally, female gender were associated with an increased likelihood of afterlife belief. This study is the first to use multinational data to provide evidence that a combination of childhood factors are related to afterlife beliefs in adulthood.",

While several national surveys highlight differences in afterlife beliefs across countries, none have explored the sociodemographic factors associated with these beliefs. Using data from Wave 1 of the Global Flourishing Study (N=202,898), weighted to be nationally representative, we estimated the proportion of people affirming belief in an afterlife in 22 countries. Primary analyses with demographic variables were conducted separately by country and then pooled using meta-analytic techniques. We examined variations in afterlife belief across nine sociodemographic characteristics: age, gender, marital status, employment status, education level, immigration status, frequency of religious service attendance, religious affiliation, and racial/ethnic identity. The overall proportion of the populations believing in life after death ranged from 95% in Indonesia to 21% in Japan. Meta-analytic results indicated cross-national heterogeneity across all sociodemographic categories, though the degree of variation differed. Random effects meta-analytic results highlighted religious service attendance as a key factor, with the highest belief in the afterlife observed among those attending services at least once per week. These findings provide a foundation for understanding population-level beliefs in the afterlife and continued exploration of their complexity across different contexts.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn as they use the same base-10 place value system of whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, e.g., 0.8 &gt; 0.26.  Accordingly, children and adults perform worse when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs like 0.8 vs. 0.26 than Consistent ones like 0.86 vs. 0.2. This effect is typically attributed to the conflict between the number of digits and the magnitude of the decimal. But it could also result from students activating the whole number referents, i.e., the corresponding whole numbers without the decimals points (e.g., 8 vs. 26). We recently developed a stimulus set that can distinguish between these explanations by leveraging numerical distance effects. As in previous studies, our stimuli vary on the rational distance between pairs of numbers, and in our prior studies (Rosenberg-Lee, et al. 2023), we found that performance is lower for close comparisons (0.3 vs. 0.21, distance = 0.09) than far (0.8 vs. 0.26, distance = 0.54). However, we also varied the whole distance between the pairs, that is, the distance between the whole referents. Holding rational distance constant, participants were worse on problems where the whole distance was larger (0.9 vs. 0.81 =&gt; 9 vs. 81, whole distance 72) than smaller (0.3 vs. 0.21 =&gt; 3 vs 21, whole distance = 18), suggesting they were activating the whole referents. In this study, we use functional MRI during decimal comparison to identify brain systems related to rational distance and whole distance processing in university students (n=21). We anticipated that rational distance would modulate the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which is implicated in numerical magnitude processing for whole and rational numbers, while frontal regions involved in working memory (middle frontal gyrus) and cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex and insula) would process interference from whole distance. Interestingly, we did find rational magnitude sensitivity in the IPS, but only for Consistent comparisons, while the ACC was sensitive for rational distance only for Inconsistent comparisons. We found sensitivity to whole distance in the IPS and insula. These results contribute to growing evidence that whole number referents are automatically activated during decimal processing and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. Further, these results highlight the unique challenges that decimals present for learners and point to the need for educators to emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than current practices which highlight similarities.",

          "abstract": "Background: Food cravings and binge eating behaviors are critical components of eating disorders, contributing to maladaptive eating patterns, weight gain, and psychological distress. Despite the growing recognition of their importance, there is a lack of culturally adapted assessment tools to evaluate these phenomena in Brazil.\nAims: This study aimed to perform the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of two key instruments—the Craving Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) and the Functions of Binge Eating Scale (FBES)—for use in the Brazilian population, ensuring semantic, content, and cultural relevance.\nMethods: The process included translation, synthesis, back-translation, expert committee review, and pre-testing. Content validity was assessed using the Content Validity Index (CVI) and inter-rater agreement via the Finn Coefficient. A panel of six experts in psychology, psychiatry, and nutrition evaluated the semantic equivalence, content alignment, and item relevance.\nResults: The CEQ demonstrated excellent validity in terms of semantics, content, and relevance. There was perfect agreement among raters for content and relevance. The FBES showed strong validity for content and relevance, with slightly lower validity for semantic equivalence. Minor revisions were made to enhance clarity and cultural appropriateness.\nDiscussion: The adaptation process confirmed the instruments' conceptual integrity and cultural fit. The CEQ effectively assesses craving intensity, imagery, and intrusiveness, while the FBES captures eight motives underlying binge eating, such as emotion regulation and self-punishment.\nConclusion: The Brazilian versions are reliable instruments for assessing food cravings and binge eating motives. Their integration into clinical and research settings will enhance specificity within established diagnostic categories, increasing the accuracy of binge eating disorder treatments by considering the integration of various areas of care. In this way, interventions will achieve more specific outcomes beyond the mere remission of binge eating episodes.",

          "abstract": "Background: Empirical research suggests that suffering may degrade health and wellbeing. However, further research is needed to develop an epidemiology of suffering that can contribute to identifying potential targets for addressing population-level suffering.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study used the first wave of nationally representative data from 22 countries included in the Global Flourishing Study (N = 202,898) to explore associations of 13 individual characteristics and retrospectively recalled childhood factors with suffering in adulthood. We conducted a modified Poisson regression by country in which suffering was regressed on all candidate predictors. Random effects meta-analyses were used to aggregate results for the 11 predictors that were common across all countries.\nResults: Meta-analytic results suggested a combination of risk and protective factors during childhood may be associated with suffering in adulthood. Individuals whose parents were married (versus divorced) at age 12, had a very good/somewhat good paternal relationship (versus very bad/somewhat bad) when growing up, had excellent health (versus good) when growing up, and who reported their family lived comfortably (versus got by) financially when growing up were less likely to experience suffering in adulthood, whereas those who were abused during childhood (versus not), felt like an outsider in their family when growing up (versus not), attended religious services 1-3 times a month (versus never) around age 12, and were female (versus male) had a higher likelihood of suffering in adulthood. Associations were somewhat heterogenous across the countries.\nConclusions: Childhood experiences, influences, and conditions may impact experiences of suffering in adulthood. Targeted early-life interventions could mitigate the burden of suffering later in life.",

          "abstract": "Research has documented changes in autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, cognitive decline occurs gradually and recent findings suggest that subtle alterations in autobiographical cognition may be evident earlier in the trajectory towards dementia, before AD-related symptoms emerge or a clinical diagnosis has been given. The current study used the Autobiographical Interview to examine the episodic and semantic content of autobiographical past and future events generated by older adults (N=38) of varying cognitive functioning who were grouped into High (N=20) and Low Cognition (N=18) groups based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Participants described 12 past and 12 future autobiographical events, and transcripts were scored to quantify the numbers of internal (episodic) or external (non-episodic, including semantic) details. Although the Low Cognition group exhibited a differential reduction for internal details comprising both past and future events, they did not show the expected overproduction of external details relative to the High Cognition group. Multilevel modelling demonstrated that on trials lower in episodic content, semantic content was significantly increased in both groups. Although suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, the magnitude of this inverse relationship did not differ across groups or interact with MoCA scores. This finding indicates that external detail production may be underpinned by mechanisms not affected by cognitive decline, such as narrative style and the ability to contextualize one’s past and future events in relation to broader autobiographical knowledge.",

Meta-analytic results provided evidence of subgroup differences in forgivingness for religious service attendance and (to a lesser extent) age, with the highest forgivingness observed among people who attended religious services more than once a week and those 80 years or older.

In this study, we aim to determine whether the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is linked to symptoms trajectories in a longitudinal sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed into adulthood. Specifically, we will test whether differences in SC-FC coupling within a network of neural regions centered on two specific white matter tracts (the cingulum angular bundle and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), previously found to be altered in adults with ADHD histories, are associated with the persistence or remission of ADHD symptoms. We will also examine how to SC-FC coupling in these neural pathways relate to developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms from childhood. By focusing on the interplay between SC and FC, we aim to uncover neural signatures that differentiate adults with persistent ADHD symptoms from those whose symptoms have remitted. Findings could provide new insights into the neurodevelopmental processes underlying ADHD and may help identify neural markers predictive of symptom persistence as well as inform targeted interventions contributing to more personalized treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.",

Although previous studies identified experimental conditions under which humans and non-human animals show increased variable decision-making, we have only a limited understanding of its underlying cognitive mechanisms. Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate the use of three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. Model simulations with a policy-gradient meta-learning algorithm show that agents could respond more optimally in such environments by (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate to allow for faster interactions between reinforcement learning and extinction, or (3) strategically upvalue unchosen actions using a frequency-based memory. After demonstrating the theoretical benefit of each of these strategies, we fitted our model on existing datasets of human-, pigeons- and rat behavior in adversarial environments. We show that, while all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, only humans strategically upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

However, there is surprising little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This can be overcome by future parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types will allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Identical paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will indicate homologous pathways in the human brain with access to perceptual reports. In NHP and human, long-distance priors and expectations suggest that the claustrum might be involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical-claustral-cortical loops will enable a similar approach to explore these pathways participation in the integration of TD and BU signals as used in the cortico-cortical pathways.",

          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus-response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in human populations have yielded mixed results.  Only two laboratory paradigms have successfully demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training conditions: the forced-response task and the ‘aliens’ outcome-devaluation task. Notably, these paradigms measure behavior habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal-directed responses that conflict with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with those expected from learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed four days of training in each paradigm. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable across measures.  However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This finding suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal-directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures used to investigate habit control in humans.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the neurocognitive basis of cognitive control and its relationship with general cognitive ability is a key challenge in individual differences research. This study investigates midfrontal theta connectivity as a neurocognitive marker for individual differences in cognitive control. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined midfrontal global theta connectivity across three distinct cognitive control tasks in 148 participants. Our findings reveal that midfrontal theta connectivity can be modeled as a trait-like latent variable, indicating its consistency across tasks and stability over time. However, the reliability of the observed measures was found to be low to moderate, suggesting substantial measurement error. We also replicated previous results, finding a strong correlation (r = 0.64) between midfrontal theta connectivity and cognitive abilities, especially during higher-order stages of information processing. We disentangled the specific cognitive processes contributing to this relationship by employing a task-cueing paradigm with distinct cue and target intervals. The results indicated that only theta connectivity during response-related processes, not during cue-evoked task-set reconfiguration, correlated with cognitive abilities. These insights significantly advance theoretical models of intelligence, highlighting the critical role of specific aspects of cognitive control in cognitive abilities.",

This paper employs a correlation-based network construction method to investigate the colexification networks of the two concepts in 58 + 68 Tibeto-Burman languages. A total of 104 concepts colexified with ‘fruit’ and 99 concepts colexified with ‘stone’ are organized into macro semantic classes. Semantic networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of concepts, as well as languages networks on the basis of the similarities in colexification patterns of languages, are constructed for ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’, respectively. The results indicate that classifiers for small round objects evolved from either ‘fruit’ or ‘stone’ are directly colexified with class terms in compound nouns denoting varieties of fruits/stones and the shape class of small round objects, indicating that they are diachronically related. However, ‘fruit’ and ‘stone’ differ significantly in their modes of deriving a classifier. Moreover, languages that have developed classifiers from ‘fruit’ are mostly from the Ngwi subgroup, whereas languages whose classifiers are colexified with ‘stone’ evolved independently.",

However, the emergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms has opened new opportunities for exploring variable relationships beyond linear constraints. To interpret the outcomes of these \"black-box\" algorithms, various tools for assessing feature importance have been developed. However, most of these tools are descriptive and do not facilitate statistical inference. To address this gap, our study introduces two versions of residual permutation tests (RPTs), designed to assess the significance of a target feature in predicting the label. The first variant, RPT on Y (RPT-Y ), permutes\nthe residuals of the label conditioned on features other than the target. The second variant, RPT on X (RPT-X), permutes the residuals of the target feature conditioned on the other features. Our simulation study demonstrates that RPT-X eﬀectively maintains empirical Type I error rates within acceptable bounds and exhibits appreciable power in both regression and classification tasks. These findings suggest the utility of RPT-X for hypothesis testing in ML applications.",

          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of eight executive function (EF) tasks designed for use in infancy and early childhood. Modern measurement theory and item response theory (IRT) frameworks were applied to examine the underlying latent ability influencing children’s performance on EF tasks. Longitudinal assessments at 8 months, 2.5 years, and 5 years were conducted as part of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, and 830 participants from the larger cohort were included in the present study. The results indicated that the tasks included in the study were effective in measuring children’s EF abilities with a certain level of discrimination power. The difficulty level of each task varied across time points. In 8-month-old children, the A-not-B task scores were the most informative for assessing above-average levels of EF ability. At 2.5 years of age, the two EF tasks (Spin the Pots and Snack Delay) provided the most informative assessments for children with low to moderate levels of EF ability. Among 5-year-old children, three EF tasks measured ability levels only below the sample mean, whereas two additional tasks captured a broader range of EF abilities. The discussion highlights the benefits of applying IRT analysis to EF measurements and emphasises the need for reliable and scalable tools to assess how executive function changes among individuals during early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Empathy allows us to infer the affective state of another individual and resonate with it. Accumulating evidence suggests that on a neural level, empathizing relies on ‘shared neural representations’, i.e., patterns of neural activation recruited both during the first-hand and the empathic experience of a specific affective state. Studies employing placebo analgesia have shown consistent reductions in behavioral ratings and neural activity for both first-hand and empathic pain. The mechanistic interpretation of such effects, however, remains elusive, as placebo analgesia could exert its effects on empathy either via pharmacological actions or via top-down cognitive processes on pain and empathy beliefs. To address this limitation, we conducted a double-blind, within-subjects study administering either an opioid antagonist (naltrexone) or an inactive placebo in two separate testing sessions (N=35 healthy, neurotypical individuals, 21 female), and participants experienced both pain first-hand and pain empathy. We predicted that naltrexone would similarly increase first-hand pain and empathy for pain. The results, however, show reduced ratings of first-hand pain and empathy for pain, and thus, unexpectedly, hypo- rather than hyperalgesic effects. However, the coherence in their directionality confirms the hypothesis of shared opioidergic mechanisms being involved in the first-hand experience of pain and empathy for pain.",

          "authors": "Pablo Martínez-López; Antonio Vázquez-Millán; Francisco Garre-Frutos; David Luque",
          "abstract": "Animal research has shown that repeatedly performing a rewarded action leads to its transition into a habit—an inflexible response controlled by stimulus-response associations. Efforts to reproduce this principle in human populations have yielded mixed results.  Only two laboratory paradigms have successfully demonstrated behavior habitualization following extensive instrumental training compared to minimal training conditions: the forced-response task and the ‘aliens’ outcome-devaluation task. Notably, these paradigms measure behavior habitualization through distinct measures. The forced-response task focuses on the persistence of a trained response when a reversal is required, whereas the outcome-devaluation task measures reaction time switch costs—slowdowns in goal-directed responses that conflict with the trained habit. Although both measures have produced results consistent with those expected from learning theory—showing stronger evidence of habits in overtrained conditions—their construct validity remains insufficiently established. In this study, participants completed four days of training in each paradigm. We then examined the reliability of each measure and evaluated their convergent validity. Habitual responses in the forced-response task and reaction time switch costs in the outcome-devaluation task demonstrated good reliability, allowing us to assess whether individual differences remained stable across measures.  However, the two measures were not associated, providing no evidence of convergent validity. This finding suggests that these measures capture distinct aspects of the balance between habitual and goal-directed control. Our results highlight the need for further evaluation of the validity and reliability of current measures used to investigate habit control in humans.",

          "abstract": "Habitual behaviour is commonly assumed to operate outside of conscious awareness, driven by stimulus-response (S-R) associations rather than goal-directed evaluation. However, whether habitual instrumental behaviours can be triggered by stimuli that are not consciously perceived remains an understudied question. In a preregistered within-subjects study (N after exclusions = 75), we examined this question by employing a symmetrical outcome revaluation task. Participants underwent extensive instrumental training, forming strong S-R associations, before completing two testing stages: a conscious stage with fully visible stimuli and an unconscious stage where stimuli were rendered subliminal via visual masking. In the conscious condition, participants exhibited habitual control, responding more accurately to habit-congruent (still-valuable, still-non-valuable) stimuli than to habit-incongruent (upvalued, devalued) stimuli, replicating prior findings. However, in the unconscious condition participants did not exhibit above-chance accuracy, and responses were not biased toward habitual actions, suggesting that subliminal stimuli were unable to elicit either habitual or goal-directed responses. These findings challenge the notion that habitual control of instrumental behaviour can function independently of stimulus awareness and suggest that conscious access to action-relevant cues may be necessary even for well-established S-R associations to guide behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition involving widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Evidence-based interventions for fibromyalgia, such as education and exercise, often require prolonged, cognitive and/or physical effort, involving immediate costs (effort) for delayed benefits (improved pain/function). Initiation of, and adherence to, these interventions is often difficult. While assumed to reflect low motivation, these difficulties may reflect pain-related alterations in an individual’s attitudes towards effortful and delayed rewards. Here we explored whether individuals with fibromyalgia differed from age- and sex-matched pain-free controls in such attitudes. In Study 1, individuals with fibromyalgia (N=19) and controls (N=19) completed tasks offering real rewards (raffle tickets) for performing actual physical or cognitive effort or enduring real delays. Despite individualising task difficulty to each participant’s unique capacity, those with fibromyalgia required higher incentives to engage in the physical effort task (treadmill walking), especially at higher effort intensities, but showed no differences in the cognitive effort task, indicating no general motivation deficit but rather a shift in attitudes toward physical exertion. Additionally, participants with fibromyalgia showed a greater willingness to wait for rewards, particularly at lower reward levels, suggesting an increased motivation driven by rewards. Study 2, conducted online (N=43 fibromyalgia, N=139 controls), replicated these findings, reinforcing that fibromyalgia does not involve a broad motivational deficit based on reward magnitude. Instead, we found specific changes in physical effort discounting and indications of heightened sensitivity to rewards in delay discounting. These insights may help inform tailored intervention strategies for individuals with fibromyalgia.",

RoBMA-regression allows for moderator analyses while simultaneously taking into account the uncertainty about the presence and impact of other factors (i.e., the main effect, heterogeneity, publication bias, and other potential moderators). The methodology presents a coherent way of assessing the evidence for and against the presence of both continuous and categorical moderators. We further employ a Savage-Dickey density ratio test to quantify the evidence for and against the presence of the effect at different levels of categorical moderators. We illustrate RoBMA-regression in an empirical example and demonstrate its performance in a simulation study. We implemented the methodology in the RoBMA R package. Overall, RoBMA-regression presents researchers with a powerful and flexible tool for conducting robust and informative meta-regression analyses.",

          "abstract": "Background. Enduring mental health conditions typically begin in adolescence. Social adversity (e.g., discrimination, bullying, trauma) may disrupt the development of healthy social learning processes and self and other beliefs. We tested the impact of prior social adversity and current social exclusion on paranoia, self and other beliefs and latent social learning processes in UK adolescents (15-17 years, n=502), using pre-registered hypotheses (AsPredicted #154322), causal Bayesian models, and exploratory analyses. Study Design. An experimental design tested (a) whether social exclusion interacted with prior social adversity to increase paranoia, (b) whether this occurred due to activating negative self and other beliefs, and (c) whether this was moderated by cognitive flexibility (i.e., moderated-mediation). Cognitive flexibility, alongside computational processes of social information generalisation, were assessed using The Intentions Game (Barnby et al., 2024). Study Results. Social exclusion triggered paranoia, which was intensified by prior social adversity, and substantially reduced latent belief flexibility about the self and others, inhibiting learning and subduing other-to-self generalisation (social contagion). Negative self and other beliefs were a mechanism through which social adversities lead to paranoia in the context of exclusion. Prior exposure to discrimination amplified state paranoia irrespective of inclusion/exclusion. Conclusion. Social adversity enhances susceptibility to paranoia following a social exclusion manipulation, in part due to activating negative self and other beliefs. Failure to detect pro-sociality in others, impacted by the rigidly with which negative self and other beliefs are held, as well as by discrimination in particular, likely exacerbates and maintains paranoia. Findings directly inform likely profitable intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Background. The experience sampling method (ESM), also known as ecological momentary assessment, is gaining popularity in physical activity research. This method involves assessing participants’ behaviors and experiences repeatedly over time. One key advantage of ESM is its ability to temporally separate the dependent and independent variable of interest, reducing the risk of reverse causality. However, temporal separation alone is insufficient for establishing causality. This methodology paper illustrates the importance of the identification phase in drawing causal conclusions from ESM data. In the identification phase the causal effect of interest (or estimand) is specified and the assumptions under which a statistical association can be considered as causal are visualized using causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Methods. We demonstrate how to define a causal estimand and construct a DAG for a specific ESM research question. The example focuses on the causal effect of physical activity performed in real-life on subsequent executive functioning among older adults. The DAG development process combines literature review and expert consultations to identify time-varying and time-invariant confounders. Results. The developed DAG shows multiple backdoor paths creating confounding bias, even with temporal separation of the exposure (physical activity) and outcome (executive functioning). Two approaches to address this confounding bias are illustrated: (1) physical control using the within-person encouragement design, where participants receive randomized prompts to perform physical activity in their natural environment, and (2) analytic control, involving assessing all confounding variables and adjusting for these variables in the analysis phase. Conclusions. Implementing the identification phase enables ESM researchers to make more informed decisions, thereby enhancing the validity of causal inferences in studies aimed at answering causal questions.",

          "abstract": "In experimental psychology and behavioral neuroscience, habits are considered stimulus-response (S-R) associations formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, habits are assessed using one of two tests: 1) Outcome devaluation, in which the value of the outcome (reward) is reduced, making it less desirable, and 2) Contingency degradation, in which the response-outcome association is reversed so that responding prevents the delivery of a reward. If a behavior is controlled by S-R links, then it should remain unaffected by these two manipulations. Animal research using the outcome devaluation test has shown that initially goal-directed actions can become habitual after extended operant training. However, replicating this transition in human research has proven challenging, representing a significant problem for translational research. Notably, the contingency degradation test has rarely been used in human research. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate a shift from goal-directed to habitual control through three pre-registered experiments. Participants were trained in two S-R-O (stimulus-response-outcome) mappings for three days, with one condition (the ‘overtrained’) occurring four times more frequently than the other ('standard’). Importantly, we assessed the habitualization of both responses by using a degraded contingency test. Overall, we found no evidence of an overtraining effect — that is, the ‘overtrained’ condition did not lead to increased habitual responding. We discuss the theoretical and applied implications of these findings and explore further directions for studying habitual behavior.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway and perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories.

          "abstract": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning new tasks, in large part by relying on the integration of previously learned knowledge. However, research on task learning typically focuses on the learning of abstract task rules on minimalist stimuli, to study behavior independent of the learning history that humans come equipped with (i.e., semantic knowledge). In contrast, several theories suggest that the use of semantic knowledge and labels may help the learning of new task information. Here, we tested whether providing existing, semantically rich task rules and response labels allowed for more robust task encoding and less (catastrophic) forgetting and interference. Our results show that providing semantically rich task rules and response labels resulted in less task forgetting (Experiment 1), both when using pictorial symbols or words as labels (Experiment 2). Using artificial recurrent neural networks fitted to task behavior, we show that the semantically rich learning conditions resulted in more separated task representations during learning. Finally, using a subsequent value-based decision-making task and reinforcement learning modeling (Experiment 3), we demonstrate how the learned embedding of novel stimuli in semantically rich, representations, further allowed for a more efficient, feature-specific processing when learning new task information.

          "abstract": "Humans are remarkably efficient at learning new tasks, in large part by relying on the integration of previously learned knowledge. However, research on task learning typically focuses on the learning of abstract task rules on minimalist stimuli, to study behavior independent of the learning history that humans come equipped with (i.e., semantic knowledge). In contrast, several theories suggest that the use of semantic knowledge and labels may help the learning of new task information. Here, we tested whether providing existing, semantically rich task rules and response labels allowed for more robust task encoding and less (catastrophic) forgetting and interference. Our results show that providing semantically rich task rules and response labels resulted in less task forgetting (Experiment 1), both when using pictorial symbols or words as labels (Experiment 2). Using artificial recurrent neural networks fitted to task behavior, we show that the semantically rich learning conditions resulted in more separated task representations during learning. Finally, using a subsequent value-based decision-making task and reinforcement learning modeling (Experiment 3), we demonstrate how the learned embedding of novel stimuli in semantically rich, representations, further allowed for a more efficient, feature-specific processing when learning new task information.

In support of our first hypothesis, we found an overall negative relationship between reflective thinking and BiG; and in support of our second hypothesis, we found an overall positive relationship between intuitive thinking and BiG. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we found no evidence that completing the CRT before eliciting BiG influenced BiG scores by priming reflective thinking. Given that this is the first large cross-cultural test of these hypotheses to have a preregistered analysis plan, to hold education constant across countries, and to use both Bayesian and frequentist methods, these results considerably bolster the evidence in support of the first two hypotheses and against the third hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Philip Gerrans; Hugh MGovern; Jakob Hohwy; Lena K L Oestreich",
          "abstract": "Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a newly recognized diagnosis that is distinguished from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through additional symptom clusters beyond re-experiencing, avoidance, and a persistent sense of threat. In addition to these core PTSD symptoms, C-PTSD is characterized by disturbances in self-organization, including affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal difficulties. These disruptions often result in persistent emotional instability, deep-seated feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and challenges in forming and maintaining relationships. While PTSD often arises from discrete traumatic events, C-PTSD is more commonly associated with prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma, such as childhood maltreatment, domestic violence, or prolonged captivity. Here, we propose a novel model that explains these differences, identifies their neural substrates, and outlines the potential role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in C-PTSD treatment. Drawing on active inference theories of cognition, we apply the concept of self-modelling to elucidate the insula’s role in affective regulation and adaptation to adversity. This framework clarifies the insula’s involvement not only in C-PTSD but also in other conditions affecting self-awareness and emotional processing. By integrating insights from neuroscience and psychopharmacology, we discuss how MDMA-assisted therapy may recalibrate affective regulation and reinforce a more stable self-model, offering a promising avenue for treatment. Theoretical and clinical implications are explored, emphasizing the need for further empirical research into MDMA’s therapeutic potential for C-PTSD.",

Such scaling models search the linguistic space for differentiating features, often conflating rhetorical styles with political sentiments when the subjects are not inherently opposed. This article introduces ContextScale, a sentiment-based position scaling framework leveraging pre-trained Transformer models to measure multidimensional position scores at the sequence level, as well as predicting policy topics and political sentiments. Unlike conflict-driven models, ContextScale effectively distinguishes rhetorical styles from actual political sentiments. Further validity tests demonstrate its ability to capture nuances in party positioning, as well as its adaptability across languages, text domains, and theoretical models.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of significant increases in lesbian and gay (LG) immigration, do Americans view LG migrants as more deserving of entry to the U.S. than their straight counterparts? Using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,650 respondents, we investigate how potential immigrants' sexual-minority status affects Americans' perceptions of their deservingness for admission and their cultural similarity to the U.S. Results show that, overall, Americans do not perceive LG immigrants as more deserving than straight ones, and LG immigrants are perceived as less culturally similar. But results also reveal heterogeneity: LG immigrants fleeing persecution are seen as more deserving of admission, and Democrats, atheists, and LG respondents consider LG migrants more deserving than straight ones. This paper helps disentangle Americans' preferences for migrants' presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit as well as shed light on public opinion of an under-studied but politically salient group.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this research synthesis is to collect and summarize the research literature on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland. This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Ilari Ilmakunnas; Susanna Sten-Gahmberg",
          "abstract": "Flexible partial retirement schemes are intended to give individuals the opportunity to reduce working hours before moving into full retirement, the expectation being that the reduced workload will contribute to postponed retirement. Yet, there is limited research about whether and how flexible partial pensions are used as a way of exiting the labor force, as an income supplement, or as a way of bridging the transition into retirement through part-time employment. In Finland, individuals can take up part of their accrued old-age pension after reaching age 61 regardless of their employment status. Using high-quality register data with monthly information on retirement and wage income, we use sequence analysis analyze previously employed persons’ wage income trajectories around the take-up of partial old-age pension. We find that only around one in five continue to work at a reduced wage income level, indicating a reduction in working hours. Around one in six left paid employment just before or after pension take-up. Most individuals do not reduce their working hours when taking up a partial pension. Our findings suggest that the Finnish partial old-age pension scheme is currently not likely to extend working lives, raising concerns about its effectiveness in meeting its policy goal.",

This paper examines whether a library book giveaway program was effective in increasing parents reading investments in the form of loan of children’s books. The intervention involved “nudging” families sending out invitations to visit their local library, where their child would receive a free book and families would get introduced to library services. Using Danish individual level registry data on loan of books from public libraries, I assess the program’s impact through a difference-in-differences approach based on staggered rollout across three municipalities. Results show no increase in loan of children’s books – neither in advantaged nor disadvantaged families. Given that more intensive book giveaway programs have been successful, these results might reflect that the intervention was too mild or failed to address key barriers to participation.",

In an original survey of participants recruited from a popular online platform for sourcing social science research subjects, 34% reported using LLMs to help them answer open-ended survey questions. Simulations comparing human-written responses from three pre-ChatGPT studies with LLM-generated text reveal that LLM responses are more homogeneous and positive, particularly when they describe social groups in sensitive questions. These homogenization patterns may mask important underlying social variation in attitudes and beliefs among human subjects, raising concerns about data validity.

It was determined that in August 2024, there are 2,931 active support staff working in 348 Institutes, and the amount of RSS assigned to each institution varies between 1 and 47. The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).\tRegarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",

Ten graduate students with prior NVivo qualitative research training were randomly assigned to analyze interview transcripts about childhood flu vaccination using either AILYZE (n=5) or NVivo (n=5). Participants were blind to the study's comparative nature and were tasked with identifying themes and writing a report. Participants submitted time logs detailing how long they took to conduct the analysis. A structured blind pairwise comparison process was conducted where five independent expert qualitative researchers each conducted five evaluations (25 total comparisons), in order to assess the quality of the reports written. Results demonstrate that AILYZE-generated analyses were 73% faster (mean 7.38 vs. 27.71 hours, t=-11.45, p&lt;0.0001) and received higher quality rankings in 76% of pairwise comparisons (19 out of 25, p=0.0073).

          "abstract": "AI agents are the newest addition to our repertoire of intelligent machines. Powered by large language models and connected to other tools and robots, AI agents not only perform tasks, but they can design a workflow and employ other available tools and digital resources like datasets to carry out a compound task. AI agents are also being employed by researchers to conduct multi-step experiments or stimulate human behavior to perform social science studies. AI agents can transform various research endeavors through efficiency gains, increased productivity and reducing human errors in research and education. However, given their limitations like errors and biases, they also introduce specific risks. In this paper we highlight six specific risks such as errors and biases, loss of research jobs, loss of critical thinking and deskilling scientists, increased possibility of machine-driven misconduct and the increased rate of unverified research results. We conclude that researchers need training in areas such as algorithmic and AI literacy, to be able to identify biases, errors, and other problems in tasks conducted by AI agents. Institutions need to pay more attention to the development of these technologies and provide guidance about their use.",

          "abstract": "The study of radicalization encompasses a broad spectrum of perspectives, with scholars and experts from diverse disciplines – ranging from psychology, sociology, political science, criminology, to economics – contributing to its multifaceted comprehension. Despite this substantial body of empirical research, the knowledge is fragmented across disciplines, emphasizing the need for integration to establish a cohesive framework. As laying the groundwork for a unified framework begins with identifying relevant phenomena, this systematic review analyzed 4019 research articles using text mining to detect phenomena associated with radicalization. Author keywords and abstracts were analyzed by examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflect themes commonly featured in theory, such as ideology, identity, and social networks, but also identified themes not well-developed in theory. Macro-level phenomena, including the role of the state, economy, elections, policy, and regional factors, as well as micro- and meso-level phenomena like the internet, social media, adolescence, personality, language, education, and mental health, are not sufficiently embedded in theory. The findings further provide the first empirical evidence confirming the fragmentation of research on radicalization.

While cross-sectional studies primarily focus on tobacco use's impact on FI, they typically rely on self-reported measures of tobacco use. This study aimed to investigate the effects of food insecurity on cotinine concentrations, a biomarker of nicotine exposure, and evaluate mediating and moderating factors. \nMethods: Data from the 2015–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed for 2,843 adult smokers. Cotinine was log-transformed and modeled using generalized linear models, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, body mass index (BMI), and depression score. Casual mediation analysis and structural equation modeling assessed mediation and moderation effects, with interaction terms between FI and covariates to test for moderation. \nResults: Each unit increase in FI severity was linked to a 33.6% rise in cotinine concentrations, controlling for covariates. Depression partially mediated this relationship, while college graduation moderated it. Among females, but not males, BMI mediated and depression moderated the association. In a subset of participants, smoking frequency also moderated the link, with FI weakening the relationship between smoking frequency and cotinine levels. \nConclusions: FI may be an independent risk factor for higher cotinine concentrations, separate from smoking behavior and depression. These findings suggest that addressing FI could enhance tobacco cessation efforts. Future research should explore how FI influences nicotine metabolism and smoking patterns.",

In our year-long engagement, multiple instances of play formed a series of intertextual interventions that allowed us to co-encounter and co-experience each other’s sites. In this process, emergent attunements at one site were passed on as further and transposable provocations to the next player, allowing each of us to re-engage with our individual site in different registers while recomposing subsequent offerings for the next player. Our experience taught us the value of collaborative play and the spirit of experimentation in exploring alternative modes of conducting fieldwork. Our research further addresses the moments of vulnerability and loneliness behind ethnographic fieldwork by emphasizing how common associations can be created and drawn upon to design a more collective field experience.",

          "abstract": "Since claims about a ‘replication crisis’ started to circulate, the concept and practice of replication have gained new momentum. Some communities have started to promote replication indiscriminately as a practice and criterion for research quality irrespective of the diverse research communities’ various conditions and ways of knowledge production. Others have identified a replication drive, which involves moving replication into various research communities. This drive is enacted by incentivizing or demanding replication and related Open Science practices, and forms part of a culture change strategy towards increased replicability. Here, we propose the two-dimensional social replication of replication framework. It describes the process of moving replication across epistemic communities and enables us to understand first how the diverse epistemic communities across the research landscape relate to replication as a concept, practice and evaluative criterion and, second, which changes it undergoes along the way. The framework’s two dimensions are adaptation and adoption. Moving replication into different research communities without sufficient adaptation may lead to a potentially problematic and inappropriate social replication of replication. We thus argue that sustainable and appropriate social replication of replication requires adaptation, or more precisely a process of co-adaptation between replication and a community’s already established technologies of accountability.",

          "abstract": "The way we perceive the movement of two intersecting discs can be influenced by auditory information. When a brief tone is played while these discs overlap, people tend to report that the discs bounce off each other instead of streaming past each other. This is known as the auditory-induced bouncing/streaming illusion. Both perceptual/attentional as well as decisional processes have been discussed as explanations for the bouncing/streaming illusion. In four experiments, we study how the abruptness of tone onsets and offsets affects the bouncing/streaming illusion. We found that tones with more abrupt onsets and offsets resulted in a higher proportion of bouncing impressions than those with smoother ones (Experiment 1). This effect was not due to differences in loudness between the tones (Experiment 2). Additionally, we found that the abruptness of the tone onset, rather than the offset, caused the increase in bouncing impressions (Experiment 3). This effect was observed regardless of the temporal alignment of the tones with the moment of visual overlap (onset-aligned vs. centered vs. offset-aligned; Experiment 4). In sum, our results revealed evidence in favor of a chain of perceptual as well as decisional processes contributing to the reported bouncing/streaming impressions, and we discuss how both might interact during the resolution of the ambiguous bouncing/streaming display.",

          "abstract": "Background: Perinatal mental health conditions are the leading underlying cause of maternal mortality, with 80% of deaths considered preventable. However, factors contributing to or protecting against the development of perinatal mental health conditions remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of pregnant and postpartum individuals to understand how they experience pregnancy and postpartum, and how such experiences influence their mental health during both perinatal periods (i.e., pregnancy, postpartum). \n\nMethods: Data were obtained from a subset of participants (n = 17) enrolled in a larger prospective cohort study. Semi-structured interviews during pregnancy (n = 10) and postpartum (n = 15) were conducted remotely (i.e., Zoom, phone). Interviews were independently analyzed using inductive thematic analysis, respective to each perinatal period. \n\nResults: Resource accessibility emerged as an overarching theme, with five resources (themes) acting as barriers or facilitators to mental well-being depending on their accessibility. Three resourcessocial support, logistics, and physical healthwere considered influential across both perinatal periods, to varying degrees. When resources were inaccessible during pregnancy, they became barriers to mental well-being, contributing to experiences of loneliness, frustration, worry, an increased mental load, and ultimately, increased stress. These experiences were often intensified postpartum due to unmet expectations of having increased support to manage increases in logistical demands (e.g., domestic labor, caregiving) amid postpartum recovery and workforce participation. Conversely, when resources were accessible, this facilitated mother’s perceived ability to cope with the stress induced by the demands of this life-stage, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other logistical responsibilities.\n\nConclusions: Findings indicate perinatal individuals view their mental health as being shaped by interactions within their socioenvironmental contexts, highlighting societal norms and institutional practices that are perceived to impose unrealistic expectations on perinatal individuals to independently manage caregiving, domestic labor, and workforce participation amid resource inequities. Further research is needed, particularly among groups disproportionately impacted by maternal mortality and social determinants of health (SDoH), to guide policy reforms and public health interventions that create more inclusive, supportive environments to promote perinatal mental health and, in turn, the health of children, families, and the broader population.",

          "abstract": "We review 50 studies on the impacts of climate activism. We present the existing\nevidence in a map of what we know about climate activism and its impacts. There is\nstrong evidence that climate activism shifts public opinion and media coverage in a pro-climate direction, but this varies by context and the tactics employed. There is more\nmoderate evidence that activism can pressure policymakers to communicate more about\nclimate change, encourage voters to vote in a more pro-climate direction, and financially\npressure carbon intensive companies. We review suggestive evidence that protest can\ninfluence emissions and environmental policy. Although these studies cover a wide swath\nof outcome variables, a majority examine intermediate variables, rather than long term\nimpacts.

          "authors": "Katrin Firl; Nora Müller; Theresa Nutz",
          "abstract": "Preventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships requires ongoing actions and decisions from both partners. However, the burden of contraception is not equally shared. Most modern contraceptive methods are designed for female bodies, and women are typically responsible for managing contraception, from obtaining prescriptions to dealing with side effects. This contraceptive labor encompasses financial, time, physical and emotional costs – forming an often-overlooked aspect of unpaid labor that parallels housework and childcare in its gendered distribution.\nUsing 2021 data from the German Family Demography Panel (FReDA), we build on the “ContraIndex” to quantify the costs and risks of different contraceptive methods. Situating contraception within the framework of the gendered division of labor, we examine how women’s relative resources and gender ideology shape their contraceptive labor using OLS-regression techniques. \nOur findings suggest that higher-educated women use contraception requiring more contraceptive labor, while those working equal or greater hours than their male partners perform less contraceptive labor. Traditional gender ideology is linked to higher contraceptive labor, also for women who inherit higher relative resources than their male partners. Our results highlight a complex interplay between within-couple predictors and contraceptive behavior, underscoring the need for further research on contraceptive labor as an overlooked dimension of gender inequality.",

Nevertheless, these platforms depend on intricate algorithmic systems to execute various analytical processes and functions, which are fundamental to algorithmic operations. Algorithms go through large chunks of user data and how users behave in order to maximize user engagement. On the other hand, this infrastructure is developed with the intention of keeping the users on the platform for prolonged periods by serving content, ads and videos that are in sync with a user’s interests or likely to get a response. The research looks into the algorithmic work of social media — specifically, how algorithms of social media curate, filter and prioritize a content based upon user data. This study builds on work that has begun to explore algorithmic processes on social media platforms, focusing on how algorithms combine user data to curate, filter, and frontage content.

          "authors": "Sven Ulpts; Sheena F. Bartscherer; Sarahanne Miranda Field; Bart Penders",
          "abstract": "Since claims about a ‘replication crisis’ started to circulate, the concept and practice of replication have gained new momentum. Some communities have started to promote replication indiscriminately as a practice and criterion for research quality irrespective of the diverse research communities’ various conditions and ways of knowledge production. Others have identified a replication drive, which involves moving replication into various research communities. This drive is enacted by incentivizing or demanding replication and related Open Science practices, and forms part of a culture change strategy towards increased replicability. Here, we propose the two-dimensional social replication of replication framework. It describes the process of moving replication across epistemic communities and enables us to understand first how the diverse epistemic communities across the research landscape relate to replication as a concept, practice and evaluative criterion and, second, which changes it undergoes along the way. The framework’s two dimensions are adaptation and adoption. Moving replication into different research communities without sufficient adaptation may lead to a potentially problematic and inappropriate social replication of replication. We thus argue that sustainable and appropriate social replication of replication requires adaptation, or more precisely a process of co-adaptation between replication and a community’s already established technologies of accountability.",

          "authors": "Rochelle E. Tractenberg",
          "abstract": "Statistical literacy is critically underappreciated across scientific disciplines, and is not part of the training in graduate programs even when “statistics” or “statistical methods” are. It is common to teach “introductory statistics” courses to promote engagement with key concepts and methods in the domain, but statistical literacy involves the selection of appropriate methods from among competing plausible alternatives, as well as the correct application of the methods, and then reasoning with those methods and their results. A new, developmental, model of statistical literacy that is specific for the scientific practitioner was outlined by Tractenberg (2017-a), based on prior models of statistical and scientific thinking. In this model, there are nine elements to statistical literacy: 1) Define a problem based on critical literature review; 2) Identify or choose – and justify - the measurement system; 3) Design the collection of data; 4) Pilot, analysis and interpretation; 5) Discern “exploratory”, “planned”, and “unplanned” data analysis; 6) Hypothesis generation based on planned &amp; unplanned analyses; 7) Interpretation of results; 8) Drawing and contextualize conclusions; and 9) Communication. These knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) are important for an individual to execute when they are doing scientific work, but these KSAs must also be developed to a sufficient level to permit an individual to assess and consume research articles and arguments that use data and inferences.\n\nThe nine KSAs that comprise statistical literacy for the practicing scientist each require considerably more cognitive capacity than “engagement with key concepts and methods”. The aim of this paper is to discuss the relationship between purposeful development of these KSAs and Bloom’s taxonomy of educational outcomes (cognitive) so that statistical literacy can be clearly seen as a learnable, improvable skill set that can be introduced in the context of a journal club, among other options, and can continue to be used and developed by individuals and instructors.",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Irina Fehr",
          "abstract": "Crimmigration scholarship examines the intersection of criminal law and migration control, and has \nlargely focused on the excessive criminalization of people on the move and solidarity activists. This, \nhowever, captures only part of the story: While migration is increasingly criminalized, state-perpetrated crimes against people on the move are rarely penalized in criminal justice systems, despite widespread accounts of border violence and serious harms suffered by migrants at the hands of Western states. This perspective has not yet been thoroughly addressed within the crimmigration \ndebate – a gap that is filled in this paper. Drawing on critical criminology and the concept of ‘criminal \nselectivity’, this article unveils state-perpetrated crimes against migrants as another face of \ncrimmigration. It illustrates how Western states use criminal law both excessively against migrants \nand solidarians, and sparingly against public officials, in the pursuit of controlling migration. These \ninterrelated mechanisms – conceptualized as over- and under-criminalization – form two sides of the \nsame coin, and capture the instrumentalization of criminal law in Western migration governance. By \nunpacking this selective criminalization, the paper contributes to a more holistic crimmigration \ndebate, developing a counter story to the predominant crime-migration nexus by shifting the focus \naway from migrant criminality towards criminal state conduct. This reframing not only challenges \nthe selective focus of crimmigration scholarship, but also lays the theoretical groundwork for \nreducing impunity around harmful migration control practices through the application of criminal \nlaw.",

          "authors": "Jonathan R. Brauer; Jacob C. Day",
          "abstract": "Criminological research frequently examines ordinal outcome data, yet the common practice of treating these data as continuous using linear models can obscure patterns, introduce imprecision, and bias estimates. We advocate for the appropriate analysis of ordinal outcomes with ordered regression models. We demonstrate how linear models misrepresent ordinal distributions using simulated data before reanalyzing select results from Pickett, Graham, and Cullen's (2022) study on racial differences in fear of police. Our analysis showcases how ordered regression models, coupled with effective visualization techniques, provide more accurate estimates than linear models—revealing that linear approaches substantially underestimate racial disparities. For instance, cumulative probit models correctly estimate that nearly one-third of Black participants are “very afraid” of police killing them, while linear models underestimate this by nearly two-thirds. By respecting the ordinal nature of data, criminologists can move beyond broad directional statements and quantify effect magnitudes with greater precision, fostering a more robust, evidence-driven discipline capable of addressing its “precision crisis.”",

          "abstract": "Parental leave uptake by fathers represents one pathway to redress the typically unequal division of early childcare. Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",

          "authors": "Maurice Ongala Ouma; Ruth Kiraka; Jyoti Choudrie; Javan Solomon Okello",
          "abstract": "Background:\nHealthcare organizations are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to bolster clinical decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and secure strategic advantages. Despite rapid technological advancements, extant literature on human-AI collaboration in healthcare inadequately addresses the intersection of strategic management theories, user-centered design principles, interpretability, and ethical imperatives. This protocol delineates a scoping review designed to map the multifaceted landscape of AI adoption, thereby establishing a robust foundation for further inquiry.\nObjectives:\nThis scoping review protocol aims to systematically map the existing body of evidence on AI adoption and utilization in resource-constrained healthcare settings, with a particular focus on how AI supports decision-making, knowledge exchange, and overall organizational performance. It further seeks to identify and critically evaluate the theoretical frameworks that have been employed in these studies, scrutinizing their relevance to strategic management practices and human-AI collaboration. Additionally, the review will analyze the barriers and enablers influencing AI adoption, propose strategic management insights, and highlight theoretical gaps to inform future research directions that address user-centered design, interpretability, and the ethical dimensions of AI-driven health services.\nEligibility Criteria:\nThe review will include studies investigating AI-enabled interventions (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing) in resource-constrained healthcare settings, irrespective of publication date, provided they are available in English. This approach is intended to capture a comprehensive snapshot of the evolving literature.\nSources of Evidence and Methods:\nA systematic search will be conducted across major databases, including SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost-Web of Science, in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. An iterative search process will be refined through pilot testing of search strings, and data will be extracted using a pre-specified framework in Covidence. NVivo will be employed to facilitate the thematic synthesis of key analytical categories, including decision-making support, knowledge exchange, operational efficiency, and strategic management dimensions of AI adoption.\nExpected Outcomes:\nThis review is expected to elucidate the multifaceted roles of AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings, reveal limitations within current theoretical frameworks, and provide strategic insights for future research and practice. By integrating perspectives from strategic management and human-AI collaboration, the review aims to contribute toward more sustainable, interpretable, and ethically grounded AI implementations in healthcare.",

As children more commonly live with both of their parents post-separation, discovering the distributional impact of shared residence on parents’ household costs and the level of shared residence child’s cost are of importance. With Reference Budget calculations from Finland, we find a nuanced impact on the costs of children depending on the age of the child, their living arrangement and whether the point of view is mother’s or father’s. These aspects should be carefully considered when assessing the impact of shared residence on households’ economic needs. Our findings provide a framework for the analysis of entitlement and benefit levels for shared residence families, as well as for accurately deriving poverty estimates for them.",

However, novel sources of big data could be used to generate more precise insights about stratification among Hispanic subgroups. To demonstrate this, we use disaggregated data from the US Census Bureau that contains the number of Hispanic people in each ZIP code in the United States broken down by their regional origin (country or territory), along with ZIP code level data of economic connectedness, a strong predictor of socioeconomic mobility created using digital data from social media. Our results show Hispanics of Mexican, Central American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban origin tend to live in areas with less economic connectedness than Hispanics of South American and Spanish origin, trends which mirror the overall trends discussed in the current literature. These latter groups, in some cases, have higher indicators of economic connectedness than the average American, Hispanic or not. Better understanding of the nuances among the coherent ethnic subgroups that fall under the panethnic Hispanic umbrella has implications for our understanding of social inequality.",

          "authors": "Renato Fakhoury; Adam B. Lerner; Jarrod Hayes",
          "abstract": "Climate change represents a profound theoretical challenge for IR and adjacent disciplines. It consists simultaneously of a series of disasters, in need of repair and redress, and a creeping unjust structural condition—a new normal with growing pernicious effects that transcend borders, recur over time, and disproportionately burden marginalized communities. Though scholars have developed frameworks for assessing both the episodic and structural aspects of climate change, they have failed to grasp their entangled, compounding effects. To address this gap, we theorize dual vulnerability to climate change as a unique position in debates over climate justice. We do so by drawing on Iris Marion Young’s dichotomy between interactional and structural injustice, but integrating her models to highlight how distinct forms of injustice reinforce and compound each other. The dually vulnerable, we argue, are not merely victims of catastrophic climate events, but also the most disadvantaged by the uneven global playing field climate change creates. The concept of dual vulnerability contributes to IR by highlighting the complex entanglement of discrete environmental damages and structural climate injustice, as well as how the dually vulnerable face a temporal challenge of simultaneously pursuing backward-facing compensation and forward-facing collective reparation action. To highlight our concept’s utility, we apply it to analysis of the UNFCCC’s recently created Loss and Damage Fund.",

One broad strand of research characterises how risk emerges from the complex global system, using concepts like systemic risk, Anthropocene risk, synchronous failure, negative social tipping points, and polycrisis. Another strand focuses on possible worst-case outcomes, using concepts like global catastrophic risk (GCR), existential risk, and extinction risk. Despite their clear relevance to each other, only limited connections have been made between these two strands. Here we provide a framework which synthesises the two and shows how emergent properties of the global system contribute to the risk of global catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the global system generates hazards, amplification, vulnerability, and latent risk, as well as challenges for GCR assessment and mitigation. This systemic lens helps us understand the origins of GCR, provides a useful interface between two deeply related but infrequently connected bodies of work, and provides important insights for risk reduction.",

          "authors": "Barbara Turk Niskac",
          "abstract": "The litter-raking stands of Bela Krajina in Slovenia are taken as a reference point to examine the entanglements of human and more-than-human worlds through the concept of work as an activity that places humans in a relationship with other living beings. In the domestic agricultural economy of the past, the litter-raking stands were used as pastures for livestock in the spring and summer. In the fall, people gathered litter and cut bracken for bedding the livestock that returned to the barns before winter. The practice led to soil degradation and acidification, so that only sparsely growing birch, pine, and undergrowth of bracken, spring heath, and common heather grew on these lands. In the process of modernization and de-agrarization these activities have been abandoned since the 1960s, and the most litter-raking stands have since become overgrown. Today, some of these stands are protected as natural heritage under Natura 2000. They are home to various birds, butterflies, insects, fungi and orchids and are cut only to preserve biotic diversity. Fast reforestation in this context thus points to the importance of moderate human disturbances for biodiversity conservation. Based on a case study of litter-raking stands, this paper acknowledges the ethic of care as inherent to work as a life-sustaining practice where human and non-human well-being are entangled (Krzywoszynska 2020). Furthermore, it explores whether it is possible to consider work as a life-sustaining practice embedded in a more-than-human relationality, reciprocity, and care that recognizes “work of nature” (Battistoni 2017) for ecosystem maintenance as well.",
