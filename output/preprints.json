          "abstract": "Transparent and reproducible science requires that data and code underlying published results be made available to allow regeneration and verification of the results. But how easy is it to reproduce computational analyses using these materials? This technical report describes efforts to computationally reproduce results at one established repository as part of a routine internal pre-publication review. We conduct a structured content analysis of twenty-six “author reports'' generated through a standard review process and categorize identified issues. We find that four in five studies include code errors that prevent execution or produce inconsistent results. Although these errors are generally minor, we interpret our findings to indicate that review and correction can help resolve many of the errors and facilitate computational reproducibility.",

          "abstract": "Background: Maternal depression and anxiety dramatically increased for mothers of young children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few programs target maternal mental health and parenting skills concurrently despite this being more effective. An eHealth program, Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) was developed to address this gap. A feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with BEAM with a community partner versus an existing App for adult mental health (MoodMission). Methods: Mothers of children 6-18 months old participated in a two-arm, parallel-design pragmatic RCT (April-June 2022). Mothers were randomly allocated to BEAM or MoodMission. Primary (depression, anxiety) and secondary (anger, sleep disturbance, parenting stress) outcomes were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up. Results: Eighty mothers (Mage = 31.61 years old) were enrolled. All feasibility metrics were met based on a priori benchmarks for success. All maternal mental health and parenting stress outcomes decreased from pre- to post-intervention and follow-up in BEAM and MoodMission. When controlling for symptom severity at time of enrollment, treatment group (BEAM, MoodMission) moderated anxiety symptom reductions such that BEAM was more effective in reducing anxiety symptoms across time versus MoodMission (b = -1.48, SE = 0.74, p = .045). Symptom severity at enrollment did not moderate symptom reductions and there was no three-way interaction between symptom severity*treatment group*time. Discussion: Feasibility and effectiveness of BEAM was demonstrated for delivery with a community partner. Findings suggest BEAM holds the potential to promote the mental well-being of mothers of young children. Results have informed a future large-scale RCT across Canada. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT05 398107).",

          "authors": "Sinead McNally; Lisa Keenan; Mary Rose Sweeney; Aoife Lynam; Christina O'Keeffe",
          "abstract": "This paper provides a reflective, methodological guide for researchers conducting inclusive interviews with autistic children and young people – a historically marginalised population. As researchers reporting on the experiences of any marginalised population, we have an ethical obligation to ensure participation is open and accessible to all. While there is a growing recognition of the need to amplify the voices of under-served populations, there is a lack of clear guidelines for researchers seeking to implement inclusive research methods in practice. Drawing upon our recent experience with a large-scale qualitative study (N = 51) exploring the school experiences of autistic students in Ireland, we offer a real-world case example with a flexible, child-centred research protocol involving photovoice and adapted interviews. We describe how we individualised our protocol for the autistic students who participated in this study, supporting a wide range of ages (5 to 19 years) and communication profiles. Reflecting on the successes and challenges of this approach from an ethical and methodological standpoint, we highlight the importance of sensitivity, flexibility, and the value of small actions. Based on learnings from our work and others, we present an actionable framework of recommendations for conducting inclusive interviews. Finally, we argue that embracing inclusivity for all, not just the neurodivergent, is needed in the wider culture of academic research",

          "abstract": "Iconic memory for position is often characterized as “vast” or “limitless”. Yet typical studies of iconic memory have used only small stimulus sets and have restricted judgments to categorical visual content like letter identities or object features, the kinds of items that are known to be subject to very restrictive bottlenecks in recognition or working memory. We wondered about the capacity of iconic memory for mere spatial information, which may be pre-recognitional, and tested the ability of observers to notice discrete illuminated positions in a yes/no partial report task. We found iconic capacity for spatial position to fall far short of “limitless”, with typical observers able to report only a fraction of a set of dozens of stimulus points. These results may be explained by crowding, an unavoidable limitation on what can be reported about what is seen. We propose that extremely simple stimuli like dots may help to illuminate our understanding the appearance of crowded stimuli, and to highlight potential discrepancies between what we see and what we can report about it.",

          "authors": "Rachael Kee; Kelly Jantzen; Amanda Hahn",
          "abstract": "Infant faces are an important cue for facilitating bonding and interactions with adult caregivers. Cues of poor infant health are associated with a lower degree of parental investment and facial malformations, in particular, have been shown to negatively impact early infant-caregiver interactions. Previous research has shown altered visual and neural processing for infant faces with cleft lip/palate. Although many infants with these facial malformations undergo craniofacial repair surgery, it is not yet known if/how this impacts perceptual responses to infants. The current study investigates the potential restorative effects of craniofacial repair surgery on perceptions of infant cuteness, visual attention to infant faces (eye tracking), and neural responses to infant faces (EEG). Craniofacial repair surgery is found to increase perceived cuteness, reduce visual attention to the mouth region, and influence early neural signatures of face processing (N170, P200 ERP components). As these various responses contribute to a number of important developmental aspects (e.g., joint attention) and may play a key role in the previously observed difficulties in caregiver-infant interactions, this study provides an important first step in determining the effectiveness of surgical interventions on the underlying perceptual mechanisms of infant face processing.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of an 8-week Adapted Physical Activity (APA) program on mental health and sport confidence in 247 adults (Mage = 56.85) with and without pathologies. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and a sport confidence measure before (T1) and after (T2) the intervention. Results showed significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sport confidence following the APA program. Notably, these benefits were observed regardless of the presence of a pathology. Furthermore, a mediation model revealed that depression mediated the relationship between anxiety and sport confidence at T1. This mediation persisted at T2, while the direct link between anxiety and sport confidence was no longer significant. These findings underscore the importance of APA in enhancing mental health and sport confidence, particularly by alleviating depressive symptoms. The study highlights the need to address mood and emotional well-being in promoting long-term engagement in physical activity for individuals of all levels and health conditions.",

          "authors": "Julian Berger; Mehdi Moussaid; Ralph Hertwig; Stefan Michael Herzog; Ralf Kurvers",
          "abstract": "Efficiently allocating individuals to work on complex decision problems is a key challenge for groups, organizations, and societies. It involves a crucial trade- off: Increasing the number of individuals working on a task typically improves accuracy, but also increases costs. Research in collective intelligence has proposed a plethora of mechanisms to pool the judgments of independent decision makers in order to improve performance. However, these mechanisms are static; because they do not adjust the number of crowd members to the challenge at hand, they incur high, fixed costs for every decision problem. We develop and test three decision rules that make it possible to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd adaptively depending on a case’s difficulty. Our rules rely on decision makers’ confidence judgments to stop crowd growth. Empirical analyses in four real-world domains (cancer diagnoses, false news classification, criminology, and forecasting) using seven datasets show that our adaptive decision rules can result in equal or higher accuracy compared to widely used static crowd aggregators, while relying on fewer individuals. Our findings present easily applicable practical decision guidelines that can substantially boost the efficiency of crowds.",

          "authors": "Albert Levis",
          "abstract": "In this study we introduce the formal theoretical conceptualization of psychology and apply it to the integration of the three components of the Self-regulated learning (SRL) experience. The Formal Theory through the analysis of the creative process identifies emotions as energetic entities and the unconscious as an energy transformation homeostatic conflict resolution mechanism, a scientifically defined, graphically portrayable, qualifiable and measurable conflict resolution entity. We identify its two components: a six emotions energetic dialectic leading predictably to four types of conflict resolution.  This entity unites cognition, emotions, and behaviors into an organic testable, measurable continuum. A three prong emotional education program addresses the three domains leading to accurate and useful self-regulating insights. The cognitive component introduces the new science, integrating psychology, morality and physics by examining art exhibits; the psychological component uses the Conflict Analysis Battery (CAB) self-assessment for self-discovery; the behavior modification component examines cultural paradigms of four alternative ways of managing  power and attitude as complementary relational modalities. In a study of the self-guided online delivery of the CAB to 47 participants, we examine the program’s emotional impact by reviewing the participants’ comments on the learning experience and their responses to a query evaluating the program’s didactic, diagnostic and therapeutic objectives. We conclude that since behavior has become a science educators should introduce Emotional Education to enhance SLR objectives.",

When applied in the context of psychological and educational assessments, such models can be used for assigning scores to essays and other types of responses. In such as setting, traditional frameworks of test theory, such as classical test theory and item response theory, are no longer applicable, which leads to practical challenges in the evaluation of testing standards for scores obtained from AI models. To address these challenges, we discuss the evaluation of validity, fairness and reliability for scores obtained from models of artificial intelligence in the context of automated essay scoring. We further illustrate the proposed methods with an empirical example. The development of additional methods is suggested.",

          "authors": "Julianna Vig; Zoltán Jakab",
          "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare three different methods for assessing ear dominance and analyse the relationship between handedness and various ear dominance values. \nMethods: In a group of neurotypical, Hungarian adults including right-handed (N=38), left-handed (N=24) and ambidextrous (N=10) men and women, handedness was assessed by a short form of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, whereas ear dominance was assessed by dichotic tests and two types of degraded speech stimuli (sine-wave and vocoded speech, generated from trisyllabic Hungarian words) presented monaurally. \nResults: Although the majority of participants had a right ear advantage using each of the three methods, characteristics of ear dominance differed depending on the assessment method. The three different ear dominance indices were uncorrelated with one another. Handedness was weakly related to dominance measured by monaural sine-wave stimuli and unrelated to that measured by monaural vocoded and dichotic stimuli. Crossed dominance was observed in a substantial proportion of participants (35-46%, depending on the type of ear dominance). Analysis of the perception of degraded speech revealed a remarkable interindividual variability and a learning transfer between sine-wave and vocoded speech.\nConclusion: The use of monaural degraded speech stimuli reveals different forms of ear dominance compared with dichotic tests, which suggests that ear dominance is strongly task-dependent. Handedness is not strongly correlated with any form of ear dominance. The high prevalence of crossed hand-ear dominance suggests that this type of crossed dominance is a normal variant rather than a maladaptive trait. The observed learing transfer between the two types of degraded stimuli might be mediated by domain-general mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of contextual factors on mind wandering (MW) by leveraging an online platform for an established laboratory task. We investigated how direct performance feedback, information about task progression, and the feeling of being monitored influenced performance indices in a task used to investigate the effect of MW on executive control. Our results indicate that specific performance feedback, and not general positive feedback, consistently improved performance, while neither impacted self-reported MW. Conversely, feedback on task progression and the feeling of being monitored increased self-reported MW, possibly reflecting participant self-awareness due to contextual distractions. Intriguingly, information relaying task progression also substantially increased performance. These findings highlight the potential of performance feedback to reduce the negative effects of MW on task performance in an online setting. Additionally, the findings suggest that information about task progression, as well as the notion of being monitored during the experiment can influence task focus and should be taken into consideration when investigating fluctuations of attention during cognitive tasks.",

          "authors": "Lucie Zimmer; Hilary Richardson; Carolina Pletti; Markus Paulus; Tobias Schuwerk",
          "abstract": "Social-cognitive processes, particularly Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, appear to differ between autistic and non-autistic individuals. This has been proposed to reflect the autistic core symptomatology of communication and social interaction difficulties. According to the predictive coding theory, autistic individuals’ ToM reasoning difficulties arise from an attenuated use of prior information about others’ mental states to explain and predict their behavior. This reduced use of prior assumptions makes the social world less predictable for autistic people, causing interactive mismatch and stress. Despite strong theoretical claims, robust and replicable neural differences in ToM brain regions remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether brain regions supporting ToM reasoning anticipate a narrative during repeated exposure (i.e., the narrative anticipation effect) in non-autistic adults (Experiment 1) and tested whether this effect was attenuated in autistic adults (Experiment 2). We presented a short movie with a plot including mental states with associated actions, twice, to 61 non-autistic adults who underwent fMRI (Experiment 1: M(SD)age= 25.9(4.4) years). In Experiment 2, we used the same protocol with 30 autistic (M(SD)age= 32.4(10.7) years) and 30 non-autistic adults (M(SD)age= 33.2(10.1) years). Analyses revealed no narrative anticipation effect in the ToM network in either group. Exploratory reverse correlation analyses identified a ToM scene that evoked a smaller difference in response between movie viewings (i.e., less repetition suppression) in autistic adults, compared to non-autistic adults. In sum, our study shows that predictive processing in the ToM network during a naturalistic movie-viewing experiment was absent in adults. Subtle differences in a key scene provide preliminary neural evidence for the predictive coding theory and open a promising avenue for future research to better understand the nature of differences in social interaction in autistic adults.",

          "abstract": "Background\nParental capacity to learn from dynamic infant responses is a fundamental component of early dyadic interactions.  However, the precise cognitive processes involved in successful interactions are not clear. If understood these could be targeted by preventative interventions.\nMethods\nWe examined the computational basis of learning and decision-making in nulliparous (Study 1) and pregnant participants enrolled in a multigenerational cohort study (Study 2) using a two-armed bandit task adapted to simulate a playful interaction with an infant. Participants chose between two competing bandits (i.e., two toys) with different underlying nominal probabilities for three outcomes (i.e., infant sad, neutral, and happy facial expressions). In Study 1, we manipulated the baseline emotional context of the task (i.e., baby started happy or sad) to assess its influence on the processing of emotional feedback and decision-making in a sample of non-parents. In both studies, we explored whether mental health and personalities difficulties associated with learning from feedback. \nResults\nThe manipulation of the emotional context (Study 1) was associated with differences in how participants learnt from the feedback and made decisions. Both studies suggest that having greater personality difficulties and experiencing higher antenatal depressive symptoms (Study 2) associate with slower learning from infant feedback. \nConclusions\nOur findings provide novel evidence regarding the role of the emotional context in learning and decision-making processes. For parents with depressive symptoms and personality difficulties, dampened responsivity to emotional feedback and inflexibility in updating beliefs about the values of actions may underlie fewer sensitive behaviours when interacting with their infants.",

          "abstract": "An ERP experiment was conducted to investigate the common and distinct neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the on-line processing of two types of politeness maxims (self-depreciation and other-elevation) and the individual differences during sentence reading. Electroencephalograms were recorded while participants read sentences containing pragmatically appropriate or inappropriate honorific or humble terms. When collapsing all participants’ data, inappropriate humble and honorific terms elicited N400 and P600 effects, respectively, which could reflect semantic processing costs and rechecking processes, respectively. More importantly, communication abilities modulated N400 and late negativity effects for appropriateness for humble but not honorific terms. In contrast, perspective-taking and emphatic concern modulated N400 and late positivity effects, respectively, for honorific but not humble terms. In addition, some commonness of the appropriateness effect modulation by individual variables was also observed. These results are discussed in terms of commonness and individuality of neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of different politeness maxims during sentence comprehension.",

Over the course of time, issues have arisen that have had an impact on the intended administration and interpretation of this common clinical tool. \nPurpose: Based on published literature, clinical experience, recent survey data, and practical considerations, and while maintaining the original purpose of the instrument, the authors developed a revised protocol, new rating form, and updated instructions for the CAPE-V, now called the CAPE-V – Revised (CAPE-Vr).\nSummary of Modifications: Revisions to the CAPE-V include the following: removal of textual labels indicating severity on the response form; modification of several of the stimuli; revised rating options for pitch, loudness, and resonance, and an added category for nasality; added space to describe inconsistencies according to task; modified options for vocal instabilities and other features; and added space for comments about overall impression. The form also includes sections for documenting recording and rating conditions. Updated instructions are provided to clarify the CAPE-Vr protocol and correspond closely to the rating form. \nConclusion. The CAPE-Vr is constructed to avoid common errors and problems identified from previous use of the original CAPE-V. This paper provides a rationale for each modification to the original CAPE-V, an updated form, and an example of a completed form. The CAPE-Vr is intended as a clear and useful assessment tool for documenting the auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on an extension of terror management theory, this study examines whether positive death valence might faciliate radical, intersectional interventions in homophobic prejudice. Prior research showed that a more positive view on one's own mortality in wave 1 was associated with less stereotypes about sex, gender and desire in wave 2. The present online study explores whether positive death valence reduces homonegativity. Using reaction time tests and surveys, 77 out of 191 US participants continued from wave 1, assessing death attitudes, to wave 2, assessing homonegativity. Consistent with the prediction, participants who viewed death more positively exhibited significantly less homophobic prejudice. By contrast, survey measures revealed no association between death valence and homonegativity. Future research should incorporate further assesment methods, cross-cultural samples and additional dimensions of prejudice to better understand the role of positive death valence for anti-discriminatory interventions.",

          "abstract": "In our digitally connected world, interpersonal interactions increasingly occur through online platforms offering varied information channels. This research investigates the unique contribution of visual cues to emotional communication, examining both cognitive and affective aspects. We categorize affective experiences into three domains and explore how visual feedback enhances each and promotes prosocial behavior. Across three ecological dyadic studies on Zoom (N = 710), findings show that while visual information does not significantly enhance emotion-assessment accuracy, it shapes the affective experience of communication. Visual cues increased perceptions of listening, togetherness, and empathy, primarily influencing storytellers' perceptions. Active engagement through body gestures and eye gaze proved crucial in fostering positive interactions, even in online settings. Visual feedback also enhanced prosocial behavior, suggesting that visual elements not only enhance the experience of “being seen,” but motivate altruistic actions as well. The results reveal a complex interplay between visual and auditory cues, with vocal responsiveness only partially compensating for absent visual feedback. These findings have significant implications for social relations in a digital world, as the absence or presence of visual cues can profoundly shape the outcomes of our social interactions.",

          "abstract": "Many people see climate change as a major problem that needs to be addressed. However, many still do not engage in the necessary pro-environmental behavior. One possible problem is that pro-environmental behavior may require self-control given that being non-environmental is usually less effortful or otherwise less costly. In the present research, we examine whether lay beliefs about willpower (i.e., people’s beliefs about the nature of self-control) predict pro-environmental behavior. Study 1 (N = 165) tested the correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and performance and effort exertion (as assessed by cardiovascular reactivity) on an environmental task. The results showed an association of a nonlimited willpower belief with better performance and more effort exertion (as measured by pre-ejection period, but not systolic blood pressure). Study 2 (N = 208) assessed the causal effect on the same outcomes by experimentally manipulating participants’ willpower beliefs. However, there was no support for a causal effect. There was only a marginally significant effect on performance, no significant difference in effort exertion as measured by pre-ejection period, and merely a trending difference in systolic blood pressure (which was exploratorily analyzed). Thus, while the results from Study 1 indicate a correlational relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful exertion on pro-environmental behavior, Study 2 did not provide evidence of a causal effect. These results allow first insights into the relationship between lay beliefs about willpower and effortful pro-environmental behavior, but further research is needed to test the robustness and underlying causality of this relationship.",

          "abstract": "The present study contributes to research on the effects of color terminology on perceptual tasks. More specifically, we report the results of a color discrimination study testing a possible effect of multiple basic color terms (BCTs) for the blue color spectrum in Italian. To that end, the performance of speakers of Italian is contrasted with the performance of speakers of English, as these languages differ with regard to their basic color vocabulary. Unlike English, Italian is assumed to have two basic color terms for the blue color spectrum, dividing it along the lightness dimension. The results are discussed in context with results for Russian speakers from previous research. The results obtained by the present study do not provide evidence for an effect in Italian. This null-effect supports a view of weak effects of color terminology on discrimination tasks. We also discuss whether the complex\ncolor terminology for blues in Italian with divergent findings for basic color terms for the blue color space may be an additional factor in explaining the results.",

Fifty naive adult listeners will complete an online listening experiment, containing a baseline, training, and follow-up blocks. During the training block participants will be asked to orthographically transcribe the utterances of children with idiopathic, or cleft-related SSD (n=5, aged 6;0 to 10;1), producing single word utterances. During this block participants will be randomised to a group where they are either shown, or not shown the intended word said by the child. Changes in accuracy and/or ease of understanding will be measured by comparing the listeners’ transcription accuracy and ease ratings enter via a visual analogue scale in the baseline and follow-up block.  \nResults: To be completed at Stage 2.\nConclusion: To be completed at Stage 2.",

          "abstract": "Higher education students are a vulnerable group with respect to mental health issues, and healthy romantic relationships have shown to be a key influencing factor; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. This study used a multi-method design to investigate the proposed mediating mechanisms of intra- and inter-personal emotion-regulation strategies. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and questionnaires, completed by 259 students (124 single, 135 in a relationship), were used to capture both trait emotion regulation tendencies and strategy utilisation on a day-to-day basis. Data were analysed using path mediation in a structural equation model. Results suggested some significant effects of emotion-regulation strategies on depression, anxiety and stress, but with   conflicting findings across methods. Findings suggest that fostering positive emotion-regulation strategies among students could be a relevant intervention target for supporting their mental health. Understanding variations in findings across methods, emotion regulation strategies, and mental health outcomes deserves further research attention.\n\nKeywords: mental health, students, romantic relationships",

Given that comorbidity between depressive and anxiety disorders can reach up to 65%, understanding symptom-level overlap could provide valuable insights for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing targeted transdiagnostic assessments. Methods: We conducted a content analysis of 18 widely used clinical scales, assessing both depression and anxiety domains individually and together. Using the Jaccard Index (0 = no overlap; 1 = complete overlap), we quantified overlap across individual depression scales, individual anxiety scales, and combined depression and anxiety scales to capture symptom-level intersections. Results: Our findings indicated low mean overlap within each domain (0.29 and 0.26 for depression and anxiety, respectively) and even lower mean overlap (0.13) when depression and anxiety scales were analyzed together, underscoring significant heterogeneity among scales. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRDS) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) displayed the highest cross-domain overlap (0.41), suggesting these scales may assess overlapping symptom dimensions. Conclusion: Results reveal distinct symptom structures in depression and anxiety scales, with only a limited degree of shared content. This suggests that many current scales may inadequately capture the mixed symptoms often present in clinical populations. Our findings underscore the importance of developing transdiagnostic measures capable of assessing both shared and distinct symptom dimensions across affective disorders, which may ultimately enhance clinical precision in assessing comorbid presentations and inform future revisions of existing assessment tools",

Specifically, with increasing exposure to non-target language cues, bilinguals adjust the lexical activation to allow non-target language access from the earliest word recognition stages. Using the invisible boundary paradigm, we examined the flow of lexical activation in fifty proficient Russian-English bilinguals reading in their native Russian while the language context shifted from a monolingual to a bilingual environment. We gradually introduced non-target language cues (the language of experimenter and fillers) while also manipulating the type of word previews (identical, code-switches, unrelated code-switches, pseudowords). The results revealed the facilitatory reading effects of code switches but only in the later lexical processing stages and these effects were independent of the global language context manipulation.

          "abstract": "Background: Mounting research indicates that observing others experience side effects can induce negative expectations and exacerbate side effects via the nocebo effect. However, most research on these socially-induced nocebo effects has focused on model-observer dyads, which may not map on to many real world settings in which people are exposed to many different models (e.g., social media).\n\nPurpose: To address this, we tested nocebo effects following observation of many models and whether the order of observing a ‘severe’ model (i.e., highly negative experience) moderated this effect.\n\nMethod : One hundred and seventy participants observed five social models undergo a virtual reality (VR) rollercoaster in Zoom, with four reporting mild cybersickness and one reporting severe cybersickness. The position of the model reporting severe cybersickness was manipulated between groups as either first (primacy), middle, or last\n(recency).\n\nResults: Participants who observed the cybersickness modelling reported greater cybersickness when they underwent the VR rollercoaster relative to a control group who observed non-symptomatic models. This social modelling effect was mediated by the participants’ expectancy of cybersickness symptoms. However, the position of the severe model within the sequence did not impact the participants’ cybersickness levels.\n\nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that socially-induced nocebo effects can occur in response to exposure to many models but the order of exposure does not moderate this effect. The results also indicate that developing interventions that target expectancy is critical for reducing the burden of socially-induced nocebo effects.",

          "abstract": "Reading is a complex process shaped by neurobiological traits and environmental factors, with reading disabilities imposing profound impacts on educational and socioeconomic outcomes worldwide. Early intervention is key, but identifying reliable, early-age predictors of future reading development remains a significant challenge, particularly in linguistically and socioeconomically diverse populations. While language-based precursors to reading ability (e.g., phonological awareness) have excellent predictive validity in homogeneous populations (e.g., English monolinguals), performance on these measures can be biased by language and early life experience. Here, we investigate whether visual processing measures could predict reading outcomes without biases of language background and socioeconomic status as early as kindergarten. Across a large and diverse sample of children (N ~ 1400) from California public schools, we administered measures of rapid visual processing (multi-element processing and visual motion perception tasks). Measures of language proficiency, socioeconomic status, and reading ability were also collected. We show that performance on the visual-processing measures did not differ by home language (Spanish versus English) or socioeconomic factors. Visual-processing measures accounted for ~12–18% of variance in year-end reading scores. Feature importance analysis suggests that visual-processing measures are important predictors of risk in kindergarten with equivalent performance to some of the conventional screening measures. Our findings show that visual-processing measures may provide a window into reading development that is agnostic to spoken language proficiency and socioeconomics. Incorporating these visual measures into early screening batteries could enable more equitable identification of children at risk for reading difficulties across diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

We find that, relative to participants who shared high-quality news on X, those who shared lower-quality news on X were also more likely to say that they would share false headlines in the survey, and a greater fraction of the headlines they said they would share were false.

The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest that token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate that they are positively related, and yet others argue that token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We take up both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms as well as to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments, with type frequency playing a dominant role. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Neither of these models is designed to encode a particular relationship between token frequency, type frequency, and productivity, but we show that both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

Our method employs ruler-based calibration to estimate the millimeter-to-pixel ratio by applying the least squares method to participants’ repeated measurements of randomly generated line segment lengths. Importantly, the success of the calibration can be objectively verified by assessing the measurement error of a test line segment and the residual variance in a linear regression model. Our simulation demonstrated that, with the recommended calibration criteria, an upper bound of the standard deviation for estimation errors was 0.007 mm/px. Implementation results showed that the majority of 100 participants completed the calibration within a few minutes, demonstrating the method’s feasibility. Our method may facilitate rigorous studies of psychological phenomena sensitive to visual stimulus size, such as visual perception and cognition, in online environments.

When asked to elaborate their inconsistencies in semi-structured interviews, respondents did not evaluate them negatively, instead they employed circumvention strategies - attributing incompatibility to the response format or diluting content of the claims (e.g., adding logical conditions).

The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability.

Analyzing data from a large delayed free recall experiment, we find that participants cluster their recalls based on alliterative and rhyming patterns in the encoded words, and such organization predicts recall performance.

We hypothesized that negative affect would be especially likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with strong emotion reactivity: that is, those with greater sensitivity, intensity, and persistence of negative affect when it is experienced. We used ecological momentary assessment to examine the real-time process of how emotion reactivity interacts with affect to predict suicidal thinking. As hypothesized, across two samples (n=43 college students reporting suicidal ideation; n=52 individuals with a history of suicide attempt recruited online), results revealed that the association between momentary negative affect and suicidal thinking was stronger among those with greater trait emotion reactivity. Regarding individual facets of emotion reactivity, the interaction with intensity was significant in Study 1, whereas the interactions with persistence and sensitivity were significant in Study 2. These findings support the real-world components of the emotion reactivity model, suggesting trait-level patterns of emotional responses are important to consider in modeling and analyzing momentary mood states.

          "abstract": "Theoretical models of repetitive negative thinking suggest that multiple factors contribute to rumination, placing one at risk for depression. However, temporal dynamics of rumination and related cognitive  risk factors remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to model the time-varying associations between depressed mood, metacognitive beliefs, promotion focus, attentional control, and rumination in daily life using an ecological momentary assessment approach (EMA). Participants at risk for depression (n = 95) completed an intensive EMA procedure (6 times a day for 21 days). We relied on multi-level vector autoregressive modelling (mlVAR) to obtain temporal, contemporaneous and between-subjects networks. The temporal network showed that fluctuations in rumination were predicted by prior ruminative state, attentional control, positive beliefs about rumination, self-consciousness, promotion focus, and depressed mood. The contemporaneous and between subjects networks demonstrated a co-activation of multiple nodes. Each of these analyses provided novel insights into the main cognitive factors and their temporal interplay in relation to rumination.  Overall, the results converge with integrative theoretical models suggesting bidirectional temporal associations and highlight potential direct and indirect targets for interventions to modify rumination.",

          "authors": "Eda Mizrak; Klaus Oberauer",
          "abstract": "Giving people more time between encoding items into working memory (WM) improves performance. In complex span tasks performance depends on the cognitive load imposed by a secondary task carried out between encoding items; free time is one variable determining cognitive load. Explanations of the effects of time and of cognitive load on working memory often build on the assumption that time is used for maintenance processes such as rehearsal or refreshing. This leads to the prediction that a manipulation of time has a retroactive effect on items encoded before. In contrast, the encoding resource account suggests that free time has a proactive benefit by replenishing encoding resources between items, thereby improving encoding of subsequent items. In two studies, we examined whether giving additional free time resulted in a proactive or retroactive benefit in a modified complex-span task. We found that, whereas the secondary task led to a retroactive detriment, the free time benefit was proactive. These findings call for a new\nway of thinking about the effect of cognitive load in WM.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent depression is impactful for adolescents and for their parents. High worry and low self-efficacy may be rather prominent among parents with adolescents with depression, but how this may in turn have an effect on parenting behaviors, such as warmth and criticism, is not well known. In a healthy control (i.e, 80 adolescents, M_age = 15.90, SD_age = 1.35; 151 parents, M_age = 49.04, SD_age = 5.87) and depression sample (i.e., 34 adolescents with depression, M_age = 15.65, SD_age = 1.54; 58 parents, M_age = 50.10, SD_age = 5.30), we estimated Gaussian graphical network models on adolescent-reported affect states (i.e., happy, relaxed, sad, &amp; irritated), adolescent- and parent-reported parenting behaviors (i.e., warmth, understanding, listening, criticism, dominance), and parent-reported parental worry and self-efficacy. Parents of adolescents with depression reported higher levels of worry, but not less self-efficacy. In both samples, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported sadness and parent-reported parental criticism. Moreover, parent-reported self-efficacy was positively related to adolescent- and parent-reported parental warmth. Only in the depression sample, parent-reported worry was positively related to adolescent-reported parental warmth. Parental worry, self-efficacy, parenting behaviors and adolescent affect were interrelated with considerable differences between the control and depression sample. As a next step, studies with more intensive daily assessments may yield individual family analyses, while also accounting for contextual factors, to further increase our understanding of the relation between parental worry, self-efficacy and parenting behaviors in the context of adolescent depression.",

Whilst distrust in science undeniably has detrimental outcomes, we argue that its opposite, uncritical trust in science and scientists (i.e. scientism) also leads to potential unwarranted societal polarization. In Study 1 we observed that people who endorsed scientistic beliefs supported discriminatory policies against people who ignore scientific knowledge or promote anti-scientific views, ranging from restrictions on their media appearance to imprisonment and denial of healthcare. Study 2 replicated the effect and tested its potential mechanism: the tendency to moralize rationality mediated the relationship between scientism and support for penalizing measures. Our findings demonstrate that unwarranted beliefs, even if positive in their moderate version, are associated with increased support for unwarranted measures against dissenters.",

          "abstract": "The last 15 years of research on language production and comprehension have put forward a conceptual revolution, highlighting how language may depend not only on specific brain areas but also on embodied processes underpinned by sensorimotor brain regions. A large amount of studies have underlined the sensorimotor grounding of the different processes at play in language comprehension, in particular action verb processing and sentence comprehension (see Fischer &amp; Zwaan, 2008 and Franken et al., 2022 for reviews). One aspect of language processing, phoneme perception, has been less extensively studied in light of embodied cognition, yet the motor involvement in decoding sounds pertaining to a linguistic code seems to play a crucial contribution. The focus of the current review is to provide an updated overview of the findings in this domain on both native (Sections I and II) and foreign (i.e. non-native) phoneme perception (Section III), and to further examine if and how motor training may enhance phonological processing and learning of foreign language speech sounds (Section IV and V).",

However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

Far from being merely about entertainment, Fun at Work (FaW) embodies strategic elements via social bonding, essential for bolstering employee well-being, fostering engagement, and enhancing productivity. The present meta-analysis and narrative synthesis examined the relationship between FaW with work engagement and job burnout. The results of the meta-analysis showed a substantial overlap between Work Engagement and FaW and a smaller overlap with emotional exhaustion. Meta-regression indicated that the relationship between FaW and work engagement was stronger in Non-WEIRD countries and studies with samples including a higher proportion of men. The narrative review revealed two primary and bidirectional categories that capture the essence of workplace fun: Organization-Driven Fun (ODF) and Employee-Driven Fun (EDF). ODF and EDF provided the basis for a new conceptual approach to FaW outlined in the paper. The paper reflects on whether FaW  might be inherently part of work engagement rather than a separate construct, functioning as a job resource.",

          "abstract": "Converging evidence from behavioural, neuroimaging, and neurostimulation studies demonstrates that action observation engages linked action production mechanisms, a phenomenon termed covert or automatic imitation. Behaviourally, automatic imitation is measured using the stimulus response compatibility (SRC) task, in which participants produce vocal responses whilst perceiving compatible or incompatible speech distractors. Automatic imitation is measured as the difference in response times (RT) between incompatible and compatible trials. It is unclear if and how social group membership, such as the speaker’s sex, affects automatic imitation. Two theoretical accounts make conflicting predictions regarding effects of group membership: the first predicts that automatic imitation can be modulated by group membership, while the second predicts that automatic imitation remains unaffected. We tested these predictions for participant sex and distractor sex in an online vocal SRC task. Female and male participants completed an SRC task presenting female or male distractor stimuli. The results show that automatic imitation is not modulated by group membership. Implications of these results regarding the nature of automatic imitation are considered.",

          "abstract": "Since learning to read involves associating letter shapes with how they sound, it is widely believed that children become familiar with letter shapes when they start learning their sounds or start writing them down. However, since printed letters are often available in the environment, it is possible that children are already familiar with letter shapes. Here, we provide evidence for this intriguing possibility. We tested 300 children at the beginning of formal reading instruction of the Indian language Kannada. Each child performed four tasks: (1) a letter familiarity task in which they saw upright and inverted versions of each letter, and had to identify the more familiar orientation; (2) a letter recognition task where they had to name letters shown sequentially; (3) a visual search task where they had to find an oddball letter among identical other letters, with letters either all upright or inverted; and (4) a rapid automatized naming task where they had to name digits. Our main finding is that, despite showing wide variation in letter naming, children were highly familiar with letter orientation. This effect was present even on letters that children did not recognize at all. This familiarity with letter orientation also gave them a letter processing advantage: children searched faster when letters were upright than when they were inverted. Our findings reveal a far deeper knowledge of print among early readers than previously observed, and provide empirical support for early exposure to print as a strategy to jump-start reading acquisition.",

In light of this demand — and the virtually non-existent scholarship on the human side of data analysis practice — we enthusiastically call for a new area of research: the Psychology of Data Analysis, which prioritizes a person-centered approach that seeks to understand the judgment, decision-making, and behavior of data analysts in real-world contexts.

This often requires inferring a joint plan—imagining “what coordination would we agree to, if we could?”—and playing our surmised role. Is it also considered morally wrong to violate an inferred joint plan?  In five preregistered experiments (n = 1,506), we show that deviating from an inferred joint plan is perceived as morally problematic, even without prior communication or agreement.  In other words, just as the agreements we actually make are morally binding, so too are the patterns of conduct that we infer our social partners would agree upon.",

While emerging evidence points to psychedelic agents being novel avenues for the treatment of substance use disorders, the predominantly Western medical models of psychedelic-assisted therapy being developed lack Indigenous wisdom and input, raising concerns about safety, efficacy, ownership, and continuing colonial dynamics. In Aotearoa (New Zealand), the enduring impacts of colonisation on Māori include the suppression of Indigenous wisdom, even as research affirming the knowledge and practice of traditional Māori healing is on the rise. \n\nThe Tū Wairua project will explore the integration of rongoā Māori (traditional Māori healing practices) with psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) for addressing problematic methamphetamine use (PMU) in Māori communities. This Māori-led project is driven by kaupapa Māori methodology and rongoā Māori conceptualisations of health and informed by biomedical psychedelic science. Based at Rangiwaho Marae in Te Tairāwhiti, a community with a high Māori population and a significant burden of PMU, the project aims to develop a culturally-appropriate PAT to explore the efficacy of psilocybin in treating PMU. \n\nThis research represents a shift toward health interventions that respect and extend Indigenous wisdom, addressing the unique needs of Māori communities. It also seeks to develop a skilled Māori workforce to continue these healing practices, and challenge current legislation that restricts the use of Indigenous psychedelics.

Previous experimental research has found mitigating accounts (including concessions and excuses, which acknowledge blameworthiness) and aggravating accounts (including justifications and refusals, which minimize or deny wrongdoing) to have important effects on people’s impressions of errant politicians. But are politicians who rely on one strategy versus another any more likely to win actual elections? We constructed a novel dataset documenting Representatives’ public remarks in response the 1992 House Bank Scandal, during which 266 U.S. Representatives from both major political parties were accused of misusing House Bank funds. We observed three key results. First, contrary to predictions, mitigating strategies were not associated with electoral failure among more frequent House Bank “offenders” (whose mitigating strategies were presumably less credible). Second, some aggravating strategies (refusals) were associated with electoral failure—unless incumbents’ party had a secure majority in their district. Finally, this tendency for refusals to predict failure in “safe” partisan districts obtained only in general (not primary) elections, reducing the number of unobserved variables that might be confounded with district partisanship and still incline voters to tolerate aggravating accounts. Results suggest that politicians’ responses to scandals predict real-world election outcomes—depending on district-level characteristics.",

Through item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Item 1 was removed from the original DTS and a two-factor model comprising 7 items was emerged for the Chinese version, contrasting with the previous one-factor models. We labeled the two factors as Trustworthiness (ordinal α = 0.88) and Security (ordinal α = 0.73) respectively. The adapted DTS also demonstrated very good convergent and discriminant validity, along with very good criterion validity, as evident by correlations with relationship satisfaction assessed by the Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS).

Self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate maternal depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), parental attachment-related attitudes (Revised Adult Attachment Scale), and infant regulation (Questionnaire for Crying, Feeding and Sleeping). Mother-infant interactions were recorded on video and subsequently evaluated using the Infant CARE-Index, with an additional assessment of father-infant interaction in a smaller subsample of 20 dyads.\nThe findings indicate that higher maternal depressive symptoms were linked to an increased prevalence of infant regulatory challenges, such as crying and sleep difficulties. Notably, fathers demonstrated significantly higher interaction quality than mothers, despite similar co-regulatory behaviors between parents. These results underscore the impact of maternal mental health on infant regulation and emphasize the importance of father involvement in early child development.",

Do higher-order forms of the two abilities rely on analogous recursive embedding and thus progress in parallel and coordinated ways? We addressed these questions in four studies with 3- to 9-year-old children (N = 395). ToM was operationalized as first-, second-, and third-order false belief understanding. MTT was operationalized as reasoning about future possibilities (first-order), counterfactual reasoning (second-order) and anticipating counterfactual emotions (third-order). Study 1 shows a stepwise development of both ToM and MTT and a moderate consistency of performance patterns. However, across all four studies, we did not find robust correlations between first-, second- and third-order tasks of ToM and MTT, respectively. Overall, these results show stepwise and parallel trajectories in ToM and MTT, but do not provide stringent evidence for a joint cognitive foundation of the two capacities.",

Day-to-day behaviours contribute to poor air quality (AQ) but limited public understanding of AQ warrants effective communication strategies to promote awareness and empower positive behavioural change.\n\n\nObjective:\nThrough the integration of behavioural, science communication, and socio-ecological frameworks, this rapid review mapped existing AQ-related communication interventions and their influence on AQ awareness, on protective and/or mitigating behaviours (i.e., avoiding exposure; reducing polluting activities), and on boosting civic engagement.\n\n\nMethods:\nBuilding on previous evidence syntheses, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, including 79 studies for analysis. Findings were synthesised narratively and assessed for quality with the QuADS tool. We followed the Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study designs (PICOS) criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\n\nResults:\nDespite high heterogeneity in intervention types, most served a persuasion or enablement function, often utilising dissemination modes such as websites or web applications, and most assessed awareness and/or engagement in protective behaviours. While most interventions focused on individual/household-level actions and interindividual dynamics, only some considered policy-level actions, and very few embedded infrastructural considerations in their communication. Overall, 47 studies reported positive impacts on awareness and/or behaviours, particularly through participatory approaches, although we noted issues associated with promoting meaningful participation and identified influencing psychosocial factors. Evidence of effectiveness for behaviours was often limited by observational designs and the focus on awareness only or self-reported behaviours/intentions.\n\n\nSignificance:\nOur findings highlight that top-down communication intervention can have a positive influence on AQ awareness, while findings on behavioural impact are mixed. We highlight growing attempts to communicate AQ-related risks and behavioural solutions through empowering approaches that are sensitive to individual and local circumstances, but note the need for further work to foster mitigating behaviours and civic engagement.",

          "abstract": "Puberty through young adulthood is marked by significant physical, psychological, and social changes. Adolescence holds a window of opportunity to foster resilience, healthy lifestyles, and overall wellbeing, however, research on teenage wellbeing and later life outcomes is lacking. In the current study, associations between teenage wellbeing (age 14-16) and sociodemographic, health and lifestyle outcomes in early adulthood (age 20-25 and 25-35) were investigated using both between-family and within-family designs among 14518 twins and their siblings of the Netherlands Twin Register. Between-family analyses showed positive associations between teenage wellbeing and wellbeing, flourishing, consciousness, self-rated health and sleep quality in early adulthood, and inverse associations with early adulthood neuroticism and smoking habits. The associations with wellbeing, flourishing, self-rated health, sleep quality and neuroticism were also observed when including a sibling fixed effect. Results emphasize the catalyzing effect of teenage wellbeing in shaping later life trajectories, independent of possible genetic and environmental influences.",

          "authors": "Henk Kiers",
          "abstract": "A well-known problem of null hypothesis significance testing is that it cannot be used to find support for the null hypothesis. A common solution for this is to replace the exact 0 value by an interval associated with values that are close to zero. This approach is denoted as equivalence testing and is a special case of procedures that test intervals of values against each other. Smiley et al. (2023) recently published a unified framework of statistical inference and suggested a straightforward method of testing all sorts of interval-based hypotheses in a unified way. The present paper discusses three alternative general approaches, based on Bayesian analysis, which have the advantage that the ensuing probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities of the population parameters, rather than probabilities of the data (as is the case with frequentist methods). These methods (in some form) have been previously suggested, but here we bring them together and show how they can be used for Smiley et al.’s full unified framework of statistical inference, now complementing it with three Bayesian counterparts. In particular, it is shown how each of the methods work in the analysis of a leading example data set involving a test on proportions. Subsequently, their relative pros and cons are discussed, and it is explained how the methods can be used for many statistical analysis questions in practice, using R and/or JASP. This is illustrated on an empirical data set for comparing means of two groups.",

          "abstract": "We present two meta-analyses examining the effectiveness of digital tools on reading outcomes for children and adolescents under 15. We differentiate between poor readers and general school readers, considering intervention type, syllabic complexity, and the type of reading outcomes as moderators. Our search encompassed randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials that assessed digital interventions targeting cognitive or specifically reading-related skills, including a control group, published between 2000 and 2022. We included 41 studies (k = 194) for poor readers and 15 studies (k = 69) for general readers. Our findings from multilevel meta-analyses with robust variance estimation show positive impacts on reading performance for both poor (medium effect size: g = 0.433, CI = [0.3; 0.56], p &lt; 0.001) and general readers (small effect size: g = 0.256, CI = [.08; 0.43], p = 0.009). Notably, domain-specific interventions aided both reader types, while domain-general interventions were effective only for poor readers. The impact of syllabic complexity was limited, with only numerically stronger effects in languages with simpler syllabic structures. Effect sizes did not differ significantly between decoding and comprehension outcomes. These findings highlight the potential of tailored digital interventions to enhance reading skills, especially for those facing reading challenges, and underscore the need for considering additional characteristics in intervention design.",

          "authors": "Ellen Frost; Madeleine Pownall; Daryl Brian O'Connor",
          "abstract": "Minority stress theory poses that distal and proximal stressors cause sexual minority groups to experience excess stress, which can lead to poor mental health outcomes. Szymanski and Mikorski (2016) found that proximal internalised heterosexism mediated the relationship between distal heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress in a sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Meaning in life also moderated some of these pathways. Whilst this mediating relationship is established, research in this area typically examines all sexual minority people together. It is important, however, to explore the unique experiences of lesbian women independent of other sexual minority groups. Therefore, the present study aimed to conceptually replicate Szymanski and Mikorski’s (2016) findings in a sample of lesbian women. We examined the mediating role of internalised heterosexism in the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress relationship in 363 UK lesbians. The moderating role of meaning in life, both search for and presence of, were also investigated. This was a cross-sectional self-report study with data collected from May 2024 to August 2024. In line with the original research, a moderated mediation analysis showed that internalised heterosexism significantly mediated the heterosexist discrimination and psychological distress link. However, no moderating role of search for meaning, nor presence of meaning was found, which did not replicate the results of the original study. This difference could be due to specific sample characteristics. Therefore, these results highlight the need for sexual minority women to be centralised in research in order to produce interventions tailored to specific sexual minority groups.",

          "abstract": "The key educational transition from primary to secondary school occurs during the sensitive developmental period of early adolescence, when students are developing self-regulatory abilities and facing a new array of challenges. Of concern, a decline in wellbeing has been observed following this educational transition. However, little is known about how the self-regulation of cognitions (metacognition) and emotions (emotion regulation) are related to adolescent students’ wellbeing following this transition. Here, we investigate whether metacognition and emotion regulation are related to student’s subjective academic and personal wellbeing, in a sample of 134 students (59 male, 75 female) aged 12-14 years (M = 12.88 years, SD = 0.67 years) in the early years of Australian secondary school. This study was cross-sectional, and data were collected in 2022/2023.  Participants completed a series of computer-based tasks and questionnaires designed to capture metacognition, emotion regulation, executive functions (working memory, attention control and cognitive flexibility) and wellbeing (academic wellbeing and personal wellbeing). Both metacognition and emotion regulation made significant and distinct contributions to adolescents’ academic and personal wellbeing, with metacognition playing a larger role in academic wellbeing and emotion regulation making larger contributions to personal wellbeing. Of import, the contributions of metacognition and emotion regulation to wellbeing were observed after accounting for underlying individual differences in executive functions. These findings suggest that improving both metacognition and emotion regulation during early adolescence could have positive impacts on student wellbeing, regardless of differences in students’ underlying abilities.",

          "authors": "Megan Elizabeth Schultz; Jonas Dora; Kevin Michael King",
          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol expectancy theory proposes that beliefs about drinking motivate or deter drinking. Although expectancies influence drinking, less is known about how the consequences of drinking influence expectancies. We modeled a feedback conceptualization of how the experience of specific consequences influenced people’s beliefs about how likely a consequence will occur (i.e., likelihoods) and how positive the consequence will be (i.e., valences). Method: We re-analyzed cross-sectional data from college drinkers (n = 504), using Bayesian cross-classified multilevel ordinal regressions to estimate associations between consequences, likelihoods, and valences. We performed a preregistered replication in new data (n = 362). Results: Participants had higher likelihoods (95% CIStudy 1 = [2.06, 2.43], 95% CIStudy 2 = [1.75, 2.12]) and valences (95% CIStudy 1 = [0.28, 0.52], 95% CIStudy 2 = [0.33, 0.60]) when they had experienced consequences more often, but these associations leveled off at higher consequence frequencies. Participants also believed consequences to be more likely when they viewed them as more positive, and vice versa, and again, these associations leveled off at higher levels of the predictor. Critically, the strength of these associations varied across both people and consequences. Conclusions: Experiencing specific consequences more often was related to people judging them to be more likely and more positive in the future, aligning with alcohol expectancy theory. This may lead to experiencing negative consequences repeatedly because people are not being demotivated from drinking in the same fashion. Given the person and consequence level variability, clinicians should consider an individualized approach when targeting drinking consequences.  \n\nKeywords: alcohol, college drinking, expectancies, consequences",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment is associated with a higher risk for developing psychological disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER) has been implicated as a neurocognitive mechanism linking adverse childhood experiences to an increased risk for psychopathological outcomes. \nObjective: This preregistered study investigated the relation between childhood maltreatment and different aspects of ER, including implementation capacity and effort as well as tendency and flexibility in strategy selection.\nMethods: In a non-clinical adult sample (N = 227), childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In two experimental ER tasks, participants viewed pictures of varying emotional intensity while applying one of three ER strategies (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) or without any active regulation. The ER implementation task allowed to assess emotion reactivity, implementation capacity, and subjective effort for ER. The ER selection task allowed to assess tendency and flexibility in strategy selection. \nResults: Childhood maltreatment was associated with a lower capacity to implement reappraisal (r = -.12), a stronger tendency to choose suppression (r = .15), and lower flexibility in ER strategy selection (r = -.12). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant association to experimentally assessed emotion reactivity or subjective effort exerted on ER.\nConclusions: We show that people with childhood maltreatment experiences do not only choose suppression more frequently but seem to have a deficit in flexibly adjusting strategy selection to context factors, e.g., stimulus intensity. This can be interpreted as an important factor rendering emotion regulation less adaptive in a clinical sense.",

          "abstract": "Recent geopolitical events have exposed critical gaps in the ability of peace and conflict psychology (PCP) to engage with conflicts beyond intractable or post-war contexts. This paper introduces the concept of \"naïve pacifism\" to describe underlying assumptions in PCP that hinder its ability to address complex modern conflicts effectively. Three pillars of naïve pacifism are identified: (1) the homeostatic view of peace as the natural state and violence as a dysfunction, (2) the belief in the reactive nature of violence, and (3) a perspectivist approach that overlooks objective features of conflicts. These assumptions lead PCP researchers to oversimplify, perpetuate pseudoscientific views of and promote ineffective interventions to solve violent conflicts. By challenging these pillars and proposing a more nuanced framework, this paper aims to advance PCP toward a true science of peace-making that is better equipped to address contemporary global conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Once children learn category-relevant traits and characteristics, they must automatically apply them to people to navigate social interactions. Yet, how social categorization becomes automatic is not entirely clear. The present work tests whether and how priming conceptual knowledge of social categories might influence the efficiency of social categorization across development. Children (N = 223; Mage = 7.24, SDage = 2.51; 132 girls, 90 boys; 50.26% racially minoritized; 49.74% White) were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words and then gender-categorized racially diverse faces under a time constraint. Priming concepts of social categories delayed categorization for White children 6 years and younger. By 12 years, priming categories facilitated White children’s automatic categorizations. Conceptual priming did not affect the efficiency of racially minoritized children’s social categorizations. Top-down information then contributes to how social categorization becomes efficient, but children’s identity influences what information they use to inform categorizations.",

          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2024) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

          "abstract": "Construal level has been shown to influence economic decisions, affecting both risk perception and risk-taking. However, there has been some inconsistency as to the exact effects of high/low construal on economic decisions, with some findings suggesting that construal might interact with cognitive load and self-control in a risk-taking context. In two experiments, the current paper examines behavioural and neurological (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy) responses to high and low construal manipulations during and economic decision task, under experimentally-induced cognitive load. We also examine the how construal interacts with self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy to predict lateral pre-frontal cortex (LPFC) activation during these decisions. Some of the behavioural results supported previous findings that under cognitive load, high construal prompts risk aversion. Neurological data supported the theory that construal promotes risk sensitivity. Self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy were all found to interact with construal in predicting LPFC activation during decision-making. These findings extend our understanding of how construal effects economic decisions under cognitive load while also providing new insights into how self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy might interact with construal in this context.",

          "abstract": "Objectivity has long been touted as a virtue in science, and certain statistical (e.g., null hypothesis significance testing) and scientific methods have been championed as means for obtaining objectivity. One way in which objectivity has been championed is through the use of universal statistical significance tests, where researchers conclude results are statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. While such objective criteria may improve communication and increase consensus, it does so at a cost. Specifically, objective criteria (such as p value threshholds) provide a means whereby poor quality studies can pass publication filters, they stifle creativity, and they thwart the self-correcting mechanisms of the scientific process. In this paper, I argue in favor of embracing ambiguity, either by allowing scientists to define their own criteria for statistical significance or by allowing researchers to refrain from making any decisions of statistical significance entirely. While allowing researchers to set their own decision criteria will inevitably lead to disagreements and a lack of consensus, it will only do so when evidence is weak. This is exactly as it should be, as disagreement should be welcomed in cases of interpretive ambiguity.. I conclude this paper by giving practical recommendations about how researchers might develop their own decision criteria using metrics relevant to their variables of interest.",

Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors’ judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors’ judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.",

In this study, we investigated how exclusive victimhood was related to geopolitical attitudes in Hungary and Serbia. The study involved Serbian (N = 630) and Hungarian (N = 471) adult national samples stratified by gender, age, political orientation, and place of residence. As expected, exclusive victimhood predicted higher support for a geopolitical shift from the West (i.e., EU and US) to the East (i.e., Russia and China) via Euroscepticism in both samples. In Serbia, the strongest indirect effect was observed among participants with neutral attitudes towards the war in Ukraine. In Hungary, there was no expected moderated mediation while the direct effect of exclusive victimhood on the West-to-East geopolitical shift was largest for pro-Russian participants and non-significant for pro-Ukrainian participants. Different measures of ethnic identity showed no expected moderation effect, but an exploratory analysis revealed that exclusive victimhood partially mediated the relationship between identity measures (superiority and attachment) and support for a pro-Eastern (vs. pro-Western) geopolitical orientation. We discuss how the construals of the past based on exclusive victimhood shape future geopolitical preferences of the public in Hungary and Serbia.",

The aim of this study is to replicate the findings of controlled research by examining the effects of ISTDP in the treatment of depression in a large naturalistic sample, and also to explore the mediating role of unlocking the unconscious in this treatment. Healthcare costs were also explored. Data were collected from a naturalistic study conducted at the Centre for Emotions and Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, between 1999 and 2007. A sample of 195 patients' self-reported levels of depression, measured by the depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and interpersonal problems, measured by the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32 (IIP-32), were analyzed using mixed-effects models. The analysis revealed a significant and large effect of ISTDP on both depression (within-group Cohen's d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.75, 1.26]) and interpersonal problems (within-group Cohen's d = 1.17, 95% CI [0.89, 1.46]). The process of unlocking the unconscious emerged as a significant mediator of treatment outcomes for both depression (between-group Cohen’s d = 0.60, 95% CI [0.16, 1.07]) and interpersonal problems (between-group Cohen’s d = 0.47, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.95]). Reductions in costs regarding physician (p = 0.07) and hospital costs (p &lt; 0.05) were observed.

The aim of this study is to replicate the findings of controlled research by examining the effects of ISTDP in the treatment of depression in a large naturalistic sample, and also to explore the mediating role of unlocking the unconscious in this treatment. Healthcare costs were also explored. Data were collected from a naturalistic study conducted at the Centre for Emotions and Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, between 1999 and 2007. A sample of 195 patients' self-reported levels of depression, measured by the depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and interpersonal problems, measured by the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32 (IIP-32), were analyzed using mixed-effects models. The analysis revealed a significant and large effect of ISTDP on both depression (within-group Cohen's d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.75, 1.26]) and interpersonal problems (within-group Cohen's d = 1.17, 95% CI [0.89, 1.46]). The process of unlocking the unconscious emerged as a significant mediator of treatment outcomes for both depression (between-group Cohen’s d = 0.60, 95% CI [0.16, 1.07]) and interpersonal problems (between-group Cohen’s d = 0.47, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.95]). Reductions in costs regarding physician (p = 0.07) and hospital costs (p &lt; 0.05) were observed. These findings support the efficacy of ISTDP in treating depression and highlight the importance of unlocking the unconscious among patients with depression.",

          "abstract": "Confidence is increasingly viewed as a barrier to recognizing misinformation, as people who are more confident tend to be more likely to believe and share false news. Here, we challenge this view by distinguishing between two types of confidence: general confidence in one’s abilities, and specific confidence in a particular judgment. Using a large, pre-registered study in which participants judge the accuracy of news posts, we demonstrate a striking dissociation between these two forms of confidence. While higher general confidence is associated with worse discernment of true versus false headlines (in line with past work), we find that higher confidence in specific judgments is associated with better truth discernment - a finding that we observe among both Democrats and Republicans. These results call for a reevaluation of the role of confidence in the detection of misinformation. Focusing on confidence in specific judgments, rather than general abilities, could play an important role in helping to mitigate belief in misinformation.",

          "abstract": "Empathic concern promotes prosocial behavior, but the effect of empathy is not the same for everyone. Scholars have extensively mapped the situational and personality factors that modulate the empathy-helping relationship, but only a few studies have examined the cognitive processes that link empathy with helping. Lockwood et al. (2016) found that individual differences in online simulation (the deliberate intention to imagine what another person is feeling) were associated with individual differences in the rates at which people learned how to benefit an anonymous other person in a two-armed bandit task (which we term prosocial learning). Across three experiments (N = 1,188), we critically tested and extended this finding by asking participants to learn on behalf of real people in need. Causal manipulations of empathy and social evaluation had no effect upon prosocial learning, and we could not replicate the finding that online simulation was associated with learning. Although each individual experiment provided only mixed evidence for the hypothesis that empathic concern is associated with prosocial learning, a mega-analysis that included data from all three experiments revealed that both state and trait empathic concern shared a small but significant association with prosocial learning. We discuss our results in light of problems with the methods that researchers commonly use to test the association between performance on prosocial learning tasks and individual differences in empathy",

Long-term visual memory is perhaps entirely categorical, while at the shortest latencies visual iconic memory shows signs of pictorial or imagistic structure. In this study we aimed to distinguish these two forms of memory structure, demonstrating differences in long and short term memory using similar stimuli. We confirm earlier results showing that long-term memory relies on the categorical content evoked by seeing scenes, using a standard study-and-test paradigm. With the same paradigm we show that short-term memory seems unaffected by the subtraction of high-level categorical content, implicating pre-categorical structure in memory. With the same stimuli we carry out a discrimination task, with the results suggesting that this pre-categorical structure may be explicitly spatial, the stuff of iconic memory and online vision.",

          "abstract": "The present study addresses a fundamental yet largely neglected question about personality development: To what extent are changes in parent personality traits associated with changes in their child's personality traits? Numerous developmental processes suggest that parent and child personality might have transactional associations over time, contributing to their co-development. This co-development may be homotypic (e.g., associations between changes in Parent and changes in Child Conscientiousness) and heterotypic (e.g., associations between changes in Parent Conscientiousness and changes in Child Extraversion). In addition to investigating the extent to which parent and child personality co-develops, we also investigated the extent to which parental (mother and father) personality co-develops. We tested these ideas using bivariate growth curve models of personality trait assessments from a 17-year longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin families. Intercepts of parent and child trait trajectories were generally correlated, but we did not find significant correlations between the slopes, contrary to our expectation of parent-child co-development. We found stronger evidence for co-development in mom-dad dyads, with significant slope-slope correlations for Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness. In almost all cases, these findings generalized across child gender, child nativity, and parental age. We discuss the implications of the findings for adolescent personality development.",

          "abstract": "The Bland-Altman repeated-measures correlation (rmcorr) is widely used to estimate within-person correlations between two variables in repeated-measures data. However, it assumes the same slope for all subjects, which can be misleading when slopes vary. To propose an alternative method, the weighted mean within-person correlation (wmcorr), which calculates the average of all within-person correlations, weighted by the square root of the number of observations for each person. The wmcorr method was applied to real data examples and compared to the Bland-Altman rmcorr. Simulations (5,000) were run to compare the mean significance levels (p-values) of rmcorr and wmcorr and to determine the relationship between estimated rmcorrs and wmcorrs. In most cases, rmcorr and wmcorr yielded similar results. However, in cases where subjects had at least moderately varying slopes, wmcorr provided a more visually intuitive estimate of the within-person correlation. Conflicting significance levels or opposite directions of rmcorr and wmcorr served as \"warning signs\" for potential data quality issues or the need for further data collection. The wmcorr method is proposed as an alternative to the Bland-Altman rmcorr for estimating within-person correlations in repeated-measures data. Researchers are encouraged to estimate both wmcorr and rmcorr, as discrepancies between the two can alert researchers to data patterns that warrant closer inspection before drawing conclusions about within-person relationships.",

The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

          "abstract": "Network psychometric models have emerged as an alternative to latent variable frameworks for conceptualizing psychological phenotypes. Despite their growing popularity, the formalization of network models as a measurement model has been largely unexplored. Recent efforts have integrated network models within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, but no standalone framework exists to specify network models as a measurement model, particularly with consideration of dimensions. This paper introduces the Exploratory Graph Model (EGM), a mathematical framework that formalizes networks as a measurement model that includes community structures where dimensions arise from the mutual interactions between observed variables rather than caused by latent constructs. After formalizing the model, a data generation approach is parameterized and a Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to demonstrate the differences in parameter estimates between EGM and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) when data are generated from EGM and latent factor models. We further explore whether the data generating model can be determined based on traditional SEM and likelihood statistics. An empirical example is presented to showcase how EGM can be applied and compared against EFA and alternative EGM structures. EGM broadens traditional views on how psychological phenotypes can be conceptualized, providing a network-based understanding of psychological measurement.",

In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults. These findings show that changes in cognitive control subcomponents follow different onsets and trajectories, highlighting the importance of including them in cognitive aging research.

          "abstract": "Background. The experience sampling method (ESM), also known as ecological momentary assessment, is gaining popularity in physical activity research. This method involves assessing participants’ behaviors and experiences repeatedly over time. One key advantage of ESM is its ability to temporally separate the dependent and independent variable of interest, reducing the risk of reverse causality. However, temporal separation alone is insufficient for establishing causality. This methodology paper illustrates the importance of the identification phase in drawing causal conclusions from ESM data. In the identification phase the causal effect of interest (or estimand) is specified and the assumptions under which a statistical association can be considered as causal are identified. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) visualize these assumptions by displaying the assumed causal structure between the independent variable, the dependent variable and other related variables. Methods. The Methods section demonstrates how to construct an estimand and develop a DAG for a specific research question in an ESM study. Results. In the Results section, we describe how confounding bias revealed by the DAG can be addressed by modifying ESM study design or data-analysis. Each step is illustrated with an example from the field of physical activity research. Conclusions. Implementing the identification phase before conducting data analysis enables ESM researchers to make more informed decisions, thereby enhancing the validity of causal inferences in studies aimed at answering causal questions.",

          "abstract": "Virtue theory is a natural approach towards the design of artificially intelligent systems, given that the design of artificial intelligence essentially aims at designing agents with excellent dispositions. This has led to a lively research programme to develop artificial virtues. However, this research programme has until now had a narrow focus on moral virtues in an Aristotelian mould. While Aristotelian moral virtue has played a foundational role for the field, it unduly constrains the possibilities of virtue theory for artificial intelligence. This paper aims to remedy this limitation. Philosophers have developed a rich tradition investigating virtues, their normative domains and their structure. Drawing on this tradition, I propose a three-dimensional classification system of possible artificial virtues: virtues can be classified according to the domain in which virtue is an excellence, norm which makes a virtue an excellence, and mode how the virtue delivers the excellence. With this framework, we can discern gaps in the current theorising about artificial virtues. Additionally, it gives us a tool to evaluate the competences of extant artificially intelligent systems.",

          "authors": "Isabella Stallworthy; Meriah Lee DeJoseph; Marion I. van den Heuvel; Daniel Berry; Willem Frankenhuis",
          "abstract": "Frameworks are widespread in developmental psychology. They offer general ideas about what to study in human development: which concepts to focus on (e.g., systems, trade-offs), which processes to test (e.g., micro-macro, bidirectional), and which methods to use (e.g., interview, equations). However, despite their prominence, there exists very little consensus or guidance on how to use them in research. As such, frameworks have an obscure role: they influence our research questions, methods, and theory, but often in ways we cannot articulate for ourselves, let alone for others. This paper presents a practical guide for leveraging frameworks to improve developmental research. We suggest that frameworks can guide us through a research project’s “map of conceptual terrain”: which questions to ask and how to study them. We first classify these considerations into topic areas (i.e., “regions”), including assumptions and ideas about timescales and processes of developmental change. We then offer a strategy for charting a “path” through these regions, creating chains of logic to make increasingly specific claims and choices, from framework to research practice. As an illustrative example, we use Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological framework to study parent-child relationships, highlighting its affordances and limitations. We also draw contrast with other prominent frameworks, showcasing how different frameworks can alter a researcher’s path. Our proposed explicit and systematic use of frameworks can serve as a powerful navigation system for building and refining research programs. Thus, our paper provides a guide for developmental scientists to more explicitly use and capitalize on frameworks in their empirical research.",

We propose future research to incorporate placebo controls to examine the efficacy of PM4M and dismantling designs to identify the specific treatment components responsible for its benefits, as well as explore the potential for digital, self-help versions of PM4M to enhance scalability. Additionally, we recommend examining the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on intervention outcomes to better tailor PM4M for diverse populations.

We investigated VWM for natural scene stimuli by measuring VWM performance as a function of both encoding time and cognitive load level, employing a method that approximates everyday natural vision.  VWM performance was compared between (a) scenes containing either full chromatic and luminance information, (b) luminance-only (isochromatic) information and (c) chromatic-only (isoluminant) information.  VWM performance was also measured for scenes in which the scene’s structure had been destroyed by Fourier phase scrambling, or following removal of either the high or low spatial frequencies.  It was found that recall ability for isoluminance scenes was relatively poor, as it was also for the phase scrambled scenes with high cognitive load or short encoding time. However, recall ability was similar for the full colour (i.e., chromatic and luminance information combined) and luminance-only scenes, except for very brief presentation times where performance for the luminance-only scenes was worse.  These findings suggest that spatial scene structure is important for good VWM performance, and for very brief presentations there is a particular reliance on chromatic information.",

          "abstract": "Post-error slowing, described as an error-corrective index of response binding during motor sequence learning, has only been demonstrated in the serial reaction time task under conditions where extrinsic error feedback is presented. The present experiment investigated whether post-error slowing is dependent on, or is influenced by, extrinsic error feedback. Thirty participants (14 females, Mage = 21.9  1.8 years) completed the serial reaction time task with or without presentation of extrinsic error feedback.  Post-error slowing was observed following response error whether feedback was presented or not. However, presentation of extrinsic error feedback increased post-error slowing across practice and extended the number of responses that were slowed following an error.  There was no evidence of feedback effects on motor sequence learning or explicit awareness.  Instead, feedback appeared to function as a performance factor that reduced response error rates relative to no feedback conditions.  These findings illustrate that post-error slowing in motor sequence learning is not reliant on or a result of presentation of extrinsic error information.  More specific to the serial reaction time task paradigm, the present findings demonstrate that the common practice of presenting error feedback is not necessary for investigating motor sequence learning unless the aim is to maintain low error rate. However, doing so might inflate reaction time in latter training blocks.",

Here we test the implications of theories of cognitive development by studying a sample of 464 individuals who suffered focal cortical lesion in childhood to either the right frontal or right temporal lobes. Children had follow-up cognitive assessments done 8.5 years later. The key findings showed sustained long-term deficits in fluid abilities, but no developmental cascade of a reduction in abilities over time. Suffering a lesion to the right frontal cortex, despite causing a drop in fluid or abstract intelligence, does not transfer over to crystallized or knowledge-based abilities over development. The implication is that there is no transfer between these abilities when an exogeneous change affects early fluid ability. These results can be seen as powerful for testing developmental theories of cognition against their causal assumptions.",

          "authors": "Joseph Coffey; Elizabeth Spelke",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing interest in field research using randomized designs to evaluate the impacts of diverse interventions on early child development and education. Measuring these impacts requires assessments that can track development prior to school entry. We propose a novel approach using research from developmental cognitive science: targeting five areas of core knowledge—language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, mental state reasoning, and executive function—that have been found to emerge across cultures in infancy and predict later performance on related skills in adulthood. Using tasks based on experimental paradigms developed in lab settings, we tested 1256 Ghanaian children (centering on four age groups at 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 years), whose parent previously took part in a randomized controlled field experiment on secondary education. Here we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these tasks. We ask whether these core knowledge tasks 1) produce responses from Ghanaian children that are internally consistent and above chance, 2) relate to performance on other similar tasks within the same cognitive domain, and 3) are stable over time and predict future performance. We find that the assessment battery captures individual differences in the older tested age groups (3.5 years and above), in the domains of language, numeracy, spatial reasoning, and executive functioning, but not for infants or for tests of mental state reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that experimental methods designed to study core knowledge in infancy can be used track individual differences in children’s cognitive development.",

Participants included 102 adults with FA from diverse national, ethnic, and racial backgrounds who completed validated measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), health-related quality of life, FA characteristics, personal factors, and social factors. When compared to population norms, adults with FA had significantly poorer health-related quality of life on all domains measured, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical function, sleep disturbance, social participation, pain, and cognitive function. Results showed 50% of participants had probable PTSD, 33% had probable anxiety, and 25% had probable depression. Hierarchical regressions indicated protective/risk factors for anxiety, depression, and PTSD included stigma, disability self-efficacy, fatigue, concern with death and dying, and post-traumatic growth. Adults with FA have high rates of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Just as people with FA should receive regular cancer screenings, they should also be screened for mental health symptoms.",

This paper introduces mlmpower, an R package designed to simplify Monte Carlo power analysis for multilevel models. The package accommodates various model specifications, including cross-level interactions, random slopes, and within-cluster and between-cluster predictors. Unlike other methods, which often require a pilot study or extensive prior data, mlmpower uses intuitive effect size metrics to simulate data and estimate power with confidence intervals. Inspired by ggplot2, the package's syntax allows for modular model building, making it accessible even to researchers with minimal simulation experience. Additionally, mlmpower supports including missing data mechanisms, offering more realistic power estimates for longitudinal and cross-sectional studies.",

          "authors": "Haena Kim; Alicia Liu; Yuan Chang Leong",
          "abstract": "Perceptual judgments are often influenced by goals and preferences, resulting in biased judgements that deviate from objective reality. When presented with ambiguous images, observers are biased to report seeing images associated with rewards. However, it remains unclear whether this is driven by a bias toward stimuli that people are motivated to see (i.e., desirability) or stimuli that are motivationally significant (i.e., relevance). As rewards are both desirable and motivationally relevant, these effects are not easily dissociated in a reward context. This study investigates the effects of desirability and relevance on perceptual judgments in an aversive context involving financial losses. Across two experiments conducted between 2023-2024, participants completed a visual categorization task where ambiguous stimuli were associated with a large financial loss. Participants’ perceptual judgments were biased away from stimuli associated with the loss, indicating a desirability bias. Drift diffusion model analyses revealed that this bias was due to a shift in the starting point of evidence accumulation, such that participants required more evidence to commit to a response associated with an undesirable outcome. The bias in starting point correlated with individual differences in punishment sensitivity but not reward sensitivity, highlighting how individual traits shape motivational effects on perceptual decisions. Results replicated across an in-lab sample and a larger online sample. Altogether, our study provides robust evidence of a desirability bias in perceptual decisions involving financial losses, identifying both the computational mechanisms and trait-level differences that influence how people decide what they see when faced with the prospect of undesirable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Long COVID remains a pressing health concern among Americans, with current data suggesting that 45% of those infected by COVID-19 experience at least one symptom of Long COVID. Veterans are a particularly at-risk population due to their unique demographic characteristics and lived experiences. Despite this, there has been a lack of treatment development for Long COVID that targets mental health symptoms and is veteran-specific. There is a need for effective treatments to help veterans cope with a Long COVID diagnosis and recovery. This quality improvement project aims to gain insight into the lived experiences and mental health needs of veterans with Long COVID to help inform future treatment development. A sample of 21 veterans (57% Male, 67% Black, 43% Hispanic) participated in qualitative interviews where they were asked 23 questions about their experiences living with Long COVID and seeking medical treatment, as well as their ongoing mental health needs. Qualitative data was extracted from these interviews and analyzed. Four main themes were identified: interpersonal concerns and challenges with social interaction; difficulties with day-to-day living; barriers and facilitators to accessing medical treatment; and mental health effects and attitudes towards psychotherapy. Veterans described significant impairments in functioning, as well as feelings of isolation and loneliness. These findings demonstrate the need for a psychotherapeutic intervention that can facilitate interpersonal connection, improve functioning, and decrease psychiatric symptoms.",

In an online survey, mental health professionals rated their agreement with propositions of the network theory and evaluated the acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications. The 257 participating mental health professionals largely agreed with the network theory’s proposition regarding the phenomenology of mental disorders and regarding treatment effects. Appraisal of the network theory regarding the aetiology, regarding important treatment targets and regarding acceptability and appropriateness of possible applications was mixed. A background in cognitive behavioural therapy, and previous knowledge of the network theory were positively associated with agreement.

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge has long been known to influence retention of newly learned information. In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations between concepts: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. We hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from their dominance in organizing episodic memory.",

Less well understood is how temperament traits co-develop from adolescence to young adulthood. We characterized how trajectories of effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness in adolescence to formed multi-trajectory groups. As these groups could provide novel information about pathways to psychopathology, we examined their associations with adulthood psychopathology and polygenic risk scores (PRS). Participants were drawn from a larger longitudinal cohort (N=1412). Effortful control, frustration, affiliation, and shyness were measured four times from ages 10-23. Adulthood internalizing, externalizing, and alcohol problems were measured at ages 24-27. PRS with continuous shrinkage priors were calculated. Group-based multi-trajectory analyses showed a five-group model fit best, including high-risk, undercontrolled, low-risk, overcontrolled, and low affiliation groups that differed on both the levels and slopes of temperament traits over time. We found specific linkages between the low affiliation group and problematic alcohol use, the high-risk group and depression symptoms, and the high-risk and undercontrolled groups with externalizing problems. The undercontrolled group showed the highest, and overcontrolled the lowest, externalizing PRS scores. Findings shed light on developmental patterns of temperament in adolescence-to-adulthood and unique combinations of temperament trajectories with specific linkages to etiologic factors and psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Despite the last decade’s development of optogenetic methods for artificially manipulating engrams, and subsequent claims that there is a consensus that memories are stored in ensembles of synaptic connections, it remains unclear to what degree there truly is unanimity within the neuroscientific community about the neurophysiological basis of long-term memory. We surveyed 312 neuroscientists, comprising one cohort of experts on engram research and another of general neuroscientists, to assess this community’s views on how memories are stored. While 70.5% of participants agreed that long-term memories are primarily maintained by neuronal connectivity patterns and synaptic strengths, there was no clear consensus on which specific neurophysiological features or scales are critical for memory storage. Despite this, the median probability estimate that any long-term memories could potentially be extracted from a static snapshot of brain structure was around 40%, which was also the estimate for whether a successful whole brain emulation could theoretically be created from the structure of a preserved brain. When predicting the future feasibility of whole brain emulation, the median participant estimated this would be achieved for C. elegans around 2045, mice around 2065, and humans around 2125. Notably, neither research background nor expertise level significantly influenced views on whether memories could be extracted from brain structure alone. Our findings suggest that while most neuroscientists believe memories are stored in structural features of the brain, fundamental questions about the precise physical basis of memory storage remain unresolved. These findings have important implications for both theoretical neuroscience and the development of technologies aimed at preserving or extracting memory-related information.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study aims at improving dropout and treatment non-response prevention by optimizing the performance of models for their prediction through the integration of item-level data. Method: Routine data from 1277 patients (M = 36.95, SD = 13.64; 64.77% female) treated at [masked version] was used to train and evaluate 20 machine-learning algorithms. Measures included sociodemographic information, Outcome Questionnaire-30 (OQ-30), Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Psychotherapy (FEP–2), Emotional Well-Being Questionnaire (EMO), Symptom Checklist (SCL–90–R), and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). Model training was conducted using nested cross-validation, and five ensemble models were formed to enhance predictions by combining algorithms based on performance and correlation metrics. Final predictions were evaluated in a holdout sample, with predictor scores at total, item, and combined levels. Results: A model using item-level data achieved the highest performance for dropout prediction (F1-score = 0.87, Brier score = 0.0529, balanced accuracy = 0.88) in a holdout sample. For treatment non-response, an ensemble model trained on item-level data provided the best results (F1-score = 0.60, Brier score = 0.1646, balanced accuracy = 0.72). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the clinical value of using item-level data to enhance predictive modeling for dropout and treatment non-response. Integrating such models into clinical feedback systems could help identify at-risk patients and reduce dropout and non–response rates.\nKeywords: dropout, treatment non-response, prevention, machine learning, prediction.",

This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

Modifications to the sound processing strategy could improve the transmission of information by the cochlear implant, alleviating speech perception difficulties in noise. One such modification, the temporal integrator processing strategy (TIPS), uses a model of temporal masking to identify and remove stimulation pulses that are unlikely to be perceived. In a previous investigation, TIPS significantly improved the perception of CIS-processed speech in the presence of speech-shaped noise (Lamping et al. 2020). This study extends the previous investigation to include conditions that better reflect everyday listening through two pre-registered double-blind within-participant experiments. The first experiment tested speech perception with CIS and TIPS and found that speech intelligibility in speech-shaped and multi-talker noise was unaffected by TIPS processing, although TIPS-processed stimuli achieved slightly lower quality ratings than their CIS counterparts in quiet (p = 0.044). The second experiment compared TIPS to ACE and found that both speech intelligibility in a multi-talker noise and speech quality ratings in quiet were unaffected by TIPS processing. Given that TIPS removes a substantial number of stimulation pulses, TIPS was estimated to result in net power savings between 22% and 42%, without compromising speech perception in the presence of background noise.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the movement against “progressive” prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovements efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and unusual opposition, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that unusual opposition disproportionately targets women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occurs in Republican-controlled states, and has nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that unusual opposition is a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

While much of this research has focused on nuclear families, less is known about patterns in stepfamilies. This study adopts a dyadic perspective to explore how parental partnership quality relates to the wellbeing of children living with both biological parents versus those with a biological parent and a stepparent. We apply multivariable linear regression and a mediation analysis on longitudinal data from the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) to understand the relationship between family structure, step- and biological parent’s partnership quality and children’s self-reported wellbeing, operationalised over the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ-scores). The analytical sample includes children who live in heterosexual couple households (n=1,781). We differentiate two separate dimensions of parental partnership quality, namely the frequency of conflict and esteem between the (step-)parents. Results show that children living with a stepparent exhibit higher total difficulties score compared to children living with both their biological parents. However, parental conflict occurs less and esteem more frequently in stepfamilies than in nuclear families. Mediation analysis indicates that partnership quality partially mediates the impact of family structure on SDQ scores. Our analysis suggests that the negative effect of living with stepparents on children’s behavioural problems is slightly mitigated by increased parental esteem and lower conflict in these unions.",

          "authors": "Victor Caballero-Cordero; Daniel Oto-Peralías; Demetrio Carmona-Derqui",
          "abstract": "Street names are not neutral identifiers to navigate through cities but are charged with strong symbolic connotations and reflect power relations within society. A growing body of geographic scholarship documents a strong gender bias in the urban namespace, where women only represent a small fraction of streets named after people. This article investigates whether the lack of women in political decision-making roles contributes to explaining their marginalization in urban toponyms. More specifically, we study the impact of the gender and ideology of town mayors on their decisions to commemorate women in the street map. Focusing on the universe of Spanish towns during the period 2001-2023, we find through fixed effects panel data models and regression discontinuity design that the mayor’s gender does not affect the percentage of female-named streets, while the ideology of the governing party does. Our findings thus indicate that it is ideology rather than gender what shapes politicians’ preferences regarding the commemoration of women in the street map. We argue that this is because, on the one hand, strong political parties can impose their agenda on local leaders, making irrelevant differences in their gender and, on the other, the ideological cleavage is more relevant than the gender one to account for differences in attitudes towards symbolic gender policies. A natural implication of our results is that simply having more female politicians will hardly suffice to address the gender gap in street names and in other symbolically charged policies.",

          "abstract": "Decisions made by millions of refugees about where to go, how to make a living and how to secure a future are fundamental drivers of secondary movements. While a substantial body of literature addresses factors contributing to migrants’ decision-making, a comprehensive understanding of the central role of refugees in secondary mobility decision-making, including agency and strategies employed, remains underexplored. This is partly due to the belief that refugees are constrained by external and structural factors and cannot exercise agency, which we challenge. This article provides a systematic analysis of the literature on refugees’ secondary mobility decision-making processes. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology, it presents an in-depth analysis of 40 peer?reviewed, English-language research articles selected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases published before September 2022. The article critically examines the drivers, prevailing dichotomies and conceptual frameworks surrounding refugee categorization, agency, and mobility. By synthesizing a wide range of literature, our paper presents emerging alternative concepts and \nframeworks that shed light on the complex dynamics of decision-making",

          "abstract": "This study investigates factors driving attitudes towards voluntary return intentions among Ukrainian displaced people. Using a vignette experiment (N = 384; Observations = 1,102) to manipulate home country conditions, we find that, as expected, the most crucial driver for return intention is the presence of peace in the home country.  Conversely, economic and social conditions commonly outlined in the general migration literature have little to no effect on return intentions of forcibly replaced individuals. However, we also demonstrate that not all forms of peace are equally convincing; a \"punishing\" peace, associated with significant territorial loss, resembles an ongoing state of war and thus discouraging refugees from returning. Similarly, while peace itself does improve return intentions, so does greater integration into the international community. Our paper thus demonstrates that the conditions facilitating return are more nuanced than commonly discussed, and that not all forms of peace are seen as equal.",

          "authors": "Matthew J. A. Craig",
          "abstract": "Many social media platforms today are driven by content filtering algorithms that personalize their recommendations based on the individual user. Through nuanced interactions with the platform, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can greatly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users show to dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still engage in disclosure of private information with the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine to what extent social media users (N = 1,305) allow co-ownership of private information with their algorithm depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ algorithmic literacy significantly predicts their willingness to allow co-ownership of private information with social media algorithms. Additionally, contrary to previous literature, greater algorithmic awareness leads to less co-ownership for those most fatigued. Considering these findings, implications for future research for human-machine communication privacy management are discussed.",

We develop a game-theoretic model where an interest group can lobby a politician while learning about their ideological alignment. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff: interest groups must balance gathering information against exerting immediate influence, while politicians strategically manage their reputations to shape future interactions. These strategic forces generate systematic dynamics: policies and transfers shift in tandem, with early-career politicians showing greater policy variance and extracting larger rents through reputation management than veterans. Uncertainty about alignment increases policy volatility as groups experiment with offers, while institutional features like committee power and revolving-door incentives systematically alter both learning incentives and influence strategies. Our results shed new light on how interest group influence evolves across political careers and varies with institutional context.",

          "abstract": "This exploratory qualitative study uses a multilevel framework, combining the Social Construction of Technology and the Cognitive-Affective-Normative model, to examine how individual perceptions, emotions, and reflections shape deepfake acceptance, particularly those featuring deceased artists. Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise.

After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

Data from interviews, focus group discussions, student reflections and program blogposts were collected and coded to confirm understanding from the storybooks. Results show that in 12 of the books, the young authors had introduced protagonists, supporting characters or minor characters inspired by the environmental educators and activists they had interacted with.  These characters were adults who were different from the other adults in the storybooks. They were first and foremost, Indian, were kind &amp; caring, were experts who taught in child-friendly &amp; democratic ways and created a proto-conscientization in the other characters in the books. This proto-conscientization included an understanding of systems of power and oppression which then fuelled political or community based action by the characters in the books.

The study suggests that the combined use of Lesson Study and the CCM approach, supported by the UDL framework, fosters effective inclusive teaching practices that address the diverse needs of all students within inclusive educational settings. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the intentional integration of CCM approach and UDL as facilitative conceptual frameworks, alongside using Lesson Study as an iterative process for professional development, establishes the conditions necessary for inclusive education to flourish.",

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm and a theoretical framework jointly identified abnormal behaviour, revealing that 11.25% of users exhibited confirmed inorganic behaviour. This indicates coordinated inauthentic behaviour, a common feature of disinformation campaigns, though the study does not explore any direct connection to RT or the Russian government. Methodologically, the study advances by analysing retweets instead of hashtags and corroborating results through machine learning.

It provides an overview of recent advancements, outlines possible future scenarios, and examines the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces to the field. Opportunities include substantial gains in productivity across the research process: notably in data analysis, visualisation, and dissemination. Researchers could thus spend more time focusing on research and less time on administrative or repetitive tasks. Other opportunities include using AI algorithms to analyse the increasing vastness of data obtained in surveys; using AI to improve prediction; and efficiency gains in survey or experimental design/deployment. Challenges include the potential for a vast increase in low-quality publications, especially if academic incentives remain misaligned toward quantity rather than quality of research outputs, as well as the broader existential risks AI may pose. We also include a list of resources and additional reading. This brief was written jointly by the authors; readers can compare with briefs entirely written by Generative AI (GenAI) systems, and listen to an AI generated podcast based on this brief here: https://osf.io/ew6z8/.

          "abstract": "A four-phase Hackathon of Educational Materials was constructed to enable instructors to take existing course materials and integrate, rather than concatenate, new content and activities. The \"integrate, not concatenate\" (InC) approach was pilot tested utilizing the Hackathon, with ethical reasoning content and activities to be integrated into courses in degree programs for mathematics, statistics, operations research, and data science in one undergraduate department. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials phases for ethical reasoning coverage were: Hack 1 (H1): Take published learning outcomes about ethical reasoning and choose one or more that would be feasible in your course; Hack 2 (H2): Utilizing the learning outcomes of your specific course, determine if any can be revised to include “ethics” ideas, and whether the syllabus communicates value for/importance of ethical practice; Hack 3 (H3): Determine where in the course (syllabus) the learning outcomes created in H1–H2 fit best; and Hack 4 (H4): Design or revise assignments that will inform learners and instructors about whether the new/hacked learning outcomes (H1-H3) were achieved. The InC Hackathon of Educational Materials was scheduled over 1- and 2-hour blocks over three days totaling 8 hours during one week. Real-time feedback was collected in terms of clarity and feasibility of each Hack, and after the end of the Hackathon. Originally planned for 4-5 instructors working on one course, 14 instructors participated in some or all portions of the Hackathon, working on integrating ethical reasoning content into seven courses within three academic programs. All participants identified ethical content to integrate and worked to ensure that their courses would integrate different material and activities. Courses in sequence within an academic program were also hacked to introduce ethical content early, and develop more sophistication in later courses. Each program was able to develop achievable learning objectives for ethics content in each of the courses, and these were sequenced to support student growth throughout their program. After the Hackathon, participants deemed it feasible and clear, and all participants achieved the objectives of Hacks 1-3, but there was insufficient time to complete the work in Hack 4. More time was felt and demonstrated to be needed, as well as orientation by leadership at the start.  Additional time at the end of the Hackathon should be dedicated to curriculum-wide alignment of the results of the hacks. This InC pilot was an empirical demonstration of a coherent, reproducible framework for making systemic and systematic changes to higher education curricula.",

This paper demonstrates how data science can be harnessed for social good by mapping the distribution of opportunity youth across different regions. We develop an Opportunity Youth Index by integrating fragmented data from sources such as the American Community Survey, the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, FBI Crime Data, and Bureau of Justice Statistics incarceration reports. Focusing on four key indicators—disconnected youth, youth in foster care, justice-impacted youth, and children with an incarcerated parent—we employ statistical methods and computational techniques to estimate local concentrations of opportunity youth. The resulting index provides insights for policymakers and community organizations, highlighting areas where targeted interventions can make the most impact. This work illustrates the potential of data science to address complex social issues and is presented in an accessible manner to engage a younger audience.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, attitudes toward mothers’ roles have become more gender-egalitarian. There has been a concurrent increase in early childhood education and care (ECEC) participation rates across Europe. However, inequality in ECEC usage has remained. The main reason for the inequality has been found to be problems with accessing the service but it is argued that attitudes toward mother’s role possible also play a role in it. This article examines the relationship between attitudes and ECEC usage at two points in time: 2008 and 2017. The article uses two data, EU-SILC and EVS, and the method multilevel logistic regression. The analysis considers both country-level and individual-level connections, reflecting on ECEC usage. The findings indicate an association between increasingly egalitarian attitudes and rising ECEC participation rates. As attitudes among less educated individuals change more slowly, their impact on ECEC usage could become more significant, particularly concerning inequality in ECEC usage. This is evident in the cross-level interaction between overall attitudes and mothers’ education in predicting ECEC participation among children under three years old. The disparity in ECEC usage between the less educated and those with higher levels of education is growing.",

          "abstract": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has established one of the most \ncomprehensive free movement regimes. By declaring West Africa a borderless region, the \norganisation affirms the right of free movement for all citizens of member states. Nevertheless, \nsignificant obstacles to securing this right persist, resulting in difficulties moving across the region. \nThese challenges are particularly prevalent for female migrants. Studies on free movement within \nWest Africa reveal that widespread corruption, border harassment, and bureaucratic inefficiencies \nseverely restrict female migration opportunities. However, current scholarship inadequately \naddresses the interrelation between regional mobility law, infrastructures, and female migration. This \narticle argues that a fundamental issue within the ECOWAS free movement regime is ensuring access \nto mobility infrastructures. It examines the gendered dimensions of access to mobility infrastructures \nfrom the perspective of ECOWAS officials. Mobility infrastructures are conceptualised as comprising \nlegal, physical, and technological components that collectively facilitate or restrict movement. The \nanalysis draws on documentary evidence and insights from 19 semi-structured interviews with \nECOWAS Commission officials. It shows that access to mobility infrastructures is predominantly \ndetermined by embedded gender norms, laws, and practices. By analysing accounts from officials \ninvolved in constructing the free movement regime, the article provides unique insights into the \ndisparities between institutional intentions, legal frameworks, and mobility trajectories. In doing so, \nit contributes to research on free movement in West Africa, mobility infrastructures, and the emerging scholarship on legal infrastructures.",

The findings indicate that, despite the significant impact of the digital divide, caused by multifaceted socioeconomic inequality, ICT education has largely failed to provide students with essential digital skills. This article emphasizes the need for an effective learning environment that prioritizes three interconnected dimensions: equal access, resources, and digital literacy. By examining the interplay between digital divides and the imperative of integrating e-learning into pedagogical strategies, this study contributes to the field of educational policy and technology. Ultimately, this article advocates a digitally inclusive and student-centred digital learning environment in the technology-poor setting of higher education in Bangladesh.",

          "abstract": "Although the organisational aspects of scholarly journals—such as the types of organisations responsible for publishing individual journals, whether independently or in collaboration—have significant implications for scholarly communication, they have received little focused research attention on a large scale. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of all WoS-indexed journals (N=21,886), focusing on the type of organisations that are officially attached to publishing the journals, either alone or together. We also investigate the disciplinary, geographical and linguistic diversity, and the key bibliometric characteristics, of journals (co)published by different types of organisations. By augmenting WoS metadata with a custom classification concerning organisational information about the journals publishing and governing organisations available through the International ISSN Centre, this study provides a larger and more detailed analysis than has been available so far. Our results show that 66% of journals are published by a sole organisation type (professional, research organisation, society), and 34% respectively are published through combinations of these different organisation types. The most common form of collaboration was a professional publisher with a scholarly society as the collaborative organisation.",

          "abstract": "Our starting point is to challenge the often-made assumption that large cities are so complex that they have become ungovernable or that globalization pressures make political and policy choices irrelevant. By going beyond rational or positivist views of governance, it argues that the process of governing a city is never fully complete, nor linear. The paper refers to a systematic review of the academic literature. Urban societies are more or less governed and that may change from one city to the next, from one period to the next. Processes of government and governance are always work in progress, but make crucial differences over time. Case studies show that modes of governance have long-term consequences for their inhabitants and governing failures may have severe negative effects (e.g. housing shortages, low levels of educational attainment, crime, low productivity, health). The systematic analysis of the literature shows the need to describe and document at the same time (1) how processes of governance operate in relation to major urban development projects, the implementation of public policies and (2) the implications of such practices for inequalities; so to say articulating an analysis of the governance processes and their outcomes. The paper suggests that the link between metropolitan governance and inequalities allow considering inequalities not only as the outcomes of policy choices, but also as part of the way in which metropolitan policies are implemented.",

          "authors": "Sho Miyazaki",
          "abstract": "Do voters ``signal'' their decisions by voting early, or do they ``snipe'' by casting their votes at the last minute?  In transparent sequential roll call voting, such as in the U.S. House of Representatives, voters can strategically choose when to cast their votes. This contrasts with the U.S. Senate's sequential voting, where the order is exogenously determined, or private simultaneous voting, as typically seen in elections. Despite the significance of these roll call votes in high-stakes decision-making, the potential for strategic behavior based on vote timing remains underexplored. This paper examines the causal effect of transparent sequential voting on voter decision timing, leveraging a natural experiment from roll call votes in a crypto startup (DAO), which transitioned from private one-stage voting to transparent sequential voting. I collected a dataset of individual-level voting records, delegated voting power, and precise vote timing. First, the fixed-effect regression analysis reveals that introducing a public tally in transparent sequential voting increases the likelihood of early voting (signaling) or last-minute voting (sniping) compared to the baseline of private simultaneous voting. This finding is consistent with game-theoretic predictions. Additionally, interaction models show that more pivotal voters, measured by the Shapley-Shubik index, are more likely to vote early rather than snipe at the last minute. These results suggest that a public tally may adversely affect welfare regarding information aggregation, as signaling strategies can intensify the influence of pivotal voters.",

          "authors": "Sofia Maniatakou; Pero Olsson; Peter Søgaard Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "Several transnational corporations, investors, international organizations and philanthropies have formed coalitions to respond to global social and environmental challenges. Do these coalitions, consisting of large-scale actors, have the capacities to contribute to the transformations that are needed, or do they perpetuate the same system dynamics that created the problem in the first place? We investigate this question by comparing publicly available information for five coalitions working with financial and food systems sustainability. This paper examines whether large-scale actor coalitions (LSACs) may contribute to transformations towards equitable and sustainable futures. We use a ‘rapid assessment’ 20-variable framework to collect and analyze empirical data from five food and finance coalitions to identify their roles and capacities for transformative change. Our results indicate that LSACs implement distinct strategies to reach their goals. More specifically, due to their diverse set-ups, LSACs have the ability to raise awareness of sustainability issues, utilize ties to push forward agendas, experiment with solutions and showcase promising niche initiatives. We examine strategies undertaken by LSACs that can enable other change makers working to transform the food and finance systems, contributing to systems with high and diverse capacities for transformative change. We also identify potential capacity gaps within the studied LSACs, which might hinder the creation of enabling conditions for transformative change within the food and finance sectors.",

          "abstract": "Three out of five Australian renters say they expect they will never own their own home — a significant shift that requires rethinking of tax and housing systems so that governments’ support all Australians in a two tier housing market (of owners and renters) into retirement, according to new AHURI research.\n\nThe policy challenge is to make renting a good, long-term housing outcome for renters, particularly lower-income, older renters with limited superannuation. The research highlights that in the Australian Housing Aspirations (AHA) survey a large majority (78%) of private rental tenants aspired to own their own home, while the research survey found three out of five (59%) private renters don’t think they will ever be able to afford to buy a home of their own.\n\nCurrently, homeowners receive tax concessions that are not available to renters. Examples include no capital gains tax on the sale of the primary residence (which becomes a form of wealth accumulation) and no tax on the imputed rental income of owner occupied housing. Conversely, renters are required to pay rent after income tax.\n\nA fairer housing and tax system (for retirement investment) could see some lower income private renters compensated for living long-term in the sector. This support could come through the provision of non-property investment opportunities (to reduce households’ need to 'rentvest') or targeted superannuation benefits.\n\nSustained underinvestment in social housing stock has also had long-term negative implications for all Australians and additional public housing construction is needed as a priority, together with policies to support private developers increasing the supply of affordable housing. In addition, a more immediate goal for policy development is to reform legislation controlling private tenancies so as to have better protections for tenants.",

This briefing paper summarises the findings from the one of the strands of the ‘Beyond Left Behind Places’ project, which involved quantitative analysis of residential migration patterns in economically ‘left behind’ regions in the UK, France, and Germany during the immediate pre-COVID period. In addition, we conducted qualitative research with residents of economically ‘left behind’ regions in the three countries to get their perceptions. We use national administrative and census data for the three countries to examine whether economically lagging regions tend to lose or gain population through migration, and what age groups are moving in or out.  Economic theories often assume that individuals migrate from economically lagging regions to areas offering better economic conditions. But actually, economically lagging regions in the UK, France and Germany generally tend to experience net population inflows. In other words, more people are moving to these regions than are moving out. In fact, when it comes to internal migration (i.e. people moving within the same country), these lagging regions tend to attract more new residents, on average, than more economically successful regions do.",

It is no longer necessary to claim or reject a racial category for oneself to claim a solely Hispanic/Latina/e/o ethnic identity, which means that the current and prior schemes for ethnoracial identity are neither equivalent nor directly comparable.",

          "abstract": "International investment arbitration is inhabited by actors who theorize the law as scholars and decide on it when arbitrating, which raises critical questions concerning their normative role within the legal system. This article explores empirically the influence of legal scholars on the development of inter?national investment law through a combined legal-empirical and sociological approach designed to capture the multidirectional nature of influence. It relies on a novel database of all citations to legal scholarship in International Centre for the Settlement of Disputes (ICSID) case law, which is analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and contextualized alongside interviews with 16 leading arbitrators and lawyers. The article firstly introduces the arbitrator/academic as an agent of international law, and then details the methodology. It then turns to provide an overview of citations to legal scholarship in ICSID case law, before considering why legal actors find it useful. The following parts show how legal scholarship influenced the development of the definition of an ‘investment’ in ICSID arbitration through an analysis of legal decisions and scholarship authored by arbitrators. The final part goes into conversation with the actors to further unravel how they manage competing and complementary obligations towards theory and practice, and the article concludes by reflecting on the ethical implications of their law-making function.",

          "authors": "Lingkai Kong",
          "abstract": "Current federalism research is dominated by the successful American model, focusing on a territorialized, mono-national constitutional federalism, where individuals of different nations within a specific territorial scope are jointly subject to and protected by the state. However, this is not the only way federalism can address the coexistence of multiple nations. By reviewing historical figures and theoretical narratives, as well as incorporating contemporary federal theorists on plurality and multiracial coexistence, this study seeks to shed light on a non-territorialized alternative arrangement. Once, facing the complex national coexistence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austrian Marxist Karl Renner proposed the personal principle and cultural autonomy, attempting to reshape the federal structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through a non-territorial arrangement. Renner reorganizes national communities as legal entities to act as intermediaries between individuals and the state, and to implement non-territorial economic, political, and cultural management for individuals of their own nations. This study also explores the model's non-territorial character, its treaty-based character, and its embodiment of federalism as norm. In Renner's view, this attempt could achieve a balance, avoiding both the oppression of minorities by the majority within territorial structures and the centrifugal tendencies of minority groups within specific territorial scopes. Although Renner's federalist reforms ultimately failed, they still provide valuable guidance for dealing with the political reality of multinational coexistence today, demonstrating the inherent potential of a non-territorial, pluralistic, treaty-based federalism.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, white fundamentalist Christians became disproportionately affiliated with the Republican Party in the U.S. and some advocate Christian Nationalism. This study examines the association of religious commitment with an index of humanitarian progress and Republican vote percentage in 2012 and 2016 among U.S. states. The percentage of people who say they pray daily in a state strongly correlates with a lower humanitarian progress score and a higher percentage of votes for Trump. The correlations remained strong when other factors (gun ownership, ethnic segregation, and income per cost of living) were controlled statistically in a multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that reliance on the supernatural leads to neglect of the natural. Support of Trump whose dishonesty is legion and who employs the fascist tactic of blaming social problems on minorities seems anomalous with Christian ideology. Although many establishment Republicans warned against Trump, the strong correlation between the Trump vote in 2016 with the vote for the establishment Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 suggests that party members are enmeshed in mutually reinforcing social arrangements that are not conducive to support of humanitarian policies and resistance to fascist tactics.",

          "authors": "Christopher Blattman",
          "abstract": "International drug trafficking dominates the conversation on organized crime, but equally common and serious are urban systems of organized crime—criminal groups focused not on exports or transshipment, but on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics. When policymakers do pay attention to this problem, they consistently make the same mistake—believing there are best practices. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no one blueprint or general solution, and so following the latest fad is unlikely to deliver the desired result. Instead of trying to copy the quasi-mythological success of a Giuliani or Bukele, policymakers need to understand what kind of organized crime problem they have, what capabilities their city possesses, and what tools are appropriate to the circumstances. This paper looks in-depth at how organized crime is organized in three cities: Chicago, Medellín, and San Salvador. It also considers New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue that the primary driver of their organization and incentives is their source of criminal revenues. A second major driver of behavior is the degree of criminal political organization, which broadly-speaking takes three forms: atomized individuals, fragmented groups, and competing confederations. These forms are not just the product of their revenues, but are also the result of decades of competition with the state and one another. What policy tools will work hinges on this diagnosis. I look at the evidence for a range of standard policies—from crackdowns to street outreach—and explain why we can expect them to have wildly different impacts depending on the context.",

          "authors": "Joshua Midha",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel transaction-function model for valuing emerging markets, integrating machine learning, agent-based modeling, and multi-method valuation techniques. Traditional valuation models often rely on aggregated economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation, which lack the granularity needed to capture the transactional dynamics and unique risk factors inherent to emerging markets. In contrast, the proposed model treats each market as a multi-dimensional function of individual transactions, analyzing these interactions through a multi-method framework that includes Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparables, precedent transaction, and multiples analysis. By incorporating machine learning algorithms, the model iteratively improves predictive accuracy, dynamically adjusting to new data in volatile and data-sparse environments. Additionally, agent-based simulations provide insights into behavioral responses to policy changes, regulatory shifts, and other market-specific conditions, offering a behavioral layer often missing from traditional approaches. Validation of this model demonstrates a marked improvement in predictive accuracy and adaptability compared to conventional models. This transaction-function approach provides investors and policymakers with a granular, data-driven tool for assessing the true growth potential of emerging markets, paving the way for more informed, context-sensitive investment decisions.",

The latter disproportionately impacts developing nations and vulnerable communities. While the law of the sea was originally designed to ensure peace, security, and legal order for the ocean, its facilitation of industrialized ocean exploitation has inadvertently contributed to widening inequality gaps. \nThis paper leverages infrastructure studies to discuss the \"infrastructural work of law\" and explore how law’s distributional effects perpetuate injustices in ocean governance. By analyzing case studies such as marine resource conservation and shipping regulations, the study illustrates how thinking of law through an infrastructural lens reveals its agency and its potential for harm in the global ocean polity. This perspective advances an understanding of ocean justice that accounts for the complex and multi-scalar dynamics required to address the unequal burdens of the Anthropocene.",

          "abstract": "C’est désormais un poncif : l’extrême droite serait une quasi-résultante des problèmes de l’urbanisme, le fruit des classes populaires et moyennes confrontées aux difficultés de l’habitat dégradé en secteur cosmopolite. Cette étude de Caterina Froio, Pietro Castelli Gattinara et Tommaso Vitale analyse en profondeur l’action et l’implantation de CasaPound, mouvement italien considéré comme une référence et un modèle par les radicaux de droite en Europe, dans les quartiers populaires. Elle démontre empiriquement comment des actions fabriquées pour les médias occultent une réalité plus en demi-teintes.",

          "authors": "MOBILE - Center of Excellence for Global Mobility Law; Anouk Lamé",
          "abstract": "Depuis septembre 2021, les décisions de la justice administrative sont progressivement et \nexhaustivement publiées en open data, ouvrant par là un corpus d’une très grande richesse pour les \nrecherches empiriques sur le droit et des opportunités de recherche uniques en Europe. Cependant, \nun tel matériel empirique, parce qu’il est novateur et unique, requiert de s’équiper d’un outillage \nméthodologique et conceptuel adapté. C’est à ces deux discussions que cette contribution souhaite \napporter des pistes de réflexion, en introduisant un cadre méthodologique inspiré du pragmatisme et des outils dits « computationnels », qui permettent d’analyser de larges corpus de données, y compris juridiques. \nIl s’agira dans une première partie d’introduire le cadre méthodologique de l’étude et de présenter les récents développements dans la recherche computationnelle sur le droit. Dans une seconde partie, seront présentés des résultats empiriques tirés d’un projet de recherche en cours portant sur le rôle des juges dans la définition de l’éloignabilité des étrangers et de la création d’une base de données sur le contentieux de l’éloignement dans les tribunaux administratifs. Ce retour d’expérience est suivi par une discussion conceptuelle, qui a pour objectif d’ouvrir un dialogue sur le cadre analytique adapté aux opportunités offertes par l’open data.",

          "authors": "James Higgs; Stephen Flowerday",
          "abstract": "The video game market is forecasted to be valued at $321.6 billion by 2027. Today, younger generations increasingly prefer spending their leisurely time playing online video games. Beyond providing a leisurely – and often competitive – activity to the bulk of its user base, online video games provide cybercriminals with an environment that is free from the reigns of legal enforcement. More specifically, with the growing popularity and uptake of the microtransaction business model, money launderers are provided with novel channels to move their illicitly gained funds. A continuously expanding body of evidence underscores that money laundering is occurring through online video games. Foremost, cybercriminals are attracted to the anonymity and global reach offered by online video games with few to no controls currently in place to disrupt laundering processes. Furthermore, regulations are struggling to keep pace with the latest money laundering strategies employed by cybercriminals. This paper explores and discusses money laundering in the context of online video games. Core vulnerabilities enabling money laundering to occur through online video games are identified. Security controls to reduce the scale of laundering are proposed.",

          "title": "Local and Spillover Effects of Trade on Structural Transformation: Evidence from Brazil",
          "authors": "Mateo Hoyos; José Alejandro Coronado; Guilherme Klein Martins",
          "abstract": "This paper presents novel empirical evidence on the impact of trade on structural transformation. Leveraging quasi-experimental tariff variation from Brazil's trade liberalization in the 1990s, we examine its effects on regional sectoral employment shares. Building on recent cross-regional macroeconomic literature, we approximate the aggregate effects of trade on structural change by extending the traditional shift-share analysis to include estimates of spatial spillover effects, beyond the commonly reported local or direct impacts. Our findings reveal that Brazilian regions directly exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a significant decrease in manufacturing employment shares, an increase in the primary sector, and a decline in non-tradables. Spatial spillover effects—whether based on migration or gravity links—are positive for manufacturing and the primary sector but negative for non-tradables. While positive spillovers in manufacturing partially offset local deindustrialization, the net effects remain negative and economically significant. These effects persisted for at least twenty years post-liberalization and are independent of potential confounders, including alternative structural change hypotheses and other shocks to Brazil's economy during the study period. Our results are consistent with the theoretical literature on trade and structural transformation which emphasizes the significance of comparative advantage.",
