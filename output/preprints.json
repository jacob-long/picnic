          "title": "Exploring the Relationship Between Learning Styles Based on Introversion/Extraversion and Blood Types Using Fuzzy Logic Models",
          "authors": "Kian Zehtabian",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between learning styles based on introversion/extraversion and culturally mythologized variables (e.g., blood type), utilizing fuzzy logic models to explore potential interactions in numerical cognition. Data from 278 students were analyzed using traditional statistical methods and fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Results suggest that introversion correlates with reflective learning styles, while extraversion is linked to active approaches. However, no significant direct relationship between blood type (a culturally popularized factor) and learning styles was found. This paper highlights fuzzy logic’s potential in modeling cognitive processes and underscores how methodological choices shape outcomes—transforming a null relationship into a cautionary case study of cultural myths in empirical research.",

          "authors": "Ruhi Bhanap; Lea Maria Bartsch; Agnes Rosner",
          "abstract": "Memory maintenance strategies such as visual imagery and rehearsal are widely reported by participants as means to enhance recall and their underlying mechanisms are thought to differ. Visual imagery is believed to engage both visual and spatial aspects of memoranda, while rehearsal is thought to reactivate only the item-specific information, excluding spatial information. In this study, we employed the Looking at Nothing (LAN) effect – in which individuals make eye movements towards the original location of the memorized item during retrieval – to investigate the reactivation of spatial location in both visual imagery and rehearsal. Our findings demonstrate that LAN occurs with both strategies, indicating that spatial information is reactivated during rehearsal as well. Notably, we observed higher immediate as well as delayed memory performance with visual imagery compared to rehearsal. However, the amount of LAN observed for both these strategies remained the same. To further explore whether these differences in the amount of LAN and memory performance were driven by a modulation of the strength of long-term memory (LTM) traces we introduced proactive interference (PI) in a second experiment. PI is known to impact LTM traces, while leaving working memory (WM) intact. While PI led to a decline in WM for visual imagery, the amount of LAN remained the same. These results indicate that visual imagery and rehearsal both reactivate location information and additionally, visual imagery drives eye movements and memory benefits through distinct mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: During pandemics, various determinants influence protective behaviors   such as face mask use. Current evidence lacks insights into sociodemographic differences and potential room for improvement in these determinants, despite this being essential for effective interventions. We aimed to identify the most promising intervention targets for face mask use during COVID-19, across the whole population and stratified by age and education, using novel analytical approaches.\nDesign: Cross-sectional survey of a representative Finnish adult population sample.\nMethods: 2272 adults responded to questions about mask wearing and potential determinants (May 2021). We employed two complementary analytical approaches: Confidence-Interval Based Estimation of Relevance (CIBER), which combines bivariate correlations with univariate distributions, and interpretable machine learning (Categorical Boosted Tree regression with SHapley Additive exPlanations).\nResults: Both analytical approaches identified similar promising intervention targets with some notable differences. Key determinants included injunctive norms (particularly expectations of people present rather than authorities), habit, response efficacy, feeling safe when wearing masks, and perceived disease severity. Age was more influential than education in determining both the relevance of determinants and room for improvement, with older adults showing less room for improvement in key determinants.\nConclusions: Promising intervention targets encompass reasoned, habitual, social, and affective elements. Our findings emphasize the importance of socio-contextual determinants like situation-specific injunctive norms, which are often overlooked in behavior change interventions, and highlight the need to consider demographic differences such as age when designing mask-wearing interventions.",

          "authors": "Jon W Carr; Kathleen Rastle",
          "abstract": "English orthography has largely been left to evolve freely across its thousand-year history with little top-down design or reform. Yet modern English spelling has become standardized, even if its standardized spellings are sometimes internally inconsistent. The relative freedom with which English orthography has been allowed to evolve makes it an interesting test-case for exploring whether spelling standardization might arise through a process of positive frequency-dependent selection. To maximize the chance of being understood, it pays for a writer to adopt spelling variants that occur with higher frequency, leading to those forms becoming increasingly entrenched. To evaluate this possibility, we assembled a diachronic dataset of English spelling variation, SpellEng, which we make freely available. SpellEng reports on the frequency of 112,080 spelling variants (across 32,264 lemmata) over the entire history of the English language. We use this dataset along with a model of frequency-dependent selection to estimate the extent to which English standardization can be explained by such a process. Our findings suggest that the past 1000 years of English spelling have been characterized by both positive and negative frequency-dependent selection. We discuss how linguistic dynamics and external events have shaped these periods of stability and change.",

          "abstract": "Unemployed people face significant stigmatization, which leads them to experience, anticipate, and internalize their stigma and to use a range of strategies to cope with it. Despite its importance, the extent of this stigma remains largely unknown. Therefore, we conduct a victimization study and quantify the extent of unemployment stigma and its relationship to self-efficacy using survey data from a representative sample of 2,098 jobseekers. Study 1a finds high levels of acute, daily, and anticipated stigmatization and low levels of stigma internalization, with avoidance being a common behavioral strategy. Study 1b uses k-means clustering and uncovers three distinct profiles of stigma exposure that vary by age, family situation, and receipt of social benefits. Study 1c shows that these profiles predict differences in self-efficacy, independent of key demographic factors. The findings highlight the vulnerability of younger, single, welfare recipients who are most at risk for stigma and low self-efficacy.",

          "authors": "Marianne Promberger; Jonathan Baron",
          "abstract": "Public policy must often decide about issues where a change in behavior is likely to be accompanied by a corresponding change in preferences, such as pornography becoming less scandalous if it is widely consumed, or same-sex desire less offensive if more gay people are getting married. All other things being equal, the adaptation of preferences to match prevalent behavior makes them more likely to be fulfilled and hence confers utility. However, we show that people hold other-regarding second-order preferences (preferences regarding the preferences held by others), which are somewhat independent of first-order preferences, and which affect their preferences for policy changes. In Study~1 we found that, across 19 scenarios, such second-order preferences were consistently more negative than first-order preferences. In Study~2, second-order preferences were associated with subjects judging a policy worse if values were to adapt to it. In Studies 3 and 4, subjects believed others to be more mistaken than they themselves would be about what is good for them, resulting in a greater discrepancy of second-order preferences from predicted first-order preferences.",

          "authors": "Ovidia Stanoi",
          "abstract": "In times of high stress, support from our social networks is essential. This paper tested the influence of close friendships on young adults’ well-being in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (May-October 2020). In a longitudinal study of 28 days (N = 205 participants; 10,088 observations), students with more close friends in college, as reported pre-pandemic, adjusted better to COVID-19 stressors, even when away from campus. Follow-up analyses revealed that this effect could be partially explained by differences in the quality of significant online conversations. Students with many close friends in college benefited equally from important in-person and online conversations. In contrast, those with few close friends experienced higher negative affect and lower positive affect on days when their most important interactions were online vs. in-person. Participants’ number of friends was uncorrelated with their number of online interactions or personality traits. Our intensive longitudinal design also permitted investigation, within individuals, of how online vs. in-person interactions led to feelings of closeness. Personal disclosures emerged as the base of closeness in both types of communications; all participants felt closer to their interaction partners when one of them shared something personal, regardless of whether the interaction took place in-person or online. This effect was stronger for those with few close friends, suggesting that individuals can foster connection in everyday interactions by allowing themselves—and inviting others—to be vulnerable. This research leveraged social network and longitudinal methods to highlight how young adults coped with the COVID-19 pandemic through their friendship networks.",

          "abstract": "Long-distance romantic relationships (LDRRs) have grown increasingly common due to career-related necessity and the proliferation of digital technologies. We sought to understand how LDRRs differed from individuals in cohabitating romantic relationships (CRRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a multinational, six-wave dataset collected during the beginning of the pandemic (Nobservations = 2,954), we hypothesized an interaction whereby spending more time with one’s partner than was typical would lead to increased passion and decreased conflict for LDRRs, but decreased passion and increased conflict for CRRs. However, we found, regardless of relationship type, spending more time with one’s partner led to better outcomes. Nevertheless, LDRRs reported less conflict and more passion than those in CRRs. These associations remained consistent across case-control matched models and models adjusting for theoretically-relevant covariates. While LDRRs navigate periods of uncertainty better than CRRs, spending more time with one’s partner, irrespective of the arrangement, is ultimately beneficial.",

          "authors": "Matthias Uhl; Joshua Knobe",
          "abstract": "People sometimes behave differently depending on whether they are interacting online (by email, social media, etc.) vs. interacting in person. Four studies test the hypothesis that when an agent’s behavior is different online vs. in person, people think that the online behavior is less reflective of who the agent truly is deep down. Study 1 found that the very same behavior is regarded as less reflective of the true self when it is performed online. Study 2 showed that this effect is not merely a matter of perceived impression management. Study 3 found that there is a general tendency such that behavior is seen as more reflective of the true self when it is performed in an environment regarded as “natural.” In Study 4, a manipulation that led participants to see online behavior as more natural had a downstream effect on the degree to which this behavior was seen as reflecting the true self. Taken together, these results suggest that people’s judgments about online behavior are not simply a reflection of idiosyncratic facts about the online sphere in particular but are instead driven in part by a far more general psychological process involving perceptions of naturalness.",

          "authors": "Timothy Joseph Pleskac; Ellie Kyung; Gretchen B. Chapman; Oleg Urminsky",
          "abstract": "Blinded review is often proposed as a solution to inequities in merit-based evaluations. We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40\\% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were Ph.D. students or research scientists, while disfavoring Asian (vs. White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (vs. single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.",

          "abstract": "Importance: The tobacco industry spends over $8 billion annually in the United States on marketing at the point-of-sale. Exposure to tobacco retail has been associated with smoking outcomes, but few studies have objectively logged day-to-day, real-world tobacco retail exposure and linked exposure to smoking outcomes, which can provide insight into dynamic associations.\n\nObjective: To assess pre-registered hypotheses that individuals report greater craving and cigarettes smoked on days when their objectively logged retail exposure is higher than usual. \n\nDesign: A 14-day within-person observational study combining geolocating tracking, public tobacco-retail location records, and ecological momentary assessment. Data collection occurred from 2022 to 2024.\n\nSetting: A remote study including participants statewide in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\n\nParticipants: Main eligibility criteria were: aged 21-65 years, smoked at least five cigarettes per day for the previous six months, owned an iPhone or Android smartphone, and a resident of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled and 273 participants were included in the final analysis.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment.\n\nResults: Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses. On days when individuals had more tobacco marketing exposure than their usual baseline, they reported significantly higher levels of craving (b = 0.04, t(3,456.79) = 2.56, p = 0.01) and smoking significantly more cigarettes (b = 0.01, t(3,469) = 2.47, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: People’s environments shape their feelings and behaviors. Exposure to tobacco retail in the real-world is associated with increases in craving and smoking. Findings highlight the significance of retail exposure in relation to smoking, information that is critical for developing effective tobacco control interventions.",

          "abstract": "This study examines whether and how the shape of the linguistic input influences language learning and regularization in individual adult learners. To test this question, we used a set of miniature artificial languages with different degrees of structural systematicity, from fully random to fully systematic, and two types of frequency distributions, skewed and uniform. The results from 80 adult native speakers of English show that systematicity facilitates learning: the mean transmission error decreases as the input systematicity increases. Frequency distributions play an important role in the systematicity of the output language, but, contrary to some previous findings, this factor alone does not drive regularization. Learners increased the systematicity of the learned language only when they were exposed to a high degree of regularity in the input. Systematicity is, therefore, critically determined by the patterns in the language input, and not by some independent pressure to regularize.",

          "abstract": "To represent something as absent, one must know that they would have known if it was present. This form of counterfactual reasoning critically relies on a mental self-model: a simplified schema of one’s own cognition, which specifies expected perceptual and cognitive states under different world states and affords better monitoring and control over cognitive resources. Here I propose to use inference about absence as a unique window into the structure and function of the mental self-model. In contrast to commonly used paradigms, using inference about absence bypasses the need for explicit metacognitive reports. I draw on findings from low-level perception, spatial attention, and episodic memory, in support of the idea that self knowledge is a computational bottleneck for efficient inference about absence, making inference about absence a cross-cutting framework for probing key features of the mental self-model that are not accessible for introspection.",

We address these questions asking school-aged children to generate semantic relations of categorical inclusion for words varying in concreteness. Results show that language-mediated abstraction (the ability to generate increasingly more general words starting from a prompt) improves over time, is independent of age, and characterizes both, concrete and abstract concepts. However, abstract concepts used as prompts stimulate children to construct shorter ladders. Additionally, variations in abstraction pathways were observed across development, with extra-semantic relations, beyond taxonomic ones, being most prominent in children of intermediate ages and for abstract and emotional words. These findings support theories distinguishing concreteness and specificity as distinct aspects of the general notion of abstraction, both of which effects category formation and organization.",

Individuals involved in collective action problems are often considered to have two options: contribute towards a public solution or free-ride. But they might also choose a third option of investing in a private solution such as local climate change adaptation. Here we introduce a collective action game featuring wealth inequality caused by luck or merit and both public and private solutions with participants from 34 countries. We show that the joint existence of wealth inequality and private solutions has a consistent effect across countries: participants endowed with higher income choose the private solution almost twice as often as those endowed with lower income; and this finding cannot be explained by different sources of wealth (luck vs. merit) or by cultural or economic factors. We also show that preferences for private solutions undermine support for public solutions, resulting in wealth inequality increasing in every country. In contrast, we identify two universal pathways to successful public solution provision: early contributions to public solutions and conditional cooperation. Our findings highlight the ubiquity of the ‘private solution problem’ and its potential consequences for global collective action problems.",

          "abstract": "Emotional intensity seems to be related to the selection of emotion regulation (ER) strategies. Previous studies have focused primarily on intrapersonal ER. In contrast, everyday use of interpersonal ER remains understudied, with the association between perceived emotional intensity and selection of intra- or intrinsic interpersonal ER still unclear. In a preregistered study, we used experience sampling method data from a community sample of individuals in a heterosexual relationship (n = 183) who provided reports on their daily lives over a period of 4 weeks during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Surveys included questions about various emotions, their perceived intensity, and selected ER strategies. Results revealed more frequent use of ER overall with increasing emotional intensity of all negative emotions (except for boredom). In line with our hypothesis, results showed that greater emotional intensity increased the probability of interpersonal ER more strongly than intrapersonal ER for most negative emotions, in both women and men. Additionally, we found that men used significantly more intrapersonal than interpersonal strategies at average emotional intensity of all negative emotions. A preference for interpersonal ER in the face of highly intense emotions may be related to a higher demand for resources, which is compensated through social connection. In the association between perceived emotional intensity and ER selection, our research highlights the importance of considering both intra- and interpersonal ER strategies.\n\n©American Psychological Association, 2025.

Some theoretical\naccounts argue for the existence of domain-specific cognitive adaptations that prioritise social\ninformation, while others suggest that social learning is itself a product of cumulative cultural\nevolution based on domain-general learning mechanisms. The current paper explores the\ncontribution of humans’ unique ontogenetic environment to the emergence of social learning in\ninfancy. It suggests that the prolonged period of post-natal dependency experienced by human\ninfants contributes to the development of social learning. Because of motor limitations, infants\nlearn to interact with and act through caregivers, establishing social learning abilities skills that\ncontinue to develop as children become less dependent. According to this percpective, at least\nsome key aspects of social development can be attributed to a developmental trajectory guided\nby infants’ early motor development that radically alters how they experience the world.",

          "abstract": "Creative processes of semantic extension play a key role in language change, grammaticalisation, and (by hypothesis) the early origins and evolution of language. In this paper we report two dyadic interaction experiments studying the semantic extension of novel labels in controlled circumstances. We find that participants can use salient and shared associations in their perceptual environment (between colours and shapes) to bootstrap a communication system, and can then extend those labels figuratively, to convey both concrete and abstract targets, by exploiting shared understandings such as colours associated stereotypically with specific objects and emotions. By manipulating the presence of reliable statistical associations between colour and shape early in this process we show that such shared associations facilitate both an initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions; we also find that extensions relying on less certain grounding (e.g. between colours and emotions) lead to greater variability in how extensions are made. Our method can be used to test the creative processes of semantic extension under controlled conditions, and provides experimental purchase on the relationship between association and extension which have only previously been studied through correlational means.",

Participants are more likely to declare wanting to consume and to share material that generates more insight. We also observe that many participants choose to consume a new riddle or a new whodunit instead of immediately finishing the experiment, but that only High Insight riddles, and not whodunits, were significantly preferred.

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

          "authors": "Kodai Kusano; Waleed Jami",
          "abstract": "Cross-cultural researchers often compare mean scores across cultures using subjective Likert scales, but this approach faces several methodological challenges. One alleged problem is the reference group effect (RGE), which posits that varying normative standards distort cultural comparisons, potentially suppressing or even reversing true differences. In this study, we revisit this issue and challenge its premise. Leveraging data from three large-scale international datasets, we examined the relationship between subjective socioeconomic status (SES) and its external criterion, national wealth (GDP per capita). According to the RGE, respondents’ judgments based on their local peers would result in individuals from wealthy countries rating themselves as less affluent and those from developing countries rating themselves as relatively more affluent. Such biased evaluations would suppress true differences, leading to a null correlation between SES and GDP across countries. However, our findings consistently revealed a strong positive correlation: respondents from wealthier countries rated themselves higher, while those from developing countries rated themselves lower. The majority of respondents appear to interpret numerical anchors of Likert scales in a single, universal, and absolute manner—“middle class” carries the same meaning regardless of varying economic standards. This consistent interpretation enables valid cross-cultural differences to emerge. Our findings encourage cross-cultural researchers to interpret observed cultural differences with greater confidence when using Likert scales.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) have become a popular data format to capture people's momentary affect in everyday life. Besides describing persons' average affect over time, ILD are also often used to describe affect dynamics - that is how affect changes over time -, such as intraindividual variability or moment-to-moment temporal dependencies. Given that ILD studies mostly use self-report rating data, there is an increasing concern that response biases, such as extreme responding, might impact the estimates of affect dynamics. In this study, we assessed the relationship between extreme responding and affect dynamics in a controlled experiment. In a highly powered sample with N=1,398 persons, we measured extreme responding using background questionnaires, and repeatedly induced affect using a probabilistic reward task with T=140 trials per person. Our results suggest that people with high extreme response style trait levels show substantially higher measures of affect variability. However, extreme responding is neither associated with moment-to-moment temporal dependencies nor with participants' reactivity to affective stimuli. We conclude with a discussion on the importance of evaluating measurement in ILD for psychological assessments, and outline potential areas for future research to improve assessments of affect dynamics.",

Several TSST adaptations for the presentation in virtual reality (VR) have been introduced and evaluated recently. Here we describe a freely available version, the Open TSST-VR. In two independent studies, we evaluated subjective, endocrine, and heart rate responses to the Open TSST-VR compared to an active control condition. In study 1, 50 men were randomly assigned to the Open TSST-VR or the control condition. Compared to the active control condition, the Open TSST-VR induced higher levels of subjective stress and significantly more cortisol responders. In study 2, we employed a balanced within-subject design comparing groups of 46 men and women. Again, the TSST-VR induced more stress than the control condition and a stronger cortisol response, but there were also order-effects suggesting that the TSST-VR is less suitable for within-subject comparisons. In both studies, we observed a substantial stress level (and cortisol responders) in the control condition indicating that future studies should further elaborate on non-stressful control conditions, either without any task or non-stressful active components. Overall, the Open TSST-VR is a versatile tool for collaborative experimental stress research that offers flexibility to a broad range of future research questions among various disciplines.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the neural effects of perceptual (caused by blur processing) and sexual ambiguity (induced by morphing manipulation) in facial images via event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analysis. Gaussian blur and morphing of male and female faces were used to create gradually ambiguous face images, and participants completed a sexual dimorphism judgment task. Results revealed that the N170 was strongly affected by blur, which suggested that it disrupted the structural encoding of faces. The EPN exhibited a different response compared with the N170, which indicated that it may reflect both bottom-up processing due to lack of visual cues and top-down processing driven by the sexual dimorphism judgment task. Additionally, LPP amplitude increased under conditions of explicit perceptual and sexual faces, which confirmed that ease of interpretation in sexual dimorphism judgments influenced neural responses. Furthermore, the time-frequency analysis revealed that high-frequency gamma activity at approximately 200 ms was associated with extracting and evaluating facial features, whereas activity after 600 ms reflected processes related to retaining facial information. These findings suggest that visual processing and semantic evaluation of faces rely on complex mechanisms influenced by both the clarity of physical cues and task context.",

          "abstract": "It is well-established that skilled, young-adult readers rely on predictive processing during online language comprehension; however, fewer studies have investigated whether this extends to healthy, older adults (60+ years). The aim of the present research was to assess whether older readers make use of lexical prediction by investigating whether they demonstrate processing costs for incorrect predictions in a controlled experimental design. The eye movements of a sample of older adults (60-86 years) were recorded as they read strongly and weakly constraining sentences containing a predictable word or an unpredictable alternative that was either semantically related or unrelated. To determine whether predictive processing depends on the stimuli presentation format, a second experiment presented the same materials in a self-paced reading task in which each word of a sentence appears one at a time at the readers’ own pace. Older adults showed processing benefits for expected input on eye-movement measures of reading. They also showed processing costs for unexpected input across both methodologies but only when semantically unrelated to the best completion. Taken together, the results suggest that the use of predictive processes remains relatively preserved with age. The implications of these findings for understanding whether prediction is a fundamental component of online language comprehension are discussed.",

Results indicated that LGBTQ adolescents entered high school with significantly higher anxiety symptom levels than their cisgender heterosexual peers but experienced a significant linear decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, anxiety symptoms remained stable for cisgender heterosexual adolescents. Additionally, for both groups, initial levels of self-esteem predicted lower initial anxiety symptoms and steeper declines in anxiety symptoms; however, its association with later anxiety symptoms weakened for LGBTQ adolescents. These findings suggest that LGBTQ adolescents experience significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers as they transition through the first years of high school but that these increased levels of anxiety symptoms can be mitigated by the bolstering of a more robust self-esteem.",

The framework's distinctive elements—including \"stepping out\" visualization, trigger questions, and the detective metaphor—provide accessible tools for navigating the critical transition between emotional reactivity and strategic effectiveness.

          "abstract": "Dysphoria is associated with dampening of social interaction intention, but the cognitive mechanisms that underpin this relationship are under-investigated. This study tested the hypothesis that heightened negative social expectancies mediate the association between dysphoria and dampened social motivation. Additionally, it tested the hypothesis that the association between dysphoria and negative social expectancies is mediated by an attribution style bias that attributes negative, but not positive, outcomes to internal causes. University students (N = 271) with varied levels of dysphoria read vignettes describing situations where they initiate a social interaction that results in positive or negative outcomes. Participants rated their expectancies concerning the likelihoods of these outcomes, and their expected emotional impact. Participants also forecast the emotions they would experience and reported the degree to which they attribute each outcome to internal factors (themselves) or to external factors (the other person/circumstance). Finally, participants reported their intention to seek social interaction in similar future situations. Results showed that negative biases in outcome likelihood and emotional impact expectancies both independently mediated the association between dysphoria and deficits in social interaction intention. Furthermore, negative internal causal attribution bias mediated the association between dysphoria and each type of expectancy bias. Dysphoria’s association with negative internal causal attribution style converged with negative affective forecasts, reflecting greater self-focused negative emotions (humiliation, guilt, helplessness) and reduced self-focused positive emotions (pride). Findings indicate the utility of assessing dysphoria-linked biases in outcome and emotional impact expectancies and highlight the importance of attribution style bias in dampening social motivation in dysphoria.",

Study 1 finds that when observers morally agree with a perpetrator, they perceive punishers as less legitimate and view punishment as less deterrent. Study 2 shows punisher legitimacy has only a mixed effect on moral evaluations and deterrence. Study 3, using a 2x2 design, finds moral agreement, but not punisher legitimacy, predicts deterrence. Study 4 replicates these effects in a criminal sample. Our results suggest deterrence is deeply intertwined with the morality ascribed to an act, superseding punisher legitimacy.

In contrast, anxiety symptoms remained stable for cisgender heterosexual adolescents. Additionally, for both groups, initial levels of self-esteem predicted lower initial anxiety symptoms and steeper declines in anxiety symptoms; however, its association with later anxiety symptoms weakened for LGBTQ adolescents. These findings suggest that LGBTQ adolescents experience significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers as they transition through the first years of high school but that these increased levels of anxiety symptoms can be mitigated by the bolstering of a more robust self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "It has been suggested that mentalizing abilities underlie the distinct profiles of autism characteristics observed in Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) and fragile X syndromes (FXS). However, traditional explicit mentalizing tasks have high language demands that may mask mentalizing abilities. We compared performance on traditional explicit tasks and an implicit anticipatory looking mentalizing task in children with CdLS (N=9), boys with FXS (N=9), autistic (N=22) and neurotypical (N=34) children. The groups showed divergent patterns of performance. Neurotypical children had higher explicit mentalizing scores than all other groups. However, neurotypical, FXS and CdLS groups showed better implicit mentalizing performance than autistic children. Both chronological age and receptive language ability correlated with explicit mentalizing scores in neurotypical children. In autistic children, there was an association between explicit mentalizing score and receptive language ability but not chronological age. Explicit mentalizing score was not associated with receptive language ability or chronological age in the CdLS and FXS groups. Neither chronological age nor receptive language ability correlated with implicit mentalizing task performance in any group.  Despite having intellectual disability and autistic characteristics, findings demonstrate that children with CdLS and FXS are skilled at spontaneously mentalizing.",

          "abstract": "Speech sounds are based on categories, but listeners are also sensitive to within-category acoustic variation. This gradient system helps promote flexibility, deal with ambiguity, and maintain plasticity. While the exact sources of gradiency are not well understood, prior work suggests it may be a product of statistical learning: Listeners exposed to more variable input show shallower categorization slopes. However, the tasks used in earlier work are ambiguous regarding what this slope represents. We investigated the role of phonetic variability as a causal driver of gradiency across three experiments, using a distributional learning paradigm in conjunction with the visual analog scaling (VAS) task, which resolves this ambiguity. In 2024, participants were trained on distributions of voice onset time with either high or low variance, and gradiency was assessed with the VAS task. Experiment 1 (n=84) suggested that variance  increased trial-by-trial inconsistency not gradiency. Experiment 2 (n=168) utilized 28 items to better generalize across stimulus characteristics and found robust evidence for increased gradiency due to variability. Experiment 3 (n=85) introduced a baseline (no learning) condition and ruled out the alternative explanation that listeners were adapting to low variance by becoming less gradient. Together, these support the idea that variable input promotes gradiency.",

          "abstract": "The majority of reading research takes place in high-income ‘Minority World’ countries where children typically begin learning to read in early childhood. This research, however, does not reflect the experience of many children around the world who learn to read later in childhood or in adolescence. Crucially, children who learn to read later in life may rely on different cognitive systems. Specifically, procedural learning, which supports sequence and pattern learning, reaches maturity around early adolescence, while declarative learning, which supports the arbitrary mapping of form and meaning, continues to develop into adulthood. The declarative/procedural model of learning posits that the role of declarative learning increases as an individual ages, and as it matures will overlap, and compete, with typically procedural supported learning. Therefore, declarative supported learning may lead to poorer outcomes for older first-time readers. This study examined the potential competition between procedural and declarative learning among emergent readers (n = 88) in rural Cote d’Ivoire, aged 10-16. We examined performance on culturally-appropriate declarative and procedural memory tasks, and found that declarative learning competes with procedural learning, such that stronger declarative memory negatively impacts the development of early reading skills. These findings are important for understanding the role of learning systems, and their interaction with age, in supporting literacy development.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

          "abstract": "Math anxiety is a pervasive phenomenon that negatively impacts individuals’ ability to perform mathematical tasks, yet its implications for functioning in a society where math is often helpful if not necessary remain underexplored. This study examines the relationships between math anxiety, financial anxiety, and financial literacy in a nationally representative sample of young adults in the U.S. (n = 393). As math anxiety and financial anxiety have previously been linked to avoidance of mathematical and financial content, we also examined the role of avoidance in their relationships to financial literacy. Consistent with prior research, math anxiety, financial anxiety, and gender were related to financial literacy. Further analysis revealed that math-anxious individuals and women showed a greater tendency to avoid responding to financial literacy questions. These findings clarify math and financial anxiety’s negative association with financial literacy and suggest that a tendency to avoid financial content may help to explain the link between math anxiety and financial literacy. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the implications of math anxiety for young people’s educational and financial lives and offers insight into the mechanisms that underlie these relationships. Insights for interventions targeting math anxiety and their potential for boosting financial literacy are discussed.",

These fluctuations parallel known biological rhythms, such as cortisol levels and sleep-wake cycles. Our findings contribute to theoretical models of mood regulation and have practical implications for early mental health interventions, highlighting the importance of timing in psychological assessments and treatments.",

Results showed that greed increased unethi-cal behaviour, with moral disengagement partially mediating this link by justifying immor-al actions. Moral identity moderated both the direct and indirect effects, weakening greed’s influence on unethical behaviour. Bribery acceptance was higher in the second language.

This suggests that instead of focusing on misinformation, it would be more\nproductive to increase the uptake of reliable information and trust. Still, a handful of powerful\nindividuals push misinformation and give it visibility.

On each trial of the Event Ranking Task, participants were asked to provide a ranking for an event set consisting of four events, A, not-A, B, and not-B, in terms of their perceived likelihoods. Qualitative predictions were formally derived by assuming direct sampling from a fixed underlying probability distribution. Adding read-out noise in the sampling process – as suggested in the Probability Theory plus Noise model (Costello &amp; Watts, 2014) – did not change the qualitative predictions. Two online experiments, where participants ranked twelve different event sets, yielded results in line with the qualitative predictions, providing evidence for the idea that mental sampling underlies probability judgments.",

These included beliefs that menstruation is taboo and irrelevant to the workplace, and that talking about menstruation uncomfortable and therefore menstruation should be concealed. Additionally, findings demonstrated how menstruating individuals are seen as emotionally instable and weak. Overall, our findings extend applications of femmephobia to feminine experiences in the workplace and additionally broaden theorising about dirty femininity to include menstruation.

This study aimed to investigate how common personal psychedelic experiences are among psychedelic researchers, their perceived relevance to research, and whether personal use is associated with opinions about psychedelics.\n\nMethods. Participants (N = 111) conducting psychedelic research in academic settings were recruited. Data were collected on personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and opinions about psychedelics. Regression analyses examined associations between personal use and opinions.\n\nResults. Most respondents (85%) reported personal experiences with classic psychedelics. Personal use predicted more positive opinions about psychedelics’ potential to improve well-being, transform society, address the ecological crisis, and answer spiritual questions (regression βs = .3 – .5, ps &lt; .01). For 72%, personal experiences had sparked interest in psychedelic research, and 67% found personal experience as helpful for research. Many expressed the need to disclose and discuss personal experiences but found it challenging in practice.\n\nConclusions.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are characterized as a risk factor for self-harm within the Integrated-Motivational Volitional (IMV) model. However, it is unclear how ACEs relate to self-harm as it unfolds in daily-life, and research investigating potential protective factors in the association between ACEs and self-harm is scarce. Here, we investigated whether ACEs were associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), and whether parent-child or peer attachment relationship quality influenced this association. Additionally, we explored whether specific types of ACEs were differentially associated with self-harm. \n\tMethods: A cross-sectional study using retrospective questionnaires to assess ACEs, lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviours, and paternal, maternal, and peer attachment relationship quality, and ESM to assess daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, 10x/day for 6 days. N=1014 adolescents (Age, Mean (SD) = 14.05 years (1.91), 66.66% female) were recruited from the general population via schools across Flanders (Belgium). \n\tResults: Multilevel analyses demonstrated associations between ACEs and lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, that were attenuated by a high-quality maternal attachment relationship. Specific types of ACEs (e.g., sexual victimization) were more strongly associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours.\n\tConclusion: The study provides evidence for ACEs as a pre-motivational phase variable within the IMV model. Clinicians are encouraged to consider exposure to ACEs and the potential of maternal relationships to buffer their impact in the prevention and management of adolescent self-harm.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a novel method to test a classic idea in developmental science: that children's attention to a stimulus is driven by how much they can learn from it. Preschoolers (4-6 years, M=4.6) watched a video where a distracting animation accompanied static, page-by-page illustrations of a storybook. The audio narration for each storybook page was looped such that children could listen to it up to 6 total times. However, the narration automatically ended if the child looked at the distractor for an extended period of time, indicating their loss of attention to the story, and triggering the next page. The complexity of the narration was manipulated between-subjects: the Simple narration largely contained words that should be familiar to preschoolers, while the Complex narration contained many rare, late-acquired words. Children's learning was measured via post-tests of their plot comprehension and ability to generalize the rare words. Consistent with the hypothesis that children's attention was driven at least partly by their ability to learn from the speech, we observed a significant interaction between narration complexity and age in predicting children's probability of continuing listening on each page, and the proportion of their visual attention that they devoted to the story illustration. That is, while younger children were more likely to continue listening to the Simple speech, older children became increasingly likely to sustain attention to the Complex speech. Our results provide evidence that young children may actively direct their attention toward linguistic input that is most appropriate for their current level of cognitive and linguistic development, which may provide the best learning opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue has significant resonances with relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis, yet the communication between these two fields has not been sufficiently explored. Broadly speaking, the concept of the \"I–Thou\" relationship is akin to mutual recognition, manifesting primarily in two ways: (1) During smooth interactions, both parties can fully engage in the ongoing dialogue, achieving attunement and responsiveness through both nonverbal and verbal communication; (2) During less smooth interactions, both parties remain open to dialogue, negotiate areas of disagreement, and even attempt to repair the relationship after a breakdown. Relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis and related research extends Buber's philosophy of dialogue by emphasizing nonverbal communication in infancy, focusing on intersubjective interactions at the micro level, providing evidence for Buber's concept of \"healing through encounter,\" and considering the complementarity of encounter (interactive regulation) and insight (self regulation). Future research could delve into guiding the interaction patterns of certain clients from an \"I–It\" relationship to an \"I–Thou\" relationship, which remains a crucial area for further exploration.",

          "authors": "Ebru Evcen; Alan Clinton Bale; David Barner",
          "abstract": "Conditional statements often imply meanings that extend beyond their literal content, influenced by contextual factors such as the Question Under Discussion (QUD) and a speaker’s epistemic state. One such inference is Conditional Perfection (CP), wherein a statement like, “If p then q,” is strengthened to imply that the antecedent p is the only contextually salient condition under which the consequent q holds (e.g., “p if and only if q”). While previous research has debated the role of QUDs in CP, the role of speaker knowledge has yet to be systematically tested. In two experiments, we investigated how these contextual factors influence conditional reasoning. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to derive CP when the conditional statement was an answer to a QUD that focused on the antecedent compared to those that were answers to either a neutral QUD or one that focused on the consequent. In Experiment 2, CP was more likely when the speaker was knowledgeable about all alternative antecedents than when they had partial knowledge. These findings support the view that CP arises through a process of exhaustification, wherein the conditional statement is strengthened by negating relevant alternatives. More broadly, they suggest that conditional inferences depend on reasoning about alternative utterances, paralleling other forms of pragmatic enrichment such as scalar implicatures.",

Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy. We also found that silent operating environments significantly improved image classification accuracy, while female voice alerts were distracting.

This study examined the influence of background noise on the structure of postural variability, a hallmark of adaptive capacity, and complexity matching, an index of global interpersonal coordination. Twenty-two pairs of participants conversed under varying levels of background noise (53 – 92 dB SPL), while motion-tracking sensors captured their postural movements. As noise increased, participants exhibited more rigid and less adaptable dynamics. However, when standing, noise also covaried with increased complexity matching, reflecting enhanced global coupling. Finally, complexity matching was negatively associated with communication breakdowns, suggesting it may serve as a behavioral biomarker of successful interaction. These findings highlight the adaptive nature of human movement and underscore complexity matching as a key indicator of information exchange. Future research should explore the predictive value of complexity matching in indexing communication breakdowns prior to their occurrence.",

          "abstract": "Throughout development, we learn through trial and error in the face of uncertainty. This ‘reinforcement learning’ supports youth’s ability to adapt to environmental demands. Theory suggests that early experiences optimize learning to prioritize socially relevant cues across multiple levels of analysis. Yet, experimental paradigms often use abstract stimuli and limit measures of learning to behavioral summaries such as task accuracy. This study uses computational models grounded in reinforcement learning and dynamic systems frameworks to examine how socioemotional context modulates cognitive and psychophysiological learning processes. In a sample of 56 youth aged 12-15 years, a within-person experimental design quantified continuous behavior and heart rate (~700 observations of behavior and heart rate, per person) during an adapted reinforcement learning task with stimuli that varied in socioemotional relevance. A series of Bayesian multilevel models revealed that, compared to traditionally-used non-emotional stimuli, learning from stimuli high in socioemotional arousal enhanced behavioral performance. Specifically, computational models suggested that socioemotional salience may elicit faster value-updating processes and a qualitative shift to more exploitative decision-making. Underlying psychophysiological engagement was modulated by heightened sensitivity to learning from rewards, showing faster value-updating in the context of rewards aligned with more optimal psychophysiological flexibility and organization. Together, these findings clarify the contexts and modulatory processes that shape developmental learning mechanisms.",

Specifically, we anticipate sensory events that are likely to be presented in the future on the basis of the current sensory events. By comparing these forward predictions against incoming input, we can obtain an accurate estimate of the environment (i.e. perceive) and improve the predictions themselves (i.e. learn). Interestingly however, research in the field of statistical learning has taught us that backward predictive relationships - reflecting the probability of past events given present events - govern learning too. This work questions the privileged status of forward-looking mechanisms and renders it essential to consider the implications for our models of learning and perception. Here we discuss commonalities and differences between implications for learning and perception. We conclude that while forward and backward predictive relationships both shape learning, we retrieve future, but not past, predicted states during perception.",

To address this issue we harnessed experience sampling data (68,232 observations across 10,905 days) from 1,415 Belgian participants to examine whether normal variations in sleep duration linearly or nonlinearly influence next-day fatigue, stress, happiness, anxiety, despondence, and calmness. We also tested whether people that sleep less on average benefit more from a standard sleep increase than people that generally sleep more. We tested 10,080 models as part of a multiverse analyses in this non-pre-registered study. Findings indicate even small increases in sleep duration promote (albeit, in a small way) more positive affective experiences, that effects are generally stronger in the period after waking relative to later in the day, and that effect magnitudes differ markedly across affective experiences. Findings also tentatively indicate that the impact of sleep on fatigue and feelings of despondence soon after waking may be greater for people that sleep less on average. However, little support was gained for sleep effects being nonlinear. In short, our findings advance understanding of whether and to what extent sleep impacts various affective experiences, and reveal a range of important nuances to this relationship.",

          "abstract": "We often fail to consciously hear important information while preoccupied with another task or otherwise busy. Understanding the processes determining which information is more likely to overcome this “inattentional deafness” is crucial for theories of consciousness and non-conscious cognition. This is especially important because much less is known about processes that precede and determine conscious awareness in the auditory modality, compared to the visual modality. We developed a task that leaves the auditory channels free of within-channel interference to examine which kind of speech stimuli enter consciousness more often. Specifically, we tested whether word valence affects the prioritization of utterances to awareness. In three experiments (two preregistered), 101 participants completed a visual task while a stream of pseudowords was played. Occasionally, a meaningful word appeared in the stream and, shortly after, participants were asked about its presence. The results show counter-intuitively that participants consciously heard more neutral words than negative ones, regardless of visual task difficulty. The intelligibility of pronunciation, alongside phonetic and lexical features, could not account for this effect. The results suggest that the emotional content influences how information is prioritized non-consciously.",

Eye gaze perception—a building block of social cognition—is altered in schizophrenia (SZ), manifesting as both reduced perceptual precision and stronger self-referential bias. Yet, the visual processing mechanisms influencing gaze precision and bias are unclear. This study examined the unique and joint contributions contour integration and visuospatial memory to altered eye gaze perception in SZ.\n\nMethods. A sample of 62 participants with SZ and 63 healthy controls completed a psychophysical gaze-perception task, which was used to measure perceptual precision and self-referential bias. Theorized visual processing mechanisms were indexed using measures of contour integration and visuospatial memory. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to determine the unique contributions of these visual processes to perceptual precision and self-referential bias.\n\nResults. Contour integration, but not visuospatial memory, explained unique variance in perceptual precision during eye gaze perception across groups. Conversely, contour integration did not explain unique variance in self-referential bias of eye gaze perception; however, visuospatial memory was a significant predictor of self-referential bias even after accounting for the effect of contour integration.\n\nConclusions. Results indicate that perceptual precision and self-referential bias of eye gaze perception may be differentially influenced by different visual processes in SZ as well as HC. These findings can inform the development of more precise interventions for social cognition in SZ.",

We hypothesized that children would feel closer, imitate more, and share more with a partner who moved in synchrony compared to one who moved asynchronously. In a group setting, motor synchrony and asynchrony were experimentally induced between the child and two experimenters. Bayesian analyses revealed no credible evidence for differences in affiliation, imitation, over-imitation, or prosocial behaviour between experimenters (BF10=0.045-0.216). A manipulation check indicated low motor synchrony scores, suggesting the intended synchrony may not have been fully achieved, potentially influencing the outcomes. These findings highlight the challenges of inducing motor synchrony in playful group contexts and raise questions about the conditions necessary for synchrony to impact social learning in young children.",

Results were consistent across samples, showing that 19% of barriers to allyship concerned features of the organizational context (e.g., lack of resources), 16% pertained to interpersonal dynamics (e.g., lack of trust from coworkers), and 25% referred to intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of knowledge about how to be an ally). Many (27.5%) claimed no barriers. We interpret findings using EST to theorize potential interactions among barriers and explore four promising organizational actions that target multiple barriers across levels of the ecological system: (1) expand opportunities for allyship, (2) diversify allyship strategies, (3) facilitate coalition-building between employee resource groups, and (4) tailor interventions to fit organizations’ unique barriers.

Drawing from cultural evolutionary theory, we examined the variation in outgroup mistrust, psychological reactance (a measure of nonconformity), conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy across three countries with different historical, political, and socio-cultural contexts. We tested the predictive role of outgroup mistrust and reactance in explaining conspiracy beliefs using rich, demographically representative cross-cultural data of over 4500 participants from the UK, US, and Turkey and hierarchical linear models. We used two measures of conspiracy beliefs: conspiracy mentality and belief in health conspiracies. As predicted, outgroup mistrust and psychological reactance had the largest effect sizes for belief in health conspiracies, and reactance had the largest predictive power for conspiracy mentality. Control variables such as belief in science, political orientation, religiosity, and demographic factors had minimal effects. Turkish participants had the highest conspiracy mentality and health conspiracy scores, along with higher levels of outgroup mistrust and reactance, while UK participants had the lowest. Belief in health conspiracies and conspiracy mentality were strongly associated with vaccine hesitancy across all three countries, with the highest hesitancy in Turkey. Moderation analyses revealed that outgroup mistrust was a stronger predictor of health conspiracy beliefs in Turkey, while reactance had a greater impact in the UK and the US. These results suggest that outgroup mistrust and signalling non-conformity play a crucial role in conspiracy beliefs and variations in their levels across cultures.

Yet, evidence relating action-impact knowledge with the frequency of pro-environment behaviors is limited and mixed. Additionally, some studies found little evidence of accurate action-impact knowledge among citizens, leading researchers to evaluate action impact perceptions - how much individuals believe actions are impactful - as a behavioral predictor. The current study examined the role of action-impact knowledge vs. perception in the engagement in pro-environmental behaviors across domains relevant to climate-change mitigation, namely, driving, flying, food choices, and saving energy and water. In a sample of Portuguese participants  (n = 386), we observed that action-impact knowledge varies: individuals often overestimated the potential of some low-impact behaviors (e.g., reducing littering) while underestimating some high-impact behaviors such as reducing meat consumption, and more accurately estimated others, like driving and flying. Our analysis showed that an overall higher action-impact perception, together with positive ecological attitudes, were more strongly associated with mitigation behaviors than objective action-impact knowledge per se. We conclude that efforts to promote behavioral change should focus on fostering positive ecological attitudes and communicating the mitigation potential of high-impact behaviors.",

We implemented a novel field experiment to elucidate how social information on gender is produced and transmitted among young men in an urbanising Tanzanian community. Men interviewed in front of their peers reported lower support for women’s empowerment compared to men interviewed privately. We interpret this finding as indicative of men modifying or strategically misrepresenting beliefs to match an assumed lack of support for women’s empowerment among their peers. We also found that men interviewed in front of community elders, assumed to hold relatively patriarchal beliefs, reported relatively low support for women’s empowerment. However, contrary to our expectations, men interviewed in the presence of highly-educated urban men, assumed to be more supportive of women’s empowerment, also reported lower support than when interviewed privately. Supporting qualitative data suggests that our assumptions about our comparison groups may be somewhat naive, with participants emphasising similarity rather than dieerences between themselves and those from the city.

Second, we evaluated literature examining imagery-based interventions, i.e., Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), in treating symptoms. Findings identify distressing mental imagery as a prominent feature in OCD. Intrusive imagery in OCD was characterised as vivid distressing visual images often accompanied by bodily sensations. Compared to other anxiety disorders, intrusive imagery in OCD occurred more frequently, which often led people to believe they possessed a “dangerous self”. Up to 89% of OCD patients reported experiencing intrusive imagery, with 70% to 79% also reporting that the intrusions related to adverse or traumatic events. Image-based treatments like ImRs and EMDR were found to be promising in reducing symptoms, providing an effective alternative treatment for patients suffering intrusive imagery.",

          "abstract": "After considering a more or less random number (i.e., an anchor), people’s subsequent estimates are biased toward that number. Such anchoring phenomena have been explained via an adjustment process that ends too early. We present a formalized version of the insufficient adjustment model, which captures the idea that decreasing the time that people have to adjust from anchors draws their estimates closer to the anchors. In four independent studies (N = 898), we could not confirm this effect of time on anchoring. Moreover, anchoring effects vanished in the two studies that deviated from classical paradigms by using a visual scale or a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm to allow faster responses. Although we propose that the current version of the insufficient adjustment model should be discarded, we believe that adjustment models hold the most potential for the future of anchoring research, and we make suggestions for what these might look like.",

GPT performed at near-human levels, proving to be a highly useful tool for thematic analysis. Our analyses revealed that strong climate denialists and believers tended to display greater dogmatism, with increased likelihood of stating that nothing would change their mind and lower likelihood of being unsure.

However, in\nthe real world, humans are increasingly sharing control with artificial intelligence (AI), with the\nparadigmatic case being partially automated cars. We designed an experiment that models the\nsharing of control between humans and AI in partially automated cars and found that when\nhumans (N=40) share control with an automated system that usually stops, human response\ninhibition is impaired when the automated system fails. This reveals a specific cost of sharing\ncontrol to human response inhibition, suggesting that the benefits of partial automation should\nbe weighed against the costs of impaired human cognitive control.",

However, it remains unclear whether these relationships represent causal effects. We therefore tested whether anxiety, depression, and stress affect (and are affected by) belief in conspiracy theories in a preregistered longitudinal study. We sampled participants from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (N = 970), with seven monthly waves (October 2022 to March 2023). Using a multiple indicator random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we found support for only one of 15 preregistered hypotheses: a small cross-lagged effect of anxiety on belief in conspiracy theories. We also found no evidence of belief in conspiracy theories itself provoking psychological distress. Our findings provide grounds for scepticism of the notion that beliefs in conspiracy theories are often motivated by psychological distress or feelings of “existential threat.”",

          "abstract": "Can art improve health and wellbeing? The rapidly growing art therapy literature claims that there is solid evidence that engaging with art ameliorates mental and physical disorders and increases wellbeing. This claim is used to justify numerous arts-based clinical interventions and health policies, so it deserves thorough scrutiny. Here we show that the evidence cited in favor of the efficacy of art therapy interventions is conceptually and methodologically flawed. Conceptually, experiments investigating the effects of arts-based interventions on health do not include appropriate tests nor control conditions that would allow demonstrating that the putative effects actually owe to the healing power of art: (i) they fail to define what art is, making it impossible to compare the effect of “art” and “non-art” stimuli and activities on health and wellbeing; (ii) they fail to demonstrate that “art” stimuli and activities elicit a distinct class of “art” experiences that modulate the mechanistic causes of disorders; (iii) and they fail to include causal manipulations of physiological processes believed to be mechanisms of action that could prove that art-induced processes affect the etiology of disorders. Methodologically, most studies cited as proof for the efficacy of art therapy lacked such common clinical trial procedures as defining the therapeutic agent, randomizing group assignment, controlling for patient or researcher allegiance, controlling for the effects of other concurrent interventions and medications, comparing art-based interventions to other kinds of interventions, or conducting and reporting statistical analyses appropriately. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence that art objects and activities can induce physiological changes to the human nervous system that result in health improvements and wellbeing. We discuss why proponents of art therapy have neglected these problems and the ethical implications for patients who are treated using art therapy.",

Between-persons, welcoming accountability, personal responsibility, and goal progress satisfaction were positively associated. Results: At the within-person goal-level, welcoming accountability and personal responsibility predicted higher subsequent levels of each other. However, satisfaction with goal progress only predicted subsequent welcoming accountability. Exploratory analysis of goal types revealed that participants reported more accountability, responsibility, and progress satisfaction for approach (versus avoidance) goals.

          "abstract": "Correlation coefficients play a central role in scientific research to quantify the (linear) association between certain key variables of interest. Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product-moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the re- search community.",

          "abstract": "Are humans naturally inclined to help others, or are we more focused on ourselves? How does the brain decide whether to put someone else’s needs ahead of our own? Helping, sharing, and cooperating are key human behaviors that have shaped societies and allowed civilizations to thrive. These prosocial actions often involve giving up something—like time, effort, or resources—to benefit others. Despite the personal cost, prosocial actions play a crucial role in building relationships, improving well-being and health, and tackling global challenges like climate change. Prosocial behavior is a complex concept with many layers. Researchers from psychology, neuroscience, economics, and other fields use a range of tools and methods to study it. This chapter explores human prosociality in several ways. It looks at how researchers measure prosocial behavior, examines the brain regions involved in making prosocial decisions, and discusses the factors that influence when and why people act in prosocial ways. Specifically, it outlines how environmental influences like stress and culture, along with individual differences such as age and genetics, shape prosocial behaviors. Finally, the chapter explores exciting trends and future directions in research, helping us better understand what drives humans to care for one another.",

A bi-factor for behavioral and emotional self-regulation was interpreted as representing a p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity), and respective scales were formed for both. Behavioral regulation in each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale (comprising subscales for Hyperactive/Inattentive, Aggressive, and Anxious behavior) and a Prosocial behavior scale. Self-ratings on these scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14. Twin modeling indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors. The inventory can be used for self- and sibling ratings in population studies.",

          "abstract": "People vary widely in how strategically they guide their attention during visual search. What drives this variation? We contrasted two possibilities: one in which individuals are predisposed to attend to different stimulus aspects, and another in which individuals flexibly choose their strategies depending on the task parameters. Using the Adaptive Choice Visual Search (ACVS) paradigm, we measured participants’ search strategies while probing various display features to index how participants attended the displays. Experiment 1 showed that participants who attended the stimulus properties that are essential for the optimal strategy—specifically, the numerosity subset information—exhibited more optimal performance. In Experiment 2, we made the subset information irrelevant for optimal task performance and found no relationship between attention to the subsets and search optimality, which is consistent with the strategic choice account. Experiment 3 encouraged attention to the subset information without explicitly requiring optimal search. Results showed a boost in optimality, suggesting that overcoming a reluctance to engage in numerosity judgments fosters better strategy use. Overall, these results help to explain individual variation in attentional strategy use, with optimal searchers judiciously directing their attention to process the critical stimulus properties while non-optimal searchers avoid doing so.",

To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Purpose: Family navigation (FN) has emerged as a promising intervention for reducing barriers and addressing social and economic inequities in autism service delivery. Little is known regarding the implementation and effectiveness of FN for children with autism. The aims of this scoping review are to: (1) summarize the breadth, quantity, and characteristics of the existing literature on FN for children diagnosed with autism; (2) describe the models and outcomes of FN for this population; and (3) identify knowledge gaps and provide directions for future research.\n\nMethods: Authors used the Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews. Searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science, resulting in identification of 479 papers. Two independent raters completed title/abstract and full text screening, followed by extraction of pertinent data using a researcher-developed tool. Synthesis of results involved content and constructs analysis and descriptive numerical summaries.\n\nResults: 17 publications met inclusion criteria. Seven studies evaluated FN programs delivered by a professional or peer navigator. Three studies assessed FN tools. Overall, the studies reported positive impacts on family activation, family well-being, parental knowledge, and service utilization. Navigator programs were generally found to be feasible and acceptable. However, none of the navigator programs addressed their effect on wait times to services or child-specific outcomes. \n\nConclusion: FN is a promising intervention for improving family outcomes and increasing service utilization. Further research is needed to establish best practices, identify child- and family-centered outcome metrics, and promote scalability and sustainability.",

          "abstract": "Humans have thousands of thoughts daily, often shaped by personal memories, goals, and environmental cues, that are deeply intertwined with emotional functioning. Our study explored if, how, and when common patterns of naturally occurring thought predict differences in emotion regulation (ER) ability across people and settings and, ultimately, well-being. Specifically, we examined how ongoing thought patterns shape ER variability—the ability to dynamically adjust and apply different emotion regulation strategies based on situational demands or personal goals—and negative affect in everyday life. Over seven days, 120 participants completed 3,286 experience sampling surveys to measure their ongoing thoughts, ER variability, and negative affect in daily life (data collected in 2023–2024). Principal components analysis identified common ‘thought patterns’, which we used to predict participants’ real-world ER variability and negative affect. One specific thought pattern—characterized by negative, intrusive, and distractive content—was linked to lower ER variability. This thought pattern also predicted increased negative affect, as captured by higher levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness and reduced social/emotional support, with the impact moderated by momentary ER variability. Social activities, such as texting or engaging in conversations, similarly mitigated the harmful effects of this thought pattern on well-being in daily life. Our findings illuminate how thought patterns influence ER dynamics and negative affect in complex real-world settings. They also underscore the protective power of social interactions, both digital and in-person, and the importance of enhancing flexible ER approaches to reduce the adverse effects of intrusive negative thoughts on mental health.",

          "authors": "James Lavers",
          "abstract": "Resistance to change is often attributed to habits, regression, cognitive rigidity, or avoidance behaviors, but these explanations fail to account for situational, unconscious behavioral overrides. This paper introduces Unconscious Clusters of Behavioral Artifacts (UCBAs)—developmentally anchored fallback responses that emerge under performance-based stressors or novel challenges requiring adaptation, bypassing adaptive adult responses. Unlike habits (Wood &amp; Rünger, 2016) or learned helplessness (Seligman, 1975), UCBAs are not passive; they actively redirect behavior into previously reinforced but outdated coping strategies. Rooted in psychosocial development (Erikson, 1950), stress-adaptive learning (Admon et al., 2020), and behavioral inhibition mechanisms (Gray &amp; McNaughton, 2000), UCBAs function as a neurocognitive safety mechanism, prioritizing predictability over progress. Unlike personality pathology (McAdams &amp; Pals, 2006), they are situational and reversible, overriding conscious intent without indicating chronic dysfunction. This framework positions UCBAs as distinct from existing models (Pittig et al., 2023; Diamond, 2013), illustrating how they override conscious intent rather than merely inhibiting action. The paper explores UCBA mechanisms, their implications for coaching and therapy, and strategies for disrupting these behavioral loops through structured intervention. Recognizing UCBAs expands our understanding of unconscious resistance, providing new pathways for behavioral adaptation and performance growth.",

          "authors": "Natalia Kartushina; Clara Martin",
          "abstract": "An important challenge in second language acquisition is learning how to produce novel sounds. Visual-acoustic feedback training has been shown to improve second language production, but it is still unclear whether training on isolated sounds transfers to words and is maintained over time. Forty-six Spanish speakers were trained to produce unfamiliar French vowels /e/-/ɛ/ through exposure to either single- or multiple-talker stimuli. On each trial, they heard a vowel, produced it, and received feedback showing the position of their vowel and the target in the acoustic space. Both groups showed improvements in vowel production, which transferred to words and were maintained twelve days later. However, better generalization – more accurate production when repeating vowels after an unfamiliar speaker - was maintained only in the multiple-talker group. This study shows that visual-acoustic feedback training is an effective method for improving second language production as the gains of such training demonstrate three key features for pedagogical practice: transfer, generalization and maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

          "abstract": "Visual foraging tasks, where participants collect items by touching or clicking on them, have\nbecome popular for investigating visual search. They probe selective attention in multi-target\ncontexts through naturalistic goal-directed actions, unlike the button presses used in many other\nparadigms. Despite their potential, such tasks had not been used to examine the interplay of\nattention and goal-directed actions until now, even though this topic has been extensively studied\nwith other paradigms and has significant implications for understanding human visual behavior in\nthe real world. In this study, we applied the visual foraging paradigm to address this gap. We found\nthat attentional prioritization of one part in a two-part compound object is accompanied by a motor\nbias in the collecting action (stylus tap) toward the prioritized part. This bias combines with motor\nprecision demands, such as aiming for stable contact points. Our findings show that action\nplanning not only modulates the attentional landscape at large but also that attentional asymmetries\n(e.g., prioritizing one object part) feedback into the motor system, combining with motoric factors\nto refine goal-directed actions",

          "authors": "Alexey Koshevoy; Jakub Szymanik",
          "abstract": "Both functional and lexical categories in natural languages are believed to be shaped by domain-general pressures for efficient information transmission and simplicity of representations. However, the origins of this simplicity-informativeness trade-off remain unclear, with previous research suggesting that it may stem from learning, communication, or both. In this paper, we propose that the domain-general bias for convexity -- a property whereby if a word applies to two objects in the conceptual space, it must also apply to all the objects between them -- fosters the optimization of this trade-off. Convexity, previously hypothesized to constrain the meanings of both content and logical words, likely reflects a fundamental property of cognitive representations shared across species, as evidenced by similar patterns in non-human animals. Using a gradual measure of convexity, shown to predict learning outcomes in artificial language learning experiments, we present evidence that color systems with the highest degree of convexity optimally balance simplicity and informativeness across different formulations of these measures. Additionally, we demonstrate that convexity is sensitive to rotations in color systems, with attested color systems exhibiting the highest degree of convexity. These findings suggest that the simplicity-informativeness trade-off emerges from the convexity of underlying representations, explaining why this trade-off is observed in both functional and content words, as lexicalization is likely constrained by convexity. Moreover, this explanation offers a more parsimonious account of why languages exhibit efficient phenomena like the simplicity-informativeness trade-off, relying solely on a single domain-general bias that applies across a broad range of linguistic categories.",

          "abstract": "Body dissatisfaction is closely linked to low self-esteem, reduced well-being, as well as mental health issues, and eating-related pathologies, which are increasingly prevalent worldwide, particularly among women. Understanding gender differences in body dissatisfaction is therefore an important issue. Previous studies often rely on small, non-representative samples from single developed countries.\nThis study aims to analyze gender differences in body dissatisfaction using two large-scale international surveys, covering 70,000 teenagers aged 15 to 16 across 9 countries and 200,000 teenagers aged 11 to 16 across 41 countries. \nGirls report significantly higher body dissatisfaction than boys, regardless of Body Mass Index, socioeconomic background, age, or country. Additionally, for girls, body image concerns appear more central, with body dissatisfaction showing stronger negative associations with life satisfaction and self-efficacy compared to boys. Within countries, the gender gap is more pronounced among high-performing students, teenagers from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, older teenagers, and those with higher BMI.\nThe gender gap in body dissatisfaction varies across countries, primarily driven by greater variability in girls' body dissatisfaction. Countries with larger gender gaps also show wider gender disparities in life satisfaction, eating disorders and depression. \nNotably, body dissatisfaction satisfies the Gender Equality Paradox, with larger gender differences in more developed countries, mainly due to higher dissatisfaction among girls.\nWe also examine the role of social norms. Stereotypes associating women more with physical appearance than abilities are more prevalent in more developed countries. Moreover, these stereotypes are associated with greater body dissatisfaction among women and larger gender differences in body dissatisfaction. Our analysis suggests that these stereotypes may at least partly explain the Gender Equality Paradox in body dissatisfaction.\nBy identifying the patterns and drivers of gender differences in body dissatisfaction, this study provides a foundation for more effective strategies to address this important issue.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is the ability to maintain focus on a specific goal over time,\nbut lapses in attention are frequent. Many theories have attributed these lapses to a\ntransient failure of control in maintaining the goal in mind. However, these proposals\nhave been challenged because recent findings have shown more engagement of\ncognitive control during states more prone to lapses. We hypothesized that lapses occur\nduring periods of high competition between goals, requiring stronger cognitive control.\nTo test this goal-competition hypothesis, we developed a Switch-Continuous\nPerformance Task in which subjects alternated task goals between blocks—either\nswitching or holding the same goal—in an effort to manipulate periods of higher and\nlower competition between goals. Participants viewed a bilateral display showing a\nscene (indoor/outdoor) and a face (male/female) on each trial. At the start of each 20-\ntrial block, a cue instructed participants to perform either the scene task (e.g., press for\nfrequent indoor scenes, not infrequent outdoor scenes) or the face task (e.g., press for\nfrequent male faces, not infrequent female faces). Results showed more attention lapses\nduring switch than repeat blocks, suggesting that lapses occur during periods of high\ncompetition between goals. In a second study, we monetarily rewarded performance on\nonly one task (scene or face) to create unequal competition between goals. We found\nthat switching to an unrewarded goal—but not a rewarded goal—produced more lapses.\nTogether, these findings support the goal-competition hypothesis as an explanation for\nthe occurrence of sustained attention lapses.",

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

A bi-factor for behavioral and emotional self-regulation was interpreted as representing a p-factor (general psychopathology) versus src-factor (self-regulation capacity), and respective scales were formed for both. Behavioral regulation in each was further categorized into a Problem behavior scale (comprising subscales for Hyperactive/Inattentive, Aggressive, and Anxious behavior) and a Prosocial behavior scale. Self-ratings on these scales had high correlations with co-twin ratings at age 17 and similarly formed scales for self- and co-twin ratings at age 14. Twin modeling indicated that the p-factor and src-factor are moderately heritable and influenced by both genetic and unique environmental factors. The inventory can be used for self- and sibling ratings in population studies.",

The correlation between TMD symptoms and depression was significant even among the participants without a TMD diagnosis.

          "authors": "Rudolf Debelak; Timo Kevin Koch; Matthias Aßenmacher; Clemens Stachl",
          "abstract": "Large language models and their use for text analysis have had a significant impact on psychology and the social and behavioral sciences in general. Key applications include the analysis of texts, such as social media posts, to infer psychological characteristics, as well as survey and interview analysis. In this tutorial paper, we demonstrate the use of the Python-based natural language processing software package transformers (and related modules from the Hugging Face Ecosystem) that allow for the automated classification of text inputs in a practical exercise. In doing so, we rely on pretrained transformer models which can be fine-tuned to a specific task and domain. The first proposed application of this model class is to use it as a feature extractor, allowing for the transformation of written text into real-valued numerical vectors (called \"embeddings\") that capture a text's semantic meaning. These vectors can, in turn, be used as input for a subsequent machine-learning model. The second presented application of transformer models is the end-to-end training (so-called \"fine-tuning\") of the model. This results in a direct prediction of the label within the same model that directly maps the text to the embeddings. While in the second case, results are usually better and training works more seamlessly, the model itself is often not directly interpretable. We showcase an alleviation of this issue via the application of post-hoc interpretability methods by calculating SHAP values and applying local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) in an attempt to explain the model's inner workings.",

This study aims to assess the frequency, motivations, and perceived effectiveness of LLM use for mental health support or therapy-related goals among U.S. residents with ongoing mental health conditions who have used LLMs in the past year. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18-80 with internet access who had used at least one LLM in the past year and reported having an ongoing mental health condition. Participants completed an anonymous 35-question online survey, covering patterns of LLM use, reasons for use, perceived effectiveness, comparison with human therapy, and problematic experiences. Survey responses suggest substantial adoption of LLMs for mental health purposes, with 48.7% of participants using them for psychological support within the past year. Users primarily sought help for anxiety (73.3%), personal advice (63.0%), and depression (59.7%). Notably, 63.4% of users reported improved mental health from LLM interactions, with high satisfaction ratings for practical advice (86.8%) and overall helpfulness (82.3%). When comparing LLMs to human therapy, evaluations were generally neutral to positive, with 37.8% finding LLMs more beneficial than traditional therapy.

Using an online survey designed in consultation with autistic people, we examined reasons why autistic adults living in the UK did not seek help from the National Health Service (NHS) when they last experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Participants who disaffirmed having sought help from the NHS (n = 754) were able to select from a prepopulated list of 20 reasons why and to enter their own. The three most commonly endorsed reasons were ‘I tried to cope and manage my feelings by myself’, ‘I did not think they could help me’, and ‘The waiting list is too long – no point’. Endorsement of reasons differed significantly with gender identity, age group, and degree of lifetime suicidality. Four themes emerged from analysis of free-form responses: NHS is ineffective, NHS as antagonistic, Fear and consequences, and Barriers to access. These findings highlight the need to foster more flexible healthcare systems capable of supporting autistic people, and that autistic people view as trustworthy and effective, to enable help-seeking behaviours with the potential to save lives.",

Participants are more likely to declare wanting to consume and to share material that generates more insight. We also observe that many participants choose to consume a new riddle or a new whodunit instead of immediately finishing the experiment, but that only High Insight riddles, and not whodunits, were significantly preferred.

          "abstract": "We investigated the content, consistency, and accuracy (i.e., convergence with self-assessment) of stereotypes about recreational users of common psychoactive substances. In Study 1 (N = 470), participants rated a typical occasional user of one of seven substances (cannabis, MDMA, heroin, LSD, cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol) on personality traits, values, and other attributes. Results revealed distinct and highly consistent stereotypes across substances. Study 2 (N = 1,163) assessed stereotype accuracy by comparing them to self-reports from an international sample of substance users. Accuracy (based on overall and distinctive similarity) was generally low, with cocaine user stereotypes revealing the highest accuracy. Modest accuracy was also found for MDMA, amphetamine, and heroin. These findings highlight the prevalence of consistent yet largely inaccurate stereotypes about recreational substance users in society. The discrepancy between stereotype agreement and accuracy is discussed in the context of the origins of these stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Individuals experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression have been shown to exhibit persistent underconfidence. The origin of such metacognitive biases presents a puzzle, given that individuals should be able to learn appropriate levels of confidence from observing their own performance. In two large general population samples (N = 230 and N = 278), we measure both “local” confidence in individual task instances and “global” confidence as longer run self-performance estimates while manipulating external feedback. Global confidence is sensitive to both local confidence and feedback valence – more frequent positive (negative) feedback increases (respectively decreases) global confidence, with asymmetries in feedback also leading to shifts in affective self-beliefs. Notably, however, global confidence exhibits reduced sensitivity to instances of higher local confidence in individuals with greater subclinical anxious-depression symptomatology, despite sensitivity to feedback valence remaining intact. Our finding of blunted sensitivity to increases in local confidence offers a mechanistic basis for how persistent underconfidence is maintained in the face of intact performance.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Jean-Louis van Gelder; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the ‘desperation threshold model’ (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or ‘cliff’, a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a ‘rock bottom’, a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people’s main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.",

This study seeks to address this gap by examining the impact of training with an AI-powered mobile application on nonnative sound perception and production. Participants completed a pretest assessing their ability to discriminate the second language English /iː/–/ɪ/ contrast and produce these vowels in sentence contexts. The intervention involved training with the Speakometer mobile application, which incorporated recording tasks featuring the English vowels, along with pronunciation feedback and practice. The posttest mirrored the pretest to measure changes in performance. The results revealed significant improvements in both discrimination accuracy and production of the target contrast following the intervention. However, participants did not achieve native-like competence. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-powered applications in facilitating speech acquisition and support their potential use for personalized, interactive pronunciation training beyond the classroom.",

Triggered by Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) reports, the intervention encouraged participants to activate their (digital) social support networks. \n\nMethods: Twenty-five participants completed 2,689 EMAs and received 377 JITAIs over an 18-day intervention period, including a micro-randomized trial design to compare four strategies to trigger an intervention: Fixed cutoff points of distress variables, personalized thresholds (through Shewhart Control Charts) of distress variable, momentary support need, and no intervention. \n\nResults: The results showed high feasibility, with participants completing 85% of EMA surveys, low study-related attrition rate (7%), and reporting minimal technical issues. Engagement and perceived helpfulness were heterogenous and moderate, with participants seeking support in one-third of triggered instances. JITAIs triggered by self-reported need for support were rated as more appropriately timed, helpful, and effective for promoting support-seeking behavior compared to those based on distress indicators, despite being triggered less frequently. Barriers such as time constraints and perceived unavailability of support providers likely affected support seeking behavior, as indicated by additional qualitative analyses. Exploratory effectiveness analyses indicate Cohen’s d effect sizes between 0.06 - 0.14 in reducing distress after JITAIs were received. \n\nConclusion: These findings demonstrate that a social support JITAI is feasible to implement, with high compliance and minimal technical issues. Yet, further research is needed to evaluate the JITAI’s effectiveness and to optimize trigger strategies in addressing individual needs and barriers to engagement.",

          "authors": "Margaret Catherine Macpherson; Amber Brown; Lynden K Miles",
          "abstract": "As a foundation of social interaction, interpersonal coordination is boosted in prosocial contexts but undermined by negative situations. Exactly how social factors shape coordination is, however, unknown. Previous literature demonstrates that for coordination to emerge people must attend to their interaction partners. This evidence, however, draws from sterile laboratory studies employing heavy-handed manipulations of little interpersonal relevance. By contrast, in more naturalistic contexts subtle differences in how people attend to themselves and others (e.g., a lingering glance vs. a suspicious side-eye) can profoundly change the course of interaction. Understanding how social factors shape interpersonal coordination therefore requires consideration of aspects of attentional behaviour that better characterise everyday interaction. To this end, the current research employed virtual reality (VR) to explore how two core features of social attention, focus (self vs. other) and partner gaze (direct vs. averted), influence the spontaneous coordination of arm and head movements. The results indicated that: (i) coordination was enhanced in the other (cf. self) focus condition; and (ii) coordination was diminished in the averted (cf. direct) gaze condition. These findings provide novel evidence to indicate that the emergence of interpersonal coordination varies as a function of the everyday attentional behaviours that punctuate naturalistic social exchange. Of broad theoretical note, here we demonstrate that the among the factors constraining interpersonal coordination, the distribution of attention between self and other plays a meaningful role.",

          "abstract": "We employed a modified battery of cognitive and social tests from psychological sciences intended to reflect key components of teamwork. These tests were given to five instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) to examine the capabilities of LLMs to contribute to teamwork. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. Language models performed well on action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These moments are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teams. Finally, LLMs had unique behaviours for interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how ‘off-the-shelf’ LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

          "abstract": "Given that emotional expressions are essential for navigating our social world, it is imperative that measures of facial expression recognition ability are psychometrically rigorous and easy to administer. Unfortunately, most studies to date have used face images of prototypically posed expressions, which lack the nuance and variation of real-life expressions and are often perceived as fake. To address the need for a more ecologically valid measure of expression recognition, we introduce the Naturalistic Expression Recognition Task (NERT), modeled after an established posed expression labeling task. We investigated whether the NERT shows expected associations with empathy and general cognitive ability, and whether these associations align with those found for the corresponding posed expression task, despite differences in the realism and perceived genuineness of the expressions. Across three studies, we found that the NERT had strong psychometric properties that make it well suited for examining individual differences in expression recognition ability. While both the NERT and the posed expression task showed similarly sized positive associations with measures of cognitive and affective empathy, the NERT exhibited a stronger positive association with cognitive ability than did the posed expression task. Our findings suggest that naturalistic expressions—which are more nuanced and varied than posed expressions—can offer equally, if not more, robust insights into expression recognition ability. The NERT serves as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to enhance the ecological validity of their studies by incorporating naturalistic stimuli.",

The evolution of cases of infection by the\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains worrying for public health, with prevention\nconsidered the only strategy for its control, especially with emphasis on Post-Exposure\nProphylaxis (PEP) after an episode of sexual violence. Method: Our goal was to analyze the\nstealth breeding experiences from the victims’ perspectives and the associated factors with\nseeking PEP among gay men who experienced stealth breeding in Brazil. This quantitative\nstudy followed the conceptual references of intersectionality, health care, and masculinities.\nResults: In total, 601 gay cisgender men from all regions of Brazil responded to an online\nsurvey in 2023.

In Study 2 and 3, psychology students (n=181)  and acting students (n=41) imagined events from a first-person, third-person, and fictional person perspective. Feelings of realness were closely related to, and often predicted by, ease of the imagining and one’s absorption into the imagining, with a differential supportive role of vividness and emotion, providing partial evidence for the fluency theory of reality monitoring. Trait absorption and fantasy proneness were both associated with greater felt realness of imaginings, but the more fictional the imagining, the more fantasy proneness supported feelings of realness.",

Effective healthcare for individuals with ASD requires a patient-centered approach that addresses their unique medical, emotional, and social needs. This study surveyed caregivers of individuals with ASD in Myanmar, gathering insights about their healthcare experiences, communication, and unmet needs. These findings aim to inform strategies to improve care and promote inclusivity in the healthcare system.\n\nObjective: This study explores the healthcare experiences of caregivers of individuals with ASD in Myanmar. It identifies challenges in communication, support, and service delivery while highlighting gaps in current care strategies. By examining caregivers' perspectives, the study aims to offer insights that will help shape patient-centered care practices that address the medical, emotional, and social needs of individuals with ASD. The ultimate goal is to promote inclusive, empathetic healthcare that enhances long-term outcomes for both individuals with ASD and their families.\n\nMethodology: A survey-based approach was used to collect data from caregivers of individuals with ASD in Myanmar. The survey included structured questions designed to assess caregivers' experiences with healthcare services, communication practices, and the challenges they faced. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends, while qualitative responses were examined through thematic analysis to uncover recurring patterns and key insights. This mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive understanding of the caregivers' experiences and highlighted areas for improvement in patient-centered care.\n\nResults: The survey revealed several challenges faced by caregivers of individuals with ASD in accessing and navigating healthcare. Quantitative data showed that a majority of respondents reported difficulties with communication between healthcare providers and patients. Many caregivers also expressed concerns about unmet needs related to sensory sensitivities and behavioral issues, which are common in individuals with ASD. The thematic analysis of qualitative responses further highlighted a lack of tailored care, insufficient provider training, and the need for greater caregiver involvement in decision-making. These findings underscore the importance of adopting inclusive, patient-centered care practices that consider both the medical and non-medical aspects of ASD care.\n\nConclusion: Adopting a patient-centered care approach and utilizing the biopsychosocial model can significantly enhance care for individuals with ASD. By addressing the unique health challenges faced by individuals with ASD through empathy, communication, and collaboration, healthcare providers can offer more effective and inclusive treatment. The study highlights the need to better support caregivers and patients by providing tailored care that respects their experiences and individual needs. Additionally, reducing stigma and promoting understanding about ASD are essential for improving long-term health outcomes and the overall quality of life for individuals with ASD. Ultimately, the findings emphasize the importance of fostering an inclusive, compassionate healthcare environment that supports both patients and their families.",

Our results show that personalized learners developed inaccurate representations about the categories and reported inflated confidence about incorrect decisions for what they have never or rarely studied before relative to non-personalized learners.

          "authors": "Andrew Jessop; Julian Pine; Fernand Gobet",
          "abstract": "According to chunking theories, children discover their first words by extracting sub-sequences embedded in their continuous input. However, the mechanisms proposed in these accounts are often incompatible with data from other areas of language development. We present a new theory to connect the chunking accounts of word discovery with the broader developmental literature. We argue that (a) children build a diverse collection of chunks, including words, multi-word phrases, and sub-lexical units; (b) these chunks have different processing times determined by how often each chunk is used to recode the input; and (c) these processing times interact with short-term memory limitations and incremental processing to constrain learning. We implemented this theory as a computational modelling architecture called CIPAL (Chunk-based Incremental Processing and Learning). Across nine studies, we demonstrate that CIPAL can model word discovery in different contexts. First, we trained the model with 70 child-directed speech corpora from 15 languages. CIPAL gradually discovered words in each language, with cross-linguistic variation in performance. The model’s average processing time also improved with experience, resembling the developmental changes observed in children’s speed of processing. Second, we showed that CIPAL could simulate seven influential effects reported in statistical learning experiments with artificial languages. This included a preference for words over nonwords, part words, frequency-matched part words, phantom words, and sub-lexical units. On this basis, we argue that incremental chunking is an effective implicit statistical learning mechanism that may be central to children’s vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Unemployed people face significant stigmatization, which leads them to experience, anticipate, and internalize their stigma and to use a range of strategies to cope with it. Despite its importance, the extent of this stigma remains largely unknown. Therefore, we conduct a victimization study and quantify the extent of unemployment stigma and its relationship to self-efficacy using survey data from a representative sample of 2,098 jobseekers. Study 1a finds high levels of acute, daily, and anticipated stigmatization and low levels of stigma internalization, with avoidance being a common behavioral strategy. Study 1b uses k-means clustering and uncovers three distinct profiles of stigma exposure that vary by age, family situation, and receipt of social benefits. Study 1c shows that these profiles predict differences in self-efficacy, independent of key demographic factors. The findings highlight the vulnerability of younger, single, welfare recipients who are most at risk for stigma and low self-efficacy.",

The present research (Study 1, N = 209; Study 2, N = 611; Study 3, N = 638) conducted in France, home to Western Europe’s largest Muslim community, failed to confirm the role of GRD in explaining variations in radicalism. Earlier research showed that GRD predicts activism, and that activism is positively correlated with radicalism. Consequently, we hypothesized and found that group membership (Muslims vs non-Muslims) is related to activism (not radicalism), that GRD mediates this relation between group membership and activism, and that GRD is predictive of radicalism only indirectly, via activism. The results also confirm that group-based contempt is uniquely predictive of support for violence, unlike group-based anger. The theoretical, methodological and policy implications of these findings are discussed.",

          "authors": "Florentin Woergoetter",
          "abstract": "Humans often interact with each other during daily life and many times one finds that one person (at least for some time) takes the lead while the other follows. Different from usual experimental settings in a lab, this happens without external influences and in a time-continuous manner. While knowledge that gazes onto the object to be manipulated precede a then-following manipulation action emerged long ago, little is known how gaze- and hand movement patterns develop in complex interactive scenarios where one person needs to consider the other’s action when planning their own.\nTo address this question in this study we investigate predictive, planning-related behavior during a two-player (Leader and Follower) table-top game. In this game – called “do-undo” – the Leader has to perform pick and place actions, following simple rules, to change the configuration of objects on the table. The Follower then has to use different objects to re-create the object-configuration back to the one that had existed before the Leader had acted. We track eyes, hand-movements and individual objects on the table and determine relations between eyes and hands of both players, with emphasis on the differences in behavior of Leader and Follower. Data is recorded using a setup where gaze tracking is combined with multicamera tracking of motion of the subjects and of the configuration on the table. The game proceeds without any external trigger signals and we address the problem of finding accurate time-points for phasing of the cooperative manipulation by using touch sensors on the hands of the players to record touching and untouching events by which we can unequivocally define the different temporal (inter-)action intervals for analysis.\nWhile gaze clearly precedes manipulation in all cases, we find clear differences in eye-movement patterns of Leader and Follower. The Leader makes more and earlier gazes on the objects to be manipulated. In a substantial proportion of trials, the Leader is predicting by his gaze not only their own, but also the required potential Follower-actions before their own manipulation. Also, the gaze data shows that the Leader takes more interest in re-checking the outcome of the do-undo manipulation pair. Indications of trying to memorize a configuration are also found in the gaze pattern of both. In addition, we often find sequences of alternating gazes towards objects and location where to put, which are much more expressed by the Leader than by the Follower. Intriguingly some patterns show that players pre-plan over longer periods and not just for their next action.\nThis clearly indicates different decision-making and planning characteristics for Leader as compared to Follower, which happen not only for own plan but also for potential action plans by the other shining a light on the complex cognitive processes that exist in daily human-human interaction.",

Momentary fluctuations in emotion differentiation are expected to introduce variability in using emotion regulation strategies, leading to sequential emotion intensity changes. Using five experience sampling datasets (N = 750, aged 11–25, 59.17% female, 25,834 observations) that repeatedly assess emotion differentiation and emotion regulation variability, we examined their interaction and impact on emotion intensity. Surprisingly, moments of heightened emotion differentiation were followed by more stable use of regulation strategies (lower variability), while moments of higher emotion regulation variability were followed by less emotion differentiation. Both heightened differentiation and regulation variability preceded contra-hedonic outcomes, such as increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions. These findings were robust across different types of emotion regulation variability (intensity or switching) and valences of emotions (positive or negative). In the short term, emotion differentiation predicts reduced regulation variability and may bring unpleasant changes in emotion intensity.",

          "authors": "Felix Haiduk; Nick Harley; Tudor Popescu",
          "abstract": "Humans are unique among social animals in having both music and language. A key approach to studying their evolution is identifying shared traits, like vocal learning or entrainment, across species and mapping them onto phylogenetic trees (Honing et al., 2015). Related to these traits, cross-cultural research revealed near-universal features specific for or shared by music and language (Savage et al., 2015). However, many crucial traits emerged after our split from chimpanzees, limiting this method's explanatory power. Understanding the evolutionary sequence and interaction of these traits could refine hypotheses about protolanguage and protomusic systems and their evolutionary relation. We propose adapting an evolutionary systems biology (ESB) framework aiming to identify causal interactions in evolving systems and define their possible evolutionary trajectories. Using dynamical systems modeling, this approach provides mechanistic explanations for phenotypic development and evolutionary transitions. The key domain to assess evolvability and robustness are the component dynamics of the system - in the original ESB framework gene expression dynamics linking genotype to phenotype (Jaeger &amp; Monk, 2021). In transferring this approach, we suggest investigating the domain of predictive dynamics mediating between cognitive traits (\"genotypic\") and spectrotemporal features (\"phenotypic\"). Here we attempted an ESB implementation by investigating predictability in song, instrumental music, and recited and descriptive speech from a cross-cultural dataset (Ozaki et al., 2024). We conceptualise predictive dynamics as interface between song/speech acoustics and cognitive capacities/goals and quantified it using the information-theoretic model IDyoMS (Pearce, 2005). This model operationalises auditory perception through \"viewpoints\" like pitch and duration. We computed information content and entropy across viewpoints and examined the resulting networks with graph-theoretic measures. We found that mean information content increased from descriptive to recited speech to song and instrumental music, forming a continuum with the highest predictability in instrumental music. However, we also observed that both network topographies and observed predictive patterns were similar between conditions, suggesting that construction and choice of viewpoints is highly influential. We also found song and speech to differ in specific subnetworks, suggesting that the same set of perceptual dimensions may still lead to different predictive dynamics. We propose that a framework from ESB can be applied to cognition to gain empirical insight into music and language evolution. We will discuss current limitations and future directions of operationalising predictive dynamics using information-theoretic viewpoint networks to investigate the evolutionary differentiation of song and speech.",

In principle, any word form that is not currently in the lexicon but adheres to the orthotactic rules of a language can be a novel word, including morphologically complex words but also pseudowords. However, such novel words differ in their semantic interpretability – how easily speakers can come up with an interpretation for them – which is of interest as both an independent and dependent variable in theory-building, computational modelling, and empirical studies. Here, we provide an overview of studies that make available (large) norms of semantic interpretability ratings and judgments, which will serve as a useful resource for such studies.",

          "authors": "Andrew Jessop; Julian Pine; Fernand Gobet",
          "abstract": "According to chunking theories, children discover their first words by extracting sub-sequences embedded in their continuous input. However, the mechanisms proposed in these accounts are often incompatible with data from other areas of language development. We present a new theory to connect the chunking accounts of word discovery with the broader developmental literature. We argue that (a) children build a diverse collection of chunks, including words, multi-word phrases, and sub-lexical units; (b) these chunks have different processing times determined by how often each chunk is used to recode the input; and (c) these processing times interact with short-term memory limitations and incremental processing to constrain learning. We implemented this theory as a computational modelling architecture called CIPAL (Chunk-based Incremental Processing and Learning). Across nine studies, we demonstrate that CIPAL can model word discovery in different contexts. First, we trained the model with 70 child-directed speech corpora from 15 languages. CIPAL gradually discovered words in each language, with cross-linguistic variation in performance. The model’s average processing time also improved with experience, resembling the developmental changes observed in children’s speed of processing. Second, we showed that CIPAL could simulate seven influential effects reported in statistical learning experiments with artificial languages. This included a preference for words over nonwords, part words, frequency-matched part words, phantom words, and sub-lexical units. On this basis, we argue that incremental chunking is an effective implicit statistical learning mechanism that may be central to children’s vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Vocabulary knowledge is foundational to educational success, but significant gaps exist between students from disadvantaged backgrounds or those with reading disabilities and their peers. These gaps have cascading effects, as children with lower vocabulary knowledge are less likely to acquire new words through independent reading and are less responsive to vocabulary instruction methods like read-alouds and explicit teaching. The effectiveness of explicit instruction relies on individualization, which typically places substantial demands on educators and thereby hinders the adoption of evidence-based methods. A potential solution is using audiobooks supplemented by explicit and individualized remote instruction from paraprofessionals. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) intervention study in which children listened to audiobooks along with text, either alone or with scaffolded instructional support. Third and fourth-grade students (N = 314, age: mean (SD) = 9.47(.56) years) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (Audiobooks-Only, Audiobooks+Scaffold, or active control) for 8 weeks. Participants in the two audiobook intervention groups showed significant improvements in receptive and expressive vocabulary, while the active control group showed no improvement. The effectiveness of the intervention varied based on reading ability and socioeconomic status (SES): poor readers benefited only in the Audiobooks+Scaffold group, whereas children from lower-SES backgrounds improved with audiobook access alone, especially if they were already proficient readers. Additionally, the Audiobooks+Scaffold group spent more time listening to recommended audiobooks during the study. These findings suggest that text-supplemented audiobooks, particularly when combined with personalized support, can be a valuable tool for supporting vocabulary development in struggling readers.",

          "abstract": "Stereotypical biases are readily acquired and expressed by generative AI, causing growing societal concern about these systems amplifying existing human bias. This concern rests on reasonable psychological assumptions, but stereotypical bias amplification during human-AI interaction relative to pre-existing baseline levels hasn’t been demonstrated. Here, we use previous psychological work on gendered character traits to capture and control gender stereotypes expressed in character descriptions generated by Open AI’s ChatGPT. In four experiments (N=782) with a first impressions task we find that unexplained (‘black-box’) character recommendations using stereotypical traits already convey a potent persuasive influence significantly amplifying baseline stereotyping within first impressions. Recommendations that are counter-stereotypical eliminate and effectively reverse human baseline bias, but these stereotype challenging influences propagate less well than reinforcing influences from stereotypical recommendations. Critically, the bias amplification and reversal phenomena occur when ChatGPT elaborates on the core stereotypical content, although ChatGPT’s explanations propagate counter-stereotypical influence more effectively and persuasively than black-box recommendations. Our findings strongly imply that without robust safeguards generative AI will amplify existing bias. But with safeguards, existing bias can be eliminated and even reversed. Our novel approach safely allows such effects to be studied in various contexts where gender and other bias-inducing social stereotypes operate.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes behave differently depending on whether they are interacting online (by email, social media, etc.) vs. interacting in person.

Study 1 found that the very same behavior is regarded as less reflective of the true self when it is performed online. Study 2 showed that this effect is not merely a matter of perceived impression management. Study 3 found that there is a general tendency such that behavior is seen as more reflective of the true self when it is performed in an environment regarded as “natural.” In Study 4, a manipulation that led participants to see online behavior as more natural had a downstream effect on the degree to which this behavior was seen as reflecting the true self. Taken together, these results suggest that people’s judgments about online behavior are not simply a reflection of idiosyncratic facts about the online sphere in particular but are instead driven in part by a far more general psychological process involving perceptions of naturalness.",

          "authors": "Jumpei Yamashita; Haruo Oishi; Takatsune Kumada",
          "abstract": "Introduction: The traditional RIASEC model organizes occupational preferences into a circular structure with two orthogonal dimensions: People-Things and Data-Ideas. In contrast, a more recent model of occupational personality traits (O-E-A) emphasizes Openness to Experience (Openness), Extraversion, and Agreeableness within a three-cluster circular arrangement, which does not follow the R-I-A-S-E-C order. Do these frameworks represent distinct constructs or share an underlying structure?\n\nMethods: This study investigated whether applying RIASEC's relative, within-person scoring procedure to the O-E-A framework, originally based on absolute scoring, could reveal shared orthogonal dimensions: People-Things (A-S-E to C-R-I) and Data-Ideas (E-C to I-A). The analysis involved reanalyzing large-scale data in which participants rated themselves on the Big Five personality traits and on their preferences for 13 O-E-A job categories. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) and canonical correlation analyses (CCA) were conducted to explore the relationships between these variables, with job preferences transformed into relative values.\n\nResults: Extraversion and Openness emerged as the most influential predictors of 13 relative preferences in the MLR analysis. The CCA revealed two orthogonal preference dimensions corresponding to People-Things (Extraversion-Introversion) and Data-Ideas (Openness-Closedness). The RIASEC sequence emerged within the relativized O-E-A framework, revealing two orthogonal axes: Extraversion (C-R-I to A-S-E) and Openness (E-C to I-A).\n\nDiscussion: These findings suggest that discrepancies between the O-E-A personality model and RIASEC preferences may partly arise from differences in scoring methods. Relative scoring highlights how individuals prioritize one job domain over another, revealing a shared motivational structure underlying both frameworks. These results support integrating personality-based occupational insights with traditional preference models.",

          "abstract": "To solve problems, people tend to add new components to them rather than subtract from them. Across experimental and naturalistic studies, we examined if more additive (to start something new or do more) than subtractive advice (to stop or do less) is given when humans and artificial intelligence give mental health advice. Compared to subtractive advice, additive advice was recommended more frequently and was rated as more effective and feasible by recipients. Several moderators of this effect are explored: Older people are more additive than younger people, who we are advising (e.g., strangers/friends) matters, as does the type of pre-existing mental health-affecting activities (e.g., gambling versus avoiding exercise). People feel that they are overburdened and yet we often tell them to do more. When helping people with their mental health, advice givers must balance what can be added to life with what needs to be removed.",

          "abstract": "When studying mood or affective state, it is useful to collect free-text input from participants relevant to their mood alongside traditional assessment batteries. Quantifying free-text data in relation to quantitative measures remains a challenge. We propose a novel application of an Elo rating system for analysing verbatim human text descriptions of emotionally salient experiences. By using crowdsourced pairwise comparisons, our approach preserves the richness of free-text data while generating a quantitative representation. We apply the same approach to various LLMs to compare their performance against humans. Regression analyses indicate that rankings generated by LLMs  predict human rankings, demonstrating strong explanatory power across models. Applying LLMs to this task offers the added advantages of greater efficiency and lower cost. We discuss the potential applications of this method in human research and explore critical considerations regarding the use of LLMs in emotionally relevant tasks.",

          "abstract": "The author reviews psychologist Eric Turkheimer’s 2024 book \"Understanding the Nature-Nurture Debate.\" Turkheimer is known for taking a critical position within the field of behavioral genetics. While mentioning several important limitations, Turkheimer upholds the validity of the heritability concept, twin studies, and adoption studies. The author notes that “heritability” is a disputed concept, and briefly describes what he sees as the invalidating aspects of behavioral and psychiatric genetic twin and adoption studies. He then reviews Turkheimer’s analysis of DNA-based (molecular genetic) behavioral research methods such as linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association (GWAS), and polygenetic score (PGS) studies. The first two methods ended in failure. Although GWAS and PGS researchers have claimed many “gene-behavior associations,” Turkheimer shows that, after decades of attempts, DNA-based research has failed to uncover genetic variants shown to cause human behavioral differences. Disagreements between Turkheimer and behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin are also examined. The author, though not Turkheimer, concludes that DNA-based research failure provides additional evidence that the critics of twin studies, adoption studies, and the heritability concept were right all along. As the behavioral genetic paradigm unravels, the social and behavioral sciences should begin working on a new environmentally focused post-behavioral genetics developmental paradigm.",

          "abstract": "In many languages, count nouns trigger a comparison by number (e.g., too many strings), while mass nouns typically do not (e.g., too much string). However, object-mass nouns like furniture exhibit mass syntax but often support a comparison by number (e.g., too much furniture → too many items; Barner &amp; Snedeker, 2005). Some theories argue that object-mass nouns lexically specify individuation, making them semantically like count nouns in that they induce a comparison by number (Bale &amp; Barner, 2009), while others propose that only count nouns force numerical comparisons, leaving object-mass nouns open to contextual shifts (Rothstein, 2017; McCawley, 1975). We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing English quantity judgments for object-mass nouns to (1) collective count nouns, and (2) French judgments for translations of object-mass nouns. In each case, we found that object-mass nouns behaved like count nouns, and were no more susceptible to contextual effects. These findings support the view that object-mass nouns and count nouns specify individuation to the same extent.",

We test the hypothesis that believers will differ in their willingness to apply karmic explanations to their own experiences compared to the experiences of other people, such that they are more willing to explain their own positive experiences as caused by their own karmic merit (to satisfy self-enhancement motives), while being more willing to explain other people’s negative experiences as karmic punishment for others’ misdeeds (to satisfy justice motives).\nMethods: In three studies (total N = 2041), we ask participants to recall events believed to have been caused by karma in their own life, and events believed to have been caused by karma in the lives of other people, and we code whether these descriptions of karma-caused events are primarily positive or negative, using a combination of human coders, sentiment analysis, and participants’ self-reported evaluations of the events.\nResults: Results consistently show that positive experiences are more likely to come to mind when they think about how karma influences their own life, but negative experiences are more likely when thinking about other’s karma, although this difference was weaker in Singapore and India than in the United States. \nConclusions: Results are consistent with predicted self-enhancement biases in karmic attributions, and show how personal motivations predict willingness to adopt supernatural explanations for specific life events.",

Results of our Bayesian multilevel modelling (n=95) found trust in reliable alerts supported task focus but had limited impact on response times. Task-switching interruptions led to a decline in immediate performance, which improved over time, and that image classification accuracy was unaffected by perceived workload, although moderate increases in effort and frustration improved accuracy.

          "abstract": "Salience models for complex scenes typically aim to explain heatmaps or scan-paths. While heatmaps potentially conflate fixations serving different functions, scan-paths aim for a level of detail which is hard to attain. We introduce a novel approach, based on the premise that most fixations target objects and belong to three functionally meaningful classes: Detection fixations (D), foveating an object for the first time; Inspection fixations (I), successively targeting object details; and Return fixations (R), revisiting an object, e.g., to refresh its representation in memory. To test the hypothesis that these classes capture distinct fixation profiles, we reanalysed a large dataset of scene fixations. We computed separate heatmaps for D, I, and R and found significantly higher inter-observer consistency within than between classes. Across fixations landing on different semantic features, the proportion of D, I, and R fixations varied consistently, and a semantic salience model trained to predict each class independently learned diverging distributions of feature weights. Further, we found a shift from D to I and R across viewing time, in line with their functional interpretation and previous findings on ambient and focal viewing modes. We tested and confirmed that the dynamics of this shift varied as a function of trial duration. Finally, we found that the D, I, R classification could be approximated with a simple spatial heuristic, extending its applicability to images without object metadata. We propose the D, I, and R classification as a simple but powerful tool to functionally classify scene fixations and provide well documented code to implement it.",

However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide individual learning—whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted ‘actor-critic’ models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, self-reinforcement, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.",

Participants either vocalized spontaneously generated words or let their mind wander during 2 to 3-minute runs, and were instructed to report thought transitions with a key press. We first validate this subjective mental event segmentation, which enables us to measure the duration of coherent thought episodes. We then turn to model comparison to show that the timing of thought transitions is best explained by an accumulation-to-threshold mechanism. We further find that the threshold of this accumulation – but not the accumulation rate – negatively correlates with participants’ trait tendency for mind-wandering, highlighting the role of mental impulsivity in thought transitions.",

Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), has been widely used for scientific research. Yet, few studies have explored their potential to advance social science research. This research evaluates how effectively ChatGPT can mimic responses from real human participants on online crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), Prolific, and CloudResearch. We replicated 22 studies published in top psychology journals between January 2023 and June 2023. Since ChatGPT 4.0’s cutoff date is September 2021, its training database does not include articles published after that time. The current research is among the first to use ChatGPT to replicate social science studies whose conclusions have not been included in the training database of ChatGPT. This unique methodology strengthens the credibility of our findings and establishes a more robust foundation for applying AI in simulating human behavior. The results show that ChatGPT successfully replicates about 93.2% (20.5/22) of the findings from these studies. While conducting these studies (assuming each study is a typical 5-minute online experiment with 300 participants) on online crowdsourcing platforms could take approximately 11 days and cost around $3,960, using AI through a platform we term “AITurk” could reduce the time to about 11 minutes and the cost to $132. That is, AITurk achieves about 93.2% accuracy of real human participants’ responses on online crowdsourcing platforms, with about 1/1440 time and 1/30 cost. Based on these findings, we suggest that ChatGPT can be an effective tool for social science research, especially for conducting preliminary research and evaluating the replicability of existing studies.",

A systematic review of existing literature was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of A reference was selected if: a) the study was conducted in either an East Asian or Southeast Asian country, b) described post-funeral rituals, and c) addressed grief outcomes. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify common themes when carrying out death rituals. Ten studies were included for review. Quantitative findings revealed correlations between funeral satisfaction and physical health, as well as funeral satisfaction and decreased distress over time. Qualitative studies suggested the following themes: 1) death as taboo, 2) family support, 3) public display of grief, and 4) continuing bonds. Our scope review suggests rituals as a mechanism for recovery from the death of a family member. Mourning rituals do not just provide support at the time of death but also help them adjust over time.

While IRT provides valuable item-level analysis for measuring latent constructs, traditional frequentist approaches require large samples, especially for complex multidimensional models. Using data from Chinese secondary mathematics teachers (n=155), I illustrate how Bayesian methods effectively address these limitations through a transparent workflow that integrates theoretical frameworks with statistical modeling. I compare competing theoretical models—unidimensional, correlated-traits, and bi-factor structures—to identify the optimal representation of teachers' equity beliefs across mathematics, learner, and pedagogy dimensions. Through systematic model iterations involving different response scale structures and link functions, the results support a bi-factor structure, revealing that mathematics teachers' beliefs about equity form a complex system where both general inclusive beliefs and dimension-specific beliefs coexist. The findings also indicate differential functioning by gender and school district, with female teachers and those from higher socioeconomic districts demonstrating stronger inclusive beliefs.",

In particular, we derive the exact bootstrap distribution based on the principle of Magis's algorithm. Next, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the parametric bootstrap SE under the independent but not necessarily identically distributed condition. We prove the consistency of the parametric bootstrap SE. The asymptotic relative efficiency of it over the Fisher information SE is also established. The second part contains an improvement of the parametric-bootstrap algorithm for SE to reduce computational complexity. Using minimal sufficient statistics, we develop an accelerated version of the algorithm for the two-parameter logistic model. The last part concerns the small sample analysis. We conduct a series of simulations comparing the performance of the SE estimator from our proposed algorithm with that from the information-based method. We also illustrate an application of our algorithm on test construction using existing data with small item numbers. \nOverall, the results reveal an advantage of our newly developed method over the the information-based method for assessing the precision of the ability estimator in IRT.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sensory changes are commonly observed in individuals with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) but remain under-researched.\nObjectives: This study examined the prevalence of sensory changes after msTBI and relationships with emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction.\nMethods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted including 387 participants with msTBI (M=12.8 years post-injury; range=0.4–35.0) and 60 controls, not matched on age and sex but recruited in the same time period. Self-reported sensory symptoms were assessed using a custom checklist and the Somatic Symptom Scale–8. Emotional distress, functional disability, and life satisfaction were measured through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 12-Item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Satisfaction With Life Scale. We compared the frequency of sensory symptoms between groups, and associations with demographics, injury factors, and clinical outcomes were examined within the msTBI sample.\nResults: 70% with msTBI reported experiencing ≥1 sensory changes due to their brain injury, and 35% reported experiencing dizziness in the previous week, averaging 2.2 symptoms in total—significantly higher than controls after adjusting for age and sex. Sensory changes were more common in younger participants (light hypersensitivity), females (light and noise hypersensitivity), those with more severe TBI (overall sensory changes, affected vision, reduced smell), and those fewer years post-injury (overall sensory changes, noise hypersensitivity, reduced smell, altered taste, dizziness), though many of these associations did not survive multiple comparison correction. Sensory changes were clearly and consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes, with medium-large effect sizes for emotional distress and functional disability and smaller effects for life satisfaction.\nConclusions: Although causality cannot be established, these findings suggest that sensory changes are a clinically significant issue after msTBI, even among individuals more than a decade post-injury on average. This underscores the need for routine assessment and further research on underlying mechanisms and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This research examines cardiovascular response to everyday threats and challenges during wakefulness and sleep. Approximately eleven thousand people, who comprised a diverse sample ethnically but not socioeconomically, completed three weekly morning and evening surveys in which they indicated whether they expected and experienced threats and challenges that day. Participants also provided measures of blood pressure on morning surveys and provided measures of average heart rate during the day and resting heart rate when asleep via their WHOOP biometric capture device. Enrollment began in April, 2024 and data collection ceased in July, 2024. Results indicated that both threat and challenge were associated with higher blood pressure and higher average heart rate during the day. In contrast, when people were asleep, threat was associated with higher resting heart rate but challenge was associated with lower resting heart rate. These results suggest that the body achieves more restorative sleep in preparation for perceived challenges but not for perceived threats, raising the possibility that the greater stress associated with threats disrupts the body’s capacity for restorative sleep. The generalizability of these results to members of economically marginalized groups remains an open question.",

          "authors": "Li Zhaoping",
          "abstract": "Our brain recognizes only a tiny fraction of sensory input, due to an information processing bottleneck. This blinds  us to most visual inputs. Since we are blind to this blindness, only a recent framework highlights this bottleneck by  formulating vision as mainly looking and seeing. Looking selects a tiny fraction of visual information for progression  through the bottleneck, mainly by shifting gaze to center an attentional spotlight. Seeing decodes, i.e., recognizes,  objects within the selected information. Since looking often occurs before seeing and evokes limited awareness,  humans have the impression of seeing whole scenes clearly. According to the new framework, the bottleneck starts  from the output of the primary visual cortex (V1) to downstream brain areas. This is motivated by the evidence- backed V1 Saliency Hypothesis (V1SH) that V1 creates a saliency map of the visual ﬁeld to guide looking. Massive \nvisual information loss downstream from V1 makes seeing vulnerable to ambiguity and illusions (errors). To overcome  this, feedback from downstream to upstream areas such as V1 queries for additional relevant information. An integral  part of this framework is the central-peripheral dichotomy (CPD) theory proposing that vision in the peripheral and  central visual ﬁelds are specialized for looking (deciding where to shift the gaze) and seeing, respectively, and that the  feedback query to aid seeing is mainly directed to the central visual ﬁeld. This V1SH-Bottleneck-CPD framework  predicts that the peripheral visual ﬁeld, lacking feedback queries, is more vulnerable to illusions, and that such  illusions become visible in the central visual ﬁeld when the feedback query is compromised. We present theoretical  predictions, experimental conﬁrmations, a Feedforward-Feedback-Verify-and-reWeight (FFVW) algorithm for seeing  through the bottleneck, and indicate how the framework explains visual crowding, grouping, understanding, and  post-V1 visual cortical areas.",

          "authors": "James Lavers",
          "abstract": "Resistance to change is usually chalked up to habits, cognitive rigidity, or avoidance behaviors. But none of these explanations quite cover what happens when someone is all geared up for change, even motivated, but their actions keep looping back to the same old counterproductive behaviors. I call these Unconscious Clusters of Behavioral Artifacts (UCBAs)—behavioral echoes from earlier stages of psychosocial development that emerge under pressure or novel experiences. They’re not habits formed through repetition, and they’re not conscious strategies of avoidance. They’re automatic, fallback mechanisms—deeply ingrained coping responses from earlier developmental stages that show up when a person’s current strategies feel insufficient or under threat. They mimic, but are distinct from, phenomena like cognitive rigidity or the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). While habits are built over time through reinforcement, UCBAs are like behavioral fossils—old strategies that resurface to reassert safety and predictability when someone encounters threshold challenges. What makes this interesting is that UCBAs seem to have been reinforced by early success at a particular developmental stage, which means the behavior persists even if it’s completely inappropriate for the current context. This paper argues that understanding UCBAs could be a missing link in explaining why people get stuck in cycles of ineffective behavior, despite having all the knowledge and intention to change. And if we can make this unconscious process conscious, we open the door to real, lasting transformation.",

          "abstract": "The successor representation balances flexible and efficient reinforcement learning by learning to predict the future, given the present. As such, the successor representation models stimuli as what future states they lead to. Therefore, two stimuli that are perceptually dissimilar but lead to the same future state will come to be represented more similarly. This is very similar to an older behavioral paradigm -the acquired equivalence paradigm, which measures the generalization of learned associations. Here, we test, via computational modeling, the plausibility that the successor representation is the mechanism by which people generalize knowledge learned in the acquired equivalence paradigm. Computational evidence suggests that this is a plausible mechanism for acquired equivalence and thus can guide future empirical work on individual differences in associative-based generalization.",

This uncertainty creates a challenge: How do we decide what asset to invest in and when to divest from an underperforming asset? In this paper, we propose a normative model of asset selection and switching. We hypothesize that people use Bayesian function learning to extrapolate asset performance trajectories and choose assets based on anticipated final performances at a task-specific time horizon. We test the model in three experiments (N = 380) that manipulate the setup (selection versus switching), time horizons, and statistical properties of asset performance trajectories. The model outperforms myopic alternatives inspired by foraging and study time allocation. Our work highlights the role of probabilistic forecasting---integrating prior knowledge with observed asset performance---in guiding complex decisions about uncertain future outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This study examines different approaches to modeling change over time, comparing growth curve models with difference equation models. Growth curve models provide a descriptive framework for capturing longitudinal trends but primarily serve as phenomenological tools that summarize observed trajectories. In contrast, difference equation models offer a process-based perspective, modeling system dynamics iteratively and allowing researchers to explore change processes. This study’s empirical analyses highlight both the advantages and limitations of such models. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of difference equations in capturing system dynamics, but high levels of variability in early time periods can make the models fit somewhat poorly in some cases. Findings suggest that while growth curve models remain valuable for summarizing change, difference equation models provide deeper insights into the mechanisms driving temporal processes. Future research should explore hybrid modeling approaches that integrate these frameworks, using dynamical systems theory to enhance psychological and organizational research.

          "abstract": "Individuals with eating disorders present with heterogenous cognitive-affective symptom profiles, whereas behavioral symptoms tend to be more homogenous. For example, dietary restriction is a common behavioral symptom across the eating disorders; however, the cognitive-affective factors that predict restriction may vary among persons. The aim of this study was to examine which variables are associated with dietary restriction in group-level models of eating disorder pathology and describe how these symptoms compare to the associations evidenced in person-specific models. We collected time-intensive longitudinal data from 26 participants with eating disorders. Participants provided a mean of 355.92 observations across a 90-day period. We estimated group-level models using group iterative multiple model estimation including nodes with the six highest means for the sample. We estimated idiographic (N=1) models by using regularized graphical vector autoregressive models including nodes with the six highest means for each participant. Nodes included in the group-level model were anxiety, feeling fat, fear of weight gain, overevaluation of weight and shape, drive for thinness, and the urge to restrict. In the group-level model, aside from the autoregressive relationship, fear of weight gain was the only variable associated with the urge to restrict. In idiographic models, the urge to body check was the most common variable associated with the urge to restrict, followed by anxiety and feeling fat. Findings from the group-level model were rarely maintained at the individual level. Idiographic models may provide more tailored conceptualizations of eating disorder symptom dynamics related to dietary restriction relative to group-based models.\nKeywords: eating disorders, dietary restriction, idiographic, network analysis, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, OSFED",

Despite being heralded amongst the “kinematic laws of nature” (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, common reporting practice, or vetted analytical protocol. Many legacy elements of analytical protocols in the literature are suboptimal, such as noise amplification from repeated differentiation, biases arising from filtering, log transformation distortion, and injudicious linear regression, all of which undermine power law calculations. This article reviews prior power law calculation protocols, identifies suboptimal practices, before proposing solutions grounded in the kinematics literature and related fields of enquiry. Ultimately, we synthesise these solutions into a vetted, modular protocol which we make freely available to the scientific community. The protocol’s modularity accommodates future analytical advances and permits re-use of modules useful in broader kinematic science applications. We propose that adoption of this protocol will eliminate spurious confirmation of the law and enable more sensitive quantification of recently noted power law divergences. These divergences have been linked to neurochemical disturbances arising from ingestion of dopaminergic drugs, and in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and autism.",

The motivation for a post-school pathway and perceptions of the impact of moving out of home, ending a relationship, and entering a new relationship were examined as potential predictors of between-person differences in well-being trajectories. German-speaking high school graduates (N = 897) reported on their affective well-being in up to four surveys over approximately one year and indicated their motivation for their post-school pathway and life events they had experienced. At three measurement occasions, participants also participated in a three-week experience sampling phase, in which they reported on their daily well-being. Latent change models revealed an initial increase in well-being after graduation, but mixed evidence for subsequent trajectories, as both positive and negative affect decreased on average. Changes in well-being were more pronounced for global assessments of affective well-being. We did not find associations of the motivation for a post-school pathway and the life events with well-being trajectories. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of well-being trajectories during the transition out of upper secondary education and the importance of using multiple time points and assessment methods to understand these dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that our perception of time is tied to the embodiment of space. They suggest that time is perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and differently prior to and after an interaction with space using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 282 younger (18-35 years) and elderly (60-75 years) participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training and either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm. For young participants, prior to training the reproduced intervals were significantly longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm), though this effect was not observed for the elderly. For young participants, tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. This effect was again absent in the elderly, resulting in a significant group-difference. In both groups, participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups but the effect sizes were generally small, pointing to systematic but weak effects. Overall, this supports previous claims that time perception is tied to space and our interaction with this when we are young, though further work is required to understand the robustness and specificity of these effects.  \n\nKeywords: Time perception, Peripersonal Space, Space Representation, Active Tool-use, Aging",

We lack clear theoretical foundations of critical periods and the effects they generate, which breeds disagreement about how to conceptualize and study them, as well as how to turn empirical findings into pedagogical practice. Here, we develop a computationally-motivated framework for explaining how experience can contribute to the emergence of CPEs. In building our framework, we offer a precise definition, a methodology for identification, and geometric intuitions for the influence of experience on CPEs. We identify three qualitatively different ways in which experience-driven CPEs can emerge, and use simple computational models to illustrate each of these possibilities. With this work, we hope to provide more structure and intuition to the study of CPEs in a way that is useful across neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and machine learning.",

          "abstract": "Nobody knows exactly how consciousness is produced. To make matters worse, nobody even knows what consciousness is. In this article, I provide insight into what consciousness is, and how it is produced, by showing that consciousness is faster than light. I also show that consciousness is a new faster-than-light phenomenon; as opposed to coming from non-local quantum mechanics. To be clear, I have not disproven Einstein’s theory of relativity; instead, I have discovered a loophole in Einstein’s theory of relativity that applies to consciousness. The discovery that consciousness is faster than light is important, because it shows that consciousness cannot be a particle, energy, or anything else located in space (e.g. not a soul). In other words, we can now conclude that consciousness is non-energy information. Where does this non-energy information (i.e. consciousness) come from? The discovery that consciousness is faster than light excludes numerous theories of consciousness while also enabling new theories of consciousness. For example, a computational theory of consciousness was previously untenable due to the fact that there is no convergence point in the brain for all information and the speed limit of light prevented the conscious observer from accessing all of the distributed information in the brain, but now a computational theory of consciousness is plausible. I show rare case reports and evidence that support the theory that consciousness (i.e. non-energy information) is, at least in part, produced directly from “non-trivial” computations.",

          "abstract": "The past few years have seen a surge in the application of quantum theory methodologies and quantum-like modeling in fields such as cognition, psychology, and decision-making. Despite the success of this approach in explaining various psychological phenomena — such as order, conjunction, disjunction, and response replicability effects — there remains a potential dissatisfaction due to its lack of clear connection to neurophysiological processes in the brain. Currently, it remains a phenomenological approach.\nIn this paper, we develop a quantum-like representation of networks of communicating neurons. This representation is not based on standard quantum theory but on {\\it generalized probability theory} (GPT), with a focus on the operational measurement framework. Specifically, we use a version of GPT that relies on ordered linear state spaces rather than the traditional complex Hilbert spaces. A network of communicating neurons is modeled as a weighted directed graph, which is encoded by its weight matrix. The state space of these weight matrices is embedded within the GPT framework, incorporating effect-observables and state updates within the theory of measurement instruments — a critical aspect of this model. This GPT-based approach successfully reproduces key quantum-like effects, such as order, non-repeatability, and disjunction effects (commonly associated with decision interference). Moreover, this framework supports quantum-like modeling in medical diagnostics for neurological conditions such as depression and epilepsy.\nWhile this paper focuses primarily on cognition and neuronal networks, the proposed formalism and methodology can be directly applied to a wide range of biological and social networks.",

While best established in psychosis-spectrum illness, data also support the presence of this abnormality in other neuropsychiatric illnesses that vary in their association with disruption of visual sensory circuits. In this piece, we ask whether an over-weighting of expectations may be conceived of as a compensatory response to incoming sensory noise. \n\nWe make the case that visual hallucinogenesis across a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders can be captured within a common Bayesian computational framework, as a compensatory response to sensory signal disruptions at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. We focus on three specific disorders (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Schizophrenia) with prominent visual hallucinations and highlight the fact that these disorders describe a spectrum of visual impairment where the overtness and localization of the visual processing disruption is reflected in the characteristics of the emergent visual hallucinations. We examine how discrete sensory disruptions in Charles Bonnet Syndrome translate to hallucinations via known circuits, and then how different disruptions in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Schizophrenia may lead to hallucinations with distinct phenomenology, comorbidities, and circuit involvement. Finally, we appeal to emerging computational theories to unite these observations under a common conceptual umbrella.\n\nTaken together, this work presents a means of understanding how sensory disruptions could interact with other aspects of cognitive and neural architecture to produce hallucinations across neuropsychiatric disease. It is our hope that this framework will help in efforts to identify pathophysiologically distinct patient subgroups and new pharmacological and circuit-based interventions.",

First, we explain the history of item-writing guidelines.

Second, we critique the current state of the field of item-writing guidelines drawing on evidence from literature related to item-writing flaws, professional development, and automatic item generation noting that innovations to increase the adherence to guidelines have not resulted in a sustained improvement. Third, we apply a use-inspired lens to identify conceptual overlap and implementation redundancy in Haladyna et al.’s (2002) guidelines, reducing the list to 13 sequentially ordered guidelines. In reaching these future directions, we focus on how a use-inspired perspective is more in keeping with the reality that most item writers will write many items without ever becoming measurement experts.",

However, confirmatory methods for group network comparison are limited by practical constraints, such as the computational intractability of the Ising model in large networks. In this study, we demonstrate how to estimate causal effects on network state and strength when direct network estimation is not feasible by leveraging the mathematical equivalencies between the Ising model and item response theory (IRT) models. We demonstrate through simulation that a two-parameter logistic (2PL) explanatory IRT model can simultaneously recover causal effects on network state and strength. We first apply the method to a single empirical example of a vocabulary assessment from a content literacy intervention to demonstrate model building and interpretation strategies. We then replicate our approach with 72 empirical datasets from randomized controlled trials with item-level outcome data in education, economics, health, and related fields. Our results show that causal effects on network strength are both common and uncorrelated with effects on network state, suggesting that causal network models can provide new insight into the impact of interventions in the social and behavioral sciences.",

These constructs can also be understood within the framework of the five-factor model (FFM) of personality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between personality profiles, the severity of suicide-related histories, and ITS-related risk factors. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the relationship between ITS-related risk factors and the severity of suicide-related histories was moderated by personality profiles. Method: A nationwide sample of 1,367 adults, collected via CloudResearch, completed an online survey. Results: Six distinct personality profiles were identified via latent profile analysis. Elevated levels of neuroticism and low levels of conscientiousness corresponded to the highest levels of suicide-related histories. Lower levels of neuroticism coupled with higher levels of extraversion and conscientiousness were associated with reduced levels of suicide-related histories and ITS-related risk factors. However, personality profiles did not moderate the relationship between ITS-related risk factors and the severity of suicide-related histories. Conclusion: Future research should investigate whether directly targeting personality domains contributes to mitigating suicide risk and alleviating thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and hopelessness.",

We propose that biases in signal value computation promote the cooperative functions. In three pre-registered studies (total N = 1,341, general US population), we first showed in an artificial setting that committed individuals assort by overestimating signal benefits, although free-riders faking the signal earned the most. Using a real-world identity—religious affiliation—the second study demonstrated that highly costly religious signals deter outsiders, making religious cooperation profitable and resistant to free-riders. Finally, the third study revealed that religious signals were perceived by committed members to bring additional benefits that were not perceived by outsiders. This differential benefit estimation explains why highly costly signals such as extreme rituals persist and promote cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the persistent heterogeneity in psychopathology, treatment outcomes, and the science-practice gap requires a systematic approach to personalizing psychotherapy. Case conceptualization aims to understand a patient’s idiographic psychopathology by generating hypotheses about predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors. These hypotheses are continually updated with new information from assessments and ongoing treatment. This study applies a novel data-driven approach to formalize this process with personalized network estimation through prior elicitation and Bayesian inference. It is the first study to assess the clinical utility of this approach in a sample of twelve psychotherapy patients, primarily treated for depression, along with their respective therapists (preregistered: https://osf.io/38qdx).\nPatients employed the PECAN (Perceived Causal Networks) method to create personalized \"prior networks,\" mapping how they perceived their symptoms to interact. Intensive longitudinal data were then collected six times daily over 15 days (N = 935). Bayesian inference was used to update these prior networks using the collected longitudinal data, resulting in personalized \"posterior networks.\"\nBoth PECAN and longitudinal assessments were evaluated feasible and acceptable. Face validity was scored highest for the posterior networks. Patients emphasized the personal relevance of these networks, while therapists noted their value in guiding the therapeutic process. However, prior, posterior, and data networks showed significant dissimilarities. These differences may stem from patients’ limited insight into symptom interactions, insufficient power in the longitudinal data, or variations in self-perception. Despite these discrepancies, this study demonstrates the potential for integrating two methods to create personalized models of psychopathology. Future research should refine this formalization process to develop a more rigorous theoretical-empirical cycle to test these models.",

In this article, we investigate to what extend panel data can be used to study a causal mechanism when the causal process is assumed to play out at a (much) faster timescale than that at which the panel data were obtained. Specifically, we used simulations to study the impact of time aggregation (i.e., aggregating scores over multiple occasions) and systematic\n(under)sampling (i.e., when parts of the ongoing process are not covered with the measurements) on the ability of popular dynamic models to approximate the effects of a time-varying exposure on a time-varying outcome in three different scenarios. The results show that time aggregation and systematic (under)sampling can lead to severe over- and underestimation of the causal effect, implying that wrong (and potentially harmful) conclusions can be draw. We discuss the implications of these findings for applied researchers.",

          "abstract": "Diminished use of goal-directed (“model-based”) decision-making is a hallmark of transdiagnostic compulsivity, promoting an over-reliance on inflexible and habitual behaviours. However, the origin of this impairment remains unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that these impairments arise due to uncertainty within the internal world model that subserves goal-directed decision-making. We adapted a validated gamified decision-making task to characterise how individuals build an internal model of an environment, pairing this data with computational modelling to uncover the exact mechanisms underpinning behaviour and quantify individual differences. Two samples of participants (a discovery and pre-registered replication sample) performed the task, and we also acquired longitudinal data over 2 week and 3 month periods to assess task reliability and stability of behaviour over time. Across discovery (n=551) and replication (n=1322) samples, we found that individuals higher in compulsivity and intrusive thought learned more slowly and formed a less certain representation of the task’s structure. This uncertainty mediated the link between compulsive symptoms and use of goal-directed behaviour. Behaviour in the task was relatively stable over a 3 month (n=385) and 1 year (n=326) period and did not predict changes in symptoms. Our results suggest that reliance on habitual behaviours seen in those with high levels of compulsive symptoms result from a tendency to form less certain internal models of the external world. Given the stability of this behaviour and its links to symptoms, this may represent a trait-level vulnerability for this symptom dimension.",

This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

Yet, little is known about how people morally evaluate future generations relative to other distant groups, such as human outgroups and nature (plants, animals). Moreover, does this perception change among those who exhibit impartial intergenerational beneficence (i.e., concern for all future generations), or when moral concern is framed as zero-sum? Across 15 studies, we find that future generations consistently receive less moral concern than present-day targets already ascribed low levels of concern. This pattern holds whether moral expansiveness is framed as unlimited or zero-sum and persists even among individuals who typically care deeply about future generations, regardless of their temporal distance. These findings suggest that future generations hold a uniquely disadvantaged position in the moral hierarchy—not because of perceived constraints on moral concern, but due to factors intrinsic to their exceptional psychological distance from the self, here and now.",

          "authors": "Andreas Alexandersen; Steffen Aasen; Gabor Csifcsak; Matthias Mittner",
          "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) is a common mental phenomenon where attention shifts spontaneously from an external task to internal trains of thought. Recent studies propose that non-invasive brain stimulation methods hold potential for influencing attentional shifts between on-task and MW states. Exploratory analysis from a recent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) study reported that targeting the left angular gyrus (AG) with inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) reduced MW compared to sham stimulation, without affecting executive performance (Drevland et al., 2024). The present study is a pre-registered, direct replication of the study by Drevland et al., but also expands their protocol by applying excitatory intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the same cortical area. Using a triple-blind crossover design, healthy participants completed four blocks of the Finger-Tapping Random Sequence Generation Task (FT-RSGT) in three sessions on separate days. Each session included three rounds of either real (cTBS or iTBS) or sham stimulation in an accelerated rTMS design. We successfully replicated the effect of cTBS in reducing MW propensity but failed to find the expected increase in MW post-iTBS stimulation. Furthermore, based on a joint analysis of the current data and that from Drevland et al., we found compelling evidence for cTBS being efficient both in reducing MW and improving executive performance. Our results provide evidence for the causal relationship between the left AG and shifts of attention during an executive task, highlighting the role of the default mode network in the generation and maintenance of MW episodes.",

Children completed the Youth Self Report, and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Questionnaire. The Youth Self Report and the Child Behavior Checklist were completed annually for three years, while the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were completed at Time 1. \nLatent Growth Curve Modeling was used to assess the effect of COA and sex on the development of social problems and competencies over time. There were significant interactions between sex and COA on child reports of social problems and parent reports of social competencies. \nResults suggest that COA girls may be particularly at risk for concerning social development trajectories in youth. Future studies should determine what aspects of living with a parent with an alcohol use disorder led to COA girls having difficulties with healthy social development.

Individuals with densely connected symptom networks that facilitate the perpetuation of withdrawal symptom activity across time are theorized to have more difficulty quitting due to intense withdrawal experiences that persist even after the events instigating initial increases in withdrawal intensity are no longer present. Method. Here, we test this theory by constructing withdrawal symptom networks using ecological momentary assessment data in 123 individuals who smoke cigarettes daily from a period during which they were smoking as usual and test the extent to which between-person differences in these networks predict change in smoking behavior during a 10-day smoking abstinence period.  Results. Individuals with symptom networks facilitating sustained withdrawal symptom intensity after symptom perturbation exhibited a less pronounced decrease in smoking between the smoking as usual and smoking abstinence period. Conclusions. Results support a network theory of tobacco withdrawal and highlight the significance of inter-symptom interplay in smoking cessation outcomes.",

The studies consisted of an exploratory study, a preregistered replication, and data from a separate study utilizing a distinct learning task. Participants completed reinforcement learning tasks where they learned to select either the more rewarding response or more rewarding stimulus, as well as a large set of self-report measures of symptoms and traits. Contrary to expectations, we observed a positive association between reinforcement learning performance and anhedonia symptoms across all three studies. General depression symptoms showed one positive association and two null associations with performance. Our results contrast with the assumption of a negative association between reinforcement learning behavior and symptoms of depression or anhedonia. Instead, our results suggest that in large non-selective samples, anhedonia symptoms can be positively associated with reward-guided learning and decision-making.",

          "abstract": "People can learn new concepts from a small number of examples by drawing on inductive biases that favor some hypotheses over others. These inductive biases have previously been captured by Bayesian models that use symbolic representations such as logical formulas to define prior distributions over hypotheses. But does this imply that people must be using symbolic representations when solving these problems?  We show that it is possible to create an artificial neural network that displays the same inductive biases as symbolic Bayesian models without making use of explicit symbolic representations. Our approach is based on distilling a prior distribution from a symbolic Bayesian model via meta-learning, a method for extracting the common structure from a set of tasks. This approach is used to create an artificial neural network with an inductive bias towards concepts expressed as short logical formulas. Analyzing results from previous behavioral experiments in which people learned logical concepts from a few examples shows that neural networks trained via meta-learning are able to capture human performance. These results suggest that while symbolic models are an effective tool for giving an interpretable description of human inductive biases, they do not imply that people must be using symbolic representations in order to make inferences that align with those inductive biases.",

The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to be elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder. Additional primary studies have emerged since the most comprehensive previous meta-analysis on this topic by Solmi et al. (2021), warranting an updated synthesis of evidence.\t \nAims: This study aimed to compare IL-6 levels in blood or plasma in patients with bipolar disorder versus healthy comparison groups by meta-analysis. \t\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted, incorporating recent studies, and addressing methodological limitations, such as skewed data distributions, and differences between mood states. Random-effects models, with and without inverse variance weighting, were used. The systematic search included observational studies published between 1993 and 2023. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore variations in IL-6 levels across mood states (manic, depressive, euthymic or mixed).\t \nResults: This study included 62 scientific articles. A meta-analysis with default weighting showed that IL-6 was higher in patients (standardized mean difference 0.77 [0.46, 1.08]), but in presence of high heterogeneity (I2=96.92%). A meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting showed a smaller difference between patients and controls (0.37 [-0.03, 0.80]. Subgroup analyses suggested elevated levels of IL-6 in manic states. \t\nConclusions: IL-6 levels were elevated in bipolar patients versus healthy comparison groups, though effect sizes were smaller than previously reported and not statistically significant when using inverse variance weighting. Uncertainty remains concerning any role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.",

          "abstract": "The intricate interplay between visual art, aesthetic appreciation, and human cognition has long captivated artists and scientists. One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

          "abstract": "Preregistration is the act of formally documenting a research plan before collecting (or at least before analysing) the data. It allows those reading a final research report to know which aspects of a study were decided before sight of the data, and which were added later. This enables informed evaluation of the severity with which scientific claims have been tested. We, as the British Neuropsychological Society Open Science Group, conducted a survey to explore awareness and adoption of open science practices within our field. Neuropsychology involves the study of relatively rare or hard-to-access participants, creating practical challenges that, according to our survey, are perceived as barriers to preregistration. We survey the available routes to preregistration, and suggest that the barriers are all surmountable in one way or another. However, there is a tension, in that higher levels of bias control require greater restriction over the flexibility of preregistered studies, but such flexibility is often essential for neuropsychological research. Researchers must therefore consider which route provides the right balance of rigour and pragmatic flexibility to render a preregistered project viable for them. By mapping out the issues and potential solutions, and by signposting relevant resources and publication routes, we hope to facilitate well-reasoned decision-making and empower neuropsychologists to enhance the transparency and rigour of their research.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the persistent heterogeneity in psychopathology, treatment outcomes, and the science-practice gap requires a systematic approach to personalizing psychotherapy. Case conceptualization aims to understand a patient’s idiographic psychopathology by generating hypotheses about predisposing, precipitating, and maintaining factors. These hypotheses are continually updated with new information from assessments and ongoing treatment. This study applies a novel data-driven approach to formalize this process with personalized network estimation through prior elicitation and Bayesian inference. It is the first study to assess the clinical utility of this approach in a sample of twelve psychotherapy patients, primarily treated for depression, along with their respective therapists (preregistered: https://osf.io/38qdx).\nPatients employed the PECAN (Perceived Causal Networks) method to create personalized \"prior networks,\" mapping how they perceived their symptoms to interact. Intensive longitudinal data were then collected six times daily over 15 days (N = 935). Bayesian inference was used to update these prior networks using the collected longitudinal data, resulting in personalized \"posterior networks.\"\nBoth PECAN and longitudinal assessments were evaluated feasible and acceptable. Face validity was scored highest for the posterior networks. Patients emphasized the personal relevance of these networks, while therapists noted their value in guiding the therapeutic process. However, prior, posterior, and data networks showed significant dissimilarities. These differences may stem from patients’ limited insight into symptom interactions, insufficient power in the longitudinal data, or variations in self-perception. Despite these discrepancies, this study demonstrates the potential for integrating two methods to create personalized models of psychopathology. Future research should refine this formalization process to develop a more rigorous theoretical-empirical cycle to test these models.",

          "abstract": "Background: From time to time in life, people have to weigh losses and gains that occur at different points in time, a process called intertemporal choice. When faced with intertemporal choices, people's subjective value assessments of costs and benefits decrease over time, which is the phenomenon of delay discounting. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an individual's emotion and field cognitive styles on individual delay discounting. Method: College student from a university in Shandong were recruited to conduct the Embedded Figure Test. From these students, field-independent and field-dependent individuals were classified to complete the delay discounting task. Results: Delay discounting was larger for field-dependent individuals than for field-independent individuals; individuals' delay discounting was reduced in the positive emotion state compared to the negative emotion state. Importantly, for field-independent individuals, they had comparable delay discounting between the positive and negative emotion state. Whereas for field-dependent individuals, the delay discounting is larger in the negative emotion state than positive emotion state. Conclusions: Field cognitive styles modulate the emotion effect on individuals' delay discounting. Field-dependent individuals are more likely to choose immediate small rewards in the negative emotion state and delayed large rewards in the positive emotion state. Field-independent individuals have similar probabilities of choosing the rewards across both emotion state.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of the present research was to investigate the temporal dynamics of the core cognitive vulnerability and individual internalizing symptom characteristics and to explore the role of negative events in relation to the core cognitive vulnerability and symptoms.\nMethods: Adopting a network approach, we fitted a multilevel vector autoregressive model to ecological momentary assessment data from 223 university students collected over 21 days – modelling associations between the core cognitive vulnerability, perceived event negativity, and 12 internalizing symptoms.\nResults: In the between-person network, core cognitive vulnerability was positively associated with the avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations, indicating that those with higher levels of core cognitive vulnerability on average tended to avoid anxiety-provoking situations more severely on average. In the contemporaneous network, momentary core cognitive vulnerability was associated with various momentary symptoms. In the temporal network, increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the severity of three specific symptoms – anxious mood, fear, and feeling like a failure. Interestingly, momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the perceived event negativity, but perceived event negativity did not predict subsequent increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability.\nConclusions: Our findings show that the core cognitive vulnerability is differentially associated with symptoms at the between-person and within-person levels of analysis. On a moment-to-moment basis, core cognitive vulnerability temporally precedes and influences the severity of emotional symptoms and perceived event negativity. We discuss study implications and outline directions for future research to clarify the etiology of internalizing psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Monte Carlo simulation studies are the de facto standard for assessing both classical and modern statistical methods. In traditional simulation studies, researchers have full discretion over data generation and often create simulated data with a high degree of smoothness and limited dependencies among variables. Under such conditions, the performance of statistical methods may not indicate their real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel AI-based simulation framework that leverages generative AI (GenAI) to create realistic synthetic data and incorporate them into Monte Carlo simulation studies. In particular, we focus on simulation studies with sequential data (e.g., action sequences from process data) and demonstrate our approach by evaluating the predictive performance of an example statistical method. Our framework consists of five key steps: (i) pre-processing input data, (ii) training GenAI models on input data, (iii) assessing synthetic data quality, (iv) conducting AI-based simulations, and (v) evaluating simulation results. We also perform robustness checks on both synthetic data quality and simulation outcomes by modifying specific steps of our approach. Overall, the proposed AI-based simulations outperform traditional simulations in generating realistic synthetic data and providing a more accurate evaluation of the real-world performance of statistical methods.",

          "abstract": "This study presents empirical evidence suggesting that consciousness, specifically during meditative states, influences quantum interference patterns without collapsing quantum states. Using IBM's quantum processors, we developed and implemented experimental protocols to assess how different consciousness states affect quantum measurements. Our results demonstrate that meditation significantly alters quantum interference (p=0.025, Cohen's d=-2.88) while having minimal impact on coherence or entanglement. Individual meditation sessions suppressed interference by 73.3% on average, while synchronized meditation enhanced interference by 340%. Furthermore, these effects gradually dissipate following meditation with a characteristic relaxation time (τ) of approximately 74 minutes. These findings challenge von Neumann-Wigner collapse interpretations while supporting a Quantum Bayesian (QBism) model where consciousness modifies quantum probability distributions without forcing collapse. We present a mathematical framework integrating QBism with our empirical findings and discuss implications for quantum mechanics, consciousness studies, and information theory.",

          "abstract": "According to the normative standpoint, decision-making under risk, as it is traditionally instantiated in choice among fully described probabilistic lotteries, should not be affected by the disclosure of outcomes (feedback).  Yet, contrary to this normative prescription, empirical studies have repeatedly reported that risk preferences are affected by immediate presentation of choice outcomes. The consensual and intuitive hypothesis is that feedback affects risk preferences via a learning process, whereby experienced outcomes alter the representation of subjective values. However, despite a relatively large body of published studies, available evidence does not allow robustly establishing the direction and the impact of feedback on key decision variables, namely risk propensity and expected value maximization, limiting our ability to establish a clear cognitive mechanism. Here, we ran seven behavioral experiments, tailored to address this gap and found that the presence of feedback consistently increases risk-taking, without any detectable impact on expected value maximization. Crucially, fine-grained analyses of the temporal dynamics of the effect of feedback directly falsified one of the currently most influential models of the role of experience in decisions under risk, and challenges any instantiation of the learning hypotheses. These results rather favor of an attitudinal effect, induced by the anticipation of feedback information. Epistemic curiosity and regret avoidance may drive this effect in partial and complete feedback conditions, respectively.",

However, because HiTOP is based on analyses of standardized symptom criteria and close-ended survey items, it may just reflect the structure of available measures.  This study provides a novel test of HiTOP’s generalizability by comparing it to the structure of psychopathology derived from the natural language people use when talking about their mental health.  For our analysis, we obtained 87,007 naturalistic descriptions of mental health from &gt;55,625 unique users on 27 online Reddit forums (i.e., subreddits).  We used text embeddings in large language models to represent common themes of posts in the subreddits, each dedicated to a different diagnosis or maladaptive trait.  Semantic similarity of posts across subreddits was quantified with a cosine similarity matrix. We then fit exploratory factor models to this matrix and examined the hierarchical structure with a bass-akwards approach. Results showed the natural language structure of psychopathology closely corresponds to the HiTOP model, with factors resembling internalizing, detachment, thought disorder, substance use, antagonism, and somatoform spectra at the lowest level of the hierarchy.  The higher-order factors diverged from HiTOP, including a linguistic p-factor that reflects variation in attribution of problems to internal vs. external sources.  Overall, the emergence of HiTOP spectra from natural language offers unique evidence for its validity and clinical utility.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale online studies with healthy adults have documented consistent associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric traits and metacognitive biases. Here, analysis of existing and new large-scale datasets reveals that such correlations are largely driven by surface-level dimensions of questionnaire-filling behaviour: systematic rating biases and inattentive responding. Specifically, a bias to report positive or negative values in self-report scales generalizes to confidence ratings, producing spurious correlations between the two. Additionally, systematic over-confidence among inattentive responders produces spurious positive correlations between confidence and the endorsement of rare symptoms. We show that previously identified transdiagnostic dimensions of “anxiety-depression” and “compulsivity and intrusive thought,” both shown to correlate with decision confidence, map neatly onto these two biases of questionnaire-filling behaviour. In a pre-registered experiment, we further show that decision confidence and self-reported obsessive-compulsive tendencies are correlated with independent measures of inattentive and biased responding. Taken together, we find an alarming degree of influence of inattentive and biased responding over both self-report psychiatric measures and confidence ratings. When not accounted for, these factors produce a mirage of apparent metacognitive alterations in mental health. We discuss concrete precautionary measures that are needed to control for these biases.",

Drawing from quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and metaphysical idealism, this model resolves paradoxes such as the observer effect, non-locality, and memory as real-time access.

          "abstract": "Over the past several years, there has been a shift in the researchers’ thinking about the functional role of episodic memory. Rather than focusing on how memory represents the past, recent literature often presents memory as ultimately dealing with the future–helping the organism to anticipate events and increase its adaptive success. However, the distinct contribution of episodic (as opposed to semantic) memory to future-oriented simulations remains unclear. We claim that episodic memory yields adaptive success because of its crucial role in singular counterfactual causal reasoning, which thus far has been mostly ignored in causal reasoning literature. Our paper presents a causal inference model based on the predictive processing framework and the minimal trace account of episodic memory. According to our model, evaluating the cause of an event involves (i) generating an episodic memory related to the said potential cause, (ii) constructing a counterfactual scenario through inhibition of the relevant part of the past episode, and (iii) temporal evolution followed by alternative model evaluation. We further discuss our approach in the developmental context.",

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

Although these doctrines do not enjoy widespread support in current philosophy of science, they continue to influence psychological science through their effect on research practices and its, often implicit, methodological principles. In this paper, we argue that at least five of these principles hamper progress in psychology. Epistemic freezing refers to unhelpful conservatism in the use of psychometric measurement techniques; testing myopia concerns the focus on hypothesis testing at the expense of other research practices; data fixation is the belief that data are what require explanation, and that gathering novel and surprising data is key to scientific progress; smallism is the preference for reductive explanation; and mirrorism denotes a focus on developing true theories as opposed to developing pragmatically or epistemically useful ones. We argue that adherence to these principles, and to the research practices that go with it, puts psychological science at risk of stagnation, and we call for a broad discussion to reassess and adapt them.",

However, we need comprehensive and robust methodologies to identify gaps and inefficiencies in service provision to shape policy, ensure efficient allocation of resources and support those most in need. Here we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study involving evaluation of health, mental health, and human service use among Victorian young people, with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs. \nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort is youth aged 12-25 years during the time period January 2018 to November 2023. Data for individuals aged 5-11 and 26-53 during this period will also be included, to allow for examination of early years factors and an older adult comparison group. The data sources and data linkage methodology are described. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical characteristics of young people, their broader health and human service use behaviour and typical pathways through care, that could not be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

This study will investigate if UAP sighting\ndistributions exhibit fractal scaling spatially and temporally. Using\nNational UFO Reporting Center data, we will calculate fractal\ndimensions and Hurst exponents, comparing these to aircraft flight\npatterns. Significant fractal patterns will support hypotheses of\nscale-invariant UAP behavior, while non-fractal results will suggest\nconventional explanations, advancing empirical UAP analysis.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have gained scientific traction\nthrough declassified footage and civilian reports spanning decades,\nrevealing behaviors like rapid scale shifts and object splitting [1].\nThese patterns, documented in sources like the National UFO Reporting\nCenter (NUFORC), suggest potential fractal properties—self-similar\nstructures observed in systems from galaxy distributions to biological\nnetworks [2]. Fractal analysis offers a rigorous, empirical approach\nto study UAP without assuming their nature, addressing a gap in\nquantitative assessments of such phenomena.\n\nThis research will test whether UAP sightings exhibit fractal scaling,\nmotivated by eyewitness accounts of geometric objects splitting (e.g.,\nfrom 1 to 12 units) and mathematical patterns like iterative scaling\n(0.3333333333, ÷10, ×9), hinting at multi-scale dynamics [3].\nTheoretical constructs, such as string theory’s 11 dimensions or\nspeculative infinite-dimensional frameworks, inspire this inquiry,\nthough they remain untestable here [4]. We will focus on two research\nquestions: do UAP spatial distributions show fractal clustering, and\ndo their temporal patterns display long-range dependence? Hypotheses\nare:\n\nHypothesis 1: UAP sighting locations will yield a fractal dimension D\n&lt; 2, unlike uniform distributions (H0: D = 2).\n\nHypothesis 2: UAP sighting times will show a Hurst exponent H &gt; 0.5,\nindicating persistence (H0: H = 0.5).\n\nThese predictions, detailed in Table 1, will be tested using NUFORC\ndata against aircraft controls. Significant fractal metrics will\nsuggest non-random, scale-invariant patterns; non-significant results\nwill align UAP with conventional phenomena. Bayesian methods will\nensure robust interpretation of all outcomes, avoiding over-reliance\non null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nWe will extract UAP sighting data from NUFORC and aircraft flight\nrecords from the FAA. Spatial analysis will use the box-counting\nmethod, overlaying grids (1 km to 1,000 km) to estimate D via N(δ) ∝\nδ^(-D). Temporal analysis will apply DFA to daily sighting counts,\ncalculating H over scales of 10 to 1,000 days. Positive controls will\ninclude random point distributions (D ≈ 2, H ≈ 0.5). Data collection\nand analysis will not be performed blindly to the conditions of the\nexperiments.\n\n\n\nEthics Information\n\nThis study will use anonymized, publicly available data, requiring no\nethical approvals or participant consent.\n\n\n\nPilot Data\n\nA preliminary analysis of 5,000 NUFORC sightings (2010–2020) will\nyield D ≈ 1.7 and H ≈ 0.65, differing from random baselines (D = 2, H\n= 0.5). Full details will be in Supplementary Information.\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe study will employ comparative observational design, analyzing UAP\nand aircraft data for fractal properties (Table 1).\n\n\n\nSampling Plan\n\nWe will sample ≥1,000 UAP sightings post-2000 with valid coordinates\nand timestamps, excluding duplicates. Aircraft data will match this\nsize. Power analysis, based on pilot r = 0.3, ensures 95% power at α =\n0.05 with N = 1,000.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\n\nSpatial D and temporal H will be computed for UAP and aircraft data.\nDifferences will be tested using Bayesian inference (Bayes Factor &gt; 10\nfor H1 or H0). Preprocessing will normalize spatial data by population\ndensity. Contingencies: if data are non-normal, we will use robust\nBayesian models.\n\n\n\nData Availability\n\nRaw data will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with pilot\ndata available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nCode Availability\n\nPython/R scripts will be shared on OSF upon Stage 2 acceptance, with\npilot analysis code available now under embargo.\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nCompeting Interests: The author declares no competing interests.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] National UFO Reporting Center.

          "authors": "Zackary Okun Dunivin",
          "abstract": "Social groups and identities play a central role in social research, yet systematically identifying the symbolic markers that define group boundaries can be difficult, particularly in large, unlabeled textual corpora. This article advances an existing technique for computational lexicon extraction, the ``frequency-based'' method, to automatically identify cultural and social identity signals at scale, even in the absence of reliable labeled data. By leveraging a small set of highly representative ``seed'' terms to assign low-quality labels, the approach locates authors who share specialized vocabularies, thereby revealing dense patterns of boundary-specific words. In accordance with computational grounded theory (CGT), which stresses iterative refinement informed by interpretive insight, selecting appropriate seed terms requires considerable knowledge of the groups under observation prior to lexicon extraction. A companion study also published in this volume illustrates the technique’s effectiveness in mapping the symbolic boundaries of white nationalist discourse on Twitter, highlighting how automated lexicon extraction can feed directly into traditional qualitative practices such as close reading and manual coding. The discussion situates this mixed-methods approach within the framework of computational grounded theory while challenging the presupposition—implicit in CGT and computational social science more broadly—that the use of computational tools must culminate in quantitative analyses. Instead, this approach demonstrates how natural language processing can serve as an upstream step that enriches and expedites qualitative inquiry by revealing hidden patterns and vocabularies that might otherwise remain invisible to traditional ethnography. In this way, computational approaches to text are positioned not as replacements but as catalysts for deeper, more nuanced qualitative research.",

          "authors": "Oscar Stuhler; Cat Dang Ton; Etienne Ollion",
          "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) is quickly becoming a valuable tool for sociological research. Already, sociologists employ GenAI for tasks like classifying text and simulating human agents. We point to another major use case: the extraction of structured information from unstructured text. Information Extraction (IE) is an established branch of Natural Language Processing, but leveraging the affordances of this paradigm has thus far required familiarity with specialized models. GenAI changes this by allowing researchers to define their own IE tasks and execute them via targeted prompts. This article explores the potential of open-source large language models for IE by extracting and encoding biographical information (e.g., age, occupation, origin) from a corpus of newspaper obituaries. As we proceed, we discuss how sociologists can develop and evaluate prompt architectures for such tasks, turning codebooks into “promptbooks.” We also evaluate models of different sizes and prompting techniques. Our analysis showcases the potential of GenAI as a flexible and accessible tool for IE, while also underscoring risks like non-random error patterns that can bias downstream analyses.",

A structured blind pairwise comparison process was conducted where five independent expert qualitative researchers each conducted five evaluations (25 total comparisons), in order to assess the quality of the reports written. Results demonstrate that AILYZE-generated analyses were 73% faster (mean 7.38 vs. 27.71 hours, t=-11.45, p&lt;0.0001) and received higher quality rankings in 76% of pairwise comparisons (19 out of 25, p=0.0073).

Unlike conflict-driven models, ContextScale effectively distinguishes rhetorical styles from actual political sentiments.

          "abstract": "As the epitome of modern, rational organizations, bureaucracies are often believed to select candidates based on rules and reason. We argue that intuitive---and even instinctive---assessments of candidates' external appearances sometimes underpin seemingly rational and calculated decisions. Using a novel, AI-based algorithm that learns and reproduces human assessments of facial appearances at scale, we examine how perceived facial traits influence the careers of over 4,000 mid- and senior-level Chinese officials.  We find that officials who look more competent, trustworthy, and less aggressive enjoy significantly better promotion prospect and lower purge risk than their peers. Warmth-related traits (e.g., trustworthiness and non-aggressiveness) are especially valued at higher-level promotions and for male candidates. Additional analyses, including conjoint experiments with real officials, demonstrate that appearances' influence over selection preferences is comparable to performance or political connections. These findings challenge the prevailing meritocratic and relation-based theories of bureaucratic selection and highlight the role of impressions in the working of government institutions.",

Using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,650 respondents, we investigate how potential immigrants' sexual-minority status affects Americans' perceptions of their deservingness for admission and their cultural similarity to the U.S. Results show that, overall, Americans do not perceive LG immigrants as more deserving than straight ones, and LG immigrants are perceived as less culturally similar. But results also reveal heterogeneity: LG immigrants fleeing persecution are seen as more deserving of admission, and Democrats, atheists, and LG respondents consider LG migrants more deserving than straight ones. This paper helps disentangle Americans' preferences for migrants' presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit as well as shed light on public opinion of an under-studied but politically salient group.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this research synthesis is to collect and summarize the research literature on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland. This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "Flexible partial retirement schemes are intended to give individuals the opportunity to reduce working hours before moving into full retirement, the expectation being that the reduced workload will contribute to postponed retirement. Yet, there is limited research about whether and how flexible partial pensions are used as a way of exiting the labor force, as an income supplement, or as a way of bridging the transition into retirement through part-time employment. In Finland, individuals can take up part of their accrued old-age pension after reaching age 61 regardless of their employment status. Using high-quality register data with monthly information on retirement and wage income, we use sequence analysis analyze previously employed persons’ wage income trajectories around the take-up of partial old-age pension. We find that only around one in five continue to work at a reduced wage income level, indicating a reduction in working hours. Around one in six left paid employment just before or after pension take-up. Most individuals do not reduce their working hours when taking up a partial pension. Our findings suggest that the Finnish partial old-age pension scheme is currently not likely to extend working lives, raising concerns about its effectiveness in meeting its policy goal.",

This paper examines whether a library book giveaway program was effective in increasing parents reading investments in the form of loan of children’s books. The intervention involved “nudging” families sending out invitations to visit their local library, where their child would receive a free book and families would get introduced to library services. Using Danish individual level registry data on loan of books from public libraries, I assess the program’s impact through a difference-in-differences approach based on staggered rollout across three municipalities. Results show no increase in loan of children’s books – neither in advantaged nor disadvantaged families. Given that more intensive book giveaway programs have been successful, these results might reflect that the intervention was too mild or failed to address key barriers to participation.",

It was determined that in August 2024, there are 2,931 active support staff working in 348 Institutes, and the amount of RSS assigned to each institution varies between 1 and 47. The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).\tRegarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized.

Results demonstrate that AILYZE-generated analyses were 73% faster (mean 7.38 vs. 27.71 hours, t=-11.45, p&lt;0.0001) and received higher quality rankings in 76% of pairwise comparisons (19 out of 25, p=0.0073). These findings suggest that AI-assisted qualitative analysis tools may significantly enhance research efficiency while improving analytical comprehensiveness and depth, with important implications for qualitative methodology across disciplines.",

          "title": "Immigration, Human Capital and Economic Growth in Brazil: A Multidimensional Analysis",
          "authors": "Richard Murdoch Montgomery",
          "abstract": "This article examines the intricate relationship between immigration, human capital formation and economic growth in Brazil from 1890 to the present day. Employing a mixed-methods approach combining historical analysis and econometric modelling, this research investigates how different waves of immigration have contributed to human capital accumulation and subsequent economic development in Brazil. The ﬁndings reveal that immigration has signiﬁcantly enhanced Brazil's human capital stock through three primary mechanisms: direct skill transfer, educational spillovers and institutional development. Econometric estimates suggest that a 1% increase in skilled immigrant population historically corresponded to a 0.3-0.5% increase in regional productivity, with substantial heterogeneity across time periods and regions. The research further demonstrates that the human capital beneﬁts of immigration persist intergenerationally, with particularly strong effects in the industrial heartland of São Paulo. Policy implications highlight the potential value of targeted immigration policies that address Brazil's contemporary skills gaps while fostering knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship.",

          "title": "Spatial Data Analysis",
          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer",
          "abstract": "This handbook chapter provides an essential introduction to the field of spatial econometrics, offering a comprehensive overview of techniques and methodologies for analysing spatial data in the social sciences. Spatial econometrics addresses the unique challenges posed by spatially dependent observations, where spatial relationships among data points can significantly impact statistical analyses. The chapter begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation, and highlighting their implications for traditional econometric models. It then introduces a range of spatial econometric models, particularly spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial lag of X models, illustrating how these models accommodate spatial relationships and yield accurate and insightful results about the underlying spatial processes. The chapter provides an intuitive understanding of these models compare to each other. A practical example on London house prices demonstrates the application of spatial econometrics, emphasising its relevance in uncovering hidden spatial patterns, addressing endogeneity, and providing robust estimates in the presence of spatial dependence.",

          "abstract": "Quand mobilise-t-on une perspective de genre dans les publications de sciences sociales françaises, et qui le fait ? Recourt-on davantage à cette approche que par le passé, et cette dernière en a-t-elle remplacé d’autres grilles d’analyse comme on l’entend parfois ? Parce qu’il est impossible de consulter l’ensemble de la production universitaire sur une longue période, les spéculations l’emportent souvent sur les analyses empiriques. Afin d’apporter une contribution à ces réflexions, ainsi qu’à l’histoire et à la sociologie des sciences sociales, cet article s’appuie sur des outils issus du traitement automatique des langues – des grands modèles de langage (LLMs) – pour repérer les invocations du genre dans un vaste corpus. Appliqué aux articles scientifiques de près de 120 revues de sciences sociales françaises publiées depuis le début du siècle, il offre plusieurs résultats parlants. Le recours à une approche de genre a indéniablement progressé au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années, même si le point de départ était souvent bas, et qu’il reste finalement limité. Des différences marquées existent entre disciplines, tout comme diffèrent les formes d’institutionnalisation de cette approche. Cette perspective est, en outre, encore très majoritairement mobilisée par des femmes. Enfin, l’approche intersectionnelle augmente légèrement, tout en restant très minoritaire, et sans que le genre ne se substitue à la classe.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer; Nicole Kapelle",
          "abstract": "Panel data offer a valuable lens through which social science phenomena can be examined over time. With panel data, we can overcome some of the fundamental problems with conventional cross-sectional analyses by focusing on the within-unit changes rather than the differences between units. This chapter delves into the foundations, recent advancements, and critical issues associated with panel data analysis. The chapter illustrates the basic concepts of random effects (RE) and fixed effects (FE) estimators. Moving beyond the fundamentals, we provide an intuition for various recent developments and advances in the field of panel data methods, paying particular attention to the identification of time-varying treatment effects or impact functions. To illustrate practical application, we investigate how marriage influences sexual satisfaction. While married individuals report a higher sexual satisfaction than un-married respondents (between-comparison), individuals experience a decline in satisfaction after marriage compared to their pre-marital levels (within-comparison).",

          "title": "Exploring N₂O Emissions at World Level: Advanced Econometric and Machine Learning Approaches in the ESG Context",
          "authors": "Carlo Drago; Massimo Arnone; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "The paper examines nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standpoint with a combination of econometric and machine learning specifications to uncover global trends and policy implications. Results show the overwhelming effect of ESG factors on emissions, with intricate interdependencies between economic growth, resource productivity, and environmental policy. Econometric specifications identify forest degradation, energy intensity, and income inequality as the most significant determinants of N₂O emissions, which are in need of policy attention. Machine learning enhances predictive power insofar as emission drivers and country-specific trends are identifiable. Through the integration of panel data techniques and state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, the paper generates a highly differentiated picture of emission trends, separating country groups by ESG performance. The findings of the study are that while developed nations have better energy efficiency and environmental governance, they remain significant contributors to N₂O emissions due to intensive industry and agriculture. Meanwhile, developing economies with energy intensity have structural impediments to emissions mitigation. The paper also identifies the contribution of regulatory quality in emission abatement in that the quality of governance is found to be linked with better environmental performance. ESG-based finance instruments, such as green bonds and impact investing, also promote sustainable economic transition. The findings have the further implications of additional arguments for mainstreaming sustainability in economic planning, developing ESG frameworks to underpin climate targets.",
