          "title": "A meta-analyst should make informed decisions: Issues with Bayesian model-averaging meta-analyses",
          "authors": "Rafael Román-Caballero; Miguel A. Vadillo",
          "abstract": "When synthesizing the results of multiple studies, meta-analysts typically assess publication bias using assumption-based models. However, the lack of convergence between methods is common. The performance of all publication-bias methods is sensitive to the specific conditions of the meta-analysis and one approach proposes to solve discrepancies by favoring results of methods that perform reasonably well under the specific conditions of each meta-analysis. Alternatively, Bayesian model averaging with different publication-bias models has become an influential approach after the recent proposal of robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA). RoBMA is presented as a method that dispenses the meta-analyst from the difficult decision of choosing which publication-bias model to apply and comes with the hope of reducing decision making. In the present study, we tested the performance of RoBMA with the data sets from replication projects in different fields (Psychology, Economics, Cancer Biology, Experimental Philosophy, and Nature and Science papers) and simulated meta-analyses with similar conditions. Despite the lack of publication bias in all data sets, the combination of heterogeneity and well-informed sample size planning (via power analysis) resulted in the small-study effects that RoBMA identified as a sign of publication bias. As preregistration and power analyses become widespread in research and given that scientific results are heterogeneous for reasons that are not always known, meta-analysts should become increasingly careful in their use and interpretation of asymmetry-based methods. Our findings suggest that publication-bias analyses demand informed decisions by the meta-analyst and no data-driven approach can replace their expertise.",

          "authors": "Louis Hickman; Christopher Huynh; Jessica Gass; Brandon Michael Booth; Jason Kuruzovich; Louis Tay",
          "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used for personnel assessment and selection (e.g., resume screeners, automatically scored interviews). However, concerns have been raised throughout society that ML assessments may be biased and perpetuate or exacerbate inequality. Although organizational researchers have begun investigating ML assessments from traditional psychometric and legal perspectives, there is a need to understand, clarify, and integrate fairness operationalizations and algorithmic bias mitigation methods from the computer science, data science, and organizational research literatures. We present a four-stage model of developing ML assessments and applying bias mitigation methods, including 1) generating the training data, 2) training the model, 3) testing the model, and 4) deploying the model. When introducing the four-stage model, we describe potential sources of bias and unfairness at each stage. Then, we systematically review definitions and operationalizations of algorithmic bias, legal requirements governing personnel selection from the United States and Europe, and research on algorithmic bias mitigation across multiple domains and integrate these findings into our framework. Our review provides insights for both research and practice by elucidating possible mechanisms of algorithmic bias while identifying which bias mitigation methods are legal and effective. This integrative framework also reveals gaps in the knowledge of algorithmic bias mitigation that should be addressed by future collaborative research between organizational researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. We provide recommendations for developing and deploying ML assessments, as well as recommendations for future research into algorithmic bias and fairness.",

          "authors": "Yaxiong Cao; Asifa Majid; Norbert Vanek",
          "abstract": "Language is known to play a crucial role in influencing how humans perceive and categorize sensory stimuli, including odors. This study investigated the impact of linguistic labeling on odor categorization among bilingual participants proficient in Chinese (L1) and English (L2).  We hypothesized that L1-like linguistic labels would more robustly propel the learning of new olfactory categories compared to a condition without language, and more familiar labels would better support odor category learning. The analysis focused on comparing learning trajectories and odor categorization performance of four groups, three in which odors were paired with different sets of verbal labels and a control group that categorized odors without any verbal labeling. Following four days of intensive training, the results showed that the groups with verbal labels numerically outperformed the control group, and that the less familiar the labels sounded the more successful categorization became. However, between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. These findings, while not conclusively supporting our hypotheses, provide insights into the complex relationship between linguistic familiarity and odor category formation. The results are nested within Ad Hoc Cognition, highlighting that variations in linguistic familiarity may not induce robust enough contextual changes to differentially affect how odor categories are formed.",

          "authors": "Ziyi Zhuang; Norbert Vanek",
          "abstract": "Calendar calculations, the process of computing the target day or month, exhibit peculiar differences across languages. In systems like English, calendar labels are largely opaque (Tuesday, August), which invites calculations to rely more heavily on verbal listing. In transparent systems, like Chinese, habitual labeling of calendar terms numerically (Tuesday = day two, August = month eight) facilitates fast numerical operations instead of verbal listing. This study examines the effects that different levels of transparency of the calendar naming system may have on calculations in the speakers’ first and second language. Chinese-English bilinguals were tested alongside English and Chinese controls. Forced-choice calendar calculations (day, month, hour, and year) and self-reported strategies were used as tasks to tap into participants’ calculation speed, accuracy, and temporal reasoning. In the calculation questions we manipulated Distance (short/long), Direction (forward/backward), Input (linguistic/numerical) and Boundary (within/across). More complex Month calculations significantly differed across groups while easier day calculations did not. The English group reported reliance on verbal listing, while the Chinese and the bilingual groups preferred numerical reasoning. These findings bring new evidence for linguistic relativity in the form of modulations of calendar processing speed changing as a function of linguistic transparency, input type and task demand.",

          "authors": "Brendan Johns; Randy Jamieson; Matthew John Charles Crump; Michael N. Jones",
          "abstract": "Instance models have been successfully applied to a range of problems including memory,\nlanguage, attention, learning, action, decision making, and categorization (see Jamieson, Johns,\nVokey, &amp; Jones, 2022). According to instance theory, the individual experience constitutes the fundamental unit of knowledge and knowledge of the general emerges during parallel retrieval from memory (Brooks, 1978, 1987). Until recently, applications of instance theory to the problem of language were constrained to small and contrived laboratory experiments (e.g., Jamieson &amp; Mewhort, 2009). However, the approach has now been applied at scale to the large and messy problem of natural language (e.g., Jamieson et al., 2018; Johns &amp; Jones, 2015; Johns et al., 2020). With those demonstrations now in hand, we argue that the framework can present an articulate mechanistic underbelly to the usage-based theory of language that highlights the role of specific language experience in general language behavior (Abbot-Smith &amp; Tomasello, 2006; Tomasello, 2003). Overall, this article argues that instance memory models provide an ability to deepen our understanding of language as a dynamic, contextually embedded process, serving to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and the language sciences.",

          "authors": "Soren Wainio-Theberge; Ignacio Spiousas; Jorge Armony",
          "abstract": "Adopting physical expressions of emotion has been shown to have feedback effects on individuals’ mood and behaviour. For example, adopting the expansive and contractive body language of dominance and submission can affect individuals’ feelings of power, but the effects are subtle and variable. Part of this variability may stem from the high number of degrees of freedom in body language, with multiple distinct actions and muscular patterns underlying the categorical constructs of “expansive” and “contractive” postures. Using quantitative measures of body posture algorithmically derived from video recordings, we demonstrate for the first time that neck flexion fully mediates the effects of posture on mood in a postural feedback (i.e. “power posing”) paradigm; that is, adopting expansive and contractive body language affects mood by introducing variability in neck flexion. We also investigate several other mediators and moderators of postural feedback, finding that both perceived difficulty of the posture and awareness of one’s body play key roles, and identify a muscular correlate of neck flexion which correlates with mood effects. The present work carries implications for our understanding of the adaptive benefits of expansive and contractive postures, as well as substantial methodological insights for controversial research on power posing.",

          "authors": "Lena Adel; Lisane Moses; Elisabeth Irvine; Kyle Greenway; Guillaume Dumas; Michael Lifshitz",
          "abstract": "Therapeutic alliance is defined as the collaborative relationship between patient and therapist. Strong therapeutic alliances have been associated with positive clinical outcomes, but much remains unknown about alliance and its physiological basis. Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) – the synchronization of neural signals between interacting individuals – is emerging as a novel lens for studying interactions with relatively objective and time-sensitive neuroimaging techniques. We searched four databases to identify studies of INS in clinical encounters. Our search yielded 161 articles, 46 met criteria for full-text review and 12 were included. The included articles reported INS across a total of 174 dyads, all published since 2018. Despite diverse methodologies, INS was observed in all studies and was often related to therapeutic outcomes. However, results were mixed regarding associations between INS and therapeutic alliance. These results highlight that, while promising, additional research is needed to elucidate the relationship between INS, therapeutic alliance and clinical outcomes. Future studies should aim to standardize methodologies, explore temporal dynamics (e.g., through longitudinal assessments), and include larger sample sizes.",

          "authors": "Yali Pan",
          "abstract": "Processing emotional information is a key ability in human life. However, little is known about how this innate ability affect acquired abilities such as reading. In this study, we recorded eye movements of 43 participants as they silently read 210 one-line English sentences. Each sentence contained a target word manipulated by emotional content (negative/neutral/positive) and word frequency (low/high). All target words were unpredicted, with well-controlled prior sentential context and pre-target words. We found a significant main effect of the target word frequency on the first fixation durations of pre-target words, indicating a lexical parafoveal-on-foveal (PoF) effect, supporting the parallel processing models in reading. Notably, this study is the first to report an interaction between emotional content and word frequency during parafoveal reading, observed in early eye movement measures (i.e., first fixation and gaze durations). This suggests that emotional information can be extracted from the parafovea and influences lexical access. During foveal reading, we found that emotional words were fixated shorter than neutral words, with no difference between positive and negative words. However, this emotional processing priority was found only for low frequency words. Interestingly, the interaction between emotional content and word frequency was observed in the early stage of parafoveal processing but in the late stage of foveal processing, highlighting a dynamic and intricate interplay between emotional processing and lexical access. Overall, our findings suggest that emotion processing is automatic and takes precedence, influencing lexical access even in the “unattended” area like the parafovea.",

          "abstract": "Background. This study examines the decline in average reading literacy among primary school students in European countries between 2016 and 2021, as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) documented. This period is characterized by disruptions due to COVID-19-related school closures and changes in student composition, influenced mainly by societal trends across many European countries.\nAims. We estimated trends in reading literacy adjusted for changes in student composition to assess the relationship between the duration of school closures and school-related learning loess.\nSample. We utilized data from 2016 and 2021 from 18 European countries/regions as part of the PIRLS, involving a representative sample of approximately 5,000 fourth graders per year and country/region (N = 187,386; Mean Age = 10.28, SD = 0.86; 49.50% female).\nMethods. Our analytical approach employed propensity score weighting to balance changes in student composition between the 2016 and 2021 cohorts.\nResults. Our findings revealed changes in student composition across most of the 18 countries/regions. First, the average adjusted decline in reading literacy across all 18 European countries/regions was significantly lower than the observed decline, but it remained substantial. Second, the expected decline was associated with the length of COVID-related school closures, estimated at ‒0.0015 SDs per day.\nConclusions. School closures and changes in the composition of student cohorts played a substantial role in the decline in reading literacy observed between 2016 and 2021. This study enhances our understanding of how student composition and school-related factors influence trends in reading literacy.",

          "abstract": "Some ethical committees question whether individuals with a history of self-harm thoughts and behaviours (SHTBs) are “too vulnerable” to take part in Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research and if repeatedly asking about SHTBs could be harmful. Past research has focused on whether participating in ESM research influences SHTBs, and has overlooked participants’ general experience of ESM studies. We explored the relationships between ESM beep disturbance (disruptiveness) and compliance, and lifetime and current SHTBs. N=1507 participants completed baseline questionnaires, including about lifetime history of SHTBs, and N=1788 completed ESM 10x per day for six days, including questions about how much completing the ESM questionnaire disturbed them, and their SHTBs in daily life. There were no significant differences in disturbance or compliance between individuals with no lifetime history of SHTBs, self-harm thoughts, or self-harm behaviours. Individuals reporting self-harm behaviours during the ESM period were more likely to experience the ESM questionnaires as more disturbing. Individuals experienced the ESM questionnaires as more disturbing when more intense self-harm thoughts were reported during the ESM period on average and when their current self-harm thoughts were more intense. Our results indicate that lifetime history of SHTBs does not relate to ESM compliance or beep disturbance. However, ESM may be more taxing for individuals experiencing more intense current SHTBs, and at moments when their self-harm thoughts are more intense. We suggest that a ‘static vulnerability’ approach to ethical evaluation of ESM research based on lifetime history of SHTBs is inappropriate, and that a dynamic approach is preferable.",

          "abstract": "Background: Insomnia is highly prevalent and associated with serious health issues. Despite the negative impact of poor sleep on mind and body, most people do not seek treatment. This study aimed to examine the strategies used to improve sleep in the general population and investigate the characteristics of individuals using music as a sleep aid.\nMethods: A survey was distributed via Facebook advertisements to Danish adults aged 18 and above. Among 3667 responders, a representative subsample of 1195 participants was randomly selected based on age and sex. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Bergen Insomnia Scale. Data analysis involved chi-square tests and logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, education and insomnia status. \nResults: This study found that nearly all participants utilized strategies to aid their sleep, with the most common strategies being “following a routine” (73%), “reducing caffeine in the afternoon/evening” (65%) and “lowering the temperature in the bedroom” (62%). Individuals with insomnia utilized significantly more strategies compared to those without insomnia. Among the participants, 29% reported using music for sleep, with 4.5% using music almost daily. Music users tended to be younger and more likely to suffer from insomnia.\nConclusions: By evaluating a broad range of sleep strategies, this study shows that people do several things to promote sleep in their daily lives. More strategies are used by people with insomnia, but people without insomnia consider specific behaviours to facilitate sleep as well. This research enhances our understanding of sleep behaviour, providing an important fundament for targeting future public health interventions to improve sleep in the general population.",

          "authors": "Takanori Sano; Hideaki Kawabata",
          "abstract": "Facial attractiveness is a critical factor in forming interpersonal impressions. Evaluations of facial attractiveness were previously considered universal. However, it has recently been pointed out that individuals and cultures can diversify their evaluations. This study conducted Web experiments using the facial images of Japanese and American participants to examine the effects of raters’ gender, age, and culture on facial attractiveness. Experiment 1 examined the impact of gender and age on Japanese raters. Experiment 2 explored the effects of culture on Japanese and American raters. Statistical and morphometric analyses were conducted on the obtained data. The results showed significant positive correlations between attractiveness ratings across gender, age, and culture. However, the results of the geometric morphometrics revealed that Japanese female participants emphasized linear contours in attractive male images more than Japanese male participants. Additionally, Japanese raters were more likely than American raters to emphasize raised eyebrows for faces in attractive male images and smaller mouths for faces in attractive female images. These results suggest that the specific facial features driving attractiveness evaluations differ depending on gender and culture, offering detailed insights into the culturally diverse standards of facial attractiveness. This study adds to the growing understanding of how cultural and individual factors shape aesthetic preferences, questioning the notion of universal beauty and offering a clearer framework for future cross-cultural research on facial attractiveness.",

          "authors": "Mazidi",
          "abstract": "Alexithymia is characterised by difficulties identifying and describing feelings, as well as a lack of focus on feelings. Alexithymia is a transdiagnostic risk factor for developing a wide array of psychopathologies, such as anxiety and depression, with a key hypothesised mechanism being the impairing impact of alexithymia on emotion regulation. However, no study has tested whether difficulties with emotion regulation mediate the link between alexithymia and clinically relevant symptoms using longitudinal designs. The present study aimed to address this limitation by collecting data from 242 Iranian high school students at two time points, seven months apart. The results revealed that baseline alexithymia levels not only related to future emotion regulation difficulties but predicted increased emotion regulation difficulties in the future. Furthermore, these increased difficulties in emotion regulation mediated the relationship between baseline alexithymia and worsening of psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms) over time. This study, therefore, supports the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia in its theoretical account linking alexithymia and emotion regulation difficulties and highlights the critical role that alexithymia plays in emotional health and illness during adolescence.",

Because these sensations are critical for social interaction, tactile preferences may be adapted to the characteristics of the human body. Our group has demonstrated that compliance (a physical correlate of softness) increased the tactile pleasantness of a deformable surface until it reaches around the same level as those of human body parts. However, individuals such as those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often avoid being touched by others. Does ASD have atypical affective response patterns to soft objects like human body parts? Herein, adults with ASD and typically developed (TD) adults numerically estimated the perceived pleasantness or softness while lightly pressing urethane rubbers with their right index fingers. The results revealed that pleasantness increased as a function of compliance, but this increase was smaller for ASD than TD, particularly at compliance levels including human body parts. However, the perceived softness increased as a function of compliance similarly between the ASD and TD groups. This result demonstrates an atypical preference of ASD individuals for soft objects, which may explain the avoidance of ASD to social touch.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This critical review examines the application of two commonly-used adaptive functioning measures, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – Third Edition (Vineland-3) and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System – Third Edition (ABAS-3), to the behavioral intervention context. The review focuses on periodic outcome and treatment planning assessment in people with autism spectrum disorder receiving comprehensive and intensive behavioral intervention (CIBI) programs. Methods: Instrument technical manuals were reviewed and a PubMed search was used to identify published manuscripts that included the Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 as a primary focus with relevance to development, psychometric properties, or measure interpretation. Results: Analysis begins by introducing the roles of periodic outcome assessment for CIBI programs. Next, the Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 are evaluated in terms of their development processes, psychometric characteristics, and practical aspects of their implementation to inform everyday practice. Examination of each measure’s development indicates that they were not specifically designed for use with individuals with autism spectrum disorder or within CIBI programs. Furthermore, the evidence for several key psychometric characteristics is either unavailable or suggests less than desirable properties, while evaluation of practical considerations for implementation revealed weaknesses in ongoing intervention monitoring and clinical decision support. Conclusions: The Vineland-3 and ABAS-3 have significant weaknesses relevant to their application in CIBI outcome assessment. Alternative approaches are offered, including developing and adopting measures specifically developed for individuals with autism spectrum disorder and the CIBI intervention context.",

Experiment 1 evaluates participants’ independent ability to perform the\ntask of estimating the number of objects in a jar from various viewpoints. The results show\nthat depending on the type of objects, some viewpoints provide more accurate estimates\nthan others. Experiment 2 confirms that participants are able to identify these more\ninformative viewpoints. Building on these findings, Experiment 3 examines how individuals\nadjust their estimates when presented with estimates from a human advisor and an AI\nadvisor. Individuals are also given information about the advisor’s perspective. Our\nfindings are consistent with egocentric discounting where individuals exhibit a general bias\ntoward their own information. However, this discounting is lower for AI advisors compared\nto human advisors in our experiment. Our results also show that the advisor’s estimate is\ntaken more into account when the advisor has a more favorable viewpoint – for both\nhuman and AI advisors. This suggests a potential for optimizing advice-taking behavior by\nenhancing people’s understanding of the advisor’s viewpoint. This study furthers our\nunderstanding of advice-taking dynamics with human and AI advisors and the role of\nperspective-taking in decision-making processes.",

          "authors": "Yilin Wang; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "Stereotypes in the real world are complex, varying by perceivers, situations, and intersecting identities. These modifying factors are often overlooked in the literature. We address this gap by having participants freely write stories about how people view 9 different groups across 6 representative situations and of 30 intersectional identities. To identify stereotypes in these stories, we leverage large language model GPT to detect stereotypes. Across two pre-registered studies with U.S. representative participants (N = 1,721), we found that although stereotypes are considered products of social learning, they varied considerably across perceivers. While seen as overgeneralized associations about the groups, stereotypes significantly varied by situation. Multiple categorizations do not shape intersectional stereotypes equally, with Asian showing dominating effects likely due U.S. population’s lower exposure to this group than familiar identities (Black/White, women/men, old/young). These findings highlight how individual experiences, situation norms, and identity representativeness interact to shape stereotypes in naturalistic contexts.",

These properties are crucial for language's flexibility and expressivity, but the cognitive biases driving their emergence remain unclear. \n\nTo address this, we designed a real-time communication game where participants developed auditory signaling systems, generalizing from a small number of learned signal-meaning mappings to communicate about a continuous color space. The emergent communication systems exhibited both discreteness and systematicity. Systematicity, in particular, predicted successful communication. Our results suggest that cognitive biases toward non-arbitrary meaning-form associations may facilitate the development of successful cooperative communication.",

          "abstract": "While verbal and numeric confidence may similarly predict identification accuracy, there are many challenges to overcome in the use of verbal confidence, despite the criminal justice system’s preference for it. Eyewitnesses could potentially provide scale ratings after verbal judgments or vice versa, if the confidence-accuracy relationship is maintained. In two studies, participants watched one or more mock-crime videos and then viewed target-present or target-absent lineups for the perpetrators. After each lineup, participants provided confidence either verbally (in their own words) and then numerically (0-100%), or numerically and then verbally. For verbal confidence judgments and numeric confidence judgments, neither order nor the interaction predicted identification accuracy. Asking eyewitnesses to provide confidence both verbally and numerically does not negatively impact the confidence-accuracy relationship, regardless of order. However, we show that there is considerable variability in the meaning eyewitnesses assigned to their own word confidence judgments, which suggests asking for own words confidence only is problematic. We caution that the usefulness of verbal confidence to predict accuracy hinges on a systematic approach to its interpretation.",

          "authors": "Orestis Zavlis; Peter Fonagy; Michael Moutoussis; Giles W Story",
          "abstract": "Existing models of personality disorder are statistical models: dispersion patterns of personality facets. Although useful in describing personality differences, such models fall short in terms of explaining those differences. Generative models can address these explanatory gaps by explicating the mechanisms that generate descriptive pathologies. In this paper, we aim to move beyond the former descriptive models and toward the latter explanatory ones. To do so, we formalize personality pathology using a generative model that has four properties. First, it is probabilistic: it outlines how humans leverage uncertainty to make sense of their own and others’ ways of being. Second, it is mentalizing: it posits that personality pathology is about poor ways of experiencing and relating to the self and others. Third, it is hierarchical: it accounts for the multiplicity of self- and other- states (in the here-and-now) and traits (in the long-run). Finally, it is dynamic: it outlines how these properties evolve over time, accounting for the development of personality. Simulating data from this model, we demonstrate how it can account for the generation, maintenance, and treatment of various personality problems (from borderline instability to narcissistic grandiosity) by formalizing them as relational problems: problems with navigating relationships. We thus discuss how our model could be used to address recent debates on what is central to personality pathology by clarifying the distinction between description (what personality ‘is’) and explanation (what personality ‘does’). We conclude the paper with a tutorial on our model and suggestions for future research.",

          "authors": "Orestis Zavlis; Giles W Story; Peter Fonagy; Michael Moutoussis",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal dynamics have long been acknowledged as instrumental to the generation and alleviation of psychopathology problems. Recent computational approaches have been argued to be uniquely suited for investigating such dynamics either with exploratory models (machine learning) or confirmatory models (generative modeling). However, the utility of such models to the study of interpersonal problems has not yet been scrutinized. We thus conducted a systematic review to assess the validity, reliability, and openness of computational models to the study of interpersonal psychopathology problems. Candidate studies (n = 2,944), including peer-reviewed conference manuscripts, were derived from five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar) up to September 2024. A total of 55 studies met inclusion criteria and were assessed for their computational approach, validity, reliability, and openness. Results indicated that Bayesian modeling was the most commonly used approach (k=19), followed by machine learning (k=16), dynamical systems modeling (k=10), and reinforcement learning (k=10). Quality assessments revealed considerable heterogeneity in the validity of these approaches, with some scoring high primarily on empirical validity (reinforcement learning), others on theoretical validity (dynamical systems), and yet others on generative validity (Bayesian models). Finally, and most strikingly, few studies reported comprehensive performance metrics and even fewer studies adopted open science practices (specifically, 2 pre-registered their hypotheses and 8 shared their data and code online). We discuss these matters and conclude with more optimistic messages regarding how, when rigorously and openly conducted, computational approaches have the potential to advance the field of interpersonal psychopathology by enabling us to formalize and examine historically elusive social concepts (like mental representations of the self and others) and their role in psychopathology problems.",

          "abstract": "There is growing concern about the impact of political engagement on health. Consequently, interest has increased in how people cope with the effects of politics on their wellbeing. We applied an affective science framework to investigate whether interoceptive sensibility, i.e., attunement to our inner bodily feelings, can attenuate the extent to which politics affect people’s health. In a US sample of Republican (n=311) and Democratic (n=321) supporters, we found that interoception can counteract the adverse effects of political engagement on citizens’ health, irrespective of their political party. Importantly, this protective function of interoception does not impact citizens’ political engagement and participation. If anything, people with higher interoceptive sensibility appear more resilient to the impact that politics can have on their health and are more likely to be politically engaged. These findings pave the way for new studies on the intricate and complex relations between embodiment, emotions and politics.",

However, eye-movement indicators of mind-wandering during reading have not yet been clearly identified. This article presents results from two studies. Firstly, we carried out a meta-analysis to identify eye movement indicators of mind-wandering during reading. From the initial search, abstracts from 140 articles were reviewed for eligibility, and 39 articles were included for full text reading and data extraction. Finally, we identified 16 individual datasets from 19 articles for which we could compute effect sizes. We calculated effect sizes for 9 eye-movement measures: mean fixation duration, fixations count, first-fixation duration, gaze duration, total reading time, saccade length, skipping, blink count, and inter-word regressions. The results indicated that readers skipped more words and made fewer fixations during mind-wandering compared to on-task reading. Following these results, we carried out exploratory analyses with a dataset from our own lab to examine other possible explanations for this eye-movement pattern. Specifically, we investigated readers’ sensitivity to word frequency and length and readers’ use of corrective regressions. Results indicated that readers show reduced effects of word length and frequency on skipping behavior as well as a reduced use of corrective regressions during mind-wandering compared to on-task reading. Results and implications from both studies are discussed in the context of mind-wandering and reading research.",

          "abstract": "Making misleading statements may benefit a politician, for example during an election campaign. However, there are potentially also negative consequences; political misinformation can taint democratic debate, voters may be misled into forming false beliefs, and being fact-checked may damage a politician’s reputation. Previous research has found that correcting misleading statements made by established politicians reduces topical misperceptions, but hardly affects voter feelings and support. Here, we examined the impact of political misinformation and fact-checking when politicians are unfamiliar. Participants (N = 406) were engaged in a simulated election campaign set in an unfamiliar country, featuring statements from fictional candidates. Participants indicated their feelings toward the candidates, cast a vote, and rated their belief in the fact-checked statements. Misleading statements that were not corrected positively affected feelings towards and voting for (right-leaning) politicians. Corrective fact-checks had large effects, reducing belief in misinformation, and fact-checked candidates were viewed much less favorably and attracted far fewer votes. This demonstrates that in the absence of strong pre-existing attitudes, corrective fact-checks can negatively impact misinformation-spreading politicians who are not (yet) well-known.",

          "abstract": "Most of the 7.1 million current global COVID deaths could likely have been prevented if the initial behavioral response in Wuhan, China had been different. Since the virus has spread globally, national death rates have varied from less than 1 to 660 deaths per 100,000. If all countries had responded like neighboring countries in Asia, half of global deaths could have been prevented. The United States with 1.2 million COVID deaths, 17% of the global total, has one of the highest COVID death rates, more than five times higher than expected from age, income, and temperature and more than six times the rate in Japan, which has more elderly. Five-year age-adjusted COVID death rates in US states vary from 66 to 410 per 100,000 in Non-Hispanic Whites, a six-fold difference. The state’s percentage of Trump votes in 2020 explains 51% of these differences, with death rates 69% higher in high vs low percentage states overall and 225% higher in 2021, the year with the most deaths. Residents of states with more Trump votes have been half as likely to be vaccinated and to practice social distancing. If the US had responded to COVID like Japan, almost a million American lives would have been saved. If all states had responded like the best Blue State, Hawaii, more than 900,000 lives would have been spared. In addition, using death certificate data, we estimate that the prevalence of Long COVID is 2.7 times higher in states with more vs less Trump votes (10.5±2.3% vs 3.8±1.2%). We discuss how three mental traits evolved through natural and sexual selection may help to explain such dysfunctional behavioral responses to life threatening danger: the tendency to form dominance hierarchies, rampant ingroup favoritism, and the often lethal combination of risk taking and overconfidence, especially in males.",

          "abstract": "Online participant recruitment is a cornerstone of modern psychology research. While this offers clear benefits for studying individual differences in cognitive abilities, test performance can vary across lab-based and web-based settings. Here we assess the stability of normative test scores across popular online recruitment platforms and in-person testing, for three standard measures of face identity processing ability: the GFMT2, CFMT+, and MFMT. Participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) scored approximately 10 percentage points lower in all tests compared to those recruited through Prolific and university students tested in the lab. Applying stricter exclusion criteria based on attention checks resulted in notably higher exclusion rates for the MTurk group (~62%) compared to the Prolific group (~22%), yet even after exclusion, some test scores remained lower for MTurk participants. Given that the GFMT2 subtests were developed using MTurk participants, we provide updated normative scores for all subtests (GFMT2-Short, GFMT2-Low, GFMT2-High) and further recommendations for their use. We also confirm the robust psychometric properties of the GFMT2-Short and GFMT2-High, demonstrating strong test-retest reliability, convergent validity with other established tests, and high diagnostic value in identifying super-recognisers.

          "authors": "Joseph M. Saito; Frida Printzlau; Yvanna Yeo; Keisuke Fukuda",
          "abstract": "Items stored in visual working memory often differ in priority. Typically, observers will shift their internal attention towards items that are relevant for impending behavior and away from those that may become relevant later. These distinct states of priority are theorized to influence bidirectional interactions between memoranda and new visual inputs by modulating their susceptibility to retroactive and proactive biases, respectively. However, prior research has produced limited and conflicting evidence on this topic due to reliance on inconsistent retrodictive cues (retro-cues) that incentivize memory prioritization. To address this, we used a double-serial retro-cue paradigm that incentivized the complete prioritization of one of two unfamiliar shape memoranda for use in a comparison with a perceptual probe before a second, independent cue instructed observers to report one of their two memories (Experiments 1-2) or the perceptual probe itself (Experiment 2). We found that observers reported robust retroactive and proactive biases, but that only retroactive biases were modulated by prioritization. Reports of prioritized memories were more precise and contained smaller attractive biases towards the probe than unprioritized memories, whereas probe reports were biased comparably towards each. These findings reveal an asymmetrical effect of prioritization on the reciprocal interactions between memory and perception.",

          "abstract": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a graph, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at the semantic level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graph perception. Using functional MRI, we indeed found that graph trend judgement recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value which indexes the statistical correlation in the graph. Our work offers a first approach to the neural bases of graph perception. We suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

Being a member of a minority (vs. majority) is a common experience that varies both between groups in a context and within a group between contexts, but how does it affect in-group love? Across six studies, we examined when and why being in the minority boosts in-group love. In Study 1, being in the minority boosted people’s appreciation of various real-life in-groups but not out-groups. In Study 2, a real-life interaction between and within groups, people cooperated more with minority in-group (but not minority out-group) members. In Studies 3-6, we measured cooperation (Study 3, incentive-compatible), appreciation (Studies 4-6), and four mediators: perceived in-group distinctiveness, experienced in-group belongingness, expected in-group cooperation, and perceived in-group status. These four mediators independently and simultaneously explained why being in the minority boosted in-group love. In Studies 5 and 6, we observed two theoretical boundary conditions for the effect. The size of the effect was smaller when the minority in-group had many (vs. few) members (Study 5), and when the imbalance between the in-group and out-group was either low or high (here: 46% minority &amp; 54% majority, or 20% minority &amp; 80% majority) rather than moderate (here: 33% minority &amp; 67% majority).

We begin by rehearsing the Free Energy Principle and Predictive Processing as foundational frameworks which subserve and inform the thesis that follows. The following sections examine three aspects of archetypes: the affective core rooted in subcortical systems, archetypal imagery emergent in altered states such as psychedelic experiences, and archetypal stories encoded in higher cortical areas. Specifically, we propose a trilogical interplay between high-level cortex, low-level cortex, and subcortical/affective systems in instantiating these archetypal phenomena. We then explore how archetypes may be transmitted between individuals, developing into a collective unconscious through social learning and subsequent attunement. Throughout, we provide syntheses of Jungian psychology with contemporary neuroscience, offering testable hypotheses regarding the neurological bases of archetypal phenomena. We conclude with discussing implications for both psychoanalytic theory and neuroscientific research. By bridging these disciplines, we aim to lend construct validity to Jungian concepts and encourage further empirical investigation of archetypes and the collective unconscious.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a broad variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, academic articles, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. In practice, using large language models (LLMs) remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around privacy, cost, compute requirements, and computational expertise, and may prefer interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios. Lexicons offer a simpler solution by counting relevant words and phrases, making them very popular in the social sciences and as baseline models in computer science.  Existing lexicons are limited because they measure a fixed set of constructs that are unlikely to cover the specific constructs of interest for a given application, resulting in low content validity. Building and validating new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. We used the lexicon counts to predict risk levels in crisis counseling conversations. After validating it with experts, our model outperformed the widely-used LIWC lexicon and performed similarly to deep learning models. Through feature importance analysis, we discovered that active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation or depressed mood. To simplify creating and validating new lexicons for any domain of research, we introduce a protocol and Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of generative AI models.",

          "abstract": "Does gratitude for the past strengthen our connection to our past and future selves? Across three pre-registered studies (N=1,779 US participants), we explored the relationship between gratitude and self-continuity–our sense of self-similarity across time. In Study 1, higher general gratitude and past-self gratitude (PSG) were associated with increased self-continuity 10 years into the past and future, with the association between gratitude and future self-continuity (FSC) significant when controlling for demographic variables and the alternative temporal dimension of self-continuity. Study 2 replicated these results in a representative US sample, finding that gratitude is linked to FSC up to 25 years ahead. Study 3 demonstrates that expressing PSG causally increases past and future self-continuity, effects not observed for gratitude towards others. Our findings suggest that individuals with higher general gratitude feel more connected to their intertemporal selves, and that promoting PSG could strengthen self-continuity, with the potential to benefit future-oriented decision-making.",

Someone experience this state more frequently than others, a variation that can be related to trait shyness. Existing methodologies face challenges in distinguishing the psychological correlates of these two shyness dimensions. To address this gap, this research developed an audio corpus designed to induce state shyness, consisting of two subsets with 25 situation descriptors each. In Study 1, descriptors were developed through semi-structured interviews with 126 student volunteers (Mage=23.63±2.76) and thematic analysis, their efficacy was assessed via self-reports from 52 participants (Mage=18.73±1.50). Study 2 utilized Electrodermal Activity with 32 participants (Mage=20.15±1.98), further validated the corpus and addressed the potential demand effects. Together, this research offered a method to distinguish the characteristics of trait and state shyness, providing insights for researchers aiming to differentiate psychological correlates of trait and state in other variables.",

To identify potential strategies to increase the accessibility, actionability, and reach of those resources, this study (1) determined the audiences that online suicide and NSSI resources are written for, (2) evaluated the extent to which those resources include evidence-based prevention strategies, (3) characterized how resources communicate information about suicide and NSSI, and (4) determined whether resource characteristics predicted participants’ ratings of resources. Undergraduate students (N = 366; 68% White) rated subsets of 59 suicide and NSSI resources for personal relevance, understandability, usability, approval, and likelihood of recommending that online resource. The resources were coded for specified audience demographics, evidence-based prevention strategies, and communication techniques. Results showed that most resources were written for a specified audience (61%), included evidence-based prevention strategies (100%), and had a high school or undergraduate reading level (92%). Results from linear regression analyses indicated that specified audience demographics (e.g., youth, adults), prevention strategies (i.e., support networking), and communication techniques (i.e., tone) featured in resources predicted recommendation and approval ratings. Findings demonstrate that while there are many online resources available to the public, they may not be accessible, culturally responsive, or usable. This research can inform the development of more relevant mental health resources for individuals with suicidal ideation and NSSI.",

          "authors": "David Březina",
          "abstract": "Typeface design, i.e. the way the characters from a particular font are drawn, affects the similarity and legibility of character shapes and, consequently, reading performance. Yet, character recognition and similarity studies are usually conducted with stimuli from a single font and script which makes the results difficult to generalise. This paper reports on a study conducted to examine the perceived similarity in a range of common typefaces intended for continuous reading in Cyrillic, Devanagari, and Latin scripts. A new experimental approach (contextual similarity task) was used in order to avoid stimulus presentation that would be detrimental to the quality of typeface designs (e.g. low resolution, small size, short exposure time). Participants were presented with character triplets and asked to pick the odd one out, thus judging the remaining two characters as more similar. The cognitively simple, yet challenging, task was used to obtain data that permit a more detailed and realistic enquiry of internal character representations to better understand character similarity relationships. The diverse selection of typefaces, world scripts, and participants (n=1721) challenged the robustness of the method and illustrated its transferability across world scripts. The results of comparisons across typefaces and with other studies showed that the contextual similarity task is sensitive to the effects of typeface design and elicits similarity judgements that are hard to predict using typical similarity matrices derived from tasks with pairs or individual characters. Comparison across groups of participants with different script expertise showed no significant difference in their similarity judgements.",

However, much less is known about potential costs of social interaction, such as loss of autonomy. Here, we test a potential relatedness–autonomy tradeoff by comparing feelings of connectedness and autonomy when people were socially interacting versus not. College student participants completed experience sampling method (ESM) self-reports (N = 352, 10,046 observations) of their momentary social interactions, feelings of social connectedness, autonomy, and positive affect. We found that people report lower autonomy when interacting with others compared to when alone. This is especially true for people higher in trait attachment avoidance. However, interaction partner matters: people report higher autonomy during interactions with romantic partners compared to when alone. Our study findings provide ecologically valid evidence for a tradeoff between relatedness and autonomy during social interactions with non-romantic others.",

This study investigates the role of psychedelic-induced aesthetic experiences in predicting positive psychological outcomes. Methods: Using a cross-sectional naturalistic survey, participants who had recently used classic psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD, or DMT completed measures assessing their acute experiences, including the novel Psychedelic Aesthetic Experience Questionnaire (PAEQ), the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI), and the Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). Post-experience psychological outcomes were evaluated using the Psychological Insight Scale (PIS) and general outcome measures, such as depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Results: We found significant positive correlations and predictive relationships between aesthetic experiences and emotional breakthroughs, psychological insight, mystical experiences, and general outcomes, while negative correlations and predictions were observed between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences such as fear and paranoia. Conclusions: These findings suggest that aesthetic enhancements during psychedelic sessions are associated with positive emotional engagement and cognitive shifts, which contribute to lasting psychological benefits. The inverse relationship between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences highlights the potential of optimizing the aesthetic environment during psychedelic therapy to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While meditation research has primarily focused on mental health outcomes and immediate cognitive and affective benefits, little is known about its influence on higher-order beliefs, such as views on free will and personal agency. Despite substantial references to free will and related concepts in Buddhist philosophy, to our knowledge, there has been no empirical work investigating the relationship between intensive meditation experience and belief in free will. The current study used a quasi-experimental approach to examine the influence of an 8-week intensive meditation retreat and a podcast comparison group on free will belief (FWB; as measured using the Free Will subscale of the Free Will Inventory). FWB was measured both at the beginning and end of the retreat. First, greater experience in meditation (measured in self-reported years meditating) was negatively correlated with belief in free will at the outset, suggesting that individuals with more meditation experience tended to have lower belief in free will. Next, changes in FWB were compared between the retreat group and the podcast comparison group who had access to the same instructional content via audio recordings. Overall, there was a decrease in free will belief for the retreat group, but free will belief for the podcast comparison group remained the same. Thus, the current study provides evidence that intensive meditation is associated with lower beliefs in free will, possibly driven by the influence of meditation on phenomenology of thought and changes in perception of the self. Furthermore, the current results suggest that measuring higher-order beliefs may be especially relevant when assessing mindfulness and meditation practices in applied settings.",

However, there are a number of ways that using machine learning-based face generation and manipulation software can introduce bias into the research process, thus threatening the validity of studies. The present article provides a summary of how one class of recently popular algorithms for generating faces–generative adversarial networks (GANs)--works, how we control GANs, and where biases (with a particular focus on racial biases) emerge throughout these processes. We discuss recommendations for mitigating these biases, as well as how these concepts manifest in similar modern text-to-image algorithms.",

Then, he reviews his group’s research on L1-L2 relationships and IDs in L2 learning, focusing on their longitudinal studies and reporting two new studies that examine the relationship between L1 achievement and L2 aptitude on the MLAT. He posits that the development of L1 literacy leads to growth in metalinguistic awareness, which enhances L1 literacy skills, and that L1 literacy and metalinguistic awareness provide the foundation for L2 aptitude, the ability to use and understand “decontextualized” material.

Theoretical work has failed to note and explore the nature and role of the strong evidence for large and stable IDs in early L1 attainment in all components of language development. Extensive research has also shown that there are strong relationships among IDs in L1 achievement, L2 aptitude, and L2 achievement outcomes. More recent investigations have found that prediction from the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT), the strongest single predictor of L2 achievement, may be due largely to MLAT’s assessment of L1 abilities, reinforcing the position that IDs in L2 achievement are strongly related to and constrained by L1 achievement. Despite the evidence that students’ L2 achievement is closely related to their L1 achievement developed prior to L2 exposure, SLA/L2 researchers have largely failed to consider L1 skills as a factor that explains IDs in L2 achievement. Several hypotheses are proposed to explain why SLA/L2 researchers consider IDs in L1 attainment to be unimportant for L2 achievement.",

We propose a new approach together with an open-access code (“Multi-interaction”) that \naim at simplifying the study of multimodal interactions and can be applied for comparison purposes \nto many species, regardless of their communication repertoire. First, we choose to annotate all \nmultimodal behaviors (i.e., communication signals and actions) that contribute to the informational \ncontent of the interaction and its overall structure. Second, the code we provide enables multimodal \nannotated interactions to be transcribed into unique sequences, using a method that preserves the \nfollowing information: the units making up the interaction, their order of appearance, their emitter, \ntheir potential overlap (intra- and/or inter-individual) and their duration. Third, the code provides \nautomatic computation of several quantitative measures that describe the overall structure of each \ninteraction, such as overall duration, number of units, diversity of units, percentage of inter?individual overlap, percentage of intra-individual superposition or each individual \"presence\" rate during the interaction. We aim to facilitate the processing of multimodal and multi-agent interaction data, enabling large datasets and species comparisons to be handled.

We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French).

This study aimed to adapt The Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (SEE; Wang et al., 2003) to the Romanian cultural context and to assess its reliability and validity. Employing exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a sample of adult Romanians (N = 466), we obtained a 20-item three-factor revised version that fitted the data adequately. All three scales of the revised SEE have an appropriate level of convergent and discriminant validity, as given by Average Variance Extracted coefficients (AVEs), and good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The scale was invariant across genders and age categories. Ethnocultural empathy, as measured with SEE, exhibited positive and significant correlations with general empathy, the cultural diversity within the respondents’ social network, Agreeableness and Openness to Experience, and negative correlations with Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and behavioral intentions of social distancing towards people from other racial or ethnic groups. We further proposed a 9-item short form of SEE (SEE-SF), which is a more parsimonious measure with a balanced number of items within each subscale. Both scale versions are robust measures of ethnocultural empathy with good psychometric properties. Based on these findings, we discuss the practical implications of ethnocultural empathy skills in a growing multicultural society.",

          "authors": "Aidan G.C. Wright; Florian Scharf; Johannes Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "Ambulatory assessment is widely popular in research settings for its ability to assess real world functioning in context. It can be useful for estimating an individual’s typical level of a behavior (individual mean), how (un)stable that behavior is (individual standard deviation), how behaviors associate with others or specific contexts (within-person correlation), and shifts in those statistics that might signal an important change in functioning (e.g., early warning signal). However, to date many of the methodological advances have not made the jump from the lab to diagnostic practice. Effective use of ambulatory assessment in applied settings to understand functioning and guide potential interventions requires development and application of psychometric standards for N=1 assessments (Wright &amp; Zimmermann, 2019). We conducted a simulation study to determine how many assessments are necessary to achieve sufficiently reliable (i.e., precise and stable) estimates of an individual’s mean and standard deviation on a single variable as well as the correlation between two variables. To ensure the ecological validity of the simulation conditions, we used real time series data from a large sample that included patients and non-patients (capturing realistic levels of autocorrelation and skewness). We found that the minimum number of assessments highly depends on the statistic of interest and the temporal characteristics of the variable of interest. Individual means can be estimated reliably with a reasonably small number of observations under most conditions, but adequately precise and stable individual correlations require more assessments than may be achievable in many applied settings. We discuss the implications of these results for the potential of applied ambulatory assessment in diagnostic practice.",

However, evidence remains inconclusive, particularly with regards to the possible links with psychopathology and the scarcity of substantial data on Italian-speaking individuals.\n\nMethods\nWe quantified a large set of prosodic and voice quality features from a free speech task conducted with Italian-speaking individuals with and without schizophrenia (SCZ – 29; CTR – 29), using a fully automated pipeline. Moreover, in the SCZ group we thoroughly assessed psychopathology using the Thought Language and Communication scale (TLC), the Clinical Language Disorder Rating scale (CLANG), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), the Examination of Anomalous Self Experience Scale (EASE) and the Autism Rating Scale (ARS).\n\nResults\nRelative to CTR, SCZ showed a different acoustic profile, with reduced speech rate and increased pause duration, fundamental frequency variability and breathy phonation. Temporal profile features were associated with most of the psychopathology tested, in particular with symptoms related to communication atypicalities but also to subjective experiences related to self and others. Other acoustic features related to pitch and intonation were associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia and subjective experiences related to others.\n\nConclusions\nThis study shows for the first time significant differences in prosody and voice quality in Italian speaking people with schizophrenia, as compared to neurotypical controls. Moreover, significant relationships between speech acoustic profile and fine psychopathology were found. Future research should expand this approach to transdiagnostic and cross-linguistic samples, to test the specificity of the investigated patterns.

          "abstract": "SilverCloud and THIS WAY UP (TWU) are two internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) programs that have demonstrated effectiveness for anxiety and depression, yet little is known about their comparative effectiveness. This non-randomized program evaluation compared client satisfaction, subjective engagement, and treatment outcomes between the SilverCloud and TWU programs. Participants were 195 adult patients (106 using SilverCloud and 89 using TWU) enrolled in a digital CBT clinic who completed assessment measures at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and one-, two-, three-, and four-month follow-ups. As hypothesized (preregistration: https://osf.io/x6bmy) patients in both programs reported high client satisfaction, and experienced improvements in depression (ds=-0.79 and -0.78), anxiety (ds=-0.95 and -0.84), and functional impairment (ds=-0.42 and -0.45), from pre- to post-treatment that were maintained at four-month follow-up. However, according to exploratory analyses, the slope of change in treatment outcomes was not significantly different between programs during the treatment and follow-up phases. As hypothesized, patients who used SilverCloud self-reported significantly greater subjective engagement with their iCBT program compared to patients who used TWU (d=0.36). However, contrary to hypotheses, client satisfaction was not significantly different between programs. This non-randomized program evaluation offers minimal evidence that one program was better than the other, though findings require replication in a randomized controlled trial and larger sample. Results provide further support for iCBT as a viable option to extend access to high-quality treatment for anxiety and depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: It's clear that the lasting impact of childhood events on mental health, specifically focusing on the concept of \"polyvictimization\" as a condition rather than isolated events. This is a key area of research, and understanding the incidence and effects of polyvictimization is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. \n\nObjective: The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of polyvictimization in Iran and to compare its occurrence among different socioeconomic status (SES) groups and various sexual orientations within the subtypes of polyvictimization. Additionally, using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, we investigate the prediction of impulsivity based on victimization.\nMethods: The study was conducted during the summer of 2023 and involved 573 adult participants aged 18 to 45 years. A demographic questionnaire, the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ) developed by Finkelhor and colleagues (2011), and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) were administered online. Participants were recruited through non-randomized sampling via social media platforms such as Telegram, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Data were collected by researchers, and descriptive statistics, ANOVA, post-hoc, and regression analysis were conducted using SPSS 26 and AMOS 26.\n\nResults: Out of the 573 participants (72.8% female; total mean age: 24.04; female mean age: 23.89; male mean age: 24.46), the average childhood victimization score was 11.95. Notably, 80.6% of participants were classified as high polyvictims (having experienced 7 or more types of victimization). Those with lower SES reported higher levels of victimization, and transgender individuals experienced higher victimization rates compared to other sexual orientation groups. To predict impulsivity based on victimization, the results of the regression analysis indicated that victimization significantly predicts cognitive impulsivity, motor impulsivity.\n\nConclusion: The rates of victimization in Iran exceed those in many other countries, including low-income nations. Considering the significant impact of victimization on mental health, further research is necessary to identify the root causes and potential interventions to alleviate the consequences of trauma.\n\nKeywords: Impulsivity, Incidence, Polyvictimization.",

          "abstract": "While reading narrative texts, the reader’s thoughts and attention often fluctuate from thoughts related to the content of the text (e.g., immersion into the story world), to thoughts unrelated to the text (e.g., mind-wandering). Research on mind-wandering and immersion suggests that these types of thought patterns influence the reading process in different ways. In this article, we examine the types of thoughts readers have while reading a literary text. Specifically, we investigated the effect of immersion and mind-wandering episodes on eye-movement behavior during reading. Fifty-six participants took part in the experiment and read extracts from Siri Hustvedt ”Memories of the Future” while their eye-movements were monitored. Participants’ thoughts were probed at regular intervals during reading using the multidimensional experience sampling method. We identified four thought components using principal component analysis on the responses to the prompts: Immersion, Mind-wandering, Sub-Vocalization, and Social Episodic Thoughts. We then ran General Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to examine the effect of these four thought types on eye movement behaviour and reading processes. Specifically, we examined the effect of thought types on the word frequency effect. Results show that eye movement behaviour and processing are influenced by the types of thoughts readers experience while reading literary texts. These results have important implications for the way that mind-wandering is typically investigated, particularly in reading research.",

          "authors": "Emily Ann Hughes; Joanne Smith",
          "abstract": "Drawing upon both social identity and balanced identity theories, the Social Identity Model of Behavioural Associations (SIMBA) presents a novel way of conceptualising and measuring the relationships among the constructs of social identity, group norms, and individual-level behaviour—that is, as cognitive-behavioural associations that mutually interact in a triadic constellation and can be measured both implicitly and explicitly. While the social identity approach suggests that the interaction between social identification and group norms shapes our individual behaviour, the SIMBA—through adopting the methodological underpinnings of balanced identity theory—advances upon this theorising to highlight that interactions among the three constructs are reciprocal and extend to the prediction of both social identification and group norms. Across four studies (total N=540), we tested the SIMBA in the context of drinking behaviour in relation to student (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and British national (Study 4) identities. On implicit measures, there was good support for the prediction that the strength of any one association in the SIMBA could be predicted by the interactive strength of the remaining two. Evidence for this prediction was largely absent on explicit Likert-type measures; we argue that this difference may be dependent on the explicit measures possessing theoretically meaningful zero-points.",

          "abstract": "We reflect on the concept of wisdom from a social psychological lens, with particular focus on the discrepancy between dynamic theories of wisdom and the largely atemporal nature of existing empirical evidence. Upon reviewing theoretical models of the key components of wisdom such as intellectual humility, open-mindedness, and empathy/perspective-taking, we outline how these characteristics differ across situational contexts. Next, we posit that the temporal dimension—essential to virtually all theories of wisdom—is paradoxically neglected or misinterpreted in empirical studies. Our findings are supported by a systematic review of literature, demonstrating that many conclusions about the development and effects of wisdom are based on insufficient, atemporal data. We outline several steps to address these challenges in wisdom and social psychological research more broadly, including enhanced sampling and modelling practices, to foster a temporally precise, social psychological understanding of wisdom-related characteristics.",

We used 18 artworks (9 created by humans and 9 created by the DALL-E system), providing both true and false information about the artworks’ authorship. \nWe analysed three possible worlds, an Alethic world (PW-A) without authorship information, an Epistemic world (PW-E) with either correct or incorrect authorship information; and a world with access to both Alethic and Epistemic worlds (PW-AE), where a comparison between ground and believed truth can be drawn. Furthermore, we administered the Big-Five personality test to understand if specific personality traits could influence the aesthetic judgments of subjects.\nOur findings include: i) creative judgments significantly correlate with both perceived pleasantness and emotional intensity across all possible worlds; ii) individuals tend to consider human-created artworks more creative only when they possess information about the authorship (PW-E and PW-AE); iii) artificially-generated artworks evoke more intense and positive emotions when people have no information about authorship (PW-A); iv) extroverted participants tend to find artworks generated by artificial systems more appealing when lacking information about the artworks' provenance.",

Study 2 developed a detection tool based on the findings from Study 1 and used two large datasets to evaluate its performance. It was found that the Type I error rates were 0, indicating no genuine human responses were falsely flagged by the detection tool.

The soundscapes of the Anthropocene are frequently characterized by an overabundance of sound sources, the vast majority of which are functionally irrelevant to a given listener. The problem of listening to speech in such environments must be solved by an auditory system that is not optimized for this task. So what does it mean to ''restore'' hearing for people with hearing loss? How might evolution optimize the sense of hearing for our world today? Building on our previous work on the two-competitor model and incorporating an active inference approach using free energy minimization, we argue that the answers to these question have implications not just for the study of human audition, but also for the development and broad awareness of hearing aids and cochlear implants, as well other auditory technologies such as ear buds, immersive auditory environments, and systems for human-machine interaction.",

          "abstract": "Background: Romantic relationships significantly influence physical and mental health. Existing measures of marital or relationship satisfaction often face limitations such as low internal consistency, excessive length, focus on counseling settings, or applicability only to married individuals. With evolving partnership dynamics, a concise and reliable tool applicable across various relationship types is needed. This study aimed to revise the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale (KMSS) to assess general relationship satisfaction and evaluate its psychometric properties.\n\nMethods: The original KMSS was modified to encompass satisfaction in all types of romantic partnerships. Two samples were utilized: the first (n = 280) to explore basic psychometric characteristics and validity, and the second (n = 946) for a detailed examination of the scale's functioning. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) assessed the factor structure, while item response theory (IRT) analyses evaluated item characteristics. Measurement invariance across gender and marital status was tested. Hypotheses regarding associations with neuroticism, well-being, education, gender, and age were examined.\n\nResults: The revised KMSS demonstrated excellent psychometric properties, with high reliability (Cronbach's α &gt; 0.90) and a unidimensional factor structure confirmed by CFA. Measurement invariance was established across genders and between married and unmarried participants. IRT analysis indicated high discrimination parameters for all items. The KMSS score was negatively associated with trait neuroticism (r = –0.11, p &lt; 0.001) and positively associated with well-being (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.001). No significant associations were found between KMSS scores and length of relationship, education level, gender, or age after controlling for covariates.\n\nConclusion: The revised KMSS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing relationship satisfaction across diverse types of partnerships. Its brevity and robust psychometric properties make it suitable for future research exploring the links between relationship satisfaction and health outcomes.",

Indirect effects of youth adversity on depression/anxiety via parental and peer support were estimated in a structural equation model, for 16 intersectionality profiles (based on gender, socio-economic status [SES], and ethnicity). Moderation attributable to these characteristics and their intersections was estimated.\nResults: Youth adversity had a detrimental impact on depression/anxiety across all intersectionality profiles (b=0.08-0.36, p=0.02). Parental and peer support did not mediate the effect of youth adversity on depression/anxiety broadly across profiles. However, a weak indirect effect of parental nurturing was observed for the Lower SES South Asian Female profile (θ=0.12 [&lt;0.01, 0.26]). \nConclusions: The harmful effects of youth adversity on adolescent mental health pervade across different societal intersections.

In countering this phenomenon, various local governments have been experimenting with citizen participation. In a large and representative sample of Belgian-Flemish citizens (N=2,205), we investigate whether the impact level and type of participation affects people’s perception of these initiatives. Impact level was operationalized through four different decision-making scenarios regarding an emblematic local policy case: repurposing an abandoned school building. Types of participation were operationalized through concrete participatory instruments (e.g., citizen panels, referendums), which varied both in how the input is solicited (aggregation or deliberation) and the extent of citizen influence (advisory or binding). Results show that participants perceived participatory scenarios as more legitimate than traditional representation, with the most outspoken preference for co-decision between government and citizens. As for concrete instruments, citizen consultations are most widely favored, and aggregation (consultations or referenda) is slightly preferred over deliberation (citizen panels). Individual differences showed modest effects on preferences, primarily affecting attitudes towards the participatory extremes (i.e., no input or full autonomy), and the relative preference of aggregative (referenda) versus deliberative (citizen panels) instruments. Altogether, this study provides useful guidelines for policy-makers who aim to cultivate legitimate participatory practices.",

In a large, representative sample of the Belgian-Flemish population (N=2205), we find that referendums appeal strongly to political cynics. However, when investigating their practical implementation, a different trend emerges. In a targeted survey of residents of a major Belgian-Flemish city (N=773), where the government organized local top-down referendums, political cynics were more critical and less likely to participate. This seemingly ironic finding was partially explained by political cynics’ tendency to disparage the specific issues addressed in these referendums, considering them as relatively less important. Our findings suggest that with suboptimal topic selection, local referendums may risk further alienating disillusioned citizens rather than reengaging them.",

          "abstract": "Sleep problems and perceived stress are linked to mental health outcomes. Epidemiological studies suggest that the effect of perceived stress on depressive symptoms is partially mediated by poor sleep quality. Naturalistic associations among perceived stress, affect, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms have not been thoroughly explored. We examine within-person associations among sleep, perceived stress, and affect in a naturalistic setting and the moderating effect of depression. Participants were 167 individuals (136 women, 29 men, 2 other gender) who completed a 21-day daily diary assessment. Multilevel models revealed that perceived stress (b = -0.01, p = 0.04) and negative affect (b = -0.05, p = 0.04) were lower than usual following nights of longer than usual sleep duration. In participants experiencing depression, increases in last night’s sleep quality were associated with decreases in next-day perceived stress (b = -0.02, p = 0.001) and negative affect (b = -0.01, p &lt; 0.001). Within-person mediation analyses indicated that last night’s sleep impacts negative affect via changes in perceived stress. Participants with depression experienced lower negative affect following nights of higher than usual sleep quality. Controlling for between-person differences in sleep duration and quality, within-person fluctuations in sleep duration and quality impacted next-day perceived stress and affect across populations. The daily functioning of individuals experiencing depression was especially sensitive to naturalistic fluctuations in sleep occurring in daily life, suggesting sleep may be a sensitive target for interventions that aim to reduce daily stress and negative affect in depression.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a formative period in which individuals become more aware of societal needs. To solve global collective challenges, it is critical to encourage prosociality in this developmental phase. School peers play a large role in acquiring prosocial norms and behaviors, yet their influence is rarely investigated experimentally. To understand if peer influence can be harnessed to promote prosociality, we set out to identify the most influential individuals within adolescents’ classroom social networks. In a pre-registered field experiment, we tested whether 456 adolescents aged 11 to 19, conformed more often to high- or low-status peers from their social network. Participants played an incentivized donation game where they could donate money to several charities or keep it to themselves. They could revise their decision upon observing the real choice of a known peer from their classroom. By manipulating the status of the observed sources, we show that high-status peers are consistently the most influential across all age groups, while overall peer influence declines with age.  Based on the social networks and conformity rates measured in the experiment, we simulated social contagion interventions to identify conditions that maximize the diffusion of prosocial behaviors. Simulation results show that picking central individuals as “influencers”, increases intervention effectiveness.

          "authors": "Ronny Bujok; Matteo Maran; antje meyer; Hans Rutger Bosker",
          "abstract": "Even though we can have successful conversations without seeing each other (e.g., in phone conversations), visual cues can further support speech comprehension. For example, speech is often produced together with co-speech hand gestures. Beat gestures specifically tend to co-occur with prominent words in a sentence, typically aligning to the stressed syllable. Hence, the alignment of beat gestures with specific syllables can affect spoken word recognition. For example, a beat gesture produced and aligned to a given syllable biases participants to perceive stress on this syllable. However, previous studies have primarily tested words in isolation and words with lexical stress competitors (e.g., CONtent vs. conTENT), where the beat gesture was crucial to disambiguate the word. Hence, it is unclear if beat gestures also support lexical access in more naturalistic conditions, such as when hearing words without a lexical stress competitor (e.g., Dutch LEger; English ARmy) in semantically constraining sentences. To answer this question, we presented participants with videos of a talker producing semantically constraining sentences containing a critical disyllabic sentence-final target in a lexical decision task. The target was either produced without a gesture or accompanied by a beat gesture aligned to the first or second syllable. Response times showed that participants were generally faster when the target was presented together with a beat gesture, regardless of its within-word alignment. Moreover, we found that this facilitatory effect was larger for words than pseudowords. These results provide evidence that beat gestures – even when they are not essential for successful speech comprehension – affect lexical access in highly constraining contexts.",

          "abstract": "How is the idea of ‘the bystander’ represented in popular media? And does this representation of ‘the bystander’ differ across cultures and languages? Daily bystander news stories in English and Mandarin, were collected through the Google News platform (N= 166) and its Chinese equivalent, Baidu News (N=89), over a six-month period. We analysed the valence (positive, neutral, negative) of the bystander news stories – and coded the prevalence of concepts from Western and Chinese theories of bystander behaviour. In Western media, bystanders were predominately presented in a neutral or positive way, with fewer than 5% of news headlines and stories having a negative valence. In contrast, Chinese media presented significantly more negative portrayals of bystanders, with negative depictions being as frequent as neutral or positive ones. We consider the implications of these findings for public understanding of the ‘bystander’ concept within Western and Chinese cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid growth of scholarly literature, efficient AI-aided abstract screening tools are becoming increasingly important. This study evaluated nine different machine learning algorithms used in AI-aided screening tools for ordering abstracts according to their estimated relevance. We focused on assessing their performance in terms of the number of abstracts required to screen to achieve a sufficient detection rate of relevant articles. Our evaluation centered on abstracts from the field of psychology, covering different research domains within this discipline. We explored how characteristics of the screening data, such as the proportion of relevant articles, the overall frequency of abstracts, and the amount of training data influenced the effectiveness of these algorithms. A key finding was that the algorithm combining the logistic regression classifier with the SBERT feature extractor outperformed other algorithms, demonstrating both the highest efficiency and the lowest variability in performance. Nonetheless, the algorithm's performance varied across experimental conditions. We discussed the results and derived practical recommendations to guide users in the AI-aided screening process.",

          "abstract": "People can become more cynical about the state of society when they see harmful behavior online. Three nationally representative studies of the American public (N = 1,090) revealed that people consistently and substantially overestimated how many social media users contribute to harmful behavior online. They believed that 43% of all Reddit users have posted severely toxic comments and that 33% of all Facebook users have shared false news online. In reality, platform-level data shows that most of these forms of harmful content are produced by small but highly active groups of users. This misperception was robust to different thresholds of harmful content and operationalizations of harmful content. An experiment revealed that overestimating the proportion of social media users who post harmful content makes people feel more negative emotion, perceive the U.S. to be in greater moral decline, and encourages distorted perceptions of what others desire to see on social media. However, these effects can be mitigated through a targeted intervention that corrects this misperception. Together, our findings highlight a novel perceptual mechanism that may explain why social media use can harm well-being and undermine social cohesion.",

In three experiments (N=106, ages 2;0−2;11 from across\nthe United States), we show that 2-year-olds only assume that novel words have distinct\nmeanings if the words were spoken with 'focus', an information-structural marker of contrast.\nWithout focus, we found no Mutual Exclusivity; novel words were understood to label familiar\nobjects.

          "abstract": "Much has been made of the apparent capacity for creativity of generative AI. However, as research expands the knowledge base regarding the capabilities and performance of this technology, the prevailing view is shifting away from “AI is creative” and towards a more balanced model of Human-AI co-creativity. Nevertheless, even this paradigm may be impacted by untested assumptions: for example, that generative AI will boost human performance on idea generation tasks. To test that assumption this study primed subjects with lists of words purportedly either from a human or from ChatGPT, and of varying degrees of creativity. Subjects then completed the Divergent Association Task (DAT). The results of this study found no evidence of any difference in divergent thinking resulting from either the source of priming (Human/ChatGPT) or from the level of creativity of the priming (low, typical and high), with one exception: a low-creativity prime, believed to be from ChatGPT, resulted in lower scores on the DAT compared to other priming conditions. This result was supported by a regression analysis, which found that only Openness and the perceived creativity of the prime were weak predictors of the subjects’ DAT scores. The consequences of these findings for Human-AI co-creativity are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one’s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DE) are a class of models in dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies used multi-armed bandit tasks to investigate individual differences in exploration strategies. However, the psychometric properties of these measures remain largely unexplored. We examined the test-retest reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and external validity of model-based estimates of exploration strategies. Our results revealed poor to moderate reliability, with minimal correlations for the same strategy across tasks. By refining the computational models, we identified two convergently valid latent factors representing value-guided and directed exploration. However, these factors showed no significant correlation with self-reported exploration tendencies and only weak associations with mood fluctuations. To improve future research, we suggest simplifying the computational models and using multiple tasks to more accurately model exploration strategies and mitigate spurious correlations arising from task-specific factors. A strong positive correlation with working memory and a lack of significant associations with questionnaire-based measures highlight both the potential and limitations of current behavioral paradigms in capturing exploration behavior.",

          "abstract": "Much has been learned about the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which humans and other animals navigate to reach their goals. However, most studies have involved a single, well-learned environment. By contrast, real-world wayfinding often occurs in unfamiliar settings, requiring people to combine memories of landmark locations with on-the-fly information about transitions between adjacent states. Here, we studied the strategies that support human navigation in wholly novel environments. We found that during goal-directed navigation, people use a mix of strategies, adaptively deploying both associations between proximal states (transitions) and directions between distal landmarks (vectors) at stereotyped points on a journey. Deep neural networks meta-trained with reinforcement learning to find the shortest path to goal exhibited near-identical strategies, and in doing so, developed units specialised for the implementation of vector- and transition-based strategies. These units coded for spatial positions, landmarks, and their conjunction. This suggests that optimal navigation in novel environments relies on an adaptive mix of transition- and vector-based strategies.",

The present study for the first time investigates whether childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in the context of unintended pregnancy, an event which is common and linked to a variety of potential stressors. Method: 189 individuals who either terminated (41%) an unintended pregnancy or carried it to term (59%) completed a self-report questionnaire of childhood maltreatment and a clinician-administered interview to assess lifetime trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms in the month prior to and 12 months after the end of the pregnancy. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis, t-tests, and change score analysis were conducted to investigate the interrelationships among childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Results: Participants most frequently reported sexual violence (25.83%), birth trauma (18.54%), or physical assault (16.56%) as their index trauma. Individuals with childhood maltreatment showed increased lifetime trauma exposure and exhibited greater PTSD symptoms 12 months after the unintended pregnancy. Childhood maltreatment did not predict a change in PTSD symptoms from pre- to post-pregnancy.\nConclusions: Childhood maltreatment is linked to increased PTSD symptoms that persist up to one year after an unintended pregnancy. These results have clinical implications for the inclusion of trauma-informed practices into reproductive care.",

The VTC exhibited axis-based feature coding, and by constructing a neural feature space using VTC neural axes, we observed that MTL neurons encode a receptive field within the VTC neural feature space. This computational framework explains how dense feature-based representations in the VTC are translated into sparse semantic-based representations in the MTL. We further validated our findings using an additional dataset with different stimuli. Lastly, we uncovered the physiological basis of this computational framework by demonstrating VTC-MTL interactions at multiple levels.

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. Ninety-six participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. In addition, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

          "abstract": "Background: Residual cognitive complaints are frequently observed in remitted depressed individuals (RMD), which can impair full recovery and increase the likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression. Cognitive control training has shown potential as a preventative intervention in RMD with small to moderate effect sizes, but substantial heterogeneity in effects between individuals exists. \nObjective: This study aimed to identify individual characteristics associated with treatment response to CCT in RMD participants using machine learning models.\nMethods: A sample of 225 RMD participants underwent a CCT regimen of at least ten training sessions. After splitting the dataset into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%), four models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest classifier, random classifier, and majority class classifier. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were computed. The importance of individual features in predicting preventative effects was assessed using standardized coefficients from the logistic regression model.\nResult: The logistic regression model demonstrated the highest performance among the models, although this was still considered to be low (accuracy: 0.58; AUC-ROC: 0.56). Exploratory feature importance analysis revealed that higher life satisfaction and effective coping strategies were positively associated with preventative effects, while current medication use, age and sense of well-being were negatively associated. \nConclusion: All models performed quite poorly, indicating that baseline RMD participant characteristics did not confidently predict CCT preventative effects. Exploratory feature analysis proposed some variables that increase the likelihood of benefiting from CCT. However, it also indicated that amount of prior depressive episodes and treatments did not affect preventative effects, suggesting that CCT may be suitable for a broad range of RMD individuals. In addition to substantiating our findings with larger sample sizes to improve model accuracy, future research should explore additional predictors.",

Here, we introduce a straightforward method for creating short versions of existing measures that are able to accurately determine participants’ sum scores, subscale scores, or factor scores. Our method, referred to as Factor Score Item Reduction with Lasso Estimator (FACSIMILE) uses lasso regularised regression to select items and weight them such that true scores can be predicted accurately from a reduced item set.

By critically examining how these effects operate within psychedelic experiences, we aim to draw greater attention to the role of suggestion effects as both a source of bias but also as a tool that can be leveraged to maximize therapeutic benefits.

The overall AGI score positively correlated with the intensity (r = 0.165; p &lt; 0.001) and positive valence (r = 0.251; p &lt; 0.001) of the acute psychedelic effects.\nConclusions: \nThe AGI is a novel scale for quantifying positive subacute (\"afterglow\") effects of psychedelics. The use of the AGI could lead to a better understanding of the interplay between acute, subacute, and long-term effects of psychedelics. Insights could also be gained into how different substances, dosages, and extra-pharmacological factors, such as psychotherapy, might influence outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown that adversity tends to be associated with lower working memory (WM) performance. This literature has mainly focused on impairments in the capacity to hold information available in WM for further processing. However, some recent adaptation-based studies suggest that certain types of adversity can leave intact, or even enhance, the ability to rapidly update information in WM. One key challenge is that WM capacity and updating tasks tend to covary, as both types of tasks require the creation and maintenance of bindings in WM; links between mental representations of information in WM. To estimate the associations between adversity and different processes in WM, we need to isolate variance in performance related to WM capacity from variance in performance related to updating ability. In this Registered Report, participants from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel completed three WM tasks: two complex span tasks and a task measuring both binding and updating of information. In addition, we estimated participants’ exposure to neighbourhood threat, material deprivation, and unpredictability. We estimated associations between the three types of adversity and latent estimates of WM capacity and updating using structural equation modeling. We did not find consistent associations between adversity and WM capacity or updating, nor did we find evidence that the associations were practically equivalent to zero. Our results show that adversity researchers should account for overlap in WM tasks when estimating specific WM abilities.",

          "abstract": "Tools such as pens, forks, and scissors play an important role in many daily-life activities, an importance underscored by the presence in visual cortex of a set of tool-selective brain regions. This review synthesizes decades of neuroimaging research that investigated the representational spaces in the visual ventral stream for objects, such as tools, that are specifically characterised by action-related properties. Overall, results reveal a dissociation between representational spaces in ventral and lateral occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). While lateral OTC encodes both visual (shape) and action-related properties of objects, distinguishing between objects acting as end-effectors (e.g., tools, hands) versus similar non-effector manipulable objects (e.g., a glass), ventral OTC primarily represents objects’ visual features such as their surface properties (e.g., material and texture). These areas act in concert with regions outside of OTC to support object interaction and tool use. The parallel investigation of the dimensions underlying object representations in artificial neural networks reveals both the possibilities and the difficulties in capturing the action-related dimensions that distinguish tools from other objects. While artificial neural networks offer promise as models of visual cortex computations, challenges persist in replicating the action-related dimensions that go beyond mere visual features. Taken together, we propose that regions in occipitotemporal cortex support the representation of tools based on a behaviorally relevant action code and suggest future paths to generate a computational model of this object space.",

          "abstract": "Excitability is a neuronal property quantified as the magnitude of neural response to stimuli. It plays a crucial role in information processing and is disrupted in various neuropsychiatric conditions. In humans, non-invasive measurements of brain excitability have been mostly limited to the primary motor cortex. Here, the response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is quantified as the magnitude of the muscular contraction. TMS mapping of brain excitability outside the motor cortex, simultaneously across brain areas, and in deep regions is challenging. Indeed, TMS has little depth penetration, and can only probe one cortical point at a time. Furthermore, the measurement of the responses to stimuli outside the motor cortex requires simultaneous neuroimaging, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Possible solutions include the application of stimulation approaches alternative to TMS, and the investigation of resting state properties of electromagnetic and hemodynamic brain activity. We show that, in combination with TMS or alone, neuroimaging will progressively allow non-invasive and accurate mapping of excitability with high spatio-temporal resolution, across the entire brain, and non-invasively. Here, we critically discuss the state of the art of whole brain excitability mapping and provide an outlook on neuroscience and clinical implications.",

          "authors": "Yang Xiang; Kevin Matthew Dorst; Samuel J. Gershman",
          "abstract": "The gambler’s fallacy is typically defined as the false belief that a random event is less likely to occur if it has occurred recently, even when the probability of the event is known to be independent across trials. While forms of this fallacy have been documented numerous times, past work suffers from two problems. First, most studies have not actually measured probabilistic predictions (“60% likely to be heads”), but rather point predictions (“Heads”). Second, the few studies that did measure probabilistic beliefs used sequences that were not independent, and therefore not a strong test of the fallacy. To address these problems, we conducted a series of high-powered, preregistered studies. We asked participants to report probabilistic predictions for truly independent sequences. In contrast to point predictions, which (as in previous research) generated a significant gambler’s fallacy, we found no evidence for a gambler’s fallacy in probabilistic predictions. Moreover, the point predictions could not be reconstructed by sampling from the probability judgments. This suggests that the gambler’s fallacy originates at the decision stage rather than in probabilistic reasoning, as posited by several leading theories. In a separate experiment, we replicate the results of a previous study showing a small gambler’s fallacy for probabilistic predictions with non-independent sequences. However, to the extent that the gambler’s fallacy manifests for probabilistic predictions, it seems to be driven by a small proportion of the participants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the gambler’s fallacy is real and robust for point predictions, but not for probabilistic predictions with independent sequences. New theories of the gambler’s fallacy may be needed to explain these findings.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive impairments have been observed in patients with depression. These include deficits in inhibition, shifting, and updating; cognitive processes that are critical for goal-directed control over behavior (‘model-based planning’). But despite this, research investigating model-based planning in depression has itself been mixed. We aimed to address this by taking a within-person approach, examining model-based planning before and after a range of effective treatments for depression.\nMethod: Across two parallel studies, participants completed a two-step reinforcement learning paradigm before and after antidepressant medication, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) or intravenous (IV) ketamine infusion. In experiment 1, 93 patients with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to a single dose of IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or IV saline (50 mL 0.9% NaCl). In Experiment 2, 781 participants were followed for four weeks of antidepressant (N=83), or iCBT (N=611) treatment. N=87 participants without any psychiatric diagnosis were followed as a control group.\nResults: In both experiments, depressive symptoms significantly improved in treatment groups compared to their corresponding control groups, but model-based planning did not change. Moreover, individual differences in model-based planning did not predict differential response to ketamine, iCBT or antidepressant treatments. Individual differences in model- based planning at baseline were associated with compulsivity, but not depression symptoms.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that model-based planning is not necessarily compromised in depression and does not improve following treatments. This result provides evidence for the trait-like nature of model-based planning and underscores the specificity of its relation to disorders of compulsivity.",

Neither of the theoretically derived models were a good fit for any of the nine datasets, and we were unable to identify any better fitting multidimensional models. Internal consistency metrics were acceptable in six of the nine datasets, but these metrics are difficult to interpret given the uncertain factor structures.

          "abstract": "Introduction. Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (LTI) is often accompanied by feelings of fear, uncertainty, and loneliness that can severely impact mental health. Relatively few interventions are available to address the existential concerns of individuals facing LTI, while treatment of the underlying physical ailment typically remains the priority of the healthcare system. Research has shown that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAT) holds promise for supporting mental health in people with LTIs. However, PAT’s potential in this population remains curtailed by several limitations, including regulatory and accessibility issues. Novel approaches that could provide some of the benefits of psychedelic experiences, while avoiding associated challenges, would therefore be highly desirable for supporting the mental well-being of people with LTIs. Among such interventions, VR-based experiences have been suggested as a promising candidate. We here evaluate a program that includes weakly representational, multi-user VR experiences based on a design aesthetic previously described as “numadelic”, which has been demonstrated to elicit self-transcendent experiences comparable to psychedelics.\nMethods. A prospective cohort study design was used to assess the effects of “Clear Light” (CL) a group-based, 6-session multimedia program that included VR experiences, video calls, and text chats spanning 3 weeks. Participants were individuals suffering from LTIs that self-selected to participate in the CL program. A total of N=15 participants were evaluated based on assessments one week before and after the program, using self-report measures of anxiety, depression, well-being, and secondary psychological outcomes. \nResults. The intervention was well-tolerated among participants. Significant improvements with moderate effect sizes were observed on self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, and well-being. Secondary measures assessing demoralization, connectedness, and spiritual well-being also showed significant improvements. \nDiscussion. This observational study demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits of a group-based VR program that can be delivered at-home to people suffering from LTIs. While conclusions are presently limited by the lack of randomization or a comparison group, our findings strongly suggest further research is warranted, including randomized controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "Reward processes can reinforce extinction learning and aide cognitive processes involved with inhibitory learning. Anhedonia, characterized by deficits in reward incentivization, hedonic response, and learning, may therefore predict worse treatment outcomes. However, there are few existing studies of reward processes or anhedonia in predicting exposure-based treatment outcomes, and results are mixed. The current study examined associations between pretreatment self-reported anhedonia and several measures of anxiety symptom severity and treatment outcomes among patients who sought exposure-based treatment. Consistent with hypotheses, pretreatment anhedonia severity was associated with higher pretreatment anxiety symptom severity across a wide range of measures. However, inconsistent with hypotheses, higher anhedonia scores were associated with greater symptom improvement across treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Additionally, anhedonia was not significantly associated with disorder-general measures of treatment outcomes, or disorder-specific treatment outcomes for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or post-traumatic anxiety disorder. Thus, pretreatment anhedonia is not an obstacle for beginning exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. More broadly, results highlight challenges in translating laboratory research to naturalistic clinical settings and the need for intensive longitudinal studies that can assess the role of reward processes in exposure therapy systematically across treatment.",

          "authors": "Jovan T Kemp; Dhanraj Vishwanath; Fulvio Domini",
          "abstract": "A major focus of research in sensory perception is the nature and source of errors in perceptual judgements. A dominant assumption in the field, originating in work on 3D perception, is that the variability in perceptual judgements measured by discrimination thresholds is due to sensory uncertainty (random error in the internal sensory estimate), and that cue integration acts to minimise this sensory uncertainty. In three experiments, we use a simple modification to the standard forced-choice paradigm in a sensory discrimination task to show that, contrary to the widespread assumption, variability in 3D perceptual discrimination tasks is determined by sensory bias (systematic error in the sensory estimate) and late-stage task-related uncertainty (random error in processes following the sensory estimate), rather than early-stage sensory uncertainty. Experiment 1 examined depth discrimination for 3D stimuli specified by low- and high-quality texture cues, where the fixed standard and variable comparison stimuli could be specified by either the same or different texture cues. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure for both disparity alone and a combination of texture and disparity. Experiment 3 tested this same discrimination task for motion or disparity while also measuring the perceptual function for each cue. In all experiments, we found that discrimination thresholds were best explained by the combination of sensory bias and task-related uncertainty, and—critically—not by sensory uncertainty. Our results bring into question the role of sensory uncertainty in perceptual error, and, in turn, what characterizes optimal cue integration.",

Some studies have shown how eye movement alterations can be associated with MS, but there are significant differences in methodology between the available studies. \nInclusion criteria: Studies that fulfil the following criteria regarding the participants, concept, and context framework will be included:  recruitment of MS patient over 18 years of age, any eye-tracking paradigm, any context. No restrictions on study design, publication type, or data will be applied at the very beginning of the literature search.\nMethods: This scoping review will be performed in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases will be searched up to October 2024. Additional papers will be detected by searching the grey literature and reference lists of all pertinent studies included in the review. The decision to include or exclude studies will be made by two reviewers working independently. The reviewers will undertake a thorough examination of all titles, abstracts, and full-text studies. The research team will endeavour to extract the characteristics of the included studies through a data collection form that has been created for this purpose.

          "abstract": "How sophisticated is young children’s comprehension of geometric lines and curves, and how can we probe it? Here, we assess an early, proto-mathematical understanding of curves by asking preschoolers (N=39) and first graders (N=42) to draw the prolongation of various mathematical patterns, ranging from linear to non-linear functions such as quadratics and exponentials, periodic functions, and more complex composite patterns. Our findings reveal that even at this early age, children’s drawings indicate an accurate differentiation of several functions, including linear and non-linear ones, and an understanding of linearity and curvature. Furthermore, both age groups displayed intuitions of compositionality by distinguishing, for example, sinusoid functions with an increasing amplitude from those with a decreasing or a constant one. All children had difficulties with more complex patterns, such as those involving changes in both amplitude and frequency, as in stair-like patterns. Our results highlight children’s early understanding of proto-mathematical concepts and the potential of drawing as a powerful tool to assess them in a concrete context.",

However, its potential impacts on policymaking have been limited by practical challenges derived from its time-consuming nature, which hindered efficient data collection at scale. The purpose of this study is to improve the efficiency of the tool by utilizing a multidimensional framework proposed by Seiden (2024). We analyzed a unique dataset collected in Nepal and selected a set of items that optimizes the balance between reliability (statistical), content relevance and representativeness (conceptual), and administrative efficiency (practical) dimensions of the tool. We compared the efficient form suggested by the multidimensional framework with a conventional approach that relied solely on the statistical dimension and discussed the implications of the results. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple dimensions when selecting items for an assessment tool, as the conventional approach may not necessarily select the most appropriate items. This study's results can inform the development of efficient ECD measurement and improve policymaking decisions based on high-quality evidence generated from precise and efficient measurements.",

Research demonstrates that stressors, such as exposure to early-life adversity (ELA), is associated with both agency beliefs and learning, but how these processes interact remains unclear.

Replicating prior behavioral and computational work, ELA resulted in decreased learning, while increased adversity severity was associated with decreased latent agency beliefs. These findings suggest that exposure to adversity in childhood has a nuanced impact on reinforcement learning and agency beliefs in adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychopathology. Besides CM types and severity, the timing of exposure is an important modulating factor in this association, as childhood and adolescence comprise sensitive developmental periods for brain maturation and socio-emotional development. Nevertheless, previously reported associations between the severity of subtypes and timing of CM and psychopathology have been heterogeneous and have hardly considered vulnerable groups broadly exposed to CM, such as out-of-home-placed youth. Thus, we investigated the association between CM types and timing and psychopathology in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults (N = 185; 32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49 years). CM was assessed using the Maltreatment of Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale and general, internalizing and, externalizing problems were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. We employed conditional random forest regression to estimate the importance of CM types (abuse, neglect, peer victimization, and sexual abuse), timings (ages 3–18) as well as CM severity, multiplicity, and duration on adult general, internalizing, and externalizing problems. We validated the results using diagnoses of mental disorders assessed in clinical interviews, which were classified under general, internalizing, and externalizing clusters based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model. We found that CM severity and multiplicity were stronger predictors of internalizing problems than timing-specific effects of CM types. Abuse in early childhood and peer violence in late adolescence were stronger predictors of externalizing problems compared to global CM measures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering CM type and timing when testing CM-associated risks for psychopathology. This might further be valuable in therapeutic settings to guide maltreatment-informed interventions. Reducing violent caregiving environments in early childhood and preventing peer victimization in adolescence may be especially important in counteracting CM-associated risks of externalizing behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Background: Large reductions to meal portion size result in reduced daily energy intake due to reductions not being fully compensated for through later energy intake. However, to date no studies have investigated how more realistic portion size reductions affect energy intake. The present study investigated whether reducing the portion size of a meal by 15% affects subsequent energy intake and if this effect differs depending on whether or not consumers are aware of the portion size reduction. \n\nMethods: Participants (N = 110, female = 58) attended two test days where they were given ad libitum access to a lunch meal (main course and desserts) and a dinner meal (main course and desserts). During the first day, participants’ intake of the lunch main course was recorded and during the second day, participants were served a lunch main course either the portion size of the amount they consumed on the first day (control condition), or 15% less. Participants served 15% less were either told that the portion size was the amount they previously consumed (reduced unaware) or it had been reduced (reduced aware).\n\nResults: Compared with the first test day, participants in the second test day in both of the reduced portion size conditions consumed less energy from the lunch main course than the control condition. There were no significant effects of condition on energy intake immediately after the lunch main course or energy intake later in the day, indicating a lack of evidence for compensatory eating in response to reduced portion size.  However, exploratory analyses were suggestive of participants in the reduced aware condition showing some degree of compensatory eating.\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest that reducing meal portion size by 15% decreases meal energy intake and may not cause significant later compensatory eating. However, further research is required to understand the size of portion reductions to promote reduced daily energy intake and if this is affected by awareness of portion size reductions.",

Previous research fails to pinpoint effect of Alzheimer’s progression collectively on the three variables and has inconsistencies in results relative to changes in anatomical volumes and cortical thinning as well as scanner effect dilemma.\nMethods Longitudinal data were analysed from participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), including individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD; N = 941), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N = 1545), and cognitively normal (CN; N = 925) participants. MRI imaging and cognitive assessment data were utilized. Images were segmented using the LOD Brain model, and a multiple regression model was employed to investigate the impact of Alzheimer’s progression and aging on various brain structure volumes and cortical thickness.\nResults The results indicate progression of the illness resulted in a significant decrease in brain structure volumes across grey and white matter, brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebellum with the exception of an increase in ventricles as well as an increase in cortical thinning in entorhinal cortex temporal, parietal cortices alongside cerebrum. Cognitive decline is correlated with a loss in total brain volume and more specifically grey matter, cerebellum and basal ganglia amplified by Alzheimer’s progression.\nConclusions Our results highlight how important it is to conduct research integrating cortical thickness, brain volume and cognitive decline in order to enhance our understanding of the disease’s progression.",

          "abstract": "The latest DSM-5-TR revision included independent diagnostic codes for Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB), emphasizing the need to differentiate subtypes. However, research on individuals who have experienced both Suicidal and Non-Suicidal SIB remains limited. This lack of understanding may hinder the recognition of a distinct subgroup within the SIB population, making it difficult to identify their unique characteristics. This study utilized the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to investigate risk decision-making patterns across four groups: Major Depressive Disorder patients with history of Suicidal SIB (MDD-SA), Non-Suicidal (MDD-NSSI), both types of SIB (MDD-Both), and a Healthy Control group (HC). Our findings revealed distinct risk-decision-making patterns in the learning curve of Cash RT. This potentially indicated features of indecisive decision-making. These pieces of evidence may significantly benefit both research and clinical communities. First, time-dimensional indices, particularly Cash RT in BART, appear to be promising discriminative markers. Additionally, at the clinical level, the distinct risk decision-making patterns observed align with the new DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework. Importantly, our findings suggest that individuals with history of combined type of SIB may be considered as an independent subgroup deserving focused attention. Future studies may elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these risk decision-making pattern differences. \n\nKeywords: Suicide, Suicide Attempt, Non-Suicidal Self-Injury, Major Depressive Disorder, Risk Decision-making, Balloon Analogue Risk Task",

In this paper we reflect on the strengths and limitations of the traditional developmental perspective. We suggest that behavioral, cognitive, and emotional development are better understood as a process of bricolage (construction within constraints). This perspective is illustrated in an analysis of change mechanisms, and behavioral and representational changes, in attachment development from pre-locomotor infancy to later adulthood. Special emphasis is placed on ordinary learning and cognitive processes, rather than those specific to attachment, and on the\nroles that socialization pressures and changing circumstances play in shaping the course of attachment development.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, research investigating the neural mechanisms of mindfulness has burgeoned. However, there remains an important need for detailed experimental data regarding how mindfulness training alters the brain and how such changes translate to influence psychological function and subjective experience. The Intensive Longitudinal Mindfulness (ILM) study addresses this gap in the literature, by providing a fully within subject, time-intensive EEG sampling of mindfulness practice.  The focus of this paper is to provide the protocol for the ILM study as a resource for interested researchers. Across eight weeks of mindfulness training, participants completed up to 24 EEG recorded sessions (3x per week) of focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM), two theoretically distinct forms of mindfulness practice, using standardized audio-guided meditation practices. Following each 20-minute practice of FA and OM (totaling 40 minutes per training session), subjective meditation quality was assessed using a self-report questionnaire battery. Before and after the eight weeks of training, participants also completed a multi-session task battery to assess training related changes to cognitive and affective functioning.  The ILM study aims to demonstrate the value of a well-controlled, within-subject time intensive longitudinal design, with the capability to track neural and self-report trajectories associated with different forms of mindfulness training and to link these important dimensions of analysis across time.",

          "abstract": "Stimulus manipulations in perceptual decision-making tasks can be categorized into two broad categories: manipulating the quality of the sensory input (stimulus reliability) and manipulating the distance between the sensory feature of interest and the decision boundary (boundary distance). However, despite the fundamental difference between these two manipulations, it remains controversial whether they lead to dissociable behavioral effects. Here, we demonstrate the existence of robust dissociation between the effect of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on confidence and accuracy. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch relative to a decision boundary set at 45. We manipulated the stimulus reliability and boundary distance by varying the contrast and the offset from 45, respectively. We found that, as compared to stimulus reliability, the boundary distance manipulation had larger effect on accuracy but smaller effect on confidence. Further, confidence decreased with difficulty for error trials in the boundary distance manipulation (a pattern known as “folded-X pattern”) but not in the stimulus reliability manipulation (i.e., a violation of the folded-X pattern). Both of these effects were replicated in a second experiment with dot motion. These results demonstrate that manipulations of stimulus reliability and boundary distance have dissociable effects on accuracy and confidence, suggesting that the mapping between confidence and accuracy depends on the specifics of how difficulty is manipulated.",

The aims of the current studies were to provide a German translation of the EPSI and replicate the original EPSI’s psychometric properties and correlates. In two cross-sectional surveys using convenience samples (n = 361 and n = 178), the EPSI’s eight-factor structure, high internal consistencies, and differential associations with other instruments assessing eating disorder-specific and general psychopathology as well as sex differences on the EPSI’s scales were largely replicated. The German EPSI had sound psychometric properties that allow for a reliable and valid, multidimensional assessment of eating-disorder psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) often gain weight during treatment, which potentially poses a threat to treatment adherence. Although weight suppression has been found to be a predictor of weight gain in persons with BN, research about the nature of weight changes during treatment and other predictors thereof is scarce.\nMethod: The current study examined weight suppression as well as self-reported bingeing severity and purging frequency at admission as predictors of weight change during inpatient treatment in 746 persons with BN (95% female).\nResults: Body mass index (BMI) increased linearly across treatment weeks. Higher weight suppression predicted larger weight gain, particularly in those with a relatively low BMI at admission. More frequent purging and less severe bingeing predicted larger weight gain but high bingeing severity in combination with infrequent purging attenuated this effect.\nConclusions: Results replicate that those with high weight suppression are at higher risk for gaining weight during BN treatment but extend these findings in that this effect additionally depends on current BMI, similar to findings reported in persons with anorexia nervosa. They further demonstrate that the core features of BN—bingeing and purging—also predict weight change both separately and interactively and may, therefore, be considered in psychoeducation and therapy planning.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of religious beliefs and practices is puzzling from evolutionary viewpoint, but previous research suggested that religious traditions provide health and cooperative benefits. Seemingly in contrast with this claim are worldwide secularization trends where people disaffiliate from religions and belief in god(s). Previous theories suggested that diminished exogenous pressures no longer motivate individuals to seek religious benefits and pay the participation costs. We investigate this causal claim using National Study of Youth and Religion dataset, which tracks the development of religiosity among US Christians from adolescence to young adulthood (n = 3 370). Using a general lagged panel methodology, we found that material security in Wave 1 (early adolescence) predicts higher probability of decrease in belief in God in Wave 4 (young adulthood). This result provides support for the hypothesis that participation in religious traditions is associated with living in insecure socio-ecology, where the systems may still confer benefits onto their members. We also examined specific exogenous pressures related to health and trust, but these additional analyses revealed mixed results.  We conclude with a call for further research using more nuanced measures and larger sample sizes that may provide further insights into the adaptive nature of cultural systems.",

Disentangling these dynamics is necessary for effective tracking of subtle cognitive change and risk factors for ADRD. \n\nMETHODS: We applied a computational cognitive model of learning and forgetting to data from Einstein Aging Study (n = 316). EAS participants completed multiple bursts of ultra-brief, high-frequency cognitive assessments on smartphones. Analyzing response time data, we extracted several key cognitive markers: short-term intraindividual variability in performance, within-burst retest learning and asymptotic (peak) performance, across-burst change in asymptote and forgetting of retest gains.  \n\nRESULTS: Asymptotic performance was related to both MCI and age, and there was evidence of asymptotic slowing over time. Long-term forgetting, learning rate, and within-person variability uniquely signified MCI, irrespective of age. \n\nDISCUSSION: Computational cognitive markers hold promise as sensitive and specific indicators of preclinical cognitive change, aiding risk identification and targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Children are highly sensitive to adversity during their first five years of life, with exposure to chronic parental mental illness (MI) consistently linked to socio-emotional impairments and mental health problems in children. Children born during the COVID-19 pandemic were exposed to unprecedented levels of parental distress, with parental MI reported at three times the pre-pandemic rates. This situation underscored a pressing need for scalable solutions to foster positive mental health and developmental outcomes for a generation of children. In response, we developed the Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM) program, an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution for parents of young children. Clinical trials to date evaluating BEAM have shown promising results, demonstrating reductions in parent depression, suicidality, anxiety, and harsh parenting practices. This trial involves an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with co-primary aims of (1) determining BEAM’s effectiveness in improving parent mental health, and (2) evaluating the implementation of BEAM in the community through metrics such as feasibility, acceptability, and uptake. This trial’s secondary aim is to measure BEAM’s effectiveness in improving short-term child mental health and developmental outcomes using primary data and long-term psychosocial family outcomes using administrative data. A final exploratory aim of this trial will measure the cost-utility of delivering BEAM relative to extant health programming.\nMethods: A single arm trial with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the BEAM intervention in the community with a sample of 400 parent participants with a child aged 24-71 months. Participants must self-report moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, parenting stress, and/or anger at time of enrolment (T0) and live in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Individuals will be recruited through four streams including the (1) Manitoba Crisis Response Services, (2) primary care offices (paediatricians and/or general practitioners), (3) Manitoba family community organizations and child care centres, and (4) social media. Study participants will complete 12 weeks of psychoeducation modules, with access to an online social support forum and check ins with a peer coach. Assessments of parent and child mental health symptoms will occur at pre-test before BEAM begins (T1), immediately after the last week of the BEAM intervention (post-test, T2), 6-month follow-up (T3), and 12-month follow-up (T4). \nDiscussion: The BEAM program offers a promising solution to address elevated parental mental health symptoms, parenting stress, and related child functioning concerns. The present implementation trial aims to extend the groundwork established by an open pilot trial and RCT of the BEAM program, in a next step of testing BEAM’s readiness for nationwide scaling. \nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06455397.

          "authors": "Hao Liang",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics and factors affecting immigrant residential segregation in Japan between 2000 and 2020, a period marked by Japan's emergence as a global immigrant destination. Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study identifies the prevalence of sandwich care, and describes demographic, socioeconomic, health, and care characteristics of sandwich carers compared with other care groups in the UK.\nBackground: Delayed childbearing and increasing care needs mean that parenting young children may increasingly coincide with the need to provide adult care, leading to so-called ‘sandwich care’, but little is known about sandwich carers in the UK.\nMethod: Using eleven waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009-2020), a large, nationally representative household panel survey in the United Kingdom, five care groups were derived based on information regarding provision of adult care and living with children aged under age 16 (N=81,057). The prevalence of these groups were shown across waves, then waves were pooled and multinomial regression models were used to show age-adjusted differences in demographic, socioeconomic, health and care characteristics across the five care groups. \nResults: 2% of the UK adult population provide sandwich care . Parents caring for someone in the generation above were generally employed in professional/managerial occupations and cared less intensively outside the household while parents caring for a disabled child or partner were disadvantaged in terms of education and income, and tended to care intensively inside the household. \nConclusion: It is important to recognise circumstances of care groups are heterogenous when designing policies and practice to support family carers.",

          "abstract": "This article develops an analytical and methodological field guide for analyzing the practices and politics of machine learning. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), it seeks to move beyond the opacity/transparency dichotomy that often characterizes discussions of algorithmic systems. In doing this, the article hones in on actors’ mundane practices of constructing machine learners, and develops an analytical stance based on four empirical moments: feature extraction, vectorization, clustering, and data drift. By making visible actors’ work, tinkering, and negotiations involved in these processes, the article aims to demystify the supposed magic of machine learning. This approach allows us to ask: How do actors decide what constitutes a good machine learner? How are things, people, and phenomena translated into the mathematical worlds of machine learning? Through ethnographic attention to these questions, we can begin to grapple with the practices and politics of machine learning in earnest. Thus, the article contributes to ongoing discussions about the societal implications of AI by providing analytical and methodological tools for understanding how the politics of machine learning is assembled in practice.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between income and voter turnout is crucial to understanding U.S. democracy. Previous research finds that richer people tend to vote at higher rates than lower-income people. But this research relies on survey data and is subject to response and social desirability bias, producing widely varying estimates of the size of the income-based turnout gap. Using data with official, geocoded, precinct election results for the entire nation, we examine how precinct-level income is associated with changes in voter turnout between the 2016 and 2020 elections. We find a dramatic income gradient in precinct voter turnout, and that this inequality became larger in 2020 compared to 2016. When comparing top decile precincts to bottom decile precincts (&gt;$121k vs &lt;$38k), we estimate a turnout gap of 17 percentage points in 2016 and 27 percentage points in 2020. These results are robust in regression analysis controlling for critical features and spatial dependence.",

          "authors": "Amanda Hughes; Elisabeth Grey; Alice Haigherty; Fayth Shepherd; Fiona Gillison; Rebecca Langford",
          "abstract": "Introduction\nWeight is the most common reason for being bullied at school - far more common than other targets for bullying such as ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Research suggests weight bias and stigma - including negative beliefs, attitudes, and discriminatory behaviours related to a person’s weight - is prevalent in educational settings among both pupils and staff.\nMost schools have anti-bullying policies with best practice suggesting policies should explicitly identify forms of unacceptable behaviour, such as racism or homophobia.  \nWe conducted an audit of secondary schools in southwest England to determine if/how they mention weight-related bullying in their policies. \nMethods\nWe obtained lists of all secondary mainstream state, private, and specialist schools in seven local authorities and downloaded anti-bullying policies from their websites. Policies were searched for key words related to weight and size. We also recorded whether policies mentioned appearance or other key targets for bullying, such as race, religion, sexuality etc. We obtained school level data including size, gender mix, academic performance and quality ratings. \nResults\nFrom 255 schools with an available bullying or behaviour policy, only 6.7% specifically mentioned weight-related bullying. Just under half (48.6%) mentioned bullying in relation to appearance. Bullying was most often mentioned in relation to race/ethnicity (94.5%), sexual orientation (93.3%), gender (85.9%), religion (84.9%), or gender identity (67.5%). Private schools (N=40) were more likely to mention weight-based bullying (17.5%) than mainstream state schools (N=148, 6.1%).  No specialist schools, whether state (N=41) or private (N=26), mentioned bullying in their policies. There was no strong evidence that other school characteristics made a difference, but small numbers limited the power of these comparisons. \nConclusion\nThere is a significant mismatch between the prevalence of weight-related bullying in schools and its representation within school anti-bullying policies. Some types of school are more likely than others to mention weight-based bullying in their policies. We recommend that schools explicitly recognise weight-related bullying in their anti-bullying policies and explore how to support staff and pupil to take action.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we quantify an inflow of women into science in the past three decades. Structured Big Data allow us to estimate the contribution of women scientists to the growth of science by disciplines (N = STEMM 14 disciplines) and over time (1990-2023). A monolithic segment of STEMM science emerges from this research as divided between the disciplines in which the growth was powerfully driven by women – and the disciplines in which the role of women was marginal. There are four disciplines in which 50% of currently publishing scientists are women; and five disciplines in which more than 50% of currently young scientists are women. But there is also a cluster of four highly mathematized disciplines (MATH, COMP, PHYS, and ENG) in which the growth of science is only marginally driven by women. Digital traces left by scientists in their publications indexed in global datasets open two new dimensions in large-scale academic profession studies: time and gender. The growth of science in Europe was accompanied by growth in the number of women scientists, but with powerful cross-disciplinary and cross-generational differentiations. We examined the share of women scientists coming from ten different age cohorts for 32 European and four comparator countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan). Our study sample was N = 1,740,985 scientists (including 39.40% women scientists). Three critical methodological challenges of using structured Big Data of the bibliometric type were discussed: gender determination, academic age determination, and discipline determination.",

The institutes with the largest number of support staff by area of ​​knowledge are: the INTEMA (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencia y Tecnología de Materiales) in the KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences) with 47 RSS, followed by the MACNBR (Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales) in the KB area with 42 RSS, the CADIC (Centro Austral de Investigaciones Científicas) in the KE area with 38 RSS, and in the KS area there are two institutes that compete to be in first place with 14 RSS, which are: the CEIL (Centro de Estudios e Investigaciones Laborales) and the CAICYT (Centro Argentino de Información Científica y Tecnológica).\tRegarding gender segregation by area of ​​knowledge, the feminized areas are: KB (Biological and Health Sciences), KS (Social Sciences and Humanities) and the masculinized areas: KA (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences); KE (Exact and Natural Sciences) and Not Applicable. The KT (Technology) area does not count any RSS personnel. It's curious that for the case of KA area (Agrarian, Engineering and Materials Sciences), the trend found for CONICET researchers is not reproduced by RSS because for them it is feminized, making it necessary to investigate the reasons for this deeply. The two areas with the largest number of support personnel assigned are KE: Exact and Natural Sciences; being masculinized, and KB: Biological and health sciences, being feminized. This analysis is a contribution to comprehension of the characteristics of CONICET's teem infrastructure roles, in order to advance the understanding of their work problems and barriers to professional growth.",

          "abstract": "When do autocrats replace their ministers? Research suggests that failed coup attempts lead autocrats to remove disloyal ruling elites. While this is an important and intuitive finding, failed coup attempts are very rare events and hence leave large amounts of variation in minister removal unexplained. It also portrays autocrats as reactionary, whereas previous work suggests that they are anticipatory and survival-seeking. We argue that autocratic leaders are strategic actors who take preemptive action against potentially disloyal elites, rather than risking a coup attempt being realized. Using structural coup risk as a lower estimate of a leader's own perception of coup risk, we find that it significantly contributes to the prediction of minister removals. Contrasting its effect to that of failed coup attempts, we find that it substantially improves predictive performance across a number of metrics. Our findings contribute to nascent research on government stability and autocratic leader survival.",

Significant changes in the composition of migrants and border crossings since then raise questions about their continued validity. In this research note, I provide an updated analysis using two independent data sources: the 2018 Guatemalan Census and annual estimates of undocumented Guatemalan arrivals to the United States from The Center for Migration Studies (CMS). Using descriptive and regression analyses, findings show a close alignment between apprehensions, household migrations reported in the Guatemalan census, and Guatemalan arrival estimates. Together, these results indicate that apprehensions remain a reliable indicator of migration flow despite recent changes in migration dynamics along the southern U.S. border.",

          "abstract": "Spatial mobility plays a crucial role in shaping social stratification processes. While previous research focused on adult workers’ monetary returns from commuting or relocating, early career gains in occupational status may be more significant from a life course perspective. We examine whether spatial mobility yields status returns for labor market entrants and, if so, how such returns might be stratified by young people’s local opportunity structures and their level of schooling. We use longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study merged with fine-grained regional information and focus on transitions from school to Vocational Education and Training (VET). As a novel approach to address the methodological challenge of self-selection into spatial mobility, we propose incorporating young people’s occupational aspirations into the regression analysis. We show that mobile young people are more likely to get higher-status VET positions. Yet, being spatially mobile only pays off if young people commute or move away from structurally weak regions and for those with higher levels of schooling who are already privileged in status attainment. We conclude that young people can potentially overcome regional disadvantages through spatial mobility, while spatial mobility also tends to widen the gap in status attainment between educational groups.",

On one hand, pXRF is essentially energy-dispersive XRF (EDXRF) condensed to fit into a handheld instrument. On the other hand, it is still often defined by a few strident critiques more than a decade ago, the focus of which were pXRF users, not the instruments. There were three themes in those critiques: perceived weaknesses in (1) research design, (2) element quantification, and (3) publishing, especially as it relates to data evaluation. Recently, Johnson et al. (2024) sought to address the third critique, by both surveying the literature and proposing a checklist of 18 variables that, they argue, should be published to “result in better science” from pXRF users. While this is an important topic, the study and list are flawed and, thus, will not achieve their goal. We do, though, share the aim of aiding archaeologists in becoming effective pXRF users. Here I adopt a different tack. Drawing on 24 years of X-ray spectrometry experience, my intent is to share knowledge that can help the expanding community of pXRF practitioners. Ranging in topic from safety to research design and common pitfalls, I aim to share my experience in a way that can, I hope, be useful to those beyond my own students. Much of what I teach about pXRF – both inside and outside the classroom – is here for anyone to read and implement themselves.",

          "title": "The Feasibility of National Inference Under the NSCAW IV L-State Sample Design",
          "authors": "Paul P. Biemer; Dan Liao; Darryl Creel; Stephen J Tueller",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this Feasibility Analysis Study (FAS) was to evaluate methods for producing valid national estimates under the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) IV sample design. The NSCAW IV design is a stratified two-stage, unequal probability design that restricts the sample to within L purposively selected states, where L is a number between 8 and 12. (L = 10 was assumed for most the analyses in this document). The design is fully consistent with the NSCAW IV’s primary objective (i.e., to provide detailed, precise state-level estimates for the L key states selected for the survey). However, an important secondary objective is to provide for valid national estimates, even though the sample design itself is not nationally representative. The FAS was conducted to determine whether the NSCAW IV L-state design could achieve this secondary objective. FAS confirmed that national estimates are indeed feasible. This report provides a summary of the FAS results and offers detailed, statistical evidence as to the NSCAW IV L-state design’s ability to produce valid national inferences. \n     State estimates can be produced from the NSCAW IV design by applying classical survey estimation techniques; however, national estimation requires nonprobability or so-called quasi-random estimation and modeling techniques. The FAS investigated two such estimation approaches: quasi-randomization weighting (QRW) and superpopulation modeling (SPM). Data from prior NSCAW cohorts—NSCAW I and II—were analyzed to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Fortunately, the NSCAW I and II designs are quite similar to what is proposed for NSCAW IV in that they both include a purposive selection of states—L = 8, in total. The key difference between their designs and NSCAW IV’s design is that the two prior surveys also included a random sample the “remainder” stratum (i.e., the combination of states that were not purposively selected). This remainder stratum provided for the unbiased national estimation in NSCAW I and II without the needed for nonprobability estimation approaches. However, the remainder stratum was initially ignored in application of the QRW and SPM to NSCAW I and II states to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Later in the analysis, the remainder stratum provided a mechanism to assessing the biases in the QRW and SPM national estimates. This was critical in order for the FAS analysis speculate on the potential bias risks for NSCAW IV national estimates using the sample estimation approaches.\n     As the results in the report convincingly show, both the QRW and SPM approaches are capable of producing valid national estimates from the L-state design envisioned for NSCAW IV. QRW is recommended for the estimating the means of the vast majority of questionnaire characteristics; however, in situations where QRW may fail to produce accurate results, the SPM approach can then be implemented to produce more accurate results. One drawback of SPM is that it requires more effort and a higher level of statistical expertise to implement. \nThe research reported in this document initially addresses the question of whether the QRW method can be feasibly applied to the NSCAW IV data to obtain valid national inferences based on a small number (8 ≤ L ≤ 12) of purposively selected sample of states. Variations of QRW were applied to the NSCAW I eight-state sample and then, using the combination of the state and remainder stratum samples, the quality of the QRW national estimates was evaluated by comparing them to the full sample, unbiased national estimates. A number of key quality indicators were analyzed for national estimates related to 26 NSCAW characteristics—23 variables that overlap with the NCANDS data and three Child Behavior Check List (CBCL)  characteristics from the survey questionnaire. Four types of estimates based solely on the eight-state data were computed: (1) unweighted estimates, (2) estimates based on the unadjusted NSCAW weights, (3) estimates derived from Method 1 weighting, and (4) estimates derived from Method 2 weighting. Estimates (1) and (2) were computed primarily to gain insight around the degree to which approaches (3) and (4) affect the bias of the unweighted and unadjusted eight-state estimates. Finally, the NSCAW I full sample estimates were computed, which provided the “gold-standard” estimates used to evaluate the quality of estimates (1) through (4) for national inference. Because the NSCAW IV design will use three domains—the eight NSCAW I domains were collapsed to create the three NSCAW IV domains and the quality analysis was repeated for these “ad hoc” domains.\n     The NSCAW I QRW analyses demonstrated the success of these methods for extend inference from the NSCAW IV purposively selected state sample to the national level. Although some bias could remain in the estimates after weighting, the biases were significantly reduced from their unweighted counterparts for the vast majority of estimates. For substantive characteristics such as the CBCL variables, the biases in the QRW estimates were slightly larger but still acceptable for many research purposes. The results for the NSCAW I analysis were essentially confirmed using NSCAW II data: both data sets produced very similar results.\nSPM offers an alternative to QRW for creating national estimates from the L-state design. Because it incorporates specific covariates that are the most highly correlated with the outcome variable, it can achieve much greater estimation accuracy than is possible with the more general QRW methodology. A key distinction between SPM and the QRW is that, although the latter can be applied to any outcome variable, SPM must be tailored to each specific outcome variable of interest; i.e., each questionnaire variable represents a dependent variable in its own customized model. Nevertheless, for questionnaire variables where the QRW estimates have, or are suspected to have, unacceptably large biases, SPM offers a less biased alternative and can be used to produce higher quality inferences. \n     The SPM analyses used the eight-state strata to project national estimates and then evaluated those estimates by comparing them to the corresponding national sample estimates that served as the gold standard. The results showed that, at least for the variables considered from NSCAW I and II, SPM produces excellent results, with very small biases in most instances. Based on these results, we believe the SPM approach is quite feasible for the NSCAW IV L-state design. Thus, its use is recommended for NSCAW IV, particularly in situations where QRW estimates are shown or suspected to be unacceptably biased.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to compare the geographical and disciplinary coverage of OA journals in three databases: OpenAlex, Scopus and the WoS. We used the ROAD database, managed by the ISSN International Centre, as a reference database which indexes 62,701 OA active resources (as of May 2024). Among the 62,701 active resources indexed in the ROAD database, the Web of Science indexes 6,157 journals, while Scopus indexes 7,351, and OpenAlex indexes 34,217. A striking observation is the presence of 25,658 OA journals exclusively in OpenAlex, whereas only 182 journals are exclusively present in WoS and 373 in Scopus.\nThe geographical analysis focusses on two levels: continents and countries. As for disciplinary comparison, we use the ten disciplinary levels of the ROAD database.  Moreover, our findings reveal a striking similarity in OA journal coverage between WoS and Scopus. However, while OpenAlex offers better inclusivity and indexing, it is not without biases. WoS and Scopus predictably favor journals from Europe, North America and Oceania. Although OpenAlex presents a much more balanced indexing, certain regions and countries remain relatively underrepresented. Typically, Africa is proportionally as under-represented in OpenAlex as it is in WoS, and some emerging countries are proportionally less represented in OpenAlex than in WoS and Scopus.\nThese results underscore a marked similarity in OA journal indexing between WoS and Scopus, while OpenAlex aligns more closely with the distribution observed in the ROAD database, although it also exhibits some representational biases.",

          "authors": "Dongjin Kim",
          "abstract": "The population of Seoul had exploded from 1 million to 2.45 million in 7 years right after the end of the Korean War (from 1953 to 1960). Many parts of Seoul were converted into slum areas and aimless urbanisation lowered the quality of life in the Seoul metropolitan area. Pupils were excluded from education due to the lack of school infrastructure while citizens were exposed to crime and unemployment. In the middle of the population crisis, the metropolitan government of Seoul and the central government of South Korea paid attention to the potential of Gangnam as one of the candidate regions for the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. This review presents how Gangnam has transformed from an “empty land” to the “symbol of wealth” in the history of the Gangnam development and the expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area. The initial development plan tried to solve immediate housing problems derived from the lack of urban space and facility. After 20 years of the intensive development, Gangnam has transformed from a poor countryside region into the new economic centre and financial hub. Gangnam has become a symbol of wealth in South Korea where citizens and private companies would like to reside. On the other hand, many evictees lost their home and disappeared as nameless citizens behind the scenes of the development. The Gangnam-style development, the expertise of urban development acquired in Gangnam, can be thoroughly studied and transferred to other regions in South Korea and developing countries in the world, thus establishing Gangnam as a model case of metropolitan area expansion.\n\nKey words: construction, eviction, Gangnam, housing crisis, metropolitan area, Seoul, shantytowns, urban development",

          "abstract": "This work analyzes data obtained through a public request in 2021 of the highest academic level and gender in the career of CONICET support staff, which are scientific personnel in charge of a wide variety of highly qualified tasks such as: responsible of: equipment, techniques and laboratories, as well as administrative. There are other types of hiring this role in science, which are not contemplated in this analysis, such as: Article 9, contracted, outsourced personnel, dependent on universities with functions in CONICET, among other possible still unidentified.\nIt was determined that there is a balanced composition of personnel from the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate studies levels. By incorporating the gender variable, it can be seen that at the undergraduate and graduate training levels (non-university tertiary, intermediate and basic) are masculinized, while at the postgraduate training levels are feminized. In the analysis of the distribution of CPA personnel by career, we can see that there are more personnel in the Professional category: 1864 people vs 951, and that it is balanced in gender but this is not the same for the Technical career. Analyzing the Technical and Professional careers separately, it was found that there are people with a high level of training retained in the Technical category, a situation that affects women more than men. It can also be seen that in the Professional category, an analogous process occurs, in which the people who access this category with a level of training less than a bachelor's degree are mostly men, which confirms that there is greater pressure of training for women. In this work, this is not considered to be a strict demonstration of “overqualification” or “underqualification,” since for this it is necessary to investigate more about the nature of the tasks they perform, how the bureaucratic incorporation and promotion mechanisms influence them, as well as the subjectivities put into play in the interpretation of which tasks are Technical and which are Professional. It is necessary to continue researching the reasons that produce these inequalities in order to propose reparatory solutions.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, violence against land and environmental activists has been on the rise, besetting even stable democracies. Using a unique, fine-grained data set on social conflict events in Peru and exogenous variation in world mineral prices, I document a strong link between local mineral rents and violent state repression of socioenvironmental protests in a democratic institutional setting. I show that the increase in the use of excessive force cannot be explained by changes in protester behavior. Empirical findings highlight the role of local authorities: the election of a pro-mining mayor is associated with a higher prevalence of state repression and corruption in the constituency. The legal and democratic accountability of local authorities is, however, found to be limited. The reported increase in corruption does not translate into more investigations against pro-mining mayors for corruption offenses nor are reelection results of incumbents found to be negatively affected by state violence against protesters. Finally, I show that violent state repression is successful in forestalling conflict resolution agreements that acknowledge protesters’ demands.",

However, the practice of visitor estimation is complex, challenging, and the methods are highly varied. While researchers and practitioners have spent decades improving and testing visitor estimation methods, determining the best approach for a specific situation remains difficult. As new methods have emerged in recent years, the need to evaluate them in the context of existing methods has become apparent. However, there has been little synthesis of this knowledge. Beginning with a systematic literature review and concluding with a Delphi approach, we review trends and themes in the research to develop a synthesized decision tool to aid in the practice of estimating visitors. We find that the volume of publications and variety of methods present in the literature has increased in recent years. Additionally, some methods are more prevalent in peer-reviewed journals than agency manuals, suggesting the connection between research and practice could be improved. We also identify three themes in the literature: all methods have benefits and shortcomings; emerging technologies create viable data; and these novel data require calibration. We synthesize our findings in table that we call the comparability matrix, which distills 30 attributes about 18 visitor estimation methods into one decision tool. This tool is hosted in an interactive online format for practitioners and researchers. Overall, we found that this two-phase approach, a systematic literature review followed by a Delphi method, is effective for subjects such as visitor estimation that are vast in scope and diverse in application.",

By modeling two evaluation tasks involving many raters and documents, we estimate how various reviewer characteristics (such as their chauvinism and strictness) and document characteristics (such as their field and content) affect societal relevance ratings. We then compare the influence of both reviewer and document characteristics on these ratings and provide an estimate of the societal relevance of humanities research where the factors contributing to peer review unreliability are filtered out. Our results suggest that, even according to humanities scholars themselves, a substantial portion of published humanities research is not relevant to society at large. Furthermore, our results also suggest that when using peer review to decide whether a particular piece of research is societally relevant, the selection of reviewers plays a more significant role than the content of the research.",

Relative measures show higher mobility, with substantially less variation across time and subpopulations. The intergenerational correlation in lifespan (a measure of persistence rather than mobility) is about 0.09 for both sexes – this low correlation is observed across races, education groups, cohorts, and birth states. Finally, we document that the intergenerational persistence of lifespan is much smaller than the persistence in socio-economic status. Moreover, correlations in lifespan and in education are largely independent of each other, suggesting that mobility in well-being may be larger than measures of income alone suggest.",

Leveraging variation in kin members’ exposure to a national policy to lower the cost of secondary school education to account for selection, we find not only an improvement in education levels of kin but also significant intergenerational benefits for children in their families through improved household food security and faster language acquisition. However, we find no evidence that exposure to educated kin improves the nutritional status of these children. The implications of our findings are profound, as they demonstrate the contemporaneous benefits of educational expansion as well as the longer-term effects on subsequent generations, prompting us to rethink the role of education in shaping the well-being of children in low-income communities.",

Results show that larger, urban, and suburban schools with higher academic achievement and less economic disadvantage offer more college prep courses.

          "abstract": "While partisan gerrymandering has been found to be widespread for Congressional redistricting in the United States, there exists little empirical research on legislative redistricting in other countries. We investigate the partisan bias of Japanese redistricting. Some scholars have argued that the prominent role played by the non-partisan commission leaves little room for partisan gerrymandering. Others have pointed out, however, that the Japanese redistricting process may be subject to political influence. The members of the redistricting commission must be appointed by the Prime Minister and be approved by the Diet. In addition, the commission invites the governors of all prefectures to provide their opinions regarding districting. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to estimate the partisan bias of the 2022 Japanese Lower House redistricting plans. We apply a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm to generate a large number of alternative non-partisan redistricting plans. The sampled plans are representative of the population of plans and are consistent with the redistricting rules with which the commission must comply. By comparing the enacted plan with this non-partisan baseline, we quantify the extent to which the enacted plan favors a particular party. Unlike the traditional methods, our simulation approach accounts for political geography and redistricting rules specific to each prefecture. Our analysis shows that the Japanese redistricting process yields little partisan bias both at the prefecture and district levels.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity declines are accelerating globally, impacting ecosystem functioning, with consequences for human health. Interactions with biodiversity can benefit human wellbeing, leading to avoided healthcare costs. However, existing research does not account for the species within ecological communities and their effect traits that elicit wellbeing (e.g. colours, sounds). Many species’ effect traits are seasonal, and spatial variation in exposure to ecosystems by different sectors of society can lead to unequal opportunities to gain wellbeing. Here, we use a novel analytical approach to explore how the relationship between forest biodiversity and wellbeing fluctuates: (1) temporally, between different seasons, and (2) spatially, across the socioeconomic deprivation continuum of a human population at a national scale (England and Wales). Forest species’ effect trait richness is spatially heterogeneous, particularly in autumn, spring, and summer. Broadleaf forests have greater species’ effect trait richness than other categories of forest. Forests with higher species’ effect trait richness, and forests that resulted in higher self-reported participant wellbeing, were in areas with the least socioeconomic deprivation. Forest creation/restoration and nature-health interventions must recognise this ecological and social diversity to ensure initiatives are equitable and socially just. Conserving biodiversity will therefore better deliver ecosystems that underpin healthier individuals and societies.",

          "abstract": "In diesem Beitrag  geht es um die Frage, wie generative Sprachmodelle (bzw. Large Language Modells LLMs) wie z.B. ChatGPT in der universitären Ausbil-dung für qualitative Methoden empirischer Sozialforschung eingesetzt werden können. Um die Möglichkeiten und Grenzen eines solchen Vorhabens seriös ab-zuschätzen, geht es einerseits darum, die derzeitige Leistungsfähigkeit solcher Modelle auszuloten und andererseits das Ziel einer qualitativen Methodenausbil-dung zu bestimmen, denn nur dann lässt sich abschätzen, an welchen Stellen der Ausbildung der Einsatz generativer Sprachmodelle sinnvoll ist. Daher werden wir uns in diesem Beitrag auch mit den Voraussetzungen für die universitäre Lehre qualitativer Methoden der Sozialforschung auseinandersetzen. \nWir beschreiben zunächst knapp die herkömmliche Methodenausbildung an-spruchsvoller qualitativer Methoden im Rahmen von Forschungswerkstätten (1). Anschließend stellen wir die neuen Möglichkeiten des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen vor und legen hierbei einen Schwerpunkt auf unser Konzept des Reconstructive Social Research Promptings (RSRP) (Lieder &amp; Schäffer, 2024) (2). Danach geben wir einen komprimierten Einblick in unser Konzept des Interpretierens zusammen mit generativen Sprachmodellen (Schäffer &amp; Lieder, 2023), das mittlerweile auch einen Vorschlag für das konkrete Vorge-hen beinhaltet. Im dritten Kapitel beleuchten wir die KI-induzierten Herausforde-rungen für die qualitative Methodenausbildung im Kontext der Vermittlung von Methodenwissen und Methodenkönnen.",

          "abstract": "“神秘”的音乐美学接受结果大量涌现在19世纪的德语报刊杂志音乐文献中。在19世纪的德语文化圈中，神秘主义始终参与着音乐发展的进程。神秘美学术语在巴赫、舒曼、韦伯和瓦格纳音乐中被提及得最多。从巴赫的宗教表达、到黑格尔所时代开始的不可理解和内向性器乐作品，到韦伯幻想般的浪漫主义开端，再到舒曼的诗意和神秘浪漫主义，最后到瓦格纳以德国神话和传说为基础的歌剧革命，神秘一直与自我内在、深奥、宗教及浪漫主义的音乐表达保持着紧密联系。The aesthetic reception of “mystical” or “mysterious” music experienced a significant rise in 19th-century German-language periodicals and musical literature. Throughout the 19th century, mysticism played a consistent and integral role in the evolution of music within the German cultural sphere. The terminology of mystical or mysterious aesthetics was particularly prevalent in the works of composers such as Bach, Schumann, Weber, and Wagner. This connection ranges from Bach's religious expressions to the introspective and, at times, incomprehensible instrumental compositions emerging in the Hegelian era, through Weber’s fantastical initiation of Romanticism, Schumann’s poetic and mystical approach to the movement, and culminating in Wagner’s operatic revolution, which drew heavily on Germanic myths and legends. Across these various forms, mysticism maintained a close relationship with expressions of the inner self, religious sentiment, and the broader aesthetics of Romantic musical expression.",
