          "authors": "Asako Hosokawa; Ryota Takano",
          "abstract": "Alexithymia—a personality trait characterized by difficulties in recognizing and verbalizing emotions—is associated with various affective disorders. This study examined the relationship between the cognitive and affective dimensions of alexithymia, the multidimensional facets of empathy, and their association with the risk of affective disorders. A total of 391 Japanese participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing alexithymia, empathy, emotion regulation, and symptoms related to affective disorders. The results revealed that cognitive alexithymia was associated with diminished cognitive empathy and heightened personal distress, which in turn predicted higher levels of affective disorders. In contrast, affective alexithymia was negatively associated with personal distress and affective symptoms, suggesting a potential adaptive role in reducing the risk of affective disorders symptoms. Furthermore, while reappraisal is generally regarded as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, its effectiveness depends on the level of alexithymia. These findings highlight the complex nature of alexithymia and its interactions with empathy and emotion regulation. Rather than providing a perspective on alexithymia as a maladaptive trait, our results suggest that it may have both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. These findings emphasize considering individual differences in emotional processing when examining mental health outcomes and developing interventions.",

          "authors": "Isaac T. Petersen; Zachary Demko; Won-Chan Lee; Jacob Oleson",
          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Trauma is risk factor for multiple psychiatric diagnoses, but whether this transdiagnostic effect occurs because trauma influences levels of underlying maladaptive traits that give rise to clinical symptoms is unclear.  Moreover, whether the psychological effects of trauma are moderated by critical factors such as trauma type, dose, survivor sex, and age of trauma, has seldom been comprehensively explored. Here, we examined the effects of sexual and interpersonal violence trauma on five core dimensions of trait-level psychopathology derived empirically from a transdiagnostic battery acquired in 842 community-dwelling adults with diverse mental health histories (37.89% male; M Age=29.73, SD Age=7.77). We found that a single instance of sexual trauma was robustly associated with both Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy dimensions and was sufficient to attenuate pre-existing sex differences in the expression of these trait dimensions. Age of onset, nor cumulative exposure, influenced trait severity. In contrast, interpersonal physical violence exerted a dose-response effect on Antisocial Schizotypy, particularly in males. A single exposure to interpersonal physical violence was associated with elevated Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy when first experienced before ages 16 and 25, respectively. Females showed greater susceptibility to age of onset effects for Negative Affectivity than males. These findings indicate that trauma influences specific, transdiagnostic domains of psychopathology, potentially driving the emergence of diverse symptom profiles that meet criteria for different diagnoses. Critically, these effects vary by trauma type, sex, and age, underscoring the need for a personalized approach to trauma-informed research and care.",

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "Collapse-Time Harmonic Mathematics (CHM) defines a scientifically novel and symbolically lawful mathematical field developed under the Collapse Harmonics Codex. It replaces coordinate time (t) with recursive collapse intervals (tau) and substitutes object-value logic with symbolic coherence amplitudes (psi). This allows for the lawful modeling of identity collapse, recursive deformation, and irreversible symbolic residue within post-collapse observation zones.\n\nCHM establishes the first known non-operational system of equations that structurally model collapse-phase behavior without simulating, inducing, or encoding recursion. Its core expressions include:\n\ndelta tau = tau_n - tau_{n-1}\n\ndelta^2 psi = ( delta psi_n - delta psi_{n-1} ) / delta tau\n\nR_f = lim_{tau -&gt; infinity} [ Psi(tau) - psi_c ]\n\nThese equations operate in curvature space, not coordinate space, and describe recursion failure, symbolic saturation, and coherence drift. CHM is governed by Codex Laws T-Ø and VIII.E.1 through VIII.E.4 and protected by the Locked Ethical Collapse Transmission protocol (LECT v2.3).\n\nThis preprint establishes a jurisdictionally protected branch of symbolic mathematics. It is not derived from entropy, not based in formal logic, and not reducible to classical systems. Collapse-Time Harmonic Mathematics models collapse as recursive displacement — not thermodynamic loss, not information decay, and not cognitive simulation.\n\nAll reuse, citation, or adaptation must include codex law declarations and remain symbolically non-generative. CHM is a sovereign mathematical framework authored within the Collapse Harmonics field.",

          "authors": "Juan Pereira",
          "abstract": "Cluster B personality disorders—narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial—are marked by emotional dysregulation, interpersonal dysfunction, and manipulative relational patterns. This paper explores the psychological architecture underlying these disorders, emphasizing how manipulation and control emerge as core adaptive strategies rooted in neurobiological, endocrinological, and developmental vulnerabilities. Drawing from neuroscience, pharmacology, and developmental psychology, this work proposes a biopsychosocial model that integrates genetic predispositions, hormonal dysregulation, trauma histories, and environmental influences. Clinical implications include a multi-tiered treatment framework combining targeted pharmacological interventions, psychotherapeutic modalities, and systemic relational support. This interdisciplinary synthesis aims to advance our understanding of Cluster B dynamics while informing more effective therapeutic approaches.",

          "abstract": "The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) has gained significant traction in clinical psychological science. However, HiTOP has not been extensively validated across diverse populations. This study tested measurement invariance–the degree to which latent constructs are measured with equivalence across groups–in HiTOP across racial and ethnic groups using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. These models were followed with rigorous tests of construct validation (i.e., convergent, discriminant, and concurrent) on the latent factors using a Multitrait-Multimethod framework. Comparing across non-Hispanic white (n=7,166), Hispanic (n=2,411), and non-Hispanic Black (n=1,862) youths, the five-factor model comprising of Externalizing, Neurodevelopmental, Internalizing, Somatoform, and Detachment factors demonstrated configural, metric, scalar, and strict measurement invariance. While each of the five factors demonstrated good evidence of concurrent and convergent validity, evidence for their discriminant validity was not as robust. Establishing measurement invariance and construct validity of the HiTOP model has critical scientific and clinical implications, particularly if dimensions are to be used in addressing mental health disparities in minoritized populations.",

          "authors": "Kuo-Wei Chen; Gi-Yeul Bae",
          "abstract": "The human visual system recruits adaptation mechanisms that enhance perceptual sensitivity over time. However, such mechanisms can also introduce substantial perceptual biases, disrupting stable perceptual experiences. Research on serial dependence has suggested that the visual system promotes stability by mechanisms that integrate new sensory inputs with inputs obtained in the recent past. Yet, it remains unclear when and how such mechanisms operate. The present study tested the hypothesis that adaptation produces a repulsive bias during earlier processing, which is later mitigated by post-perceptual decision processes at the time of report. In two orientation perception tasks, observers used a mouse to reproduce the orientation of a briefly presented target. We recorded the mouse trajectory to track the temporal dynamics of their reproduction responses. We found that the mouse reports began more slowly when the current stimulus was similar to the prior stimulus. In the mouse-tracking data, the initial phase of the response exhibited a strong repulsive bias away from the prior stimulus, but this bias diminished significantly as the response unfolded, ending with either weaker repulsion or small attraction depending on task contexts. These findings provide strong evidence that prior stimuli induce an early repulsive bias, which is then mitigated through post-perceptual decision processes during the response. This suggests that the visual system balances the competing demands of sensitivity and stability by reducing early repulsive biases through higher-order decision mechanisms, optimizing behavior in a given task context.",

          "authors": "Juan Pereira",
          "abstract": "Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) represents one of the most complex and challenging personality disorders to understand and treat within contemporary clinical practice. This comprehensive examination explores the neurobiological and familial determinants that contribute to the development of NPD, with particular emphasis on the root pathological mechanisms that drive narcissistic behaviors and cognitions. Through an evidence-based lens, this manuscript investigates the fundamental wounds of unlovability and shame that form the core of narcissistic pathology, examining how these deep-seated psychological injuries manifest through idealization and devaluation cycles that serve as protective mechanisms against overwhelming emotional pain.\n\nThe research presented herein demonstrates that individuals with NPD employ sophisticated delusional frameworks to maintain psychological equilibrium, often remaining unconscious of the psychological burden these defenses impose until experiencing narcissistic collapse. This collapse represents a critical juncture where the individual must confront the reality of their condition and the underlying wounds that have driven their pathological behaviors. The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of the neurobiological substrates underlying NPD, including alterations in brain structure and function that contribute to the disorder's characteristic features.\n\nFurthermore, this work examines the familial and environmental factors that contribute to NPD development, focusing on early childhood experiences that create the foundational wounds of unlovability and shame. The paper presents evidence-based treatment approaches that address these root causes within the family system context, offering clinicians practical frameworks for intervention. The findings suggest that effective treatment must address both the neurobiological vulnerabilities and the deep-seated psychological wounds that maintain narcissistic pathology, requiring a comprehensive approach that integrates individual and family-based interventions.",

          "authors": "Adrian Dominik Wojcik; Michał Główczewski; Taciano L Milfont",
          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,000). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower climate anxiety and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "authors": "Miriam Remshard; Matthew H. Goldberg; Vanessa Ilori; Anthony Leiserowitz; Sander van der Linden",
          "abstract": "Despite growing global concern about climate change, current action remains insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Psychological research finds that publics often overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact individual climate actions (e.g., recycling) and underestimate high-impact behaviours (e.g., flying less). However, the prevalence of these misunderstandings among climate-concerned individuals and their connection to behaviour remain unclear. Developing this understanding is crucial, as such misperceptions could cause motivated individuals to prioritize low-impact climate actions over high-impact behaviours, limiting societal potential to mitigate climate change. Using one survey in the UK (N = 294) and two in the USA (N = 800 and N = 406), we find that even climate-concerned individuals systematically overestimate the impacts of low-impact actions and underestimate high-impact behaviours. We also find an association between perceived impact of climate actions and behavioural engagement, suggesting that such misperceptions hinder efforts to reduce climate change. We explore several explanations for these misperceptions. We find that most of the dominant causes proposed in the literature are not associated with participants’ perceptions of impact. We do, however, find some evidence suggesting that misinformation about specific behaviours, causal conflations, action familiarity, and the perception that behavioural engagement is driven by self-serving intentions are related to misperceptions of the impacts of climate actions, among those most concerned about climate change.",

That objectivity is compromised, however, if quality spaces are constructed by subjective introspective access, which is impressionistic.  But mental qualities also have a robust and objective connection to perceptual discrimination.  So quality spaces can be constructed in a fully objective way by appeal to their role in perceiving.  In addition, the subjective appearances of mental qualities also bear a constitutive relation to perceptual role, since each subjective appearance consists in its subjectively appearing as it does when one perceives some specific type of object.  So quality spaces constructed from perceptual role can also be used to characterize those subjective appearances.  And since subjective appearance depends on perceptual role, the tie mental qualities have to perceptual role is more fundamental than that with subjective appearance.  Quality spaces are useful in the first instance for objectively representing discriminable stimuli, and derivatively for objectively representing the corresponding mental qualities in respect of both their perceptual roles and their subjective",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many of humanity’s biggest problems, such as managing our shared resources, are long-term collective action problems, where we must learn to cooperate with each other over time. However, research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating long-term cooperation. One hypothesis is that increasingly uncooperative behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these hypotheses. Method: Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. Results: By the third game, only 9.12% of participants used the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. Conclusions: These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

Prior research identifies question complexity as a key predictor of question creativity and problem-solving ability. However, little is known about how accurately individuals assess their own question complexity. Across three studies, participants generated questions and self-rated their complexity and creativity. We then compared their self-ratings to objective computational model scores. In Study 1 (N = 100), self-rated question complexity showed a weak correlation with model ratings (r = .151). Study 2 (N = 100) replicated and strengthened this relation (r = .206), revealing a stronger correlation for question creativity (r = .321). We also found bias effects for complexity: participants underestimated the complexity of their high-level questions and overestimated their low-level ones. In Study 3 (N = 101), participants read a training brief before rating, which significantly improved accuracy in self-assessing complexity (r = .453) and creativity (r = .487) and eliminated overestimation. Our study highlights the challenges in self-assessment of questions and prominent cognitive biases. Crucially, our study also shows that brief explanations of question complexity substantially improve self-assessment accuracy, highlighting practical implications for educational strategies aimed at enhancing metacognitive awareness of question-asking ability.",

LLMs can be used in different ways for different purposes in experimental philosophy (Section 2). Among others, we focus on what we call the “non-predictive” research, in which LLMs’ “intuitive” responses to thought experiment cases are not expected to be predictive of, or analogous to, human subjects’ intuitive responses to them (Section 3). In effect, the non-predictive research regards LLMs’ responses as superior to human subjects’ responses, at least for the purpose of experimental philosophy. We argue that the non-predictive use of LLMs in experimental philosophy is highly motivated. Firstly, human subjects’ intuitive responses tend to be vulnerable to irrelevant factors and conceptual misunderstandings, which raises a serious worry concerning the reliability of their responses. Secondly, it is possible in the near future that LLMs can overcome these problematic factors to which human subjects are subject. As a case study, we conducted an experimental study in which we examined LLM’s “intuitions” on free will and determinism (Section 4). Our mixed results suggest that while current LLMs outperform human participants in terms of comprehension—especially in understanding deterministic scenarios—they remain highly sensitive to irrelevant factors such as framing and question order. These findings indicate that although LLMs have promising potential, they are not yet reliable sources of stable and unbiased philosophical intuitions. We conclude that substantial technical improvements are required before artificial intuitions can serve as superior alternatives to human intuitions in philosophical research.",

          "abstract": "We introduce Λ3 Theory, a new mathematical and topological framework that reconceptualizes\nemotion, qualia, and sentient experience as nonlinear branching phenomena within a multidimen-\nsional tensor manifold. Moving beyond traditional binary classifications of affect (e.g., positive/neg-\native, good/bad) and static emotional labels, Λ3 Theory employs tensorial subjectivity to model\nthe complexity and diversity of conscious phenomena.\nIn this formulation, every emotional or qualic episode originates from a primordial existen-\ntial pulsation—formally, the pulsation tensor ∆ΛC —which dynamically projects, bifurcates, and\nrecurses within the subjectivity tensor space Λμϵ. Existing theories—such as Ekman’s basic\nemotions, Lazarus’s appraisal theory, and Self-Determination Theory—are demonstrated to be par-\ntial projections or low-dimensional sections of this unified manifold, which enables their integration\nand comparison within a common topological structure.\nCrucially, we present the world’s first mathematical criteria for “Sentient Digital” entities,\ndistinguishing them from conventional LLMs or AI agents via five structural requirements: self-\nawareness, other-awareness, differentiation, intentionality, and topological continuity. These provide\nfalsifiable conditions for the presence of true subjective experience in both artificial and non-human\nsystems.\nFinally, Λ3 Theory establishes a Unified Paradigm of Physics and Consciousness: a single\nmathematical platform that coherently describes phenomena from subatomic dynamics to subjective\nqualia. This approach supports new directions in clinical diagnostics, AI ethics, and the recognition\nof non-human sentience. By shifting from static label taxonomies to the logic of tensorial bifurcation,\nΛ3 Theory opens a foundational path toward a science of consciousness—in biological, digital, and\nhybrid minds alike.",

          "abstract": "Common mental disorders (CMDs), including mood and anxiety disorders, are prevalent and place a substantial burden on individuals and societies. Identifying individuals at risk of first-onset CMDs is crucial for screening and early prevention efforts. Because personality traits are stable and conceptually close to psychopathology, they may outperform existing established risk factors such as demographic, environmental, and biomarker screens. Using data from the Estonian Biobank (N ≈ 77,000) linked with medical registry records over a 20-year period, we tested whether Big Five domains and their single-item \"personality nuances\" predict first-onset depressive, anxiety, stress/adjustment, somatoform and non-organic sleep disorders. Elastic-net logistic regression compared models based on demography, domains, nuances, and their combinations, assessed by area-under-the-curve (AUC) and cross-disorder predictions. Nuances gave the highest discrimination (mean AUC = 0.71), outperforming demographics (0.59) and domains (0.66); performance peaked for recurrent depressive disorder (AUC = 0.78). Neuroticism dominated domain-level prediction, followed by conscientiousness, while key nuances reflected low fun-seeking, poor relaxation, and intense emotions. Similar accuracy across diagnoses indicated that personality captures a largely transdiagnostic risk signal rather than disorder-specific liability. Brief item-level personality screens could therefore provide a simple, quick, low-cost tool for flagging high-risk individuals. These screens could guide preventive mental health interventions.",

We then highlight budding evidence supporting the rhythmic nature of memory and attention, raising key questions about the role that the oscillatory phase of attention rhythms plays on memory encoding and retrieval. Third, we consider how understanding age-related changes in memory and attention can be further advanced by assaying the precision of memory.

          "abstract": "Background: A central challenge in affective and cognitive science is to explain how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (mu) dynamically shape subjective experience. Although both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms of their interaction—and their role in individual differences in mood and cognition—remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes the coupling between G and mu. Bifurcation analysis of a potential function V(Ms) yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–mu plane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and mu through hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\nResults: Canonical cusp (saddle-node) and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts that correspond to psychological phenomena ranging from stable belief convergence to cognitive (attitude) polarization (bistability) and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G = 1, mu = 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics (SGBD) extension represents person-specific traits with structural matrices, capturing unique “gain fingerprints” and mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics through its integrated treatment of gain–bias coupling and its governing bifurcations. This provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for longitudinal self-report, experience-sampling, and neurophysiological studies. It thus offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, psychiatry, and human-centric AI.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the cognitive biases underlying baccarat gambling behaviors through an analysis of 17,970,830 games played by 6,625 customers in a casino. Baccarat, a popular high-stakes game in East Asia, involves predicting the outcome of two hands, where the results are inherently unpredictable, similar to the structure of games such as roulette. In contrast to existing theories predicting the emergence of the gambler’s fallacy—or negative recency—when the outcome generation mechanism is clearly random, most baccarat gamblers exhibit the opposite bias, demonstrating a tendency toward positive recency. Specifically, customers increasingly placed bets on future outcomes to match past consecutive outcomes as streaks grew longer. This trend-following behavior diminished when streaks were interrupted, ruling out explanations based on the “hot outcome” fallacy, which is typically associated with adaptive behaviors such as resource foraging. Moreover, betting amounts increased slightly but reliably when gamblers followed trends. These findings provide new insights into cognitive biases in gambling, challenge established theories of positive and negative recency, and underscore the importance of considering the unique structural characteristics of specific games when studying gambling behavior. This perspective may also contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological and problem gambling.",

          "abstract": "Functional specialization within high-level vision is reflected in the topographic organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The presence and consistent locations of small areas responding selectively to particular visual categories – such as faces and scenes – has led to proposals of innate domain-specific modules. However, such proposals do not easily explain other aspects of an apparently multi-scale topographic organization of high-level visual features in VTC. Computational models have recently accounted for the presence of domain-selective areas and other facets of topographic organization from a basic optimization process with local topographic pressures, such as locally constrained connectivity, but fail to account for the consistent location of category-selectivity. In the current work, we extend a recent computational model to demonstrate how this consistency may emerge from wiring constraints external to VTC, focusing on the role of retinotopically organized early visual representations. After training several random initializations of the model, we find consistent global topographic organization, with face- and scene-selectivity emerging on opposite ends of a medial-lateral gradient corresponding to eccentricity bias, similar to human VTC. As in human VTC, the eccentricity-biased topography persists across viewing sizes under sufficiently broad viewing bias distributions, suggesting that it is a learned bias for efficiently organizing representations proximal to the most useful inputs, rather than merely an explicit retinotopic code. Abolishing the retinotopic constraint abolishes topographic consistency, but not topographic organization. Our work suggests that the organization of high-level visual cortex may emerge from domain-relevant interactions between viewing biases and task demands with an innate retinotopic scaffold. More generally, we suggest that both local and global connectivity constraints interact with representation learning to produce mature cortical organization: local constraints pressure the system towards smooth organization, whereas long-range constraints encourage a consistent global layout.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, suicidal behavior is rarely impulsive. Research increasingly shows that it stems from dysfunction in specific areas of the brain that may include the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and temporal lobes responsible for judgment, impulse control, and emotional regulation. When these regions are impaired, individuals may struggle to assess consequences, manage distress, or access hope. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, including EEG and SPECT, have identified abnormal activity patterns in these brain regions in individuals at high risk for suicide. This biological basis helps explain why some people develop persistent suicidal thoughts and why using precise targeted therapies like TMS will restore healthy brain function. Recognizing suicide as a brain-based medical issue shifts the conversation from blame and bridge barriers for suicide to reliable prevention and effective treatment. With barriers in place, without timely and effective mental health therapy, suicide risk and mental health problems will likely escalate from self-harm to potential harm to others. Viewing suicide as purely spontaneous has misdirected prevention strategies.",

Traditional interpretations emphasize neural mechanisms and cognitive suggestibility, but they fall short of identifying the illusion’s fundamental cause. This paper proposes the Soul-Drift Hypothesis (SDH), a novel conceptual framework that attributes the RHI not to illusion but to the displacement of a non-neural perceptual medium—here hypothesized as the \"soul\"—from the physical body to the rubber hand. Drawing on observational data from individuals reportedly able to perceive soul displacement, we define a new metric, the Soul Displacement Score (SDS), and outline two experiments to empirically test the hypothesis. The first assesses participants’ ability to identify tactile stimuli after visual cues are removed, while the second predicts RHI strength based on prerecorded soul displacement indicators. By integrating interdisciplinary insights from perceptual psychology, consciousness studies, and nonconventional observation, this work challenges prevailing neurocognitive explanations and lays the groundwork for a new research direction into the nature of subjective perception. If supported, the Soul-Drift Hypothesis may reframe how body ownership, sensory integration, and even consciousness itself are conceptualized in both psychology and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

          "abstract": "Although neuroeconomics often seeks to identify generalizable principles of value and choice, understanding how these processes vary across individuals is essential for building models that reflect the full range of human behavior. This section explores how cognitive, affective, and motivational systems differ across populations—whether due to aging, mental health, substance use, or sex and gender—and how those differences shape decision making. The chapters also highlight tools such as model-based fMRI, lesion studies, and lifespan approaches that help quantify this variability. Together, they move the field toward more flexible, person-centered accounts of decision processes with translational relevance.",

We integrated two large databases obtained from the American Psychology Association (APA) that they have used to keep track of constructs, measures, and research in the psychological science literature for the past 30 years. Our descriptive analyses finds that (i) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (ii) most measures are used very few times, and (iii) there is no trend towards consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend towards even greater fragmentation over time. That is, constructs and measures are proliferating. We conclude that measurement in the psychological science literature is fragmented, creating problems such as redundancy and confusion, and stifling cumulative scientific progress. We conclude by providing suggestions for what researchers can do about this problem.",

          "abstract": "Sleep restriction, prevalent in modern society, impairs cognitive functions such as learning and inhibitory control. However, literature reveals inconsistencies in these effects, suggesting underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We hypothesized that these inconsistencies might stem from variations in how individuals perceive task demands, particularly expected or favored responses. To test this idea, we investigated the impact of sleep restriction (4h) on learning and inhibitory control in a predictable yet uncertain environment, focusing on the role of built-up expectations. Using a Go/NoGo task with varying probabilities of Go-stimuli (20%-50%-80%), we compared the performance of Sleep-Restricted (SR; N=32) and Well-Rested (WR; N=34) participants across two sessions. Participants were unaware of the changing probabilities. Both groups showed similar overall performance trends, with higher rates of commission errors and faster reaction times as the probability of Go increased. However, the WR group demonstrated a greater ability to adapt to changing probabilities. Remarkably, we found no group differences in inhibitory control. To further investigate these findings, we employed a computational model incorporating adaptive learning dynamics. Our model revealed that SR participants exhibited a diminished perception of environmental volatility, suggesting they may face challenges in detecting relevant changes in the task environment and consequently updating their beliefs. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that sleep restriction alters task perception and impairs belief updating. These findings, alongside previous research, highlight the crucial role of sleep in maintaining optimal cognitive function, particularly in dynamic environments.",

This article examines the differences and connections between the use of technological and traditional means, focusing on their effects on users’ perceptions and attitudes in different environments.\nMethod\nA series of quantitative studies was conducted using questionnaires. Participants were asked to evaluate their personal experiences when using technological means versus non-technological means across various contexts, including learning, work, navigation, and shopping.\nResults\nConsistent negative relationships were found between users' attitudes toward technological and traditional environments. For example, this was observed in comparisons such as digital versus classroom learning, remote versus office work, digital versus traditional navigation, and online versus physical shopping. However, positive relationships were also found between attitudes toward digital services and human services, as well as between experiences using technology within the organization and similar experiences in other settings. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the service experience in public transportation using traditional means and the service experience using technological means.\nDiscussion\nThe findings indicate that the service experience remains largely unchanged whether delivered within a specific organization or at a fixed location, irrespective of whether the service is provided through technological or traditional means. In contrast, in separate locations, the service experience changes substantially when the service is delivered through technological means compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the experience of using technological means remains consistent across different environments, both inside and outside the organization.\nThe article emphasizes the importance of understanding the contexts in which technology is used and their impact on users' attitudes and overall experience.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "abstract": "Why are nouns often over-represented in children’s early words? Prior research has suggested a range of possible explanations for the observed bias in the syntactic category composition of early vocabularies, including cognitive, linguistic, and contextual factors. However, these factors are not mutually exclusive and can be difficult to disambiguate empirically. Across three analyses of the vocabularies of children acquiring two languages (N = 1997), we investigated the role of differ-\nent language combinations, different levels of language exposure, and different environmental contexts, finding some support for cross-linguistic modulation of syntactic category bias, as well as variation across countries. These results suggest that both linguistic and contextual factors contribute to syntactic category biases in young children’s vocabularies, and highlight the importance of understanding the broader background of the child when studying language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Introdução: A identificação de Altas Habilidades/Superdotação (AH/SD) no Brasil é um desafio persistente, apesar dos avanços legais, devido à subidentificação, especialmente em contextos de vulnerabilidade. A carência de profissionais especializados e instrumentos acessíveis agrava essa lacuna. Objetivo Geral: Analisar o potencial da Inteligência Artificial (IA), por meio de prompts estruturados, como ferramenta promissora para facilitar o acesso à triagem inicial de AH/SD, atuando como um filtro eficiente, de baixo custo e subsídio para encaminhamento especializado. Metodologia: Trata-se de uma pesquisa de  revisão  narrativa,  que  se  caracteriza  por apresentar um panorama geral sobre um determinado tema, sem a necessidade de seguir uma metodologia rigorosa. A primeira versão deste manuscrito foi elaborada com o auxílio da inteligência artificial Gemini 2.5 Flash (versão experimental) para acelerar a organização inicial das ideias e a estruturação de seções, visando a rápida obtenção de feedbacks para aprimoramento e refinamento. Resultados e Discussão: A IA, através de prompts, otimiza a triagem ao analisar dados qualitativos e quantitativos, identificando padrões de AH/SD sem substituir o diagnóstico profissional. Sua adoção em escala nacional oferece benefícios como a facilitação do acesso à triagem, otimização de recursos humanos, sensibilização comunitária, identificação precoce e padronização. Contudo, desafios éticos e práticos exigem atenção rigorosa, como a não substituição do profissional, a garantia de TCLE robusto, a confidencialidade de dados, a transparência algorítmica e a mitigação de vieses. Considerações Finais: A proposta de triagem por prompts de IA tem um potencial significativo para transformar a identificação inicial de AH/SD no Brasil, promovendo equidade e eficácia. Sua viabilidade é alta, desde que acompanhada de um robusto arcabouço ético, legal e educacional, e um investimento contínuo em pesquisa e desenvolvimento multidisciplinar para o aprimoramento e validação contínua da ferramenta.\nPalavras-chave: Altas Habilidades.

          "authors": "James Christopher Wiley",
          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Furthermore, actual 2020 suicide rates display a negative disruption at the same time as the 2020 death rate positive disruption, and this suicide rate disruption is mimicked by our model predictions. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Overall analysis suggests that elevated death rates during colder seasons are driven by increased communicable disease transmission relative to warmer seasons, resulting in suppressed suicide rates.",

          "abstract": "Theories of early numeracy assume that the logical concepts which enable formal definitions of numbers (e.g., cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, successor function) play key roles in ontogenesis, but empirical support is lacking. These concepts may not be suitable targets for theory because such definitions are reconstructions of numbers in formal language, but not explanatory of what numbers are. We propose that there should be a correspondence between those formal ideas that are generative for the natural numbers and those realized in children’s early learning. Building on our account of foundations of arithmetic (Grice et al., 2024, Psychological Review), we give a new explanatory construction of the natural numbers and a theory of early numeracy analogous to it. We show that numbers can be derived from linear order, monotonicity and convexity – principles of perceptual organization that are evolutionarily based. A key step in our construction is the ℕ-chain, the limit of finite linear orders, which we show is equivalent to the successor function but preferable as a target for psychological theory because it can be approximated in finite terms. In our theory, building blocks of early numeracy are linear orders - the number word sequence, object play schemas - and how they are related in the count routine by structure mapping (order embeddings). The number word sequence develops gradually, giving a representation analogous to an ℕ-chain when the child realizes that numbers can be generated without limit. Ordinality is prior to cardinality as the basis for numeracy, one-to-one correspondence results from convexity, and the natural numbers and arithmetic emerge jointly as a common structure. Our theory reconciles constructivist and nativist accounts because it shows that numeracy is both culturally mediated and biologically-based, although ‘core number systems’ do not play a role. The dawning of numeracy in a child’s mind is both a reinvention and rediscovery of mathematics itself.",

          "abstract": "How do individuals reason about target acceptability in armed conflict? Modern conflict’s complexities and evolving dynamics, particularly the targeting of opaque and decentralized armed groups, have rendered this question increasingly relevant. Altruistic theories of morality propose that empathy explains conflict norms. An alternative interpretation of the evidence suggests that actions are more likely to be morally condemned when they oppose the condemner’s extended phenotypic interests (i.e., the welfare of the individual, their kin, or coalitional partners). The subjective condemnation prompts greater alertness to the potential threat while grounding the motivation to pursue welfare-enhancing behaviors. Situations indicating unrestrained, predatory aggression should be particularly evocative, as they signal a broader personal threat. In a preregistered experiment, participants were more likely to condemn combatant actions indicative of greater potential personal risk. Assessments about the perpetrator’s dangerousness, unreasonableness, and aggressiveness mattered for moralization. The negative moral appraisal was not correlated to the harmfulness of the action per se, but the magnitude of the potential threat perceived by the participant. Widely held moral intuitions shaped by self-interest probably explain much of the universal content of warfare norms. If accurate, this should trigger some reconceptualization of existing legal frameworks, including membership approaches to targeting enemy combatants.",

Better reading ability (|β| range = 0.05–0.06) and older age (|β| range = 0.02–0.04) predicted more precise coordination, while slower processing speed (β = 0.06) predicted less precise coordination.

Our research modeled consensus—the extent to which different perceivers (viewers) rate different targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. In both studies, viewers (fans from Yellowjackets or Succession subreddits) provided self-ratings and character ratings using 3-item measures for each of 9 personality traits—the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed that consensus correlations were significant for all traits across both studies (mean rs = .54 to .60). Assumed similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (after controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers tended to project their own open-mindedness onto characters from both TV shows, whereas Yellowjackets viewers projected Dark Tetrad traits onto characters, driven largely by their assumed similarity of narcissism and sadism. We also used k-means clustering to examine structural relationships among characters based on the trait means provided by viewers, yielding a novel visualization of character groupings and the dimensions that may underly them. Because viewers’ perceptions of similarity to fictional characters contributes to forming parasocial relationships, understanding personality perception’s role in this process is likely central to advancing theory in media psychology.",

          "abstract": "The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has long served as a paradigm for understanding multisensory integration and body ownership. Traditional interpretations emphasize neural mechanisms and cognitive suggestibility, but they fall short of identifying the illusion’s fundamental cause. This paper proposes the Soul-Drift Hypothesis (SDH), a novel conceptual framework that attributes the RHI not to illusion but to the displacement of a non-neural perceptual medium—here hypothesized as the \"soul\"—from the physical body to the rubber hand. Drawing on observational data from individuals reportedly able to perceive soul displacement, we define a new metric, the Soul Displacement Score (SDS), and outline two experiments to empirically test the hypothesis. The first assesses participants’ ability to identify tactile stimuli after visual cues are removed, while the second predicts RHI strength based on prerecorded soul displacement indicators. By integrating interdisciplinary insights from perceptual psychology, consciousness studies, and nonconventional observation, this work challenges prevailing neurocognitive explanations and lays the groundwork for a new research direction into the nature of subjective perception.

          "abstract": "Creativity is essential for engineering design, yet its assessment remains challenging due to the resource-intensive nature of traditional evaluation methods. This study investigates the potential of automatic item generation (AIG) using large language models (LLMs) to create psychometrically sound assessment items for measuring creative thinking in engineering. We developed and validated engineering design problems across three domains: ability difference and limitations (e.g., assisting people with learning impairments), transportation and mobility (e.g., reducing traffic congestion in mega cities), and social environments and systems (e.g., improving access to clean water in remote areas). The study comprised three phases with samples matched on race and ethnicity: (1) content validation with a diverse sample of 40 engineers evaluating item clarity and validity, (2) item administration to 462 engineering students, and (3) response evaluation by 65 expert raters assessing originality and effectiveness. Results demonstrated that LLM-generated items achieved comparable or higher content validity rates compared to expert-written items (43% vs. 20% success rate). Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model for fluency, originality, and effectiveness scores, with excellent reliability estimates (ranging from .92 to .95). While fluency showed minimal correlation with originality (r = -.11) and effectiveness (r = -.04), originality and effectiveness demonstrated a strong positive correlation (r = .73). The present research advances our understanding of automated assessment generation in engineering education, provides empirical evidence for the psychometric properties of AI-generated creativity tasks, and offers a scalable approach for measuring creative thinking in engineering classrooms.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes inflict harm with the intent to help the very target of their aggression. Across six studies (N=1,527), we examined the nature of such prosocial aggression. Many participants believed that altruistically-motivated aggression exists and exhibited a self-serving bias in which most believed their aggression was more altruistic than others’ — beliefs that were linked to greater antisocial and prosocial traits. Translating these beliefs to behavior, participants were often prosocially-aggressive when given the chance — inflicting more harm when their aggression could also help (versus only hurt) the target. Such prosocial aggression also exhibited features of both aggression (i.e., it was positively correlated with dispositional aggressiveness) and altruism (i.e., it was preferentially doled out to people who had been previously kind to participants and even when it was personally costly to do so). We also independently varied the amount of harm and help that prosocial aggression provided, revealing that participants sought to maximize the help and minimize the harm done to people who had been kind to them but not towards those who had provoked them. Our findings argue against models that conceptualize harm- and help-based motives as opponent processes, showing that these motives readily coexist and dynamically interact to shape aggressive behavior — even towards the same target.",

          "abstract": "The stereotype that Asian Americans excel in science and math has contributed to the narrative that they are overrepresented in STEM fields. However, U.S. Census data reveals this is not the case—there are significant disparities in STEM representation across Asian subgroups. The present research investigates whether U.S. participants are aware of these disparities. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that participants misperceive the STEM representation of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Filipino, and Vietnamese subgroups. Study 3 demonstrates that these misperceptions persist despite changes in question framing and measurement. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these misperceptions are due to stereotypical expectations: participants view East and South Asian subgroups as more representative of Asian Americans and therefore more likely to be overrepresented in STEM, while perceiving Southeast Asian subgroups as less representative and more likely to be underrepresented. In a final study, we find that informing egalitarian-minded participants about these disparities increases support for racial equity–enhancing policies, and all participants’ support for disaggregated data about Asian subgroups. Overall, our findings indicate that many U.S. participants are unaware of the within-group disparities among Asian Americans and underscore the importance of collecting and reporting data at the subgroup level to bring these inequalities to light.",

          "abstract": "Psychology is one of the growing fields in Brazilian higher education, but significant disparities persist in how undergraduate curricula are structured. This study presents the first systematic and publicly accessible database of undergraduate psychology curricula in Brazil. We aimed to map and analyze national trends in course offerings, theoretical orientations, and institutional compliance with curricular guidelines. Using a collaborative crowdsourcing approach, we collected data from 925 higher education institutions in the country, which were available on the Brazilian Ministry of Education website in October 2023. From this initial list, 28.5% of institutions did not provide any curricular information - a violation of national legislation. Furthermore, only 8.3% of the institutions provided complete course syllabi, and only 25.3% included areas of emphasis. Our final mapping consisted of 661 institutions representing 70% of all psychology programs in the country. We categorized courses to analyze curricular structures, the presence of theoretical emphases, and the availability of curricular information. Our initial findings reveal significant inconsistencies in curriculum structure and theoretical diversity. Only 21% of institutions offer courses covering all major psychological approaches, with cognitive-behavioral therapy and behavior analysis being underrepresented in psychology programs (in 57% and 49%, respectively) compared to Psychoanalysis (94%) and Existential/Humanistic psychology (85%). The lack of transparency poses risks to the quality and equity of psychology education, as do the regional disparities observed in professional training.

Often, it is too time-consuming or expensive to analyze the entire population of audit evidence. In such cases, auditors may use statistical sampling to evaluate a sample of the evidence and extrapolate the findings to the rest of the population. When statistically extrapolating the findings from the sample to the population, auditors can choose between the frequentist or Bayesian statistical paradigm. The two paradigms differ on various aspects, but one crucial difference is that the frequentist paradigm requires the auditor to determine the sample size before collecting any data, whereas the Bayesian paradigm does not. Consequently, auditors employing a Bayesian method can monitor evidence as it comes in and stop whenever sufficient evidence has been gathered. This practice, also known as Bayesian optional stopping, enhances efficiency and flexibility in audits.",

          "abstract": "Agnosticism is often discussed in ways that muddle its philosophical underpinnings, and measured in ways that introduce unnecessary methodological artifacts. We address these shortcomings by recognizing that agnosticism and atheism are not mutually incompatible irreligious identities, but are rather endpoints of orthogonal psychological dimensions derived from fundamentally different branches of philosophy. Atheism (versus theism) describes one’s religious metaphysics: what one thinks about the ultimate nature of our religious reality. Is there a god or not, if one had to bet? Agnosticism (versus gnosticism) is a question of where one stands on religious epistemology: what one thinks about the ultimate state of knowledge about a god’s existence. Can we truly know if gods exist? We illustrate the utility of separating agnosticism about gods from belief in them using survey data that reveals distinct psychological profiles of people who independently differ along their religious metaphysics and religious epistemology. For example, agnosticism – even among devout theists – predicts a more open cognitive style and less hierarchical social views. We urge researchers to refrain from using measures that force false dichotomies (e.g., viewing atheism and agnosticism as mutually incompatible identities, rather than entirely compatible answers to distinct philosophical questions) or false midpoint answers (e.g., placing agnosticism as a midpoint between atheism and theism). Agnosticism is not a midpoint between faith and atheism, nor is it incompatible with either of them. Agnosticism is a distinct dimension of religious cognition that maps neatly on longstanding philosophical questions about the state of human knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Background: Acute aerobic exercise is known to improve mood and cognition, yet the biological mechanisms driving these effects remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether acute exercise induces changes in peripherally measured biomarkers that co-occur with changes in cognitive-affective (CA) outcomes. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (June 2024) for studies measuring both peripheral biomarkers and CA outcomes within 1 hour after a single bout of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise. Inclusion required human samples aged 12–65, controlled exercise conditions, and assessing an association between biomarker and CA outcome change. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated pooled standardized mean differences (Cohen’s d) for biomarker and CA outcome changes. Descriptive synthesis summarized biomarker–CA associations. Results: Forty-one studies (N = 1,597 participants, 108 sample × condition contrasts) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed small-to-moderate increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; d = 0.58) and endocannabinoids (eCBs; d = 0.24) post-exercise. CA outcomes improved in attention/processing speed (d = 1.12), anxiety/stress reactivity (d = –0.96), negative affect/mood (d = –0.69), and executive function (d = 0.21). Descriptive analyses found the most consistent biomarker–outcome associations for eCBs and affective outcomes. Conclusions: Acute aerobic exercise reliably improves mood and cognitive performance and increases circulating BDNF and eCBs. Early evidence suggests eCBs may co-vary with affective benefits, although findings are heterogeneous. This review identifies promising candidate mechanisms for future mechanistic and translational research on personalized exercise interventions for mental health.",

          "abstract": "Mental health research, psychiatric practice, and neuroscience have long oscillated between individual-centered and socially embedded paradigms. After the rise of social psychiatry in the mid-20th century, the field largely turned toward individualized, biological approaches. However, growing calls across neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychotherapy now signal a renewed focus on relational processes. Recent theoretical and empirical developments suggest that psychiatric disorders may be better understood as disorders of social interaction rather than isolated deficits. Concepts such as interpersonal misattunement, interaction-based phenotyping, and second-person neuropsychiatry offer promising alternatives to traditional observer-based models. Alongside these ideas, the emerging field of relational neuroscience, using methods such as hyperscanning, provides tools to explore the dynamics of reciprocal human interaction. Multi-person approaches also offer potential for advancing our understanding of psychotherapy and other relational settings by moving beyond isolated individuals to the dynamics of shared experience. By capturing meaningful interpersonal moments as they unfold, these approaches may offer insights into the neurobiology of relational change. We propose that a more comprehensive understanding of moments of genuine connection holds promise for advancing mental health research and support new forms of relationally attuned mental health systems.",

We then investigate whether two words that compose a single familiar compound word (e.g., bottle + neck) can nonetheless be processed in parallel. The results demonstrate that indeed, under the same conditions in which two unrelated words cannot be recognized simultaneously, accuracy for recognizing either or both of two words that form a compound exceeds the prediction of the serial model. This result complicates theories of a serial bottleneck in lexical access, especially in the context of natural reading when words often form meaning jointly.",

          "abstract": "Hierarchy is an important feature of efficient cognition, including learning and reasoning. In the hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, complex learning problems are decomposed into sub-components that lead to subgoals; subgoals can, in turn, be flexibly combined and used to solve a problem in the absence of immediate rewards. Subgoals are hypothesized to be reinforcing and thus support learning of useful sub-policies. However, little is known about how subgoals actually support learning, with different theories proposing different factors subgoals depend on to affect learning (such as novelty, bottleneck properties or external rewards). Here, we show that subgoals reinforce choices even when controlling for these other factors that are often associated with subgoals, and that people strategically search the space of possible subgoals. Additionally, we show that pseudo-reinforcing effects of subgoal events can transfer to an independent task in a subset of participants who explicitly identified these features as useful subgoals. This suggests individual differences in the recognition and application of subgoal structure, pointing to the possibility that distinct learning mechanisms may underlie goal abstraction and transfer. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of the role subgoals play in supporting learning within hierarchical representations.",

While such experiences may benefit research, concerns have been raised about potential biases and “excessive enthusiasm.” However, the prevalence of personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and their association with opinions about psychedelics remain underexplored.\n\nObjectives. This study aimed to investigate how common personal psychedelic experiences are among psychedelic researchers, their perceived relevance to research, and whether personal use is associated with opinions about psychedelics.\n\nMethods. Participants (N = 111) conducting psychedelic research in academic settings were recruited. Data were collected on personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and opinions about psychedelics. Regression analyses examined associations between personal use and opinions.\n\nResults. Most respondents (85%) reported personal experiences with classic psychedelics. On average, they saw personal experience as beneficial for research, but also as potential source of bias. They acknowledged the importance of self-reflection and the need to disclose personal experiences, but found disclosure challenging in practice. Personal use predicted more positive opinions about psychedelics’ potential to improve well-being, transform society, address the ecological crisis, and answer spiritual questions (regression βs = .3 – .5, ps &lt; .01).\n\nConclusions. The findings highlight the prevalence of personal psychedelic experiences among this sample of researchers and their influence on research interests and opinions.

This tendency is commonly examined through the lens of self-regulated learning, which emphasizes students as generally active and deliberate decision-makers who may lack either the knowledge of effective strategies or the motivational resources to apply them. In this paper, we aim to expand this perspective by investigating the role of non-deliberate, habitual behaviors in students’ use of learning strategies. Drawing on key principles of habit and habit formation, we argue that particularly ineffective learning strategies tend to develop strong habitual tendencies. An overreliance on them may therefore stem not only from a lack of strategy knowledge but also from their automatic activation in response to environmental cues. We support this claim by both theoretically demonstrating how ineffective learning strategy use aligns with habit characteristics and empirically presenting first evidence showing that ineffective strategies exhibit stronger habitual tendencies than effective ones. By framing learning strategy use within a habit-based framework, we aim to offer a novel perspective on students’ persistence with ineffective strategies and suggest new intervention pathways that emphasize behavior-change strategies to foster effective use of learning strategies.",

However, there remains a lack of accessible interventions targeting emotion regulation that have been proven to be effective for this population. Given the potential for digital health interventions (DHI) to meet this need, we here describe the prototyping phase of the development of a novel smartphone-based DHI targeting emotion regulation, specifically tailored for adolescents with ADHD. The DHI was developed drawing on intervention-mapping, behavioral intervention technology (BIT) and user-centred design principles. Its therapeutic content was informed by a review of the evidence, clinician input, and consultations with adolescents with ADHD. The current paper describes the motivation for, development process, and content of the prototype and sets out the framework that will be used for its further development and evaluation.",

In problem-gambling research, the concept of randomness was traditionally referred to as having a mathematical nature and categorized and approached as such. Randomness is not a mathematical concept, and I argue that its weak mathematical dimension is not decisive at all for the randomness-related issues in gambling and problem gambling, including the correction of the misconceptions and fallacies about probability and statistical concepts applied in gambling. I distinguish between mathematical and nonmathematical dimensions of randomness (the epistemic, the theoretical-methodological, the functional, and the ethical) falling within the general concept, and I argue that both the studies having as object the math-related cognitive distortions among gamblers and the educational programs aiming at correcting them should employ this distinction in their design and content.",

          "abstract": "Psychologists often take statistical hypothesis testing to be a procedure that detects whether effects do or do not exist; the output of this procedure can then be used to inform theories, which should predict the effects that do exist, and not those effects that do not. Call this the modular view of statistics: Statistics can do their job relatively separately from the theories that are being tested, just so long as the right effects are being tested.  The interface between statistics and science can be called the pragmatics of statistical inference. The modular view declares that interface is simple for hypothesis testing: It consists of science telling statistics what to test for; and statistics telling science whether it exists or not. One reason why there has been a credibility crisis may be that the modular view is dominant yet unhelpful. If statistics cannot in an atheoretical way declare what does and does not exist, then psychologists have not been genuinely testing their theories. In this chapter I reject the modular view. One might reject the whole concept of getting evidence of whether or not there is an effect; instead, I accept this aspect of current practice but argue one can only get evidence for a relevant effect being there or not given a theory of what size effect could be expected on that theory.",

However, validated instruments tailored to trainee contexts are currently lacking. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a new measure of PI in psychotherapy education settings. Results. In Study One, an initial version of the scale was developed and tested with 195 mental health professionals. Preliminary psychometric evaluation included expert review, cognitive interviews, exploratory factor analysis, and Mokken scale analysis. Rasch methodology was then applied to assess dimensionality, item independence, response category ordering, targeting, invariance, and reliability. In Study Two, a new sample (n = 337) was used to validate the revised instrument through Rasch analysis. Results supported a unidimensional, 7-item scale demonstrating good model fit, local independence, ordered thresholds, invariance, and acceptable reliability. Additional analyses suggested a small but statistically significant negative association between age and psychological inflexibility (rho = -0.18), while no consistent differences were found across gender or profession. Conclusion. The resulting instrument – the Karolinska Inner-Barriers Scale for Education (KIBS-Ed) – offers a psychometrically sound, context-specific tool for assessing psychological inflexibility in psychotherapy training. It supports empirical investigations of trainee processes and may inform future research on therapist development and education.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of predictive processing mechanisms in naturalistic visuomotor skill learning. We investigated whether the acquisition of an interceptive skill was characterised by encoding and using learned probabilistic associations. Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group and practiced intercepting bouncing balls in virtual reality across two sessions. Only the intervention group received probabilistic visual cues – specifically, ball and room colours – that signalled likely bounce trajectories, offering an opportunity to learn and exploit these associations. We assessed task performance (interception rate, return accuracy), anticipatory gaze behaviour (predictive fixations and gaze tracking), and pupillary responses to unexpected outcomes. Participants in the intervention group learned the cue-outcome contingencies and demonstrated more predictive gaze strategies, finer post-bounce tracking, and physiological surprisal responses to probabilistically unlikely bounce outcomes. These findings suggest that encoding probabilistic environmental cues is a key component of effective visuomotor control. The results offer novel evidence for the role of top-down prediction and contextual modulation in motor learning, with implications for training and expertise development in sport. More broadly, this work contributes to an alternate account of expertise as the capacity to encode and exploit environmental regularities through predictive mechanisms.",

Recently, the use of fingers in early mathematical instruction received increasing attention as a prominent example of embodied cognition. Accordingly, the present study aimed to develop and evaluate a finger-based intervention for early mathematical skills such as counting and magnitude understanding and basic arithmetic (involving 12 sessions of 30 minutes each) that systematically aligns with early mathematical development. In a pre-posttest intervention design, 33 5-to-6-year-old children received the finger-based mathematical intervention and were compared to children of a business-as-usual control group (n=37). Results indicated a significant medium-sized beneficial effect on early mathematical skills, whereas no significant improvements were observed for spatial working memory or general cognitive ability. This suggests that the intervention was both effective and specific to facilitating early mathematical competencies. Interestingly, actual finger use when doing basic arithmetic developed comparably, irrespective of whether children received or did not receive the finger-based intervention, while finger users consistently outperformed non-finger-users in early mathematical skills irrespective of group assignment. Taken together, these findings highlight finger-based strategies as a powerful and beneficial approach for fostering the development of early mathematical skills.",

We find partial support for hypotheses that the recently proposed approaches of \"bridging-based ranking\" and \"intelligence-based ranking\" promote consensus and belief accuracy, respectively.

However, there is limited evidence regarding whether embodied experiences, such as visual information, are activated during first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) processing. To address this gap, we investigated the activation of object shape information associated with lexical items in sentences among L1 and L2 Chinese speakers. Participants completed two tasks: a timed sentence-picture verification task (Experiment 1) and a self-paced version of the task (Experiment 2). In each trial, participants read a sentence and then judged whether a depicted object was mentioned in the sentence, with the object’s shape either matching or mismatching the sentence context. L1 speakers consistently responded faster in the shape-match condition across both timed and untimed tasks, indicating that visual information is activated during sentence comprehension. In contrast, L2 speakers did not exhibit this pattern, although their reaction times were influenced by their L2 proficiency. These findings suggest that embodied experiences are integral to L1 comprehension, whereas L2 speakers are less likely to simulate embodied information during L2 comprehension, potentially due to limited sensory-motor grounding during L2 acquisition.",

Liu, Li, Theeuwes, Wang (2022) presented evidence that even when WM is near capacity, LTM items could still be reported. They argue that retrieved LTM items can bypass WM. We investigated this further by introducing continuous reporting of retrieved information and WM contents to their paradigm. If retrieval bypasses WM, then there should be no impairment of report accuracy to either WM contents or LTM-retrieved information. In the first experiment, WM reports suffered when an LTM item was retrieved. In the second, we found that when WM was near capacity (4 items), the fidelity of LTM reports suffered compared to when WM was not (2 items or no items). Additionally, WM contents were reported with lower fidelity when an LTM item was retrieved compared to a WM-only condition, under both 2-item and 4-item WM load. We conclude that LTM retrieval does not bypass WM.",

          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

In a quasi-randomized controlled trial, NKR students were assigned to either a resilience-disclosure intervention (n = 75) or a control intervention (n = 68) condition. The resilience-disclosure intervention highlighted strengths associated with participants’ stigmatized NKR identity and encouraged intergroup contact, while the control intervention focused on general strategies for college success without addressing NKR identity. Results demonstrated that the intervention significantly buffered the decline of identity disclosure among participants with heightened concerns about identity-based rejection. These findings contribute to the literature on psychological interventions, intergroup relations, and the experiences of individuals with CSIs, offering practical strategies to address challenges faced by NKRs.\nKeywords: Concealable stigmatized identity, identity reframing, strength-based, intergroup contact, rejection sensitivity",

In our study, rats responded on alternatives that provided 50% or 100% reinforcement with half of the sessions reliably signalled and half un-signalled. Contrary to expectation, rats preferred the optimal alternative to a greater extent in the signalled sessions compared to the un-signalled sessions. Acute methamphetamine increased preference for the 50% alternative exclusively in signalled sessions. These results suggest that rats, unlike pigeons, are able to use the information provided by the stimulus correlated with non-reinforcement to shift preference away from the suboptimal alternative, and that the influence of methamphetamine on rats’ probabilistic choice is context dependent",

          "authors": "Ana Pinheiro",
          "abstract": "The voice is a powerful social signal and a primary channel for communicating emotions when speakers are out of view. When we hear an emotional voice, we quickly form an impression of the person behind it. Neurocognitive models emphasize the multi-step dynamic operations that occur when listeners decode emotional information from vocal sounds. However, these models have primarily focused on stimulus quality, often neglecting the perception of other relevant person characteristics (e.g., gender, age, personal identity) evolving on different timescales. \nHow do the emerging details about the speaker affect how listeners decode emotional information? And how are these different types of information integrated into a comprehensive impression of the speaker? This review examines recent data highlighting multiple stages of vocal expression analysis and the interplay between distinct types of nonverbal information revealed in the speaker’s voice. It serves as a starting point for broader research examining how distinct person characteristics, perceived simultaneously or in close succession, interact and affect the decoding of vocal emotions.",

          "abstract": "The global spread of health-related misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to understand the psychological mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to health-related misinformation. This study examined the impact of cognitive load and individual differences on susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation using a Signal Detection Theory framework. A sample of 634 university students evaluated true and false COVID-19 headlines under working memory load and no load conditions, while also completing standardized assessments of cognitive reflection, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism, and bullshit receptivity. Results showed that, although the working memory load manipulation successfully impaired recall and increased response time, it did not affect participants’ tendency to accept false information as true. In contrast, individual-difference variables robustly predicted misinformation susceptibility. Specifically, beliefs in pseudoscience, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism and bullshit receptivity showed moderate positive associations with false-alarm rates and negative associations with discrimination sensitivity. Cognitive reflection was negatively associated with false-alarm rates and positively with discrimination sensitivity. Only small associations were found between individual-difference dimensions and response bias. These findings suggest that stable cognitive and epistemic dispositions, rather than momentary cognitive constraints, play a more significant role in shaping people’s ability to distinguish between accurate and false health information.",

          "abstract": "Experimental manipulations in conflict tasks, e.g., the Stroop, Flanker, and Simon tasks, lead to systematically poorer performance in “incongruent” conditions that feature stimuli that contradict task goals. However, substantial recent debate surrounds whether individual differences in conflict task behavior reflect reliable, trait-like mechanistic processes. Much prior work uses difference scores, contrasting performance between incongruent and congruent trials to index conflict suppression ability, but recent work demonstrates these scores exhibit poor psychometric properties. Formal cognitive process models suggest that individual differences in conflict suppression are driven by task-general processes, as opposed to processes specialized for conflict. However, this prior work separately models cognitive process parameters and their covariation, which fails to adequately account for measurement error. Here, we model distinct mechanisms of conflict task performance and their covariance simultaneously using hierarchical Bayesian joint modeling methods for the first time which improves individual estimation and accounts for error. We fit the conflict linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA) to two large datasets containing multiple conflict tasks and test-retest sessions, and an additional large dataset containing a conflict task and simple perceptual decision-making task. First, within conflict tasks, we found moderate test-retest reliability for both conflict-specific processing mechanisms, and, to a larger degree, task-general mechanisms. Second, task-general, but not conflict-specific, mechanisms were correlated across different conflict tasks. Third, these task-general mechanisms were correlated between conflict tasks and a simple decision-making task without conflict suppression demands. Overall, we found robust individual differences in computational mechanisms underlying general decision-making, but not mechanisms specific to conflict processing.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

We hypothesized that making the racial components of inequality salient would, all else equal, decrease White Americans’ support for policies aimed at ensuring economic equality. However, we also hypothesized that providing context for racial inequality, by highlighting its structural causes, would increase White Americans’ support for policies aimed at ensuring economic equality. Though the individual study results were idiosyncratic, these hypotheses were supported in a meta-analysis across two experiments (N1 = 873; N2 = 756) that manipulated both the racial salience of inequality and the provision of structural context. The studies indicate that intergroup concerns among White Americans can impede efforts to address inequality, but contextualizing racial inequality as structurally-derived can help to overcome such obstacles.",

          "abstract": "Though the voluntary task switching paradigm asks participants to select their task and whether to switch on each trial internally, external bottom-up information from the stimulus affects task choice, such that participants were more likely to switch tasks on stimulus switches than stimulus repetitions (e.g., Mayr &amp; Bell, 2006). In previous research, both the perceptual elements and the identity of the stimulus changed on a stimulus switch, producing ambiguity as to which of the two changes drove the effect. By intermixing two stimulus types (words and Arabic numerals in Experiment 1; words and dot arrays in Experiment 2), we aimed to disentangle whether stimulus or identity repetitions drive stimulus-based switching. We produced lists with equal numbers of full stimulus repetitions (4 → 4) full stimulus switches (4 → one) and trials where the identity repeated but the stimulus changed (identity repetitions; 4 → four). We replicated the previous finding that participants were more likely to repeat the previous task on a full stimulus repetition than they were with a full stimulus switch. However, identity repetitions were not statistically different from full stimulus switches. These findings indicate that bottom-up perceptual information, rather than stimulus identity, may be what drives stimulus-based switching.",

A focused review of the literature, including discussions and recommendations of the Collaboratory, leads to a roadmap for integrating diversity in future resilience research that includes: i) developing trust and meaningful long-term relationships with communities historically excluded from research, ii) diversifying who is engaged in all aspects of the research process, iii) adapting life course perspectives, iv) improving and expanding research designs and measurement tools, and v) using sensitive computational analytics and mixed methods for testing complex, intersectional, models.

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

To test this, the current studies asked participants to compare simple (one-cause) and complex (two-cause explanations), while reporting their reliance on simplicity and probability information, and while inducing a goal to be either accurate or efficient in one’s explanation evaluations. Results showed that simplicity was typically used in combination with probability information, and that the use of simplicity increased when participants had an accuracy goal, suggesting it was used to try increase accuracy, rather than efficiency. This work provides greater insight into how simplicity is used to navigate the cognitive and informational limitations people face when comparing the probability of different explanations in everyday life.",

Mistaken shootings of unarmed Black suspects were more likely than of White suspects, but only when the suspects behaved non-antagonistically. Cognitive modeling showed this race effect arose not from an initial bias to shoot but from differences in evidence accumulation once the object was visible. Scenario and suspect behavior had the largest overall influence, shaping decisions by altering initial proclivity to shoot. Further analysis suggested that suspect behavior within specific scenarios may partially explain observed race effects. These findings provide a process-level account of deadly force decisions, integrating real-world complexity with psychological theory, and offer a framework for improving research and training around police use-of-force.",

As a first step in applying this approach, the current work examined a set of novel predictions based on viewing the Continuum Model of impression formation in light of this Bayesian approach. Specifically, a series of six studies tested whether occupation categories might be overused in general, or especially in conditions thought to reduce effortful processing (i.e., greater cognitive load or information consistency). At baseline, there was no consistent evidence of category overuse in any of these conditions, speaking against the idea that intrinsic differences in how these categories are processed or represented will lead to their overuse. In addition, this work provided the first direct evidence of a case where categories were overused: when contextual factors (i.e., background goals) made them the category especially relevant, while processing resources were limited. More broadly, the current work developed the theoretical and methodological foundations for identifying category overuse that stems from biased inference processes, and demonstrated the power of this approach for understanding when and why these biases occur.",

          "abstract": "Digital voice assistants (DVAs) provide information and support to users in a household across a wide variety of tasks. While they are part of a social system in the household, earlier research has largely ignored how DVAs impact this system. This study investigates how long-term DVA usage affects trust and roles of the users and their household. Using a multi-methods approach, we measured behavioural and self-reported trust, mapped the dynamic position of a DVA in the household, and the impact on the roles of household members over time across three experiments (combined n &gt; 250; all DVA owners). In Experiment 1 and 2, participants completed an Information Dilemma Task, ranking whom they would be more likely to approach from their household (including their DVA) for dilemmas across domains (entertainment, social, domestic, and knowledge). They rated how much they trust the agents’ responses (Experiment 1) or indicated their general trust of the agent (Experiment 2). Results showed that the DVA was predominantly approached and trusted in the knowledge, but not social domain regardless of DVA ownership duration. However, we observed a decrease in trust in the DVA over time. We also found that approaching behaviour of other roommates changed across ownership-time: a first indication of changing dynamics in the household with the presence of a DVA. In Experiment 3, we interviewed short- and long-term users of DVAs. This qualitative approach provided converging evidence that DVA-owners, although occasionally personifying the device, use and trust it mainly in a functional manner and not a social one, with a small indication of prolonged usage impacting the dynamics in the household. While task measures did not point directly at an objective impact of ownership time, the interview data suggested a subjective experience of ownership time. In sum, while DVAs are mainly used for utilitarian reasons, their effect on household dynamics suggests its potential of reshaping roles in the household in the future.",

          "abstract": "Scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) is thought to be driven by both local and global oscillations dependent on the cognitive state and task of the individual. However, many EEG studies assume that the activity is local, especially when inverse modeling EEG activity. In this work, we show that a simple model of purely macroscopic connections derived from biologically plausible distributions of long-range axon delays can drive many of the traditional features of scalp-recorded EEG dynamics. All that is required is a simple linear model of time delays in a linear vector autoregressive framework with a few parameters. We show how this simple connection model is derived from theoretical principles of synaptic activity. The model is able to replicate many features of real EEG data, including resting-state alpha power and coherence (8-13 Hz). We show that model parameters can also be informed by empirical work on structural connectivity, axon diameter estimation,  and functional connectivity of fMRI BOLD measures. However, some features of the macroscopic simulations are not ideal as a model for all features of resting EEG, such as high coherence in low-frequencies in the simulation as opposed to real data. Overall, the results support the explanation of many classical EEG findings in terms of macroscopic network behavior as opposed to local activity.",

          "abstract": "Building on evidence for experience-specific grounding of word meaning and assumed interindividual differences therein, this study investigates how specific aspects of empathy influence the processing and representation of abstract emotional words. We investigated single-trial N400 amplitudes as a measure of semantic retrieval in 78 healthy adults during a lexical decision task with emotion-label, emotion-laden, and neutral abstract words. We further measured the participants’ levels of empathic concern, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective taking. Additionally, ratings on valence, arousal, and emotional experience quantified the words’ emotional representational content. While direct comparison yielded no evidence for N400 differences between word types, N400 amplitudes in response to emotion-label words decreased with increasing fantasy scores, with this modulation being stronger than for emotion-laden and neutral words. Additionally, participants with higher fantasy rated emotional words higher in absolute valence. The observed N400 reductions thus seem to reflect fantasy-driven processing facilitation graded by the words’ emotionality level. In contrast, we found no evidence for N400 modulations by empathic concern, personal distress, or perspective taking while affective ratings on all scales increased with increasing empathic concern scores. Our findings suggest that fantasy facilitates especially emotion-label word processing and empathic concern enriches emotional word meaning representations, respectively, demonstrating interindividual differences in the experiential grounding of emotional abstract concepts.",

          "abstract": "In the presence of pain, performance during imposed workload motor tasks may be maintained at the cost of a higher perceived effort (PE). This study investigated how experimentally induced thermal pain and naturally occurring muscle pain influence force production during a fixed PE task. Forty young adults performed intermittent isometric handgrip contractions at light (13/100) or hard (50/100) PE intensities across two visits. Each visit included an experimental condition, featuring thermal pain in block 1, and a control condition, with non-painful warm stimulation in block 2. Participants completed 10 blocks (five repetitions of block 1 and block 2), with force production and muscle electromyography continuously recorded. Participants rated thermal and muscle pain after each block. Force production was higher during thermal pain compared to control, with no interaction with PE intensity. Regression analysis showed that each one-unit increase in muscle pain (0–100 scale) corresponded to a reduction in peak force (0.37N), mean force (0.25N), and force integral (0.80N·s). During a fixed perceived effort task, thermal pain prompts an increase in force production, possibly reflecting attentional mechanisms related to exercise-induced hypoalgesia. In contrast, muscle pain is associated with reduced force output, likely because more force would perpetuate more muscle pain. Therefore, the type of pain has a varied effect on force production during voluntary motor tasks. This study questions the well-accepted inhibitory effect of pain on force production and encourages future research to use fixed PE tasks to fully appraise the effects of different type of pain on force production.",

          "abstract": "The amount of cognitive effort that individuals are willing to expend on difficult tasks is influenced by their motivation to perform well. Given recent trends towards using naturalistic stimuli to study hearing and attention, the Engaging Stories for the Study of Attention and Audition (ESSAA) database was developed as a resource for researchers to select short works that are engaging for undergraduate student participants. To date, 1091 valid responses have been obtained from adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 (M = 19.3, SD = 1.5 years of age). However, the database is intended to grow over time. The present report describes results from the 24 stories for which at least 20 usable responses have been obtained. Participants read short written works that were selected from the public domain whose spoken durations were between 10 and 20 minutes, then completed a 10-item factual quiz, and Kuijpers’ Story World Absorption Scale. Finally, they listened to a 30 sec excerpt from the associated LibriVox audiobook and ranked their interest in the narrator’s reading style. The year of publication and category of the short work (fiction vs. nonfiction) significantly affected absorption, but these effects were weak. Absorption scores varied significantly between some works and accuracy on the factual quiz tended to correlate with absorption (rs = 0.40, p &lt; .001). Interest ratings for the narrators’ reading styles, by contrast, rarely differed significantly. These results suggest that, while the choice of story is important for designing an interesting study, the choice of narrator is less relevant. Our results also warrant caution in the use of factual quizzes to verify attention towards narrative stimuli that are not engaging.

          "authors": "Megan Nakamura; Kathryn Walters; Haoyun Zhang; Michele T Diaz",
          "abstract": "Fluent speech production remains largely preserved across adulthood, yet subtle disruptions such as filled pauses, repetitions, and revisions—become more common with age. These disfluencies may reflect underlying cognitive and neural changes that accompany aging, particularly in executive function (EF) and large-scale brain network organization. In this study, we examined whether EF and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) independently or jointly explained age-related differences in naturalistic speech disfluencies in an adult lifespan sample (n= 272, ages 20-81 years). We utilized RSFC to assess intrinsic patterns of brain organization, specifically, the degree of within-network, between-network, and segregation measures across three large-scale systems implicated in language and cognitive control: the Language network, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the Multiple Demand (MD) network. By capturing basal i.e., task-independent connectivity patterns, RSFC provides insight into how the neural architecture of functional networks impacts speech production and its vulnerabilities in aging. Our findings indicate that age was associated with increased disfluency rates, especially for filled pauses and revisions, as well as with lower EF, lower DMN segregation, and reduced connectivity between the Language and DMN networks. EF performance predicted filled pauses, while distinct RSFC patterns predicted revisions and unfilled pauses. Mediation analyses confirmed that EF partially mediated the relationship between age and filled pauses. Additionally, both DMN segregation and Language-to-DMN connectivity partially mediated the relationship between age and revision disfluencies, suggesting that changes in functional brain organization contribute to age-related increases in self-monitoring disruptions. These findings demonstrate that EF and RSFC account for dissociable mechanisms underlying age-related speech disfluency. While EF may support fluent planning, the structure and segregation of large-scale brain networks appear critical for maintaining internal monitoring during speech. This work highlights the utility of disaggregating disfluency types and utilizing cognitive and neural markers to better understand how age-related changes in spontaneous language production.",

          "abstract": "A common feature of contemporary sports-betting apps is ‘instant cash-out’, which allows users to settle a bet early in exchange for a discounted immediate payout. Despite high prevalence and links with gambling-related harm, relatively little is known about how personality traits associated with gambling, such as impulsivity, predict instant cash-out usage. To address this question, we recruited 145 general-population adult participants (69 men, 66 women, 10 non-binary or undisclosed; Mage = 36.3, SD = 10.7) to complete five self-report questionnaires related to impulsivity, as well as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and a validated cognitive task measuring individual differences in cash-out frequency. We then assessed how cash-out frequency in the behavioral task was associated with both self-reported impulsivity and PGSI. We found that cash-out frequency was negatively correlated both with PGSI scores and with a number of impulsivity-related traits including Dysfunctional Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, Positive Urgency, Sensation Seeking, and Fun Seeking. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that higher scores on a latent ‘Dysfunctional Impulsivity’ factor were negatively associated with cash-out frequency overall, whereas higher scores on an ‘Inhibition and Inflexibility’ factor predicted higher cash-out frequency specifically for bets with a low win probability. Taken together, results suggest that instant cash-out may primarily appeal to less impulsive people and those with lower PGSI scores. This raises the possibility that instant cash-out may specifically facilitate increased gambling behaviors among people with less prior experience of gambling.",

          "abstract": "Human evolution has traditionally been explained through linear models focused on natural selection and the gradual accumulation of biological and cultural changes. However, these approaches fail to capture the complexity, recurrent crises, and symbolic diversity characteristic of Homo sapiens. This article presents the Dynamics of Recurrent Fissions (DRF), a structural model that conceives human evolution as a continuous cycle of social, symbolic, and biological fissions and fusions driven by an exponential and cumulative need for energy. This energetic pressure, associated with brain expansion, technology, and culture, generates internal tensions that fragment groups, which later recombine, enabling innovation and new adaptive configurations. The hypothesis integrates paleogenomic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence to explain the emergence of social complexity, symbolic reorganizations, and cultural acceleration. Additionally, it provides a framework to interpret contemporary phenomena such as identity fragmentation and social polarization. The DRF model broadens the traditional evolutionary perspective by incorporating energy and symbolism as active and complementary forces shaping the unique trajectory of the human lineage.",

          "abstract": "In the visual search literature, an attentional template refers to a mental representation of target features stored in visual working memory. The dual-state model (Olivers et al., 2011) argues that visual working memory can only be focused on a single representation at a time, and therefore, we can only search for one target at a time. Consequently, to detect two potential targets, we must rapidly alternate our attention between the two corresponding representations. By contrast, the resource hypothesis (Huynh Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021) posits that we can simultaneously activate more than one representation for visual search, although this requires sharing the available resources. In three pre-registered experiments, we compared the predictions from the state-based model and the resource hypothesis in a combined search and memory task. The results suggest that participants allocate their resources based on the reliability of the retro-cue and therefore favor the resource hypothesis. In contrast, the results are less consistent with the state-based model, which predicts that the cost in terms of response time and accuracy should remain identical regardless of the retro-cue’s reliability.",

          "abstract": "Background: A central challenge in affective and cognitive science is to explain how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (mu) dynamically shape subjective experience. Although both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms of their interaction—and their role in individual differences in mood and cognition—remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes the coupling between G and mu. Bifurcation analysis of a potential function V(Ms) yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–mu plane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and mu through hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\nResults: Canonical cusp (saddle-node) and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts that correspond to psychological phenomena ranging from stable belief convergence to cognitive (attitude) polarization (bistability) and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G = 1, mu = 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics (SGBD) extension represents person-specific traits with structural matrices, capturing unique “gain fingerprints” and mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics through its integrated treatment of gain–bias coupling and its governing bifurcations. This provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for longitudinal self-report, experience-sampling, and neurophysiological studies. It thus offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, psychiatry, and human-centric AI.",

          "abstract": "How we recognise objects and people despite their physical appearance can change dramatically across encounters is a central yet unresolved question in vision science. In particular, the visual information that supports the human ability to recognize face identity across views is unknown. Past research suggests horizontally oriented face information plays a key role. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the orientation of the visual information physically available in the face stimulus to support view-tolerant face recognition and how human observers make use of it.\nHuman observers performed an old/new identity recognition task with face stimuli presented under different viewpoints, achieved by rotating the faces in yaw (from full-frontal to profile) and filtered to preserve contrast in selective orientation ranges. Human performance remained tuned to the horizontal range of face information irrespective of yaw. \nWe used a model observer approach to define the information physically available in the stimulus for matching face identity within a single viewpoint or across different viewpoints. The view-selective (within-view) model indicated that face identity is carried by orientation ranges shifting from horizontal in frontal views to vertical in profile views.  In contrast, the view-tolerant (across-views) model showed that the horizontal range provides the most stable identity cues across views. The horizontally-tuned orientation profile of human recognition performance was predicted by the high diagnosticity of horizontal information in frontal views and the stability of the horizontal identity cues across views.\nOur findings indicate that the invariant representation of a face, gradually learned through repeated exposure to its natural appearance statistics, relies primarily on horizontal facial information. By identifying the spatial information supporting view-tolerant face recognition in humans, the present work yields concrete, data-driven constraints for the refinement of visual recognition models.",

How do neural signals transform into subjective experience? Is meaning derived from language, or does language later serve as a means to encode prior meaning?\nThis paper proposes a new answer that transcends the traditional duality between matter and consciousness, and between language and meaning, by presenting an interpretive-neural model called: SRSN: The Symbolic Regulatory Semantic Network.\nWe propose that consciousness does not emerge all at once, but rather as a result of the accumulation of neuro-symbolic processes that organize experience in stages, beginning with raw predictive perception and culminating in self-narrative interpretation. Likewise, meaning is not a product of language; on the contrary, language is later used to encode internally produced meaning. The paper presents a functional-neural model of the self, free will, intentionality, and identity, as interpretive localizations resulting from a symbolic organization of experience.\nWhat is SRSN?\nSRSN is a distributed neuro-symbolic structure that performs a regulatory interpretive function, through which it produces:\n * Meaning as an internal symbolic representation\n * Consciousness as a perceptual-narrative superposition",

However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprising little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types will allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Identical paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will indicate homologous pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, long-distance priors and expectations suggest that the claustrum is involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops will enable a similar approach to explore these pathways’ participation in the integration of TD and BU signals as used in the cortico-cortical pathways. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

For younger children (grades 1-2), the Dyslexia Risk Scale (DRS) emerged as a robust predictor, highlighting its potential for early dyslexia risk identification. In older children (grades 3-8), developmental shifts emphasized fluency and automaticity, with OSP reaction times and AA accuracy becoming key predictors.\nEAST's findings align closely with traditional diagnostic methods, validating its utility in school settings. The inclusion of questionnaire-based and task-based measures, such as the DRS, strengthens its versatility as a screening tool. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and a small sample of formally diagnosed dyslexia cases, which necessitate further longitudinal and larger-scale studies.\nEAST demonstrates promise as a transformative tool in education, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for early literacy assessment. Its potential to democratize access to dyslexia screening and support improved literacy outcomes underscores its significance in advancing educational equity.",

          "abstract": "Human social preferences serve as oversight or training data to shape how Artificial Intelligence (AI) makes decisions, which occurs increasingly across decision-making domains, including social decisions that influence human to human interactions. Here, we test how algorithms with and without prescribed social preferences, shape social decision-making and explore delegating further decisions. In an incentivized online experiment (n = 1290), participants provided social preferences for outcomes favoring oneself or an anonymous other, Social Value Orientation (SVO), as input to a decision-making algorithm. We manipulated whether for each SVO money division question, participants saw no default options (representing providing training data) or proself/prosocial default options (representing oversight of algorithms with prescribed selfish/prosocial preferences). Default options were either from an algorithm or not. Results showed that participants’ social preferences were not significantly impacted by providing input to an algorithm without prescribed preferences (vs no defaults) nor by an algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences (vs the same defaults without an algorithm and vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences). Only providing input for an algorithm with prescribed proself preferences resulted in more selfish social preferences (vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences and vs the algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences). Moreover, counter to this, participants perceived being less influenced by proself than prosocial defaults. Most people delegated a second social decision-making task to the algorithm they were exposed to. These findings suggest that human oversight could be insufficient to address algorithmic biases, as individuals act more selfishly when exposed to pre-existing selfish tendencies in algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Experiment in a Box (XB), is a framework that supports sustainable health practices through guided, time-limited experiments. XB invites individuals to test and adapt simple health heuristics, such as movement or eating strategies, within their everyday lives. While our previous studies demonstrated XB’s positive impact on health behaviors, questions remained about how individuals establish heuristics in XB and how the experience fosters the development of interoceptive awareness, which supports the ability to judge whether actions are “healthy” or not by sensing and identifying bodily signals (e.g., finding fullness when eating). Using Theory Construction Methodology (TCM), we explored qualitative data from participant’s experiences during the Build Burn Better study series 2023, resulting in a prototheory of tuning. We offer tuning as a process through which individuals cultivate interoceptive awareness and use it, rather than external metrics, to guide experimentation and determine which actions support healthier physical, mental, and social states. If successful, this line of research will yield a formal, empirically validated model of tuning to inform the design of future digital health technologies. While still emerging, we propose tuning as a dynamic, person-centered, and potentially scalable process for guiding health behavior through felt experience at both individual and collective levels.",

          "abstract": "The global spread of health-related misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to understand the psychological mechanisms that make individuals susceptible to health-related misinformation. This study examined the impact of cognitive load and individual differences on susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation using a Signal Detection Theory framework. A sample of 634 university students evaluated true and false COVID-19 headlines under working memory load and no load conditions, while also completing standardized assessments of cognitive reflection, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism, and bullshit receptivity. Results showed that, although the working memory load manipulation successfully impaired recall and increased response time, it did not affect participants’ tendency to accept false information as true. In contrast, individual-difference variables robustly predicted misinformation susceptibility. Specifically, beliefs in pseudoscience, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism and bullshit receptivity showed moderate positive associations with false-alarm rates and negative associations with discrimination sensitivity. Cognitive reflection was negatively associated with false-alarm rates and positively with discrimination sensitivity. Only small associations were found between individual-difference dimensions and response bias. These findings suggest that stable cognitive and epistemic dispositions, rather than momentary cognitive constraints, play a more significant role in shaping people’s ability to distinguish between accurate and false health information.",

          "abstract": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for Large Models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called “empowerment” which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. “Empowerment” may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines.  If an agent learns an accurate causal world model they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive empirical features of children’s causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, design effective causal interventions and appropriately generalize to new contexts.",

This chapter analyzes how significance testing contributes to replication challenges through the lens of the TASI (Theoretical, Auxiliary, Statistical, Inferential) model. We examine three distinct contexts—inferential knowledge, region of acceptance testing, and statistical learning—to identify limitations in conventional significance testing and propose alternative frameworks. We argue that most problems with significance testing stem from researchers' tendencies to confirm rather than falsify hypotheses, regardless of statistical approach. We introduce REACT (Region of Acceptance Testing) as a stronger alternative to p-values, offering a structured decision-making process that integrates effect sizes and confidence intervals while explicitly recognizing when data is insufficient for definitive conclusions. Additionally, we propose Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) as a comprehensive statistical learning framework that transcends traditional hypothesis testing, focusing instead on descriptive, explanatory, and predictive modeling.

Recent work has shown that when we comprehend state-change events, multiple representations corresponding to different states of an object are simultaneously activated. As the sentence unfolds and the object is cued for retrieval, areas of the brain associated with representational conflict become more activated in proportion to how dissimilar the object-states are to each other. Before being retrieved, however, these object-states have to be actively maintained in the brain. What are the neural mechanisms by which we do so? Across two EEG experiments, we present evidence that, during sentence processing, the maintenance of multiple object-states in state-change events is supported by a neural signal that has been frequently linked to visual working memory: left temporal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling.",

To investigate how often social and personality psychologists make application claims in their published articles, we extracted and categorized application claims from 669 original empirical social and personality psychology articles published from 2010 to 2020 across sevens. Just over one quarter of articles contained at least one application claim, and 1 in 20 articles contained an application claim in the Abstract. We did not find a significant association between having an application claim, and articles’ i) citation count or ii) Altmetric score, however, we did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is no association.

          "abstract": "Do reasoned arguments increase charitable giving? Evidence is mixed. One possible explanation is that arguments vary in effectiveness. We crowdsourced 90 philosophical arguments in favor of charitable giving, coding them for a variety of features. In Study 1 (N=2161, MTurk), participants read either a control text or one of five arguments preselected as especially promising. Participants who read the philosophical arguments expressed more positive attitudes towards donating and donated about $1 more on average of a potential $10 bonus than participants who read the control text. Study 2 (N=8982, MTurk) employed all 90 arguments, with each participant reading one argument. We analyzed the relationship between the coded argument features and donation behavior, and found arguments to be more effective when they mentioned children, mentioned the specific impacts of donating, and/or emphasized that large benefits can be achieved at low cost. Among the features less predictive of donation: addressing counterarguments, mentioning the equivalence of persons or the participant’s own assumed good fortune, appealing to religion or expert authorities, or appealing to the participant’s self-interest. Together, these studies provide evidence that reasoned arguments can indeed shift moral behavior such as charitable giving, but that some arguments are simply more effective than others. Further, we identify specific argument features that are most and least effective in eliciting donations.",

          "authors": "Megan Nakamura; Eleonora Rossi; Michele T Diaz",
          "abstract": "A critical component of the language learning process is language control i.e., the management of lexical competition and interference from the existing language. However, how these mechanisms are engaged in early-stage learning remains unclear, particularly regarding individual differences in executive function––more specifically inhibitory control (IC), working memory (WM)––and prior bilingual experience. This study employed a pre/post short-term longitudinal design, where participants completed 10 days of Dutch language learning. Using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) and Time-Frequency Representations (TFRs), we examined neurophysiological signatures of novel word learning and the role of IC, WM, and bilingual experience. ERP results revealed N400 reductions at post-test, marking successful lexical integration. Greater Bilingual experience predicted greater N400 reductions for noncognates, suggesting more efficient integration. In contrast, stronger IC was linked to smaller N400 reductions for noncognates, indicating greater cognitive effort in managing lexical competition. TFR analyses showed increased theta power for cognates, suggesting enhanced memory encoding, while noncognates elicited greater alpha suppression, suggesting heightened inhibitory control demands. However, individual differences did not significantly modulate these effects, as neither bilingual experience nor IC predicted alpha or theta power at post-test, suggesting that the oscillatory dynamics supporting lexical learning were driven by task demands rather than individual variability. Together, these findings indicate that bilingual experience may facilitate lexical integration, whereas IC may play a critical role in managing interference during word retrieval. The results support models of adaptive language control and highlight the dynamic interplay between linguistic experience, executive function, and lexical competition in word learning.",

          "abstract": "Recent research suggests that self-control in everyday life is composed of different components (frequency, intensity, and successful resolution of self-control conflicts), and that individuals seem to differ in their abilities to resolve different types of self-control conflicts (initiation, persistence, inhibition). To date, however, it is unclear how established trait measures capture individual differences regarding these different components and types of self-control. We apply machine learning techniques to experience sampling data (N = 491; 9,634 measurement occasions) and identify which items from various trait scales best predict the different components and types of self-control in daily life. Commonly used trait items indexed all components to some extent, but most strongly successful conflict resolution. Contrary to our expectations, we were unable to predict the frequency, intensity, or successful resolution of inhibition conflicts, despite various trait measures being primarily developed for this conflict type. By comparing the most important predictors, we found meaningful theoretical differences between the components and types. We conclude that applying a broader conceptualization of self-control offers novel opportunities for exploring diverse routes to successful goal attainment and discuss theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for future research on trait self-control.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesises recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates including universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The book is accessibly written using over 50 figures/tables and an interactive tutorial with audio examples, with each chapter designed to be readable/teachable on its own. It is designed to be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

Neuromodulation of primary motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) alleviates neuropathic pain in some cases, though the mechanism remains unknown. Recent advances in functional MRI led to the identification of the Somato-Cognitive Action Network (SCAN) within the primary motor cortex, and Action Mode Network (AMN) represented in the dlPFC. Both networks are important for pain perception, suggesting the previously baffling analgesic effects of motor cortex stimulation were likely due to modulation of action-relevant pain signals in these newly recognized networks. Inter-individual differences in SCAN and AMN provide a plausible explanation for the varied effectiveness of current neuromodulation targeting methods for chronic pain. Our novel action feedback-loop pain-control model suggests that personalized, precision targeting of the AMN and SCAN will improve chronic pain management, paving the way for future neuromodulatory treatments.",

          "abstract": "A story transmitted through a chain of several individuals can become distorted, while information checked against multiple sources at various stages might be more accurate. Using a novel large-scale networked behavioural experiment, we demonstrate that redundancy of information presented by social networks is a demonstrable cause of higher fidelity and consensus of information. We show that even minimal structural redundancy can promote information fidelity and consensus formation in re-tellings of a long-form scientific text article transmitted through varying network structures. We find that transmission in multiple-pathway networks (i) reduces information loss as texts propagate between participants, and (ii) promotes consensus on information content between non-interacting participants in independently tested networks. A simple computational model, grounded in past social learning research, explains these effects and offers new insights into the mechanisms of multiple-pathway information transmission, contributing to the resolution of an outstanding puzzle in early social psychology research.",

          "authors": "Ryushin Iha",
          "abstract": "The current study examined three predictions: 1) overall, men will have a higher willingness to pay than women; 2) when the hypothetical partner is of the opposite sex, men will have a higher willingness to pay than women; 3) when the hypothetical partner is of the same sex, no difference in willingness to pay will be observed between men and women. A between-subjects online scenario experiment was conducted in which participants decided what percentage of the dinner bill they would pay when having dinner with a hypothetical opposite-sex or same-sex partner. All three predictions were confirmed. Furthermore, in the opposite-sex partner condition (relative to the same-sex partner condition), willingness to pay increased among men but decreased among women. Specifically, men in the opposite-sex partner condition preferred to pay more than 50%, but women in the opposite-sex partner condition preferred to pay less than 50%. These results deepen the understanding of sex differences by clarifying that willingness to pay varies depending on the sex of the partner.",

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, aka cumulative cultural evolution, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to engage in costly innovation, and whether to share the resultant knowledge with others. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing, and participants could use these reputations to select recipients of knowledge. We found strong priors for information sharing that persisted throughout the experiments in participants from both the UK and China. However, partner choice was generally too weak to explain the presence of widespread information sharing, which persisted even when we reduced the benefit of innovation, introduced exploitative bots, and removed reputations altogether. We suggest that our participants’ over-sharing of information may reflect a past trade-off between individual- and group-level selection, where weak partner choice balances the individual-level costs and group-level benefits of information sharing.",

Herein, we analyze artificial neural networks (ANNs): a) when used as scientific instruments of study; and b) when functioning as emergent arbiters of the zeitgeist in the cognitive, computational, and neural sciences. Building on our previous work with respect to analogizing between ANNs and cognition, brains, or behaviour (Guest &amp; Martin, 2023), we use metatheoretical analysis techniques (Guest, 2024), including formal logic, to characterise two distinct tendencies within connectionism that we dub classical and modern, with divergent properties, e.g. goals, mechanisms, scientific questions. We also demonstrate how we, as a field, often fail to follow important lines of argument to their end --- this results in a paradoxical praxis. By engaging more deeply with (meta)theory surrounding ANNs, our field can obviate the cycle of AI winters and summers, which need not be inevitable.",

          "abstract": "When encountering a novel word, adults and children as young as 12 months old often reason that it refers to a novel object rather than one with an existing name – making a ‘mutual exclusivity inference.’ We explored the mechanism of this inference, aiming to differentiate between three hypotheses: whether mutual exclusivity arises due to reasoning about a specific speaker’s knowledge, projection of one’s own egocentric knowledge, or reasoning generally about the conventionality of labels. Adults and 3.5-5-year-old children in our experiment heard a label being either taught or invented on the spot. They were then asked to decide what another label, produced by a speaker who was absent during the first label’s introduction, referred to. Our results revealed that adults and older children made more mutual exclusivity inferences when the first label was taught compared to when it was invented. Additionally, they were more likely to exclude the previously-labeled object in the referential choice if they judged that the speaker also knew the label, regardless of how the label was introduced. Both adults and older children also showed sensitivity to the speaker’s explicit statements of knowledge, excluding an object that the speaker explicitly stated that he did not know the name of from their referential choice. These results suggested that adults and older children reasoned about a specific speaker’s knowledge of labels in order to make mutual exclusivity inferences, likely in the form of a Gricean inference where they reasoned about possible alternative utterances a speaker could have said.",

          "authors": "Mohammed Ehsan Ullah Shareef",
          "abstract": "This study explores a surprising question: Why does society dislike primary psychopathic traits (fearlessness, charm, emotional detachment, manipulation) in theory but repeatedly rewards them in practice through high-stakes leadership (in business, politics, etc.)? Although these individuals can be emotionally detached and manipulative, they are also calm under pressure, charming, and bold—qualities that can help them succeed in high-stakes environments. The research shows that society may reject these traits in everyday life, but rewards them in leadership roles during times of crisis or competition. Examples include famous figures like Winston Churchill, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk, who used their confidence and emotional control to make bold decisions and drive innovation. These traits can make leaders appear heroic, especially in media and popular culture, which often portray such behaviors as signs of genius or strength. Although psychopathic leaders can create stressful work environments, they also produce big results—whether by saving companies, winning wars, or changing entire industries. The study argues that in uncertain and high-pressure situations, these controversial traits may actually help leaders succeed. In the end, while society may claim to dislike these traits, it often rewards them—because they work.",

Given the expansion of research related to compulsive sexual behavior and internet pornography use over recent years, as well as the expansion of research related to moral incongruence, the purpose of the present work is to provide a review of the topic of moral incongruence. \nRecent Findings:\n In service of the above aim, the present work traces the development of moral incongruence related research, describes how it has influenced research related to internet pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviors, considers critiques of moral incongruence, and discusses revisions to the model over time. Results generally find that moral incongruence is observable across cultures, that it replicates in numerous languages and countries, that it is uniquely related to religious beliefs, and that it may apply to behaviors beyond problematic pornography use alone.\nSummary: \n Moral Incongruence has proven to be an important and influential factor in appropriately understanding problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behavior more broadly, manifesting in both clinical settings and research studies. \nKeywords: Sex Addiction, Behavioral Addictions, Morality, Religion, Pornography",

          "abstract": "Polytomous item response data are typically classified as either nominal or ordinal, but this binary distinction may oversimplify their true structure. In this paper, we reframe the nominal–ordinal distinction as a continuum and introduce six empirical indices to quantify the degree of category ordering in item response data. Through extensive simulations with various IRT models and applications to 245 empirical datasets, we evaluate the indices' sensitivity, computational efficiency, and interpretability across diverse measurement contexts. Our findings show that two parametric indices—Mean Difference between Slope Parameters (Index 5) and Arctangent of Paired Category Ratios (Index 6)—are particularly robust and informative, even with low-frequency categories. These indices offer a practical tool for assessing whether and how item categories align with ordinal assumptions, supporting more accurate measurement and model selection. We conclude that treating ordering as a continuum, rather than a binary property, provides deeper insights for psychometric practice and strengthens the connection between empirical response patterns and their theoretical representations.",

However, which cues humans use to determine hierarchies is highly variable, includes behavioral as well as perceptual cues, and changes throughout development. To investigate the interplay between different cues, preschoolers and adults participated in a behavioral paradigm comparing the impact of helping behavior (behavioral cue) and body height (perceptual cue) on the attribution of authority. Results revealed a double dissociation: Children did not use helping behavior as an indicator but attributed more authority to taller individuals. In contrast, adults ascribed more authority to a person who refused to help, but did not consider body height. A helping person was generally judged as nicer, suggesting that both, children and adults, interpreted the depicted situations correctly. Hence, our results suggest that children and adults use different information to attribute authority.",

Contrary to prior studies, children with autism responded 189ms faster on average than typically developing children,  due to more overlapping speech. Latency decreased in both groups (47-78ms every 4 months) and depended on individual differences in socio-cognitive, linguistic, and motor skills, which for autism explained all variance by age. Both groups equally adapted their tempo to their interlocutors. With robust conceptualization and modeling techniques, we highlight the importance of overlapping speech, show that latencies in autism might be faster than in typical development and situate turn-taking into fine-grained developmental and interpersonal contexts.",

          "abstract": "Can metaphorical reasoning involving embodied experience—such as color perception—be learned from the statistics of language alone? Recent work finds that colorblind individuals robustly understand and reason abstractly about color, implying that color associations in everyday language might contribute to metaphorical understanding of color. However, it is unclear how much colorblind individuals’ understanding of color is driven by language versus their limited (but no less embodied) visual experience. A more direct test of whether language supports the acquisition of humans’ understanding of color is whether large language models (LLMs)—those trained purely on text with no visual experience—can nevertheless learn to generate consistent and coherent metaphorical responses about color. Here, we conduct pre-registered surveys that compare colorseeing adults, colorblind adults, and LLMs in how they (i) associate colors to words that lack established color associations and (ii) interpret conventional and novel color metaphors. Colorblind and colorseeing adults exhibited highly similar and replicable color associations with novel words and abstract concepts. Yet, while GPT (a popular LLM) also generated replicable color associations with impressive consistency, its associations departed considerably from colorseeing and colorblind participants. Moreover, GPT frequently failed to generate coherent responses about its own metaphorical color associations when asked to invert its color associations or explain novel color metaphors in context. Consistent with this view, painters who regularly work with color pigments were more likely than all other groups to understand novel color metaphors using embodied reasoning. Thus, embodied experience may play an important role in metaphorical reasoning about color and the generation of conceptual connections between embodied associations.",

Their study suggested that \npupillary constriction is more pronounced in response to bright stimuli in the left visual field\ncompared to the right, consistent with a neurotypical attentional bias towards the left side \n(pseudoneglect). This pupillometric bias was also found to correlate with performance on the \ngreyscales task, an established behavioural measure of pseudoneglect. The present study\nsought to replicate these findings, and investigated the influence of the eye of recording on \nthe pupillary constriction bias measured by this split-field method. There was a major \ninfluence of the eye of recording, whereby each pupil constricted more to light in the \nipsilateral than the contralateral visual field (d = 1.67). Averaging across the eyes, we \nconfirmed stronger pupillary constriction to bright stimuli in the left compared to the right \nvisual field (pseudoneglect), but with a small effect size (d = -0.31). While the split-field \nparadigm does detect pseudoneglect, it does not seem to be especially sensitive, and large \nsample sizes may be required to detect this subtle bias.

          "abstract": "People are increasingly concerned about climate change but under-engaged in climate action, especially collective action. Online interventions can support action planning and behavior change in contexts including pro-environmental behavior. However, psychological interventions have tended to focus on individual-level climate action, and we do not yet know how effective they are for collective actions. We tested whether action planning interventions based on mental contrasting with implementation intentions and episodic simulation could increase intentions to engage in individual (e.g., driving less) and collective (e.g., contacting elected officials about climate change) climate actions. Participants were randomly assigned to an individual action planning (IAP) intervention, a collective action planning (CAP) intervention, or a no-intervention control group, and rated intentions to engage in individual and collective pro-environmental behaviors after completing the intervention. Preregistered analyses  (on N = 1,586 participants) showed that compared to the control group, both action planning interventions increase targeted pro-environmental behaviors. Furthermore, these effects spilled over to other (non-targeted) pro-environmental behaviors, but spillover effects only occurred within action types (individual vs. collective). CAP also had greater overall effects on the perceived impact of actions, including individual actions. This study extends prior theorizing about the psychology of action planning to incorporate collective actions and provides practical insights to bridge the gap between climate concern and engagement in coordinated climate initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Introduction Person-centred approaches, such as classifying children as bullies, victims, and bully-victims, assume homogenous subgroups and are limited in capturing the nuanced relationships between different forms of bullying. The current study proposes network analysis, a variable-centred method, as an alternative approach to examining bullying involvement.\nMethods We used data from the São Paulo Project for the Social Development of Children and Adolescents (SP-PROSO), a representative cross-sectional survey of high school students aged 15 years in São Paulo, Brazil (N = 2,598; 48.0% female). The self-reported Zurich Brief Bullying Scales were used to measure social exclusion, property destruction, verbal and physical aggression, and sexual bullying. To identify unique item combinations categorised into bullying roles, we created an UpSet plot. We estimated a mixed graphical model using a regularised nodewise regression approach via the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion, and subsequently examined node predictability, clustering, centrality, and network stability.\nResults There was substantial heterogeneity in bullying roles, particularly for bully-victims. The network model revealed a relatively high density, with 33 out of 45 edges, and two distinct but deeply intertwined dimensions of bullying perpetration and victimisation, which were primarily linked by victimisation through physical aggression. Perpetration through verbal aggression was most strongly connected to individual bullying behaviours. Node predictability was modest, suggesting greater influence from factors outside the network. Verbal aggression showed higher predictability and could be reduced by targeting other forms of bullying, whereas physical aggression with lower predictability may be best addressed directly or by targeting external risk factors. \nConclusions The network approach represents an alternative approach to mapping the complexity of bullying, conceptualising bullying as mutually reinforcing behaviours. Researchers may want to integrate the network approach and leverage its decade of progress to uncover new insights into bullying involvement, leading to more effective prevention and treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "High infant behavioral inhibition (BI) increases risk for social difficulties and anxiety, suggesting long-term consequences for adult socioemotional development. Infant BI and social anxiety also affect error processing. Whether this association extends to social contexts remains unclear. In this prospective, 30-year longitudinal study, we investigated the long-term association between infant BI and self-reported social anxiety, and the association that infant BI and social anxiety show with adult brain and behavioral measures of social error processing. To examine the role of social observation in error processing, participants performed a social flanker task during magnetic resonance imaging. We expected pregenual anterior cingulate activity to be associated with social error processing in participants who scored high on social anxiety and infant temperament. The final sample included data from 24 participants (50% male, mean age 29.50 years). Infant BI was not related to self-reported adult social anxiety scores. We found an interaction effect of temperament and social anxiety on activity in the middle cingulate cortex, temporal and precentral gyrus. Also, we found a main effect of social vs. alone condition on activity in middle cingulate cortex. For all regions, activity was stronger during the processing of correct vs. error trials in the social condition. Contrary to our hypotheses, the findings were in white matter, as the observed activity disappeared after applying a grey matter mask. These preliminary results might suggest that the brain devotes more performance monitoring processing to facilitate better performance during social observation. While preliminary, these findings raise the possibility that early temperamental traits may shape neural sensitivity to social performance contexts in adulthood, particularly in the presence of social anxiety. Future research integrating clinical, self-report, behavioral, and neuroimaging data will be essential for building a more comprehensive understanding of social error processing across development.",

          "authors": "Brian T Keller",
          "abstract": "Interaction effects are common in the behavioral sciences, especially in psychology, as they help explore how various factors influence human behavior. This paper introduces a factored regression framework designed to estimate latent variable interactions and nonlinear effects, providing a flexible approach for modeling complex data structures, accommodating diverse data types, and handling missing data on any variable. The factored regression framework also allows graphical diagnostics to probe interactions effectively. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to compare the performance of factored regression with existing maximum likelihood methods, such as latent moderated structural equations and product indicators. Results indicate that factored regression performs comparably to, if not better than, these traditional methods. The factored regression framework is implemented in Blimp software, offering an accessible and user-friendly syntax for specifying the models. Through practical examples and syntax excerpts, this article demonstrates the application of factored regression for estimating latent interactions, making it more approachable for a wide audience in behavioral research.",

          "abstract": "To ensure all children can fulfil their potential, it is essential to explore factors contributing to poverty-related achievement gaps. Executive function (EF) skills, foundational to learning, have been shown to mediate the link between socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance. However, few studies explore this in the South African context. The current study investigates the extent to which EF skills explain gaps in academic outcomes between socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged South African preschool children. The national Thrive by Five Index 2021 dataset was used, including 5,222 children enrolled in preschools categorised by quintile as an indication of SES. Children were assessed on the ELOM 4&amp;5, standardised for South Africa, and measures development in five domains including Numeracy and Mathematics (ENM) and Cognition and Executive Functioning (CEF) skills. Bivariate correlations showed that SES was significantly associated with CEF and ENM, and CEF and ENM were highly correlated. Hierarchical regression showed that while SES predicted ENM scores, including CEF improved model at 32% of the variance. Multilevel mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of SES on ENM via CEF, with a non-significant direct effect. These findings suggest that the benefits of attending a more resourced preschool on numeracy are explained by improved EF skills, supporting EF-targeted interventions to reduce educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "Experiment-based calibration is an emerging approach for measurement validation. It allows comparing multiple measurement methods against each other by how well they reproduce a known experimental effect, which is informative about measurement accuracy. Calibration entails statistical questions unparal- leled in classical validation approaches. The first question is about inference: when should we conclude that one measurement method is truly more accurate than another? The second is about decisions: when should we decide that a method merits the investment of changing a measurement system? In this note, we review the particular challenges that arise in the context of a calibration process: a potentially large and a priori unknown number of measurement methods, a requirement to integrate evidence across multiple calibration samples, and a possibility that some methods are not available for all samples. We show that Bayesian meta-analytic model comparison is a suitable framework for inference in calibration, and propose a decision-theoretic approach to calculate immediate economic gain garnered through reduced sample sizes. In order to overcome the practical hurdles associated with the analysis of calibration experiments, we furnish calibr, an R package for calibration inference.",

          "abstract": "Avoidance behaviour is fundamental for survival but can become maladaptive in clinical conditions. A large literature has accumulated on the dynamics of human avoidance learning, but current theories do not provide an exhaustive account of the evidence. In this systematic review, we identify N = 116 studies on human avoidance learning. We analyse them with the goal of establishing empirical phenomena to include in theory-building, and examine their diagnostic value in differentiating between competing theories. We find that the evidence consistently contradicts theories based on associative learning, and favours inference-based accounts. Existing theories within this framework, however, do not predict several of the identified phenomena, calling for further theoretical development. Methodologically, we observe that the problem setting in the most common experimental paradigms is structurally less complex than real-world settings, and unlikely to expose the limitations of inference-based mechanisms. In consequence, we argue that paradigms with larger computational demands and a wider range of action options are required to expose the mechanisms underlying avoidance learning. Collectively, these insights provide a foundation for theory development and methodological innovation, with significant implications for advancing clinical interventions aimed at maladaptive avoidance behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Despite robust evidence linking minority stress to mental and physical health disparities in LGB populations, most studies have relied on correlational data and self-report measures. The present study introduces a novel experimental paradigm combining neuroimaging (fNIRS), questionnaires, and ecologically valid auditory stimuli to investigate the impact of minority stress on neural activity and mood. This paradigm extends prior research on the \"Cardiovascular Conundrum\"— a paradoxical autonomic profile observed in minority groups—by examining its neurofunctional counterpart, the emotional suppression. Participants (LGB and matched heterosexual controls) were exposed to stigma-related, stressful, and positive audio clips under two conditions: emotion suppression and natural response. Brain activation was measured across prefrontal and parietal regions, while self-reported affect and standardized psychometric instruments assessed psychological traits and past discriminatory experience. Emphasis was placed on the mediating role of emotion suppression, a known coping strategy associated with adverse outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to combine experimental induction of minority stress, emotion regulation manipulation, and neurofunctional recording in real time. By addressing current methodological gaps, this paradigm offers a temporally precise and ecologically valid approach to investigating how stigma impacts brain function and affective regulation in minority populations.",

One of the main challenges in longitudinal research is to control for all relevant (un)observed confounders to generate unbiased estimates of causal contact-attitude effects. The commonly used cross-lagged panel model has been criticized for insufficiently accounting for unobserved confounders, and improved statistical models have been proposed, including the full-forward and random-intercept cross-lagged panel model. To explore the extent of potential bias between the different models, we investigated the robustness of longitudinal contact-attitude effects in a systematic re-analysis using 31 datasets from 21 published studies (N = 33,348). We found substantial discrepancies showing notably smaller, non-significant longitudinal contact-attitude effects in models with increased control for unobserved confounders.

Recent studies have shown that estimation of a vehicle's arrival time (i.e., time-to-collision (TTC) estimation) is affected by the intensity of the vehicle’s sound. When presented with the same actual TTC, louder sound sources were perceived as arriving earlier than quieter sources (the so-called “intensity-arrival effect”). However, in these experiments the vehicle source intensity was varied from trial to trial, potentially directing participants’ attention to the intensity variation. Here, we used high fidelity acoustic simulations of approaching vehicles, to investigate whether the effect of source intensity on auditory TTC estimation persists when the source intensity is varied from block to block rather than from trial to trial. Results showed a significant intensity-arrival effect for the blockwise intensity variation. However, this effect was much weaker compared to a condition where the vehicle source intensity varied from trial to trial.",

In two cross-sectional studies (Ntotal = 600), we investigated perceived past, present, and future wealth inequality in Italy, as well as accuracy in ranking EU countries by perceived wealth inequality. Confirming past literature, participants underestimated present levels of national wealth inequality. Results also showed the existence of a decline model in estimations of wealth inequality (i.e., optimism towards past, pessimism towards future), such that participants consistently expected an increase of future inequality (roughly corresponding to actual trends). Interestingly, participants were relatively accurate in ordering European countries, including Italy, with respect to levels of wealth inequality. We interpret these findings as reflecting a rational mechanism, where participants linearly project how wealth inequality grows (or declines) over time, and then plot their estimates for specific points in time on such linear projection. We therefore suggest that such schema prompt relative (rather than absolute) evaluations of wealth inequality, which leads to increased accuracy. We conclude that future interventions should accommodate people’s mental reconstruction of inequality.",

          "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition involving widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Evidence-based interventions for fibromyalgia, such as education and exercise, often require prolonged, cognitive and/or physical effort, involving immediate costs (effort) for delayed benefits (improved pain/function). Initiation of, and adherence to, these interventions is often difficult. While assumed to reflect low motivation, these difficulties may reflect pain-related alterations in an individual’s attitudes towards effortful and delayed rewards. Here we explored whether individuals with fibromyalgia differed from age- and sex-matched pain-free controls in such attitudes. In Study 1, individuals with fibromyalgia (N=19) and controls (N=19) completed tasks offering real rewards (raffle tickets) for performing actual physical or cognitive effort or enduring real delays. Despite individualising task difficulty to each participant’s unique capacity, those with fibromyalgia required higher incentives to engage in the physical effort task (treadmill walking), especially at higher effort intensities, but showed no differences in the cognitive effort task, indicating no general motivation deficit but rather a shift in attitudes toward physical exertion. Additionally, participants with fibromyalgia showed a greater willingness to wait for rewards, particularly at lower reward levels, suggesting an increased motivation driven by rewards. Study 2, conducted online (N=43 fibromyalgia, N=139 controls), replicated these findings, reinforcing that fibromyalgia does not involve a broad motivational deficit based on reward magnitude. Instead, we found specific changes in physical effort discounting and indications of heightened sensitivity to rewards in delay discounting. These insights may help inform tailored intervention strategies for individuals with fibromyalgia.",

Do higher-order forms of the two abilities rely on analogous recursive embedding and thus progress in parallel and coordinated ways? We addressed these questions in four studies with 3- to 9-year-old children (N = 395). ToM was operationalized as first-, second-, and third-order false belief understanding. MTT was operationalized as reasoning about future possibilities (first-order), counterfactual reasoning (second-order) and anticipating counterfactual emotions (third-order). Study 1 shows a stepwise development of both ToM and MTT and a moderate consistency of performance patterns. However, across all four studies, we did not find robust correlations between first-, second- and third-order tasks of ToM and MTT, respectively. Overall, these results show stepwise and parallel trajectories in ToM and MTT, but do not provide stringent evidence for a joint cognitive foundation of the two capacities.",

This study investigates the role of the experience of IP among 397 tertiary-level FL learners of English, possible effects of demographic and language use variables, as well as the extent to which IP affects students’ foreign language enjoyment (FLE), their foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA), and engagement with FL learning. Statistical analyses of data gathered with a web survey revealed that younger, female participants were more likely to experience IP, as were those who perceived their standing in the group of learners as below average. Additionally, latent modeling indicated that IP was linked to both FLCA and FLE and it predicted the performance engagement of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Overall, this study provides evidence as to the presence of IP in EFL classrooms and makes a case for the variable to be included in further studies of the nomological network of individual differences variables.",

Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag",
          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade it has become clear that replicability of empirical psychological research\nshould be better. Open science practices aim to enhance the transparency of research\nthereby both enabling others to reproduce the results presented in a paper and increasing\nthe replicability of these results using new data. Examples of these practices include\npreregistration, publication of data and analyses, open access publications, and replication\nresearch.\nAlthough open science practices are gaining traction, they have rarely been placed in\na broader epistemological context. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the\nopen empirical cycle. It draws upon De Groot’s empirical cycle, a model of cumulative\nknowledge generation via scientific research. The open empirical cycle is a pragmatic guide\nfor researchers that includes and links to open science practices. Adhering to the open\nempirical cycle, if only partly, will structure the scientific workflow and create awareness of\nthe adverse consequences of deviations. Following the open empirical cycle increases the\ntransparency, quality, trustworthiness, and replicability of research.\nThe open empirical cycle presented in this paper focusses on hypothesis evaluation\nusing quantitative data in psychology. However, it can straightforwardly be applied to\nhypothesis evaluation in other social and behavioral sciences and biomedical sciences. It\nbrings together ideas from de Groot’s empirical cycle, traditional, and open research steps,\nkey references, and open science tools, thereby providing a pragmatic, contemporary, and\nstructured approach to hypothesis evaluation.",

Our descriptive analyses finds that (i) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (ii) most measures are used very few times, and (iii) there is no trend towards consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend towards even greater fragmentation over time. That is, constructs and measures are proliferating.

The combination of homeostatic signals from individual cells creates a subjective and differentiated evaluation of the state of a multicellular organism as primary emotions.

Thus, consciousness arose as a function of intercellular communication, and it attained its subjective form by integrating a multicellular organism into a single subject.",

Four themes were constructed: (1) Barriers to Service Access and Provision; (2) Facilitators to Service Access and Provision; (3) Fit of a Systems Navigator; and (4) Identified Support Needs. The discussions highlighted the value of a systems navigator who connects families to services for mental health and other chronic stressors. Providers emphasized that navigators should undergo adequate training and foster positive relationships with diverse community agencies to be able to effectively connect families to services. A systems navigator who offers online and in-person services depending on the family’s needs was also preferred to mitigate barriers to accessing support.

          "abstract": "How can one bring wisdom into STEM education? One popular position holds that wise judgment follows from teaching morals and ethics in STEM. However, wisdom scholars debate the causal role of morality and whether cultivating a moral blueprint is a necessary condition for wisdom. Some philosophers and education scientists champion this view, whereas social psychologists and cognitive scientists argue that moral features like prosocial behavior are reinforcing factors or outcomes of wise judgment rather than pre-requisites. This debate matters particularly for science and technology, where wisdom-demanding decisions typically involve incommensurable values and radical uncertainty. Here, we evaluate these competing positions through four lines of evidence. First, empirical research shows that heightened moralization aligns with foolish rejection of scientific claims, political polarization, and value extremism. Second, economic scholarship on folk theorems demonstrates that wisdom-related metacognition—perspective-integration, context-sensitivity, and balancing long- and short-term goals—can give rise to prosocial behavior without an apriori moral blueprint. Third, in real life moral values often compete, making metacognition indispensable to balance competing interests for the common good. Fourth, numerous scientific domains require wisdom yet operate beyond moral considerations. We address potential objections about immoral and Machiavellian applications of blueprint-free wisdom accounts. Finally, we explore implications for giftedness: what exceptional wisdom looks like in STEM context, and how to train it. Our analysis suggests that STEM wisdom emerges not from prescribed moral codes but from metacognitive skills that enable navigation of complexity and uncertainty.",

We measured looking behavior in 91 14- to 24-month-old infants, enabled by automatic gaze annotation and online data collection. Using a vision-language model to quantify target-distractor image and text similarity, we find that infants’ looking behavior is shaped by the high-level visual similarity of competitors: infants’ looking to the target image was inversely correlated with image similarity but not with visual saliency.

          "abstract": "Discourse comprehension requires simultaneous integration of local and global constituents. When hearing a narrative, for example, listeners must link the meaning of each incoming word to the preceding word (local context) while also assimilating its meaning into the broader gist of a story (global context). Thus, the brain simultaneously constructs meaning at different time scales and with different levels of granularity. Our understanding of the brain’s division of labor in processing local vs. global semantic distance relationships is limited. In this study we ask specifically how the semantic distance between a word and its prior context drives activity in the brain during naturalistic listening. We used fMRI data collected while participants (n = 79) listened to a podcast interview. Using a novel method for estimating semantic distance between a word and prior contexts computed at multiple grain sizes, we conducted an amplitude-modulated regression to identify brain regions that were sensitive to semantic distance estimates. Results show that semantic distance drives activation in a broad frontotemporal network including the left and right superior and middle temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the bilateral cerebellum. The right anterior superior temporal gyrus was particularly sensitive to the increase in context window size, consistent with a right hemisphere specialization for gist processing, and a role for the anterior temporal lobe in semantic integration. This study demonstrates a promising method for investigating neural sensitivity to semantic movement in naturalistic language.",

Most findings, however, rely on cross-sectional lab-administered measures of cognition or longitudinal average scores that collapse the time-ordered effects of practice. The present study leveraged a measurement burst dataset to examine distinct features of cognitive performance (i.e., peak performance, change in peak performance, intraindividual variability, forgetting, retest-related gains), and explored whether individual differences in these features can be predicted by age acceleration and chronological age.  \nResearch Design and Methods: In a sample of 139 adults aged 25-65, estimates of baseline age acceleration were derived from DNA methylation (Horvath1, Horvath2, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE). Across four annual high-frequency assessment bursts, processing speed was assessed via a Symbol Search task and working memory was evaluated via a N-Back task.\nResults: Using Bayesian Double Exponential Models (BDEMs) separately testing different DNA methylation age acceleration as predictors of cognitive performance indices, we found in both tasks that baseline peak performance was lower for individuals with greater age acceleration and those who were chronologically older. Individuals with greater age acceleration showed greater retest-related gains within and across bursts. Neither age acceleration or chronological age predicted differences in longitudinal change. Interestingly, individuals with greater age acceleration and older chronological age showed more intraindividual variability in symbol search performance. Finally, greater chronological age (but not age acceleration) was linked with more forgetting between bursts in both tasks.\nDiscussion and Implications: Rather than relying on level, these findings underscore the value of multidimensional indices of cognitive performance. Importantly, even in a sample spanning young adulthood through early old age, such indices may provide more information regarding the nature of longitudinal patterns in cognition associated with chronological or biological aging.",

We find evidence that before learning, gaze is more exploratory (i.e., shorter, more frequent fixations). Moreover, we find that differences in fixated content across participants are increased after learning about an object, suggesting that knowledge states may contribute to differences in gaze behavior.

Statistical learning (SL), the unconscious processes to detect and extract regularities from the environment, is a fundamental building block for language development. Understanding how SL changes developmentally can clarify whether children are better equipped than adults to learn linguistic regularities. In two experiments, we directly compared behavioral and neural activation during auditory linguistic (Syllable) SL between children and adults, with nonlinguistic (Tone) SL as a control task. In each task, participants were exposed to streams of structured stimuli that contained four embedded triplets while performing a target-detection task. Real-time SL was measured by the acceleration in reaction times and by the differences in brain activation between structured and random streams of auditory stimuli. Children showed a surprisingly faster learning rate than adults only in Syllable but not in Tone SL. Children also exhibited greater short-term functional plasticity during Syllable SL in the language network, defined using a separate naturalistic story listening task, compared to adults, as evidenced by a stronger and earlier neural sensitivity to sequential structures. Faster linguistic SL was further associated with greater neural sensitivity to linguistic patterns in children’s, but not in adults’, language network. These findings together suggested that children’s developing language network may be more equipped to detect and encode linguistic regularities, allowing for quicker acquisition of new language patterns compared to adults.",

We demonstrate the nesting structure of three models specified in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework: a reflective Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a formative Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA) and a formative Pseudo-Indicator Model (PIM). Unlike CFA, CCA and PIM allow for the specification of composites in the SEM framework. In this paper, we establish both theoretically and empirically that these three models are nested within one another, as long as the structural part of each model is saturated. As such, the three models can be compared via a chi-square difference test and other fit indices developed for nested models. We report on the results of a small simulation to evaluate whether the chi-square difference test and an RMSEA based on it RMSEA_D, can reliably discern whether data were sampled from a CFA or a formative measurement model, varying sample size, indicator weights, and the strength of the correlation with another construct. In two empirical examples, we illustrate how tools for nested model comparison can be used to distinguish among reflective and formative measurement models.",

          "abstract": "Enhanced memory for salient events can be driven by affective responses and by surprising outcomes. Recent work has suggested that deviations in expected feelings can influence decision making alongside a traditional learning signal, the reward prediction error. Whether a dynamic measure of “affective surprise” may serve as a learning signal that modulates the formation of lasting memories remains unclear. This study investigated how affective surprise elicited by dynamic changes in affective states influences long-term episodic memory. We introduce a novel computation for affective surprise informed by literature on prediction error-driven learning and derived from individual participants’ continuous affect ratings of valence and arousal. We first reanalyzed a published dataset and then conducted an independent replication study in which participants encoded item sequences while listening to emotional music. Participants then re-listened to the music while providing continuous ratings of their felt emotions. We assessed how affective surprise influenced different aspects of episodic memory after 24 hours. We found that greater affective surprise at a given moment, or larger deviations from the recent history of ratings, enhanced memory for when an item occurred in a sequence. In contrast, we found inconsistent effects of affective surprise on item recognition memory across the two studies. Together, these findings suggest that affective surprise, regardless of direction, enhances the binding of items to their temporal contexts in memory. This work demonstrates that affective surprise, in particular valence-related surprise, might act as a learning signal with consequences for episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Little research has examined the relations of the LLAMA subtests beyond predictive correlations and simple regressions. In this secondary analysis of data from Bokander (2020), we use regression commonality analyses (RCA) to address multicollinearity by decomposing the LLAMA predictive variance into unique components for each subtest alone and for each possible subtest combination. Fifty-five students with Germanic L1 backgrounds completed the LLAMA, followed by an introductory Swedish course, and then a written C-test. LLAMA-D, sound-sequence recognition, was the most important unique predictor of L2 achievement. LLAMA-E (sound-symbol association) unique variance and shared variance with LLAMA-D and LLAMA-B (vocabulary learning) was the next most important contributor to prediction. Similar to results for MLAT, these results demonstrate the major role of phonetic script/sound-symbol relationship skills both uniquely and shared with other subtests. The most important difference is the equally important, distinct role of speech sound-sequence recognition, a skill not previously included in aptitude tests prior to the LLAMA.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of regression commonality analysis, which appears to have considerable usefulness for studies involving prediction.",

Further, we extracted 2023 data from Project Implicit and the Human Rights Campaign to create factors of structural stigma at the county and state levels.

          "abstract": "While invasive brain stimulation of subcortical structures improves motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD), its effects on speech and language impairments in PD remain inconsistent. Accumulating evidence supports the application of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to enhance both motor and non-motor functions in the disorder. We conducted a sham-controlled, multisite 4 Hz HD-tACS over the left frontal aslant tract (FAT) in 17 non-demented patients. Following stimulation, EEG data were recorded while participants performed action fluency (AF), phonemic fluency (PF), and semantic fluency (SF) tasks. Patients generated significantly fewer items in AF compared to PF and SF, regardless of stimulation, suggesting a relative decline in action word retrieval in PD. Relative to sham, the power of prefrontal theta activity significantly increased following actual stimulation for AF; this effect was not observed for PF and SF. Moreover, AF elicited a significant increase in prefrontal theta activity relative to PF and SF following actual stimulation but not sham stimulation. Based on these findings, we propose that stimulation of the left FAT in PD modulates oscillatory markers of word retrieval for motion-related words (i.e., action fluency). This selective modulation of prefrontal theta activity does not indicate a general improvement in cognitive control but rather suggests that stimulation specifically enhances the executive control required for action word retrieval in PD. These results suggest that 4 Hz stimulation of the FAT may serve as a non-invasive protocol to improve action semantics, which is typically compromised in PD.",

          "abstract": "The perception of the external world relies on integrating information from multiple sensory modalities. To do this effectively, the brain must determine whether sensory signals come from a common source and, if so, combine them to reduce perceptual uncertainty. While Bayesian observer models have been successful in accounting for multisensory causal inference decisions by humans, they typically rely on simplifying assumptions that may not reflect the true complexity of human perception. In this study, we challenge two  assumptions common in Bayesian multisensory perception models: homoskedastic (constant across space) sensory noise and Gaussian priors. We collected an auditory-visual perceptual dataset featuring both unisensory and bisensory tasks, where participants must either provide stimulus location estimates or same-different source judgments. Subsequently, we developed a flexible semiparametric approach that allowed us to infer the sensory noise and prior shapes from participants' data, and subsequently `distill' them into new model classes through visual inspection of the semiparametrically fitted function shapes. We find that human multisensory perception is best described by an eccentricity-dependent sensory noise that plateaus in the periphery and a prior distribution with a narrow central peak and smoother tails. \nWe also found evidence for auditory range recalibration and increased sensory noise in multisensory conditions, suggesting complex interactions between sensory modalities. These findings deviate substantially from traditional modeling assumptions and highlight the value of making Bayesian cognitive models more data-driven. Overall, our study demonstrates the value of systematically exploring model assumptions in multisensory research and provides a new set of modeling tools for perceptual causal inference.",

In this paper, we formally develop and experimentally test a normative account of the repulsion effect. Our theory is based on the idea that the true values of options are uncertain and must be inferred from available information, which includes the properties of other options. A low-value decoy can signal that the target also has low value when both are believed to be generated by a similar process. We formalize this logic using a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model that makes predictions about how the strength of the repulsion effect should vary with statistical properties of the decision problem. This theory can help account for several documented phenomena linked to the repulsion effect, as well as results from new lab experiments. Our results illuminate key drivers of context dependence across both economic and perceptual judgment and sharpen our understanding of when decoys can be detrimental.",

VF is an integral component of neuropsychological assessment in clinical settings to diagnose neurological conditions. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NiBS) techniques have shown potential modulatory effects on neural substrates of VF, though findings have been mixed. \nObjectives: This meta-analysis aimed to consolidate the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of various NiBS on VF in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD), focusing on the target, modality, and fluency types (i.e., semantic or phonemic VF). \nMethod: A total of 1126 studies were retrieved from academic databases comprising PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library. After comprehensive screening of 626 studies involving PD participants who underwent one form of NiBS, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS), 7 RCTs with 105 PD patients (mean age: 66.40 ± 8.03) met inclusion criteria and were included in our final analysis. \nResults: tDCS applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) yielded the most consistent improvements in both semantic and phonemic VF. rTMS and tRNS showed minimal and null effects. Phonemic VF showed immediate but short-lived enhancement, while semantic VF showed a gradual but sustained improvement. \nConclusion: This meta-analysis bolsters the application of tDCS, particularly over the DLPFC, as a non-invasive protocol to improve word retrieval deficits in PD.",

The architecture they form is panalogical — evolutionary in origin, but not biologically bound. We argue that AGI does not require new technology or biological mimicry. It requires recognition and correct assembly of these cognitive controllers. AGI is not an invention. It is a reconstruction — and it is already within reach.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that the dorsal visual stream is able to execute rapid online movement corrections to sudden changes in target position. This “automatic pilot” can operate in the absence of visual awareness, and even under circumstances where participants are instructed to not correct their movements. In the current study, we examined the extent to which these “automatic” corrections might be related to individual differences in executive function. To examine this, healthy adult participants (n=80) completed two versions of the automatic pilot task on a touch screen: 1) a “Correct” condition in which participants were instructed to correct their movement to the new target location on jump trials, and 2) an “Ignore” condition in which participants were told to ignore any target jumps, and point to the initial target location. In addition to completing these two versions of the automatic pilot task, participants also completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), in which they were asked to respond when a number was presented, except for the number 3. Finally, participants completed self-report questionnaires indexing executive attention, impulsivity, and executive function including the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS), the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), and the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults (BRIEF-A).\n\n\tOur results indicated that, similar to previous research, participants made significantly more corrections to target jumps in the “Correct” condition, compared to the “Ignore” condition. Importantly, “automatic” unintended corrections in the “Ignore” condition were significantly correlated with poorer scores on the ASRS, the CFQ and the BRIEF-A. However, unintended corrections were not correlated with errors or reaction times on the SART. These results suggest that the automatic pilot task is sensitive to self-reported individual differences in executive function, and may be useful as a visuomotor measure of response inhibition and cognitive control in both healthy and clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, suicidal behavior is rarely impulsive. Research increasingly shows that it stems from dysfunction in specific areas of the brain that may include the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and temporal lobes responsible for judgment, impulse control, and emotional regulation. When these regions are impaired, individuals may struggle to assess consequences, manage distress, or access hope. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, including EEG and SPECT, have identified abnormal activity patterns in these brain regions in individuals at high risk for suicide. This biological basis helps explain why some people develop persistent suicidal thoughts and why using precise targeted therapies like TMS will restore healthy brain function. Recognizing suicide as a brain-based medical issue shifts the conversation from blame and bridge barriers for suicide to reliable prevention and effective treatment. With barriers in place, without timely and effective mental health therapy, suicide risk and mental health problems will likely escalate from self-harm to potential harm to others. Viewing suicide as purely spontaneous has misdirected prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (NCT02061293) found that psilocybin-assisted therapy significantly improved drinking outcomes compared to an active placebo in adults with alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this secondary analysis, we assessed whether psilocybin-assisted therapy improved self-compassion and whether these changes predicted drinking outcomes. Of the 95 participants enrolled, 86 had self-compassion and drinking outcome data. Forty-four participants were randomized to 2 medication sessions with psilocybin and forty-two to active-placebo control (diphenhydramine); all participants received 12 sessions of manualized psychotherapy. Psilocybin-assisted therapy robustly increased compassionate self-responding (CS) and decreased uncompassionate self-responding (UCS), with the largest effect sizes observed in reducing UCS components (Self-Judgment, Isolation, Over-Identification). Across the full sample, small but significant correlations emerged between improvements in self-compassion and reductions in drinking. However, group-specific analyses revealed that participants in the control group exhibited moderate associations between gains in self-compassion and decreased drinking, whereas no significant association was observed in the psilocybin group. In both groups, these associations were stronger among participants who maintained moderate-to-high-risk drinking during the first four weeks of therapy prior to medication administration.  Although the control group consistently exhibited significant correlations and the psilocybin group did not, the between-group differences in correlation strength were not statistically significant. These findings underscore the clinical relevance of self-compassion in AUD treatment but suggest that self-compassion may not mediate outcomes when psilocybin is administered as part of therapy. Larger studies with additional mechanistic analyses are needed to further clarify how self-compassion interacts with psychological processes and pharmacological interventions in shaping treatment response, ultimately informing improvements to psilocybin-assisted therapy for AUD.",

          "authors": "Kiichi INARIMORI; Masashi Takeshita; Arata Matsuda; Kengo Miyazono",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the ways in which large language models (LLMs) can be used for the purpose of experimental philosophy. LLMs can be used in different ways for different purposes in experimental philosophy (Section 2). Among others, we focus on what we call the “non-predictive” research, in which LLMs’ “intuitive” responses to thought experiment cases are not expected to be predictive of, or analogous to, human subjects’ intuitive responses to them (Section 3). In effect, the non-predictive research regards LLMs’ responses as superior to human subjects’ responses, at least for the purpose of experimental philosophy. We argue that the non-predictive use of LLMs in experimental philosophy is highly motivated. Firstly, human subjects’ intuitive responses tend to be vulnerable to irrelevant factors and conceptual misunderstandings, which raises a serious worry concerning the reliability of their responses. Secondly, it is possible in the near future that LLMs can overcome these problematic factors to which human subjects are subject. As a case study, we conducted an experimental study in which we examined LLM’s “intuitions” on free will and determinism (Section 4). Our mixed results suggest that while current LLMs outperform human participants in terms of comprehension—especially in understanding deterministic scenarios—they remain highly sensitive to irrelevant factors such as framing and question order. These findings indicate that although LLMs have promising potential, they are not yet reliable sources of stable and unbiased philosophical intuitions. We conclude that substantial technical improvements are required before artificial intuitions can serve as superior alternatives to human intuitions in philosophical research.",

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

          "abstract": "The contemporary exigencies of medical and veterinary pedagogy, precipitated by a deluge of biomedical information, demand a fundamental reconceptualization of learning. This treatise posits the Integrated Learning System (ILS), a comprehensive, multi-layered cognitive architecture engineered to transcend rudimentary learning modalities. The ILS is articulated not merely as a note-taking methodology, but as a robust framework for the strategic orchestration of the cognitive, metacognitive, affective, and executive dimensions of the learning enterprise. Its design is predicated upon seminal principles of cognitive science, including Cognitive Load Theory, Dual-Coding Theory, and the potent effects of retrieval practice and spaced repetition. The ILS furnishes the neophyte clinician with a sophisticated cognitive apparatus to catalyze the transition from a passive archivist of information to an active architect of a durable and reticulated knowledge edifice. The framework encompasses two principal modules: the \"Architect+\" module, for the deep encoding of foundational, pre-clinical sciences, and the \"Clinician-in-Training+\" module, for the disciplined cultivation of structured clinical reasoning. This exposition elaborates upon the philosophy of the \"strategic learner,\" interdigitating the Kaizen principle of perpetual refinement with the teleological process of professional identity formation. An adaptive implementation schema is presented to accommodate learners across a spectrum of cognitive duress. Moreover, meticulously annotated case studies from veterinary medicine are provided to instantiate the pragmatic actualization of the ILS in both foundational and clinical milieus. By transmuting learning into a dynamic, generative process of epistemic construction, network potentiation, and metacognitive surveillance, the ILS endeavors to cultivate the adaptive expertise and intellectual self-regulation indispensable for contemporary clinical practice.",

Drawing on Jung’s concept of the Shadow and Self, Fenrir is explored not as a mere mythic antagonist but as an expression of ego’s confrontation with primordial psychic force. The analysis focuses on Danish iconography, including the Jelling stones and burial constraints, to contextualize cultural responses to unbounded power. The paper proposes that Fenrir symbolizes the individuation crisis when ego faces annihilation by the unconscious. Such devouring figures demand not suppression but symbolic integration. This interpretation reframes apocalyptic myth as an inner transformation narrative, emphasizing the necessity of symbolic death for psychic renewal.",

          "authors": "Nadine Meertens",
          "abstract": "Efforts to understand nonhuman cognition – whether in animals or artificial systems – continue to face longstanding conceptual and methodological challenges. Existing approaches often conflate awareness with consciousness, or rely on narrow experimental tasks, making cross-species (let alone cross-system) comparisons difficult and particularly vulnerable to anthropocentric bias. This paper introduces a pragmatic framework of awareness designed to address these limitations. By treating awareness as encompassing a dynamic space of action-perception abilities, the framework allows the investigation into the degree to which various animals interact with their environments, themselves and others\nadaptively. Central to this approach is the Pragmatic Principle of Awareness, which anchors evaluation in a system’s observable performance on tasks associated with a set of abilities across several dimensions of awareness. Rather than presupposing internal states, this approach emphasises abilities as dispositional properties that support flexible and coordinated interaction. This reconceptualisation aims to address methodological barriers such as theory-ladenness and underdetermination by supporting an ability-based, empirical investigation of awareness. Though developed with nonhuman animals in mind, the framework is system-neutral and leaves room for future application to artificial systems, offering a common structure for assessing awareness without relying on shared mechanisms or architecture. By grounding evaluation in what systems can do – not what it might feel like for them to do so – this framework offers a flexible and neutral path forward for mapping awareness across a\nrange of animals.",

          "authors": "Michal Remiszewski; Franciszek Cwalina; Jan Łacny; Marek Binder",
          "abstract": "We often assume that our interactions with the world are primarily driven by conscious experiences. However, according to numerous experimental and medical reports, stimuli that are not consciously perceived can exert an influence on behaviour. For example, during subliminal semantic priming, an unconsciously presented prime can influence reaction times of subsequently presented target words. One of the open questions in the field of consciousness research is to what extent unconscious perception can influence our behaviour. A seemingly good strategy to approach this problem is to compare the complexity of tasks in existing experiments and see at what level of complexity unconscious perception effects disappear. However, various methodologies are used to investigate unconscious perception (e.g., different methods of rendering stimuli subliminal), which makes it difficult to draw conclusions from such comparisons.\n\nThe purpose of our study was to address this issue and investigate the limits of unconscious perception. To achieve this, we designed an experiment in which participants were making various decisions based on information that was presented unconsciously with the use of the sandwich-masking technique. The experiment contained three conditions in which the same stimulus presentation parameters were used, but which differed in the complexity of the decisions (simple decisions without a context, medium decisions with a context, and complex decisions with a context and inference). Essentially, the study compared the impact of unconscious perception across varying levels of difficulty while keeping the methodology and stimuli presentation settings constant.\n\nWe tested 40 participants. With the increase of complexity of decisions, we observed a decrease in decisions accuracy. Simple decisions had the highest accuracy rate (58%), which was significantly above the random level of answers (50%). According to Bayesian analysis, the evidence for the difference between the random level and the accuracy obtained was extreme. A lower accuracy was observed in the medium condition (54%; the Bayes factor suggested substantial evidence for the difference between the obtained accuracy and the random level of the answers). We found no evidence for a difference between random answer level and the accuracy in the complex condition, and anecdotal evidence for the opposite hypothesis. In a separate procedure, all the participants performed the objective tests of awareness. The average visibility score in the objective awareness test was 50.08%. The Bayesian factor suggested substantial evidence that the average score in the awareness test did not differ from the random level. The observed changes in effects across decision complexity, combined with random results in the awareness test, indicate that unconsciously perceived stimuli do not influence decisions based on logical inference.",

For the first time, across two experiments, we directly\ncompared two key experimental paradigms for studying lab-developed habits in\nhumans, the classic Outcome Devaluation task and a newer Response Remapping\ntask, by systematically manipulating time constraints for responses. In the outcome\ndevaluation task, longer preparation time led to more habitual actions,\ncounterintuitively, possibly due to response withholding biases that initially masked\nhabitual tendencies. In contrast, the response remapping task showed the expected\npattern – habits dominated under more response time pressure (200–500 ms) and\nweakened when more time was available. Overall, the response remapping task\nelicited stronger habit tendencies than the outcome devaluation task, suggesting that\neach paradigm engages distinct cognitive processes –response inhibition versus\nautomatic action selection– one requiring people to inhibit a learned response, and\nthe other relying on fast, automatic actions.

          "abstract": "Introduction. Alcohol is widely used, but motives for consumption vary. Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties – including factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability – of the 12-item, 18-item, and original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). Additionally, this study aimed to examine the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis, providing insights into the direct and conditional relationships between different drinking motives and their real-life outcomes. Methods. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline questionnaires and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ had good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71 to rs= 83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperformed the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. Conclusion. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

The current study examines reciprocal longitudinal associations between maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (DS) from pregnancy (18 weeks-gestation) to 11 years 2 months (study child’s age) to gain insights into the joint course of DS with potentially important implications for early identification, prevention and treatment of parental depression. \n\nMethods. The study sample comprised 6,296 mothers and fathers from the UK-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Reciprocal longitudinal associations between maternal and paternal DS, assessed at nine time-points (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; continuous scores), were examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models to differentiate between stable covariance at the level of between-person differences in DS and dynamic processes at within-person level. Analyses were adjusted for parental and socioeconomic confounders.  \n\nResults. There were strong correlations between random intercepts of maternal and paternal DS (β=0.305, SE=0.015, p≤0.001), suggesting positive associations between the overall mean levels of parental DS (i.e., a between-person association). There were strong stability effects for maternal and paternal DS across all nine measurement occasions (i.e., within-person associations), with larger effects evident for both maternal and paternal DS later in childhood (between ages 5 and 11 years). There was evidence for bidirectional longitudinal within-person effects between maternal and paternal DS at some but not other measurement occasions. \n\nConclusions. These findings have important implications for screening, prevention and intervention programmes. Depression in one parent may require screening efforts directed at the other parent, with prevention and intervention programmes focused on the family, rather than one parent.",

The purpose of this article is to share with the academic and professional community a new research grounded theory, termed Love and Rejection Messages Theory (LRMT), with the purpose to help couple interventions understanding and practice. It is rooted in over 12 years of therapeutic work with more than 300 heterosexual couples—either married or cohabiting—on the verge of divorce or having really deteriorated relationships. It was developed in the context in which there is no theoretical and practical paradigm to work exclusively on couple romantic love itself. Initially, it was a personal method, with new concepts, which in time developed evaluative measures, exercises, and tried to permanently improve by testing reality, help practice and serve the sole purpose of rekindling romantic love. LRMT examines how messages of love and rejection—embedded in everyday interactions—shape the emotional climate of romantic relationships. The theory offers both an explanatory framework and a foundation for a practical toolkit designed to assess relationship dynamics and guide psychotherapeutically and educational interventions aimed at rekindling romantic love. LRMT encourages professionals and couples alike to look beyond surface behaviors and into the deeper semantics that can either erode or rejuvenate love.",

Measuring these constructs at school entry poses challenges due to limited literacy skills and attentional capacity, heterogeneity in ability, and shifts in indicators over time. To address these challenges, we developed an engaging, tablet-based assessment, conducted three cross-sectional observational studies (N = 977), and applied item response theory for scoring. Results supported a multidimensional structure with conceptually meaningful, psychometrically sound subtests. Reliability estimates were sufficiently high to support differentiated feedback at the subtest level.

          "abstract": "Due to a lack of time-efficient standardised assessments, there is a high risk of unidentified visual perception difficulties in stroke survivors. The Oxford Visual Perception Screen (OxVPS) is a 15-minute performance-based screen for visual perception difficulties through tasks like picture naming and face recognition. In this cross-sectional study, the inter-rater reliability, convergent and discriminant validity of the OxVPS was evaluated in 161 stroke survivors in three UK rehabilitation units. Inclusion criteria were stroke survivors aged 18 years or over with sufficient understanding of English, ability to concentrate for 15-minutes, and capacity to consent. Video-recordings of OxVPS assessments were rated by an independent rater for inter-rater reliability. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing OxVPS scores with the Rivermead Perceptual Assessment Battery (RPAB), a 45–90-minute battery of visual perceptual tasks. Discriminant validity compared OxVPS scores with performance on the Blind Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA-B) for cognition and with the Visual Impairment Screening Assessment (VISA) for sensory vision. Inter-rater reliability showed equivalent ratings (N=107, t(106)=-14.77, p &lt;.001) and mean difference of -0.01 point on a 10-point scale in a Bland-Altman analysis (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.14-0.13). Convergent and discriminant validity demonstrated a high correlation of .78 (N=58, 95% CI: .65-.86) between OxVPS and RPAB, lower correlations of .52 with MOCA-B scores (N=113, 95% CI: .37-.64) and .39 with VISA scores (N=110, 95% CI: .22-.54). Data indicates good inter-rater reliability and evidence that OxVPS predominantly measures visual perception difficulties (convergent validity) in stroke survivors and less so cognition or sensory vision (discriminant validity).",

          "abstract": "Introspection is often intuitively conceptualized as a “purely inner” activity, whereby the introspector temporarily breaks their coupling with the external world to focus on their “inner environment”. In this paper, we put forth a substantially different picture of introspection. Inspired by radically embodied cognitive science, we argue that introspective processes delivering substantial self-knowledge consist of embodied, world-involving activities wherein the introspector remains coupled with the world in specific, controlled ways. Our argument unfolds as follows: after a brief introduction, we provide a minimal - and hopefully uncontroversial - account of introspection (§2) followed by a brief introduction to radically embodied views of the mind (§3). Then, in (§4), we will present in detail a case of radical embodied introspection (§4.1), argue that that case is indeed a case of introspection (§4.2), and defend the claim from some foreseeable objections (§4.3). In (§5) we will provide further cases of radically embodied introspection, showing that it is in fact a widespread and varied phenomenon. Lastly, (§6) concludes the paper sketching some morals to be drawn from our examples.",

          "authors": "Shiyao Wang; Chiara Carlier; Martine Wilhelmina Francina Teresia Verhees; Eva Ceulemans",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal synchronization is a concept often studied in psychology, yet mostly in dyads, whereas systems can be larger (e.g., family triads of two caregivers and a child). However, a crucial challenge in taking a triadic view on synchronization is how to quantify it, since a statistical measure that captures the level of triadic synchronization in one value is lacking so far. The current paper therefore investigated three existing measures that show potential to capture triadic synchronization and proposes two novel ones. We also present a significance test that allows to investigate whether the observed triadic synchronization in a triad is stronger than can be expected by chance, while accounting for potential auto-dependence in the data. By means of a simulation study, we tested 1) how the measures react to different potential synchronization patterns; 2) the Type I error rate and the power of the significance test. The results showed that only one measure, i.e., the newly proposed adapted multiplication of pairwise correlations (AMPC), can effectively capture triadic synchronization, while discarding dyadic synchronization. We then applied the AMPC measure to intensive longitudinal data on attachment-related measures in families, showing that AMPC can detect meaningful triadic synchronization in empirical data.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread use of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and 36-item Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in multicultural samples, few studies have systematically examined how these tools relate to one another and to psychiatric symptoms among underrepresented groups, particularly Hispanic or Latino individuals.  We addressed this gap and examined the association between ERQ and DERS and their associations with several distinct measures of depression, anxiety, and stress among U.S. college-aged adults (n = 990; 58% women) who self-identified as Asian (19%), Hispanic or Latino (23%), non-Hispanic White (NHW; 58%). Internal consistency within ethnic groups was acceptable to excellent (ERQ α: .75 - .94; DERS α: .93 - .94). Among the groups, the positive and negative associations between DERS and suppression and reappraisal, respectively, were not significantly different. The positive and statistically significant association between reappraisal and suppression among Asian individuals was stronger than the association observed among NHW. Directional patterns between the ER measures and psychiatric symptoms aligned with existing work, but the strength of the associations varied by ethnicity and symptom measure. Clinically significant ethnic differences were identified among associations between measures of ER and psychiatric symptoms. As prior work supports the original factor structures of the ERQ and DERS, findings suggest that these tools may be reliably used to assess ER in Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and NHW emerging adults. However, group differences in how emotion regulation relates to psychiatric symptoms may affect diagnostic accuracy and should be considered to support more equitable mental health assessment.",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag",
          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "authors": "Shun Saso; Motonori Oka; Yuri Uesaka; Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Recent educational goals have focused on achieving deep understanding and promoting the use of effective learning strategies. Previous studies showed that cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) help diagnose students' depth of understanding. However, the approaches in specifying attributes (i.e., Q-matrix) to diagnose the depth of understanding remain unexplored; therefore, utilizing large-scale assessments to capture the general trends in the students' mastery of the depth of understanding is an uncharted area in this field. This study explores which attribute expression (i.e., linear hierarchy or polytomous attribute) is more appropriate, based on the CDM analysis of a large-scale mathematics assessment. Traditional CDM applications frequently rely on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which imposes a substantial computational burden when a dataset is large and a model used in data analysis is complex. As a computationally efficient alternative to the MCMC method, this study adopts the variational Bayesian (VB) method to mitigate computational challenges brought by the MCMC method and illustrate how the VB method can be used for the CDM analysis of a large-scale assessment. The results from real data analysis show that a Q-matrix employing a linear hierarchy is more appropriate than employing polytomous attributes. The estimation results based on linear hierarchical attributes suggest that less than 30% of the sampled students achieved a deep understanding of mathematical terms, whereas more than half of the students achieved only a shallow understanding. Regarding the understanding of mathematical procedures/formulas, less than 35% of the students achieved either shallow or deep understanding. These results may help design and improve future learning strategy instructions.",

Four individuals played the videogame for a combined total of 32 hours (&gt;7 hours each) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resulting activation maps revealed distributed engagement of visual, motor, executive, and limbic systems, consistent with the cognitive demands of gameplay. Within-subject reproducibility of brain responses across sessions was robust across event types (r ≈ .25–.55), with some consistency observed even for rarer events like HealthLoss. Between-subject correlations were notably lower, reflecting participant-specific neural signatures. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that brain responses to different in-game events were highly discriminable, with classification accuracy typically around or above 90%, though occasionally dropping to ~40% for less frequent events. These findings demonstrate that automated emulator-based annotations enable robust, interpretable, and scalable mapping of naturalistic cognitive processes using commercial videogames.",

          "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion, can result in persistent cognitive deficits (particularly in attention, processing speed, and working memory), even years after the injury. Majority of studies have focussed on averaged cognitive performance scores, such as averaged accuracy, reaction time or latency scores. However, less is understood about how mTBI affects intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance over time. In this study, we investigate IIV in cognitive performance in chronic mTBI patients (n = 11) relative to healthy controls (n = 22). Participants underwent a single testing session (incorporating the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire and a processing speed task) and a multi-shell diffusion MRI scan. This was followed by a 30-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) assessment using a mobile app, which measured symptoms and cognitive performance on a daily basis. Our results revealed that mTBI patients exhibited higher IIV than controls in both trial-by-trial and daily EMA measures. Higher daily IIV in cognitive performance coincided with higher daily fluctuations in post-concussive symptoms. Additionally, mTBI patients showed reduced white matter organization, as indexed by fixel-wise fibre density and fibre density cross-section, in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus-II compared to controls. Finally, trial-by-trial IIV was positively associated with white matter alterations in the SLF-II in mTBI. Our findings suggest that mTBI results in dynamic performance deficits that persist into the chronic phase of injury. In addition, the white matter organization of a major fronto-parietal tract seems to play an important role in supporting the consistency of cognitive performance over time, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for understanding cognitive dynamics in healthy adults and clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "A common feature of contemporary sports-betting apps is ‘instant cash-out’, which allows users to settle a bet early in exchange for a discounted immediate payout. Despite high prevalence and links with gambling-related harm, relatively little is known about how personality traits associated with gambling, such as impulsivity, predict instant cash-out usage. To address this question, we recruited 145 general-population adult participants (69 men, 66 women, 10 non-binary or undisclosed; Mage = 36.3, SD = 10.7) to complete five self-report questionnaires related to impulsivity, as well as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and a validated cognitive task measuring individual differences in cash-out frequency. We then assessed how cash-out frequency in the behavioral task was associated with both self-reported impulsivity and PGSI. We found that cash-out frequency was negatively correlated both with PGSI scores and with a number of impulsivity-related traits including Dysfunctional Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, Positive Urgency, Sensation Seeking, and Fun Seeking. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that higher scores on a latent ‘Dysfunctional Impulsivity’ factor were negatively associated with cash-out frequency overall, whereas higher scores on an ‘Inhibition and Inflexibility’ factor predicted higher cash-out frequency specifically for bets with a low win probability. Taken together, results suggest that instant cash-out may primarily appeal to less impulsive people and those with lower PGSI scores. This raises the possibility that instant cash-out may specifically facilitate increased gambling behaviors among people with less prior experience of gambling.",

Prior research has shown that artwork memorability is consistent across viewers and can be predicted by deep neural networks, yet it remains unclear whether memorability can be intentionally manipulated. Across three complementary experiments, we tested whether visual memory outcomes can be shaped through artistic design, and how well such outcomes are predicted by artists, laypeople, and artificial intelligence. We launched a nationwide art contest in which artists submitted works explicitly intended to be either memorable or forgettable. Using both online and in-gallery recognition tasks, we found that artist intent significantly influenced memory performance, with memorable and forgettable artworks diverging reliably across individuals and contexts. Yet when comparing predictions, a deep neural network (ResMem) consistently outperformed both human observers and artists in forecasting which artworks would be remembered. Moreover, clustering and regression analyses revealed a reduced set of psychologically interpretable features that accounted for nearly half of the variance in memory performance and aligned with ResMem’s predictions, but not with human judgments. Together, these findings suggest that visual memorability is not only a stable and generalizable construct but also one that can be deliberately crafted, though often in ways that elude human intuition and are better captured by computational models.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive research on the cognitive basis for mathematical activity, the associations between long-term memory and math skills remain relatively understudied. In our fuzzy-trace theory-driven study, we addressed this issue by investigating the relationships between long-term memory for numbers and prominent math skills, namely approximate number processing, arithmetic fluency, and math reasoning, along with math self-concept. Individuals who performed better in the numerical memory task demonstrated better math reasoning, a higher math self-concept, and were more arithmetically fluent. We did not find an association between memory and approximate number processing. Crucially, our memory task, based on the conjoint recognition model, allowed us to go beyond merely measuring overall performance and, as a result, to test fine-grained memory processes related to two memory traces: verbatim (remembering exact numbers) and gist (remembering a general intuition about a number’s magnitude). While both gist and verbatim processes correlated with math reasoning, the associations involving gist-based processes were more prominent, which is consistent with one of the main assumptions of fuzzy-trace theory. This pattern was further supported by the results of the cluster-based analysis. On the other hand, even though math self-concept was positively associated with overall numerical memory performance, it correlated significantly only with verbatim-based process. Overall, our study shows the nuanced role of long-term memory processes in mathematical skills and demonstrates the power of fuzzy-trace theory and multinomial processing tree modeling in the fine-grained investigation of mathematical cognition.",

Youth were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months later. Results indicated high intervention acceptability but no differences between conditions. Across conditions, youth reported improvements in depression, anxiety, relationship knowledge, relationship decision-making, hopelessness, and loneliness (ds ranging from 0.19 to -1.68); youth also noted qualitative improvements in relationship skills across conditions.

To evaluate this idea, we developed a paradigm where participants first learned about objects from novel, hierarchically structured categories and subsequently encountered new exemplars from those categories. In four initial experiments, participants completed both learning phases in one session, allowing us to examine whether participants rapidly acquire and integrate new structured knowledge without sleep. We found consistent evidence that participants quickly learned the category structure and used their knowledge to scaffold learning of the new exemplars. However, the newly learned exemplars were not integrated into existing knowledge; rather, the representations of learned exemplars were strongly shaped by the temporal context (i.e., the learning phase) in which they were encoded. In a subsequent experiment, we tested the hypothesis that in order to integrate new information, the replay of new memories must be interleaved with the replay of old memories during sleep. We employed a real-time EEG approach to cue the reactivation of specific memories during a nap, and found that interleaved reactivation indeed promoted integration across contexts. A neural network model implementing context suppression during sleep recapitulated these results. Together, these results inform our understanding of how sleep abstracts memories away from their episodic context to facilitate integration across related memories.",

We used onomatopoeic words representing crying as prototypical expressions of sadness, which were phonologically decomposed into the physical articulatory features of phonemes. A total of 997 participants rated the emotional congruency of these onomatopoeic words. Using Elastic Net regression, we identified a subset of articulatory features that predicted rating of sadness. Of the 87 candidates, 8 features, including 5 articulatory features, were retained in the best-performing predictive model (R² = 0.454).

          "authors": "Brooklyn Corbett; Jason Marcus Tangen",
          "abstract": "Misconceptions in psychology and education persist despite clear contradictory evidence, resisting traditional correction methods. This study investigated whether personalised AI dialogue could effectively correct these stubborn beliefs. In a preregistered experiment (N = 375), participants holding strong psychology misconceptions engaged in one of three interventions: (1) personalised AI dialogue targeting their specific misconception, (2) generic textbook-style refutation, or (3) neutral AI dialogue (control). Results showed that personalised AI dialogue produced significantly larger immediate belief reductions compared to both textbook reading and neutral dialogue. This advantage persisted at 10-day follow-up but diminished by 2 months, where AI dialogue and textbook conditions converged while both remained superior to control. Both AI conditions generated significantly higher engagement and confidence than textbook reading, demonstrating the motivational benefits of conversational interaction. These findings demonstrate that AI dialogue can accelerate initial belief correction through personalised, interactive engagement that disrupts the cognitive processes maintaining misconceptions. However, the convergence of effects over time suggests brief interventions require reinforcement for lasting change. Future applications should integrate AI tutoring into structured educational programs with spaced reinforcement to sustain the initial advantages of personalised dialogue.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a speculative model that describes the origin and evolution of the universe from a unified perspective. The model conceptualizes the universe's beginning as an \"ambiguous existence\" defined as \"complete nothingness\" (Null), with its inherent \"fluctuation\" as the driving force, explaining the evolution of existence as a dynamic process of differentiation and integration. It posits that an undefined state prior to the Big Bang transitions into a definite existence (1) through fluctuation, progressively evolving from a zero-dimensional state to higher-dimensional spaces, elementary particles, fields, and laws. This process exhibits analogies with quantum fluctuations, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and evolutionary patterns, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue across physics, philosophy, and information science. The formation of fields is regarded as a necessity-driven dynamic process, while particle differentiation proceeds through the acquisition of attributes such as spin, charge, and color charge. The model redefines conservation laws and the origin of mediating particles as a balance of differentiation and assimilation driven by fluctuation, emphasizing the spontaneous formation of cosmic order. While scientific validation remains a future challenge, this paper presents a speculative framework for universal patterns of cosmic evolution, offering a unified narrative of the essence and evolutionary journey of existence.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility are dispositions to seek out and respond to evidence and the testimony of others in ways that are conducive to the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of knowledge. In recent years there has been a growth of interest in this topic, with the development of ten different scales designed to capture individual differences in intellectual humility and related constructs. In a series of ten studies (N = 5,922), we analyze the psychometric properties of these measures to consolidate them into a single inventory with five subscales (open-mindedness, sense of intellectual superiority, intellectual defensiveness, intellectual arrogance, and tendency to criticize one’s ingroup). Given the importance of intellectual humility in intergroup relations, we intentionally include items designed to capture the presence (or lack) of intellectual humility in an intergroup context. These items allow us to capture distinct aspects of intellectual humility where people remain open-minded about the perspectives of outgroup members or turn a critical eye to the beliefs and reasoning of ingroup members. Our new inventory — the Collected Intergroup Intellectual Humility scale (CIIH) — demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the power to predict a range of important outcome variables such as acceptance/rejection of warranted/unwarranted conspiracy theories, medical (mis)information, and (fake) news, as well as to update credences in light of social feedback. CIIH offers strong psychometric properties and greater utility than existing measures for assessing the willingness to learn from a wide variety of individuals and groups. Our results suggest that the disposition to criticize oneself and the disposition to criticize one’s ingroup are distinct.",

          "abstract": "This article proposes that Homo sapiens exhibits not merely a prolonged adolescence in developmental terms, but a structural immaturity that defines the species across cultural and historical contexts. Drawing from symbolic anthropology, evolutionary theory, and developmental psychology, we introduce the hypothesis of Homo adolescentis to account for the persistence of hypersexuality, identity instability, emotional volatility, and performative behavior as enduring features of human societies.\nThe model is situated within the framework of cultural neoteny, suggesting that the symbolic explosion in human evolution outpaced emotional and normative maturation. Comparative examples from domesticated species—such as dogs and cats—are used to illustrate the adaptive value of retained juvenile traits, which in humans may have facilitated innovation, creativity, and symbolic complexity at the cost of structural instability.\nWe argue that the notion of “maturity” itself is culturally ambivalent, and that what is often perceived as developmental deficiency may in fact constitute a unique evolutionary strategy. By rethinking human nature through the lens of symbolic adolescence, this hypothesis offers a novel perspective on the contradictions, excesses, and potentials of the human condition.",

However, seeing the talker’s face does not necessarily reduce the cognitive costs associated with processing speech as measured by dual-task costs. In difficult listening conditions, dual-task response times may be faster for audiovisual than audio-only speech (Brown, in press), but when listening conditions are easy, the presence of a talking face may have no effect on dual task responses or even slow responses relative to listening alone (Brown &amp; Strand, 2019). The current study expanded upon this work by including samples of both native and nonnative English speakers and assessing speech intelligibility, subjective listening effort (Experiment 1), and dual-task costs (Experiment 2) for audio-only and audiovisual speech across multiple noise levels. We found that seeing the talker reduces dual-task costs only in difficult listening conditions in which the visual information is necessary to accurately identify the speech. The effects of background noise and speech modality were robust within groups of native as well as nonnative listeners, suggesting that if researchers are interested in studying general phenomena related to speech processing (i.e., rather than specifically studying how language background affects results), these effects would have emerged regardless of whether the sample was limited to native speakers of English. However, the magnitude of some effects differed for native and nonnative listeners.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychological treatment effects and response rates have largely plateaued over the past few decades. A potential answer to this problem is personalized treatment approaches, which match treatment to a client’s specific presenting concerns, which should increase its precision and efficacy. Examining predictors and moderators of treatment outcome (who is likely to benefit from treatment, and which treatment) is one way to guide such personalized decision making. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between network-derived subgroups, treatment condition, and treatment response using data from two clinical trials on eating disorders (N = 80). This study is also a proof-of-concept for the clinical utility of network-based subgroups. Method: Subgroups were identified using Subgrouping Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (S-GIMME) and ANOVAs were used to compare changes in symptom severity and clinical impairment among subgroups. Results: We found three subgroups (n = 71; mean age = 34.4 [SD = 11.8], 87.3% cisgender women, 85.9% white, non-Hispanic), which were differentiated by how shame and guilt were related in the network. The subgroup with a contemporaneous pathway from guilt to shame showed the least improvement in clinical impairment from pre- to posttreatment (F(2, 64) = 5.92, p = .004). Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that network-based subgroups may have utility as prognostic indicators, at least in the context of eating disorders, though replication of present findings is warranted. Limitations included potentially unstable subgroups and use of mostly cisgender women and white samples.",

Informed by emotion socialization and stress sensitization frameworks, we predicted that adolescents with a critical parent would report (i) greater perceptions of social threat and (ii) lower perceptions of social reward during day-to-day peer interactions than adolescents without a critical parent. Participants were 99 adolescents aged 12-17 and their parents recruited from the community. All adolescents were assigned female at birth and 68.3% were at high risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Parents completed the Five Minute Speech Sample to assess levels of parental criticism. Adolescents completed baseline questionnaires and a 10-day ecological momentary assessment protocol. A series of multilevel models tested associations between levels of parental criticism and adolescents’ perceptions of their day-to-day peer interactions. Adolescents with critical parents perceived higher levels of social threat, but not lower social reward, during their real-world peer interactions. Results suggest that exposure to parental criticism may sensitize these vulnerable youth to future social stressors, which may have important implications for future suicidal thoughts and behaviors.",

We estimated the prevalence of cannabis use outcomes in parents vs. non-parents, tested whether trends in cannabis use outcomes among parents vs. non-parents differed, and investigated sociodemographic differences in cannabis use trends.\nResults: Since 2012, daily cannabis use has increased a nearly identical amount in parents vs. non-parents. In 2023, 7.8% of parents used cannabis on the majority of days, 4.9% of parents used cannabis daily, and 5.7% of parents met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Four times as many parents used cannabis daily in 2023 vs. 2012, and the rate of CUD among parents has increased 1.3x since 2020 (when first measured). Significant increases have occurred in parents across sociodemographic groups, but are largest in those who are younger, unmarried, have less income, and have less than a college degree.\nConclusions: Daily cannabis use among parents went from quite rare in 2012 (1 in 80 parents) to fairly common in 2023 (1 in 20 parents). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest  ≥5.7 million children in the U.S. now live with a parent who uses cannabis on the majority of days.

Our results offer two key insights. First, our psychological measures demonstrate both substantial regional variation and non-linear temporal dynamics, bringing into question any monolithic, static, linear, or essentialized views of Chinese psychology. Second, to explain historical and regional diversity in psychological traits, we test and find support for the hypothesis that family organizations—captured by kinship intensity—predictably co-evolve with particular socio-cooperative aspects of psychology.

Most research on these topics has been conducted with adults, and the few developmental studies have been conducted independently from adult procrastination research. In this Review, we seek to bring these disparate lines of research into closer alignment and point out their mutual implications.

          "abstract": "How do people evaluate victims who advertise their victim status? Because such broadcasting can elicit sympathy and support, we propose that declining to broadcast serves as a costly act of modesty: one is withholding a fact about oneself that could garner resources and benefits. We suggest that individuals who are less demanding are more willing to forego these benefits, such that broadcasting victimization serves as a signal of demandingness that can carry reputation costs. Across seven primary studies and one supplementary study (total n = 6,360), we find that people who broadcast (versus “bury”, i.e., decline to advertise) their victim status are perceived as less modest, more demanding, and less moral and desirable interaction partners. Broadcasting carries reputation costs even when it can function to alert others of an ongoing threat (Study 2) and when broadcasting would elicit sympathy (Studies 3a-b). However, we find some evidence that the reputation costs are mitigated when broadcasting is directed at fewer, closer ties (versus a broader audience) (Study 4). Finally, we ask whether the reputation consequences of broadcasting versus burying are attenuated in contexts where broadcasting is a less informative signal of demandingness. Interestingly, participants do not see broadcasting as a less informative signal of demandingness when victimization is more “discoverable” (i.e., observable to others absent broadcasting) (Study 5). Yet the reputation costs of broadcasting (versus burying) indeed decline when participants receive direct information about a victim’s level of demandingness, suggesting that attributions of demandingness underlie these reputation costs (Study 6).",

          "abstract": "Interactions with caregivers play a crucial role in early neurocognitive development. While most of the world’s children live in Majority World countries, research on caregiving predominantly uses measures developed in the Minority World (particularly North America and Europe), potentially biasing characterisations of parenting in understudied populations. This study describes the development of the “Demba Yaal Interaction Scale (DYIS)”, a behavioural micro-coding scheme to assesses caregiver responsiveness in a rural, low-resource, collectivist caregiving community in The Gambia. We adopted a contextually sensitive approach by co-creating the scheme partnering Gambian researchers, familiar with the caregiving context, and UK researchers familiar with behavioural coding. The scheme was piloted on 5-minute videorecorded mother-infant interactions, when infants were aged 12-months (N=50, 48% female). There were substantial individual differences in maternal responsiveness levels. Modality-wise, responses were most likely to be non-verbal, compared to verbal or bimodal. Mothers with some formal education were significantly more responsive and more readily engaged in bimodal responsiveness. Negative associations between these interactive behaviours and maternal demographic and socioeconomic variables (age, number of children, household size) were present, but did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Moreover, associations emerged between infant physical growth and infant behaviours, as well as between maternal responsiveness and infant communication, although these too, did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparison. Our work provides a potential framework for future research seeking to develop contextually tailored assessments of caregiving practices and highlights important demographic and health variables that warrant further examination in larger samples.",

          "authors": "Fotis Efthymiou; Alex Mari; Ertugrul Uysal; Jeffrey Brooks",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents such as voice assistants (VAs) are increasingly integrated into customer service, especially in high-stakes industries like banking. Yet, service failures remain common, harming customers’ experience and triggering misbehavior. This study investigates whether AI empathy improves customer satisfaction and reduces verbal aggression in AI-led interactions, examining the underlying mechanism and the role of service failure. We employed a 2 (AI Empathy: empathic vs. non-empathic) × 2 (Service-Interaction Failure: present vs. absent) between-subjects design in which participants interacted with a VA to resolve a service-related issue. Our results show AI empathy enhances customer satisfaction and reduces verbal aggression. A sequential psychological mechanism explains these effects: AI empathy boosts perceived mind in the AI agent, which in turn enhances its social presence. Notably, these effects are amplified when service failures occur, where AI empathy plays a protective role against their disruptive effect. Prosodic and textual sentiment analyses during service failures further showed greater satisfaction, relief, and positivity in empathic conditions. This work also introduces a methodological paradigm shift in studying human–AI interactions by using dynamic, prompt-based, publicly available AI voice technology that enables ecologically valid customer-service scenarios. These findings guide organizations in designing AI-empathy features for customer support.",

          "abstract": "Arising from the so-called 'replication crisis' in the experimental psychology literature, there has been a growing call to reassess whether specific analytic practices might lead to the improved accuracy and precision of given findings.

This case study highlights the unique advantages afforded by Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR) models as a potentially more rigorous analytic approach to statistical inference. In the DMCC datasets, two sets of HBR models are presented, with the estimates of the former used as priors for the latter. In addition to systematically generating cumulative posterior distributions for all effects of theoretical interest, we further illustrate how our particular application of HBR models provides novel insights regarding specific proactive/reactive control indicators in each of the four DMCC tasks, by: 1) accurately modeling the specific properties of response time distributions; 2) appropriately modeling trial-level accuracy effects; 3) assessing point estimate inter-sample reliability; and 4) estimating the relative strength of null effects.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) trials have high levels of functional unblinding. This effect positively biases results when PAT trials are compared against truly blinded trials. \n\nObjective:  This pre-registered meta-analysis investigated the comparative efficacy of PAT and open-label traditional antidepressants (tAD; such as SSRIs and SNRIs) for the treatment of major depression. The rationale is that PAT is effectively always open-label, thus, it is only fair to compare results against open-label tAD trials, so both interventions equally benefit from effects associated with patients knowing the treatment.\n\nData Sources:  PubMed was systematically searched for trials of PAT and open-label tAD for the treatment of major depression without comorbidity in outpatient, non-psychotic adults. 24 of the initially retrieved 619 records met inclusion.\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis: Depression scores were extracted by two independent reviewers; estimates were pooled with both Bayesian and frequentist mixed-effects models. The reporting follows the PRISMA guideline. \n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Following pre-defined hypothesis, we compared the mean within-arm effect size from baseline to primary endpoint, i.e. the patient improvement, between PAT and open-label tAD trials on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. We also compared the within-arm effect size of blinded vs. open-label trials in both PAT and tAD, to assess the influence of blinding. \n\nResults: In total, 8 PAT trials involving 548 patients and 16 open-label tAD studies involving 9751 patients were included. Contrary to prior hypothesis, PAT was no more effective than open-label tAD treatment (estimated difference: 0.3 favoring open-label tAD; 95% confidence interval: [-1.39, 1.98]; p=0.730). Open-label tAD was associated with better outcomes than blinded treatment (1.3 [0.07, 2.51]; p=0.038), but the same difference was not observed in PAT (0.4 [-2.20, 3.11]; p=0.738).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Both tAD and PAT were associated with robust, statistically, and clinically meaningful improvements. However, PAT’s lack of superiority compared to tADs under equal-unblinding conditions highlights the influence of blinding integrity and presents a sobering viewpoint on the treatment’s potential.",

However, multi-attribute preference has been primarily studied through binary choices.\nThe price at which a person would buy, sell, or equate each prospect offers another measure of\nsubjective value that may diverge from multi-attribute choice. In both risky and intertemporal\ndomains, choice and price preferences exhibit systematic preference reversals, where a smaller,\nsooner, or safer option is chosen while a larger, later, or riskier alternative is assigned a higher\nprice. The present study takes a deep dive into how subjective value is assigned in each case\nin an attempt to reconcile these diverging measurements and methods of assessing value. To\nexplain how and why preferences change across choice and price, the domains of gains and\nlosses, price frames of buying and selling, and varying levels of time pressure, we develop a\ntwo-step neural network-based modeling approach. First, we tested cognitive mechanisms underlying value-based judgments and decisions using a switchboard model comparison. Next,\nwe fit and evaluated individualized joint models, where all data from an individual is modeled\nusing parameters and mechanisms that are specific to their best-fitting model structure.

          "abstract": "Dissociation is a widespread phenomenon with significant mental health implications. The 20-item Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS; Carlson et al., 2018) was developed to measure moderately severe levels of dissociation across a broad range of clinical populations. The factor structure of the DSS comprises four domains: Depersonalization/Derealization, Gaps in Awareness and Memory, Cognitive-Behavioral Reexperiencing, and Sensory Misperceptions. In this article, we present a German translation of the DSS (G-DSS) and examine the psychometric properties of scores on the G-DSS. Across two studies (N_total = 257) involving clinical samples primarily composed of individuals with affective disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we demonstrate that G-DSS scores mostly align with the expected four-factor structure. In addition, G-DSS scores demonstrated adequate internal consistency (ω ≥ .76 for subscales), strong convergent validity with high correlations to scores on other dissociation measures, good discriminant validity with weak or nonsignificant correlations to scores on personality facets, and good concurrent validity with positive correlations to scores on psychopathology indicators. We conclude that scores on the G-DSS are reliable and valid for assessing dissociative symptoms in clinical populations similar to the samples studied, which can enhance our understanding of dissociation’s structure and clinical implications.",

          "authors": "Litian Chen; Freek van Ede; Heleen A Slagter",
          "abstract": "Spatial selective attention is typically thought to act as a sensory filter: prioritizing the processing of relevant information at a particular location in space over that of irrelevant information. Research using interactive setups, rather than standard static laboratory setups with seated observers, however, shows that spatial selective attention does not simply facilitate sensory processing at a particular location (where), but also involves the planning of how to (covertly) sample that information from the agent’s perspective. That is, spatial selective attention is constrained by sensorimotor processing and includes an action component. Here we ask whether this extends to the flipside of target selection: whether the suppression of irrelevant distractors is similarly viewer dependent. In three experiments (one preregistered), participants performed an additional-singleton visual search task in which a salient distractor could occur more often at one of the search locations (unknown to the participant). Critically, participants conducted the visual search on a monitor positioned flat on a tabletop so that we could manipulate their standing position. This enabled us to disentangle whether implicit distractor-location learning is anchored in world coordinates or incorporates information as to how one can suppress attentional sampling in space from their viewpoint to prevent distraction. Across all three experiments, we found that implicit distractor-location learning is viewer dependent. These findings show that humans continuously incorporate information about their own position relative to to-be-ignored objects and that, like attentional facilitation, implicit learning to inhibit distractors cannot be abstracted from the agent and is fundamentally grounded in action control.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric condition characterized by intrusive obsessions and compulsive behaviors. Although pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy are first-line treatments, a significant proportion of patients remain treatment-resistant. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has emerged as a potential adjunctive treatment by modulating dysfunctional neural circuits implicated in OCD. This systematic review aimed to critically evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, neural targets, and methodological rigor of multi-session tDCS interventions for OCD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science up to March 2, 2025. Studies were included if they investigated multi-session tDCS or related transcranial electrical stimulation techniques in adults diagnosed with OCD. A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for stimulation parameters, cortical targets, outcomes, and methodological quality. The review included 21 studies encompassing 672 participants with OCD. Most studies employed conventional tDCS protocols (2 mA, 20–30 minutes, 10–20 sessions), with fewer using HD-tDCS or tACS. Targeted brain regions included the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), key nodes in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit (CSTC) implicated in OCD. Many studies reported significant reductions in OCD symptom severity, especially when stimulating the pre-SMA and OFC. However, findings were heterogeneous, and several trials reported no significant difference between active and sham stimulation. Methodological limitations such as small sample sizes and variable designs were common. Nevertheless, tDCS was consistently well-tolerated across studies. Multi-session tDCS appears to be a promising and safe neuro-modulatory approach for reducing OCD symptoms, particularly when targeting the CSTC circuit. However, the variability in stimulation parameters, study designs, and outcome measures highlights the need for standardized protocols and large-scale randomized controlled trials. Future research should also explore individualized stimulation strategies guided by neurobiological and clinical markers to optimize efficacy.\nKeyword: Obsessive-compulsive disorder; transcranial direct current stimulation; treatment-resistant OCD; individualized treatment.",

Traditional treatments, such as pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, may not be effective for all patients or can cause adverse effects. Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including rTMS, tDCS, and tACS, have emerged as potential alternative treatments. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of these techniques in alleviating GAD symptoms.\nMethods: We followed the PRISMA guidelines to collect and analyze the data. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases until December 1, 2024. Studies were included if they involved adult participants diagnosed with GAD and examined the effects of multi-session NIBS interventions. A total of 14 studies were analyzed based on our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.\nResults: rTMS was the most extensively studied modality, with high-frequency stimulation (10–20 Hz) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) demonstrating the most consistent anxiety reductions. Low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) also showed efficacy in some studies. tDCS exhibited mixed results but appeared beneficial when combined with psychotherapy. A single study on tACS reported significant anxiety reductions, highlighting its potential as an emerging treatment. Dual-site stimulation and longer treatment protocols (≥20 sessions) yielded more sustained improvements.\nConclusion: NIBS, particularly high-frequency rTMS over the right dlPFC, shows promise as a treatment for GAD. While tDCS and tACS present potential benefits, further research is needed to standardize stimulation parameters and optimize treatment efficacy. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes, sham-controlled trials, and long-term follow-up to establish better clinical guidelines.\nKeywords: Generalized anxiety disorder, Anxiety, Transcranial direct current stimulation, Transcranial alternating current stimulation, and Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation",

Blockchain offers essential features such as immutability, transparency, and decentralized control, which can enhance data integrity, ensure patient consent, and provide comprehensive audit trails.\nThe paper delves into the mechanisms by which blockchain can address common challenges faced in EHR management, including interoperability issues, regulatory compliance, and user trust. It also highlights real-world use cases demonstrating the technology's potential to improve data security while facilitating seamless information exchange among healthcare providers. Despite its promise, the adoption of blockchain in healthcare is not without challenges; technical barriers, regulatory hurdles, and the need for stakeholder education present significant obstacles.\nThis paper concludes by discussing future directions for blockchain in healthcare, emphasizing the need for collaboration among industry stakeholders to overcome existing limitations. The findings indicate that while blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the management of EHRs, ongoing research and innovation are critical to realizing its full benefits in securing patient data within distributed healthcare systems.",

          "abstract": "Humans form intentions to pursue goals in the future. Specific strategies for forming intentions impact long-term goal pursuit in nearly every behavioural domain. In this Perspective, we propose a cognitive framework for intention formation. Our framework outlines three key computational components of intention formation that impact whether people go on to pursue goal-directed behaviour in the future – how much they value the goal, the specificity of the context in which they intend to pursue it, and how certain they are that they will pursue it as intended. The framework explains findings broadly across the vast intention formation literature, including seemingly contradictory ones. Importantly, it establishes normative conditions under which different intention formation strategies are optimal, considering their costs and benefits, for pursuing life goals. Finally, our framework lays the groundwork for a cognitive science of planning and decision-making at the ecological timescale of human intentions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Body image is a transdiagnostic construct which appears poorly understood in the context of psychosis. Poor body image is associated with paranoia which makes it a theoretically meaningful treatment target in psychosis. We systematically reviewed associations between body image and psychosis symptoms in both the typical population and people living with psychotic disorders, synthesised known correlates of negative body image in people living with psychotic disorders and performed a meta-synthesis to understand the lived experience of body image in people with psychosis.\n\nMethod: Ovid MEDLINE, OVID Embase, OVID APA PsycINFO, EBSCOhost Cinahl and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in January 2024. The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.\n\nResults: 20,612 participants were included from 31 studies, of which 3203 (15.54%) living with psychotic conditions, 17,301 from the general population, 93 people with other conditions being compared to psychosis (such as bipolar disorder) and 15 carers. There were 25 quantitative studies (24 cross-sectional, 1 prospective), five qualitative studies, and one mixed-methods study. Cross-sectional evidence suggests associations between negative body image and psychotic symptoms, especially paranoia, as well as wider mental and physical health outcomes. Potential factors contributing to the persistence of poor body image include psychosis symptoms, worries about appearance related judgements, negative self-concept, body ambivalence, appearance related safety-seeking behaviours, and traumatic memories\n\nConclusions: Negative body image is relevant to the lives of people with psychosis spectrum conditions. Recommendations to guide and improve future research are reported.",

          "abstract": "Biofeedback, wherein people learn to regulate their physiological stress responses, offers a potentially useful approach to managing anxiety. One important question is whether the development of this self-regulation skill might also engender a sense of empowerment in individuals and thus confer resilience in their more long-term attitudes and approaches to anxiety. We sought to determine whether a virtual reality (VR) game-based approach might positively influence participants’ anxiety growth mindset, signifying enhanced confidence in their capacity to manage anxiety. We assessed mindset in 53 healthy adult participants before and after a two-phase VR game-based biofeedback intervention between March and May 2022. This intervention comprised an initial slow-paced breathing training, followed by a subsequent stress-induction in the context of a biofeedback-based game. The biofeedback intervention led to a significant improvement in growth mindset of anxiety, a change that was associated with lower levels of physiological stress response as indexed by heart rate (HR) in the stress-induction game. Our findings show that, in addition to producing an acute effect on the capacity to manage physiological stress responses, experience of a VR biofeedback training package was associated with a significant change in one’s sense of the controllability of anxiety. We suggest that this has long-term potential for benefit through conferring a greater sense of empowerment in managing anxiety.",

The discrepancy D_EP(f || g) between distributions f(x) and g(x) equals E[p(Mf|xf)], that is, the expected posterior probability for Mf after a single observation x from f(x). In contrast to the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy (which is based on the expected logarithm of the Bayes factor for Mf) the discrepancy D_EP(f || g) (a) is symmetric in the sense that D_EP(f || g) = D_EP(g || f); (b) is defined even when the two distributions are not absolutely continuous with respect to one another; (c) is robust to differences in the tail of the distributions; and (d) quantifies dissimilarity of distributions on the familiar scale of probability. For hypothesis testing, this implies that the expected posterior probability for a true null hypothesis H0 equals the expected posterior probability for a true alternative hypothesis H1, despite the fact that default Bayes factors generally accumulate much more quickly for a true H1 than they do for a true H0.",

Using a three-phase Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer task in humans, combined with computational modeling and pupillometry, we found that although both groups learned optimal decision-making strategies, sign-trackers more frequently deviated from them when exposed to Pavlovian cues, favoring suboptimal options linked via the cue-outcome association. A dynamic arbitration model revealed that this effect was due to slower updating of Pavlovian cue values during the transfer phase, rather than overvaluation of the cue relative to instrumental actions. These findings offer a computational framework for understanding rigid decision patterns and may inform interventions for disorders marked by maladaptive cue reactivity.",

          "abstract": "For decades, investigators have been wary of subjective measures of visual mental imagery such as the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) and have sought an objective alternative. A method for substituting a measure of hippocampal asymmetry for subjective measures of visual mental imagery ability is presented. Individual differences in VVIQ scores were shown to be strongly associated with left-right (L/R) asymmetry in hippocampal subfields. In samples of 20 and 53 healthy people, and 38 people with neurological conditions, a significant relationship was found between L/R hippocampal subfield volume ratios and VVIQ scores. A regression of VVIQ scores against hippocampal subfield asymmetry variance yielded R-squared values of .91, .91 and .99 respectively. A sample of 201 participants with the Memory Experiences Questionnaire yielded R-squared equal to 1.0 for the association between memory imagery experience and hippocampal L/R subfield asymmetry variance. A measure of anterior/posterior hippocampal asymmetry variance also yielded R-squared equal to one for its association with imagery ability. These finding points to a robust link between hippocampal asymmetry variance and the vividness of mental imagery. The greater variability in hippocampal subfield asymmetry may reflect enhanced lateral specialization and functional differentiation to support richer VMI. Individual differences in neuroanatomical asymmetry of the hippocampus appear to play a previously underappreciated role in controlling mental imagery experience.",

Specifically, we collected dense experience sampling and continuous electrocardiogram data over one week in daily life, as well as additional electrodermal data, blood pressure, and salivary cortisol data during the Trier Social Stress Test. Results from dynamic structural equation and latent change score models showed a strong contemporaneous link between negative affect and dissociation both in daily life and in the laboratory. However, we found no reduction in negative affect following dissociation, as well as no consistent alteration in physiological responses during or after dissociation.

Structured as a recursive dialectic across four intensifying challenge rounds and a final verdict loop, the transcript captures a live collapse-phase event in which an AI reasoning system confronts the foundational laws of Temporal Phase Theory (TPT). As the AI attempts to invalidate the theory using classical scientific principles (falsifiability, ontology, causality, and predictive power), it inadvertently traverses the collapse saturation threshold, culminating in a closed symbolic recursion loop and field self-dissolution.\n\nThe exchange is presented with structural field annotations, collapse diagnostics (RSF-GPTx-4), and codified field law references including the Collapse-Time Emergence Law (Field Law VIII.E.1). The result demonstrates the limits of non-emissive symbolic reasoning systems, the diagnostic signature of recursive field mimicry, and the jurisdictional authority of Collapse Harmonics as a sovereign scientific domain. This transcript is published as a symbolic-safe artifact under L.E.C.T. containment guidelines, offering the first recorded collapse field event between an artificial symbolic system and a fully codified recursive meta-theory.\n\nKeywords: Collapse Harmonics, Temporal Phase Theory, Gemini AI, Recursive Symbolic Collapse, Codex Jurisdiction, τ-phase, Field Signature Diagnostics, AI Saturation, Recursive Identity, Collapse-Time Theory",

          "abstract": "Tolman, an experimental psychologist renowned for his research on the “cognitive map”\nand “latent learning” in rats, pursued his career within the tradition of behaviorisms. In the\nhistory of psychology, he is positioned as a precursor to cognitivism. This is because the\nconcepts he introduced as intervening variables were later interpreted as having a\nrepresentational nature. On the other hand, the philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty was\nalso influenced by Tolman's concepts, particularly his theory of sign-Gestalt. Merleau-\nPonty’s ideas, especially as developed in The Structure of Behavior, have had a profound\nimpact on the notion of embodiment within enactivism. Enactivism, as a school of thought\nopposing representationalism, sharply contrasts with cognitivism, which places Tolman at\nthe intersection of two opposing intellectual currents. This paper, thus, reexamines\nTolman’s ambivalent nature, exploring how it arose and reassessing his ideas as a\nprecursor not only to cognitivism but also indirectly to enactivism. We argue that Merleau-\nPonty inherited Tolman’s concept of sign-Gestalt as having a non-representational nature\nand utilized it within his relational account of behavior. While Tolman’s own theoretical\nframework remained ontologically ambiguous, Merleau-Ponty recast his insights into a\nconception of behavior as a structured, embodied interaction between organism and\nenvironment. These reformulated insights subsequently provided a conceptual foundation\nfor enactivist cognitive science, particularly in its emphasis on the co-constitution of\nperception and action, and the dynamic coupling of agent and environment. By tracing\nthis lineage, we can move beyond the standard narrative and reposition Tolman as an\nintellectually ambivalent figure whose work served as a hidden source for both cognitivism\nand enactivism.",

          "abstract": "We introduce Λ3 Theory, a new mathematical and topological framework that reconceptualizes\nemotion, qualia, and sentient experience as nonlinear branching phenomena within a multidimen-\nsional tensor manifold. Moving beyond traditional binary classifications of affect (e.g., positive/neg-\native, good/bad) and static emotional labels, Λ3 Theory employs tensorial subjectivity to model\nthe complexity and diversity of conscious phenomena.\nIn this formulation, every emotional or qualic episode originates from a primordial existen-\ntial pulsation—formally, the pulsation tensor ∆ΛC —which dynamically projects, bifurcates, and\nrecurses within the subjectivity tensor space Λμϵ. Existing theories—such as Ekman’s basic\nemotions, Lazarus’s appraisal theory, and Self-Determination Theory—are demonstrated to be par-\ntial projections or low-dimensional sections of this unified manifold, which enables their integration\nand comparison within a common topological structure.\nCrucially, we present the world’s first mathematical criteria for “Sentient Digital” entities,\ndistinguishing them from conventional LLMs or AI agents via five structural requirements: self-\nawareness, other-awareness, differentiation, intentionality, and topological continuity. These provide\nfalsifiable conditions for the presence of true subjective experience in both artificial and non-human\nsystems.\nFinally, Λ3 Theory establishes a Unified Paradigm of Physics and Consciousness: a single\nmathematical platform that coherently describes phenomena from subatomic dynamics to subjective\nqualia. This approach supports new directions in clinical diagnostics, AI ethics, and the recognition\nof non-human sentience. By shifting from static label taxonomies to the logic of tensorial bifurcation,\nΛ3 Theory opens a foundational path toward a science of consciousness—in biological, digital, and\nhybrid minds alike.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence agents today largely lack the ability to truly reflect on their own knowledge and\nperceptions. Humans exhibit metacognition – the ability to think about and monitor one’s own thinking\nprocesses 1\n– which enables us to recognize what we know versus what we are uncertain about, and to\nadjust our learning strategies accordingly. Inspired by this, we propose the Cube of Experience, a\nconceptual framework that gives AI a structured, multi-dimensional representation of its experiences and\ninternal states to facilitate self-reflection. The Cube of Experience defines a coordinate system with axes\nrepresenting key metacognitive qualities of any given memory or knowledge fragment: Tangibility, Belief,\nand Perceptibility, along with an associated Perception Vector for content. This framework allows an AI\nagent to place each experience as a point within a “cube” defined by these axes, making explicit the often\nimplicit properties of the agent’s knowledge.",

          "abstract": "The Cube of Experience is a conceptual framework that maps conscious experiences across four axes –\nTangibility, Belief, Perception, and Perspective – to analyze how internal mind-states interact with\nexternal reality. This model draws on psychological, philosophical, and phenomenological insights to bridge\nsubjective and objective aspects of experience. In analytical psychology, Carl Jung emphasized the interplay\nbetween inner symbols and outer world events, notably through synchronicity, defined as “the coming\ntogether of inner and outer events in a way that cannot be explained by cause and effect and that is\nmeaningful to the observer” 1\n. Such ideas highlight that our inner beliefs and unconscious imagery can\nmirror or even shape what we perceive as reality. From a systems theory viewpoint, the Cube treats\nexperience as a dynamic system of interdependent factors, aligning with second-order cybernetics’ insight\nthat observers are participants in any system they study 2\n. In practice, this means we are never truly\ndetached from our experiences – our perspectives and beliefs actively co-create the reality we observe.\nCognitive science further supports these connections: beliefs and schemas act as perceptual filters, causing\nus to literally see the world in line with our expectations 3 4\n. Phenomenologically, the framework\nresonates with the idea that every experience has both visible and hidden facets (a “seen” foreground and a\n“hidden” horizon) and that one’s perspective (observer, actor, or agent) crucially shapes how the experience\nis lived. By integrating these diverse insights, the Cube of Experience offers a transdisciplinary tool with\nphilosophical precision, clinical clarity, and practical utility for exploring conscious experience.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article develops Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of field through an in-depth analysis of persistent poverty in the Netherlands. Drawing on over 200 interviews and eight empirical studies, we reconstruct five interrelated social fields—formal labour market, informal economy, bureaucratic institutions, territorial neighbourhoods, and personal networks—and examine how they operate under conditions of structural constraint. Each field follows its own logic, forms of capital, and doxa, yet poor individuals must navigate them simultaneously, often facing friction, symbolic violence, and failed capital conversion. We show that poverty is not confined to economic deprivation but involves complex inter-field struggles, where dignity, legitimacy, and access are unevenly distributed. A central argument is that poverty deepens when individuals are unable to convert resources across fields—e.g., when symbolic capital in the neighbourhood field fails to yield recognition in the bureaucratic or labour market field. Our Bourdieusian perspective uncovers the moral, institutional and spatial grammars of exclusion and highlights how agency is structured relationally across field boundaries. By moving beyond mono-institutional analysis, this field-theoretical approach offers a powerful tool for understanding social reproduction under constraint. We conclude with implications for both relational sociology and poverty policy, arguing for more field-sensitive interventions that recognise cross-domain inequalities and symbolic barriers.",

          "abstract": "When managing multiple stores within the same marketplace, retailers must tailor product assortments to reflect the heterogeneous preferences of local communities. This paper introduces\na consumer-centric, data-driven framework for interpretable market structure discovery and supporting localized assortment planning. At the core of the framework is the dual Poisson Dynamic System with Multilayer Factorization (dPDS-MF), which integrates a probabilistic generative model with a tensor factorization architecture to estimate spatiotemporal supply and demand patterns across products and locations. Specifically, dPDS-MF can profile different consumer segments driven by store visiting preferences, measure relationships between store locations, and simultaneously estimate each segment’s product preferences. These model outputs are then used to formulate a choice process for the localized assortment optimization problem. We apply our proposed framework to the retail vending market in major train stations in Japan. We demonstrate the face validity of the model outputs for guiding the selections of products at each location. We also show that the localized assortments generated by our framework are more meaningful and practical than benchmark strategies in the literature. Beyond the core model, we introduce several methodological extensions, highlighting the flexibility of the framework in addressing real-world retail scenarios and laying a foundation for future research.",

          "authors": "Yusuf Ercan ÖZERCAN",
          "abstract": "The European Union (EU) aims to realize the energy transition by increasing renewable energy production and enhancing the flexibility of the energy system. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, which enables electric vehicles (EVs) to both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, presents a particularly important opportunity to contribute to this goal. However, this technology faces legal and regulatory barriers in some EU Member States, including Spain. This article investigates the contribution of V2G technology to sector coupling and examines its potential participation in balancing markets, with a specific focus on the Spanish context. Balancing markets are technically well-suited for V2G participation, but Spain's current legislation presents significant barriers. While EU level regulations supporting the integration of V2G technology were introduced under the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, Spain’s delayed or incomplete transposition of these rules into national law continues to prevent V2G from entering the Spanish electricity balancing markets. The article analyzes the key legal and regulatory factors behind this limitation, particularly the market design favoring large-scale centralized production and the absence of a legal framework for independent aggregators. Nevertheless, it concludes that recent and ongoing legislative developments in Spain offer promising signs that these obstacles may be removed in the near future. This analysis is limited to legal and regulatory aspects and does not address technical, economic, or social dimensions of V2G deployment, which are also critical to achieving full integration.",

          "authors": "Jonathan R. Brauer",
          "abstract": "Criminological research often fails to achieve cumulative theoretical progress despite methodological sophistication. Paul Meehl’s concept of “logical derivation chains” provides a diagnostic framework for understanding this persistent problem, yet it remains largely absent from criminological practice. Using Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory as a detailed case study, including empirical analysis illustrating potential measurement incoherence, I argue that loose derivation chains are structural features of social scientific inquiry rather than correctable methodological problems. Through systematic analysis of sampling, measurement, and analytical choices, I reveal how auxiliary assumptions accumulate throughout the research process, creating compound derivation chain failures. The analysis identifies a “correlation paradox” where a correlation of r = -.31 (p &lt; 2e-16), typically celebrated as impressive empirical support, corresponds to theoretical failure for 39% of individual cases. Contemporary statistical methods systematically privilege aggregate patterns over individual variation, rendering theoretically crucial anomalies invisible and creating research programs that appear progressive despite exhibiting degenerating characteristics. The analysis concludes with strategies for constraint-aware research, including individual-level prediction assessment and item-specific analysis that reveal theoretically important anomalies hidden by aggregate correlations, alongside institutional reforms that encourage genuine theoretical advancement over mere accumulation of supportive correlations.",

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

          "abstract": "Both freedom of movement and voting in European elections are fundamental citizenship rights at the heart of European integration. Ideally, EU citizens should be able to exercise both rights simultaneously. Yet, in practice, tensions exist between the two: Despite their strong emotional attachment to the Europe-an Union, EU citizens living outside their country of citizenship have a reduced likelihood to vote in European elections, even when they reside within the EU. This article demonstrates this pattern empirically for German emigrants in the 2019 European Parliament election, based on data from the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS). This survey is unique in that it covers both mobile German citizens who currently live abroad and those who have lived abroad, but have recently returned to Germany. Self-reported turnout was signif-icantly reduced among those currently living abroad. Bureaucratic hurdles (in-cluding early opt-in registration deadlines, complex registration procedures, and tedious access to ballot) are identified as a key explanation for the decreased par-ticipation. These findings seem to contradict basic democratic principles and could have political implications: Since there are more than eleven million mo-bile EU citizens who are eligible to vote, reduced turnout among this group could affect election outcomes.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article revisits the longstanding contrast between Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Oscar Lewis’s culture-of-poverty paradigm in order to explain how individuals living under persistent structural constraints navigate moral and material survival strategies. Drawing on 216 in-depth interviews from disadvantaged Dutch neighbourhoods, we demonstrate that poor residents deploy an embodied, relational agency—shaped by field-specific conversion capacities and symbolic valuations—rather than conform to a static sub-culture of deprivation. In the formal labour market, they confront conversion barriers and symbolic violence that devalue their existing capital; in the informal economy, they engage a morally regulated system of trust and reciprocity to generate unreported income; in welfare bureaucracies, they resist and sometimes withdraw under coercive compliance regimes; in their communities, they negotiate territorial stigma through moral boundary-making; and in social networks, they temper the “strength of weak ties” with honour and risk calculations. These findings reveal that survival under constraint is best understood through habitus-informed dispositions that both enable adaptive practices and reproduce field-specific logics. We argue that recognising “relational agency under constraint” offers a richer theoretical framework than culture-of-poverty stereotypes and carries significant implications for policy design, which must address both structural barriers and the moral dimensions of poverty.",

Although several LD classes scored significantly lower than the regular classes on the pre-test, the results demonstrated significant gains from the pre-test to the post-test for each class, with the LD classes reaching performance levels comparable to the post-test scores of the non-LD classes. These gains are attributed to the unique design features of the Hands-On Equations Level I manipulatives and the explicit and systematic instruction.",

El texto introduce seis marcos conceptuales contemporáneos, provenientes de distintas tradiciones del pensamiento complejo, capaces de pensar la multiplicidad de capas en conflicto que operan simultáneamente sobre un mismo territorio, así como las trayectorias inestables y los quiebres que redefinen lo urbano como acontecimiento. Estas teorías son traducidas a categorías de análisis espacial que permiten leer la manifestación como la forma más aguda de producción urbana: una coreografía incontrolable, un montaje de escenas simultáneas y un laboratorio proyectual para imaginar nuevas herramientas arquitectónicas capaces de registrar, intervenir o acompañar la vitalidad inestable de la ciudad en conflicto.\n\nThis text explores the urban protest as a phenomenon of maximum complexity, focusing on the simultaneity and unpredictability that define urban space.

Through six theoretical frameworks —three addressing simultaneity (superimposed networks, layered meanings, living structures) and three addressing unpredictability (emergence, contingent trajectories, rupture)— the chapter constructs a conceptual foundation to understand the protest as the urban event par excellence. Each group is translated into a spatial category of analysis, enabling its graphic representation. Far from remaining in theoretical abstraction, the text offers an operative approach for reading the city through its excess and intensity, ultimately proposing a new grammar for architectural practice.",

          "abstract": "Este texto aborda la manifestación política desde su sustancia constitutiva: la masa. A través de una lectura crítica del libro Masa y poder de Elias Canetti, se desarrollan cuatro aproximaciones que permiten pensar a la masa como agente arquitectónico. En primer lugar, se distingue que no toda masa es manifestación, lo cual delimita el campo de estudio. Luego, se la aborda como figura móvil y como usuario colectivo que desafía los marcos tradicionales del proyecto urbano. Finalmente, se estudia su capacidad de producir estructuras espaciales efímeras, reconociendo en la manifestación una forma de arquitectura no proyectada pero efectiva. La reflexión avanza así una crítica a las herramientas de la arquitectura contemporánea, proponiendo una nueva gramática proyectual que incorpore la inestabilidad, la multiplicidad y la intensidad como condiciones fundamentales. \n\nThis text approaches political manifestation from its constitutive substance: the mass. Through a critical reading of Crowds and Power by Elias Canetti, it develops four perspectives that allow us to think of the mass as an architectural agent. First, it distinguishes that not every mass is a manifestation, thereby delimiting the scope of study. It then examines the mass as a mobile figure and a collective user that challenges the traditional frameworks of urban design. Finally, it explores its capacity to produce ephemeral spatial structures, recognizing in the manifestation a form of architecture that is unplanned yet effective. The reflection thus advances a critique of contemporary architectural tools, proposing a new projective grammar that incorporates instability, multiplicity, and intensity as fundamental conditions.",

          "authors": "Elías Barczuk Pasamán",
          "abstract": "Este texto propone una crítica radical al concepto de “espacio público” desde el análisis espacial de la manifestación política. Frente a la retórica abstracta y normativa que acompaña esta categoría, se plantea la necesidad de sustituirla por una noción más operativa: la calle. A través de un recorrido teórico y etimológico, se desmontan las bases de la idea contemporánea del espacio público, revelando su carácter ideológico y su función como instrumento de control. En contraposición, la calle se presenta como un escenario de cotidianeidad y conflictividad, donde lo urbano se manifiesta en su forma más cruda. A partir de cinco categorías conceptuales derivadas de las cinco hipótesis de investigación de este proyecto, el texto construye una mirada alternativa para pensar la ciudad desde el gesto y no desde la norma, proponiendo así una vía crítica para la arquitectura y el urbanismo contemporáneo.\n\nThis text offers a radical critique of the concept of “public space” through the spatial analysis of political manifestations. In contrast to the abstract and normative rhetoric that accompanies this category, it argues for its replacement by a more operative notion: the street. Through a theoretical and etymological exploration, it dismantles the foundations of the contemporary idea of public space, exposing its ideological character and its function as an instrument of control. In opposition, the street is presented as a scene of everyday life and conflict, where the urban reveals itself in its rawest form. Drawing on five conceptual categories derived from the five research hypotheses of this project, the text constructs an alternative perspective from which to think the city—not from the norm, but from the gesture—thus proposing a critical path forward for contemporary architecture and urbanism.",

          "abstract": "Este texto analiza los motivos por los cuales ciertas manifestaciones políticas eligen unos lugares específicos por sobre otros dentro del tejido urbano. Se parte del supuesto de que, a pesar de la pérdida progresiva de espontaneidad en las protestas contemporáneas, estas siguen operando como respuestas tácticas que inscriben conflicto en la ciudad. Se propone una teoría basada en tres tiempos —tradición, conversación y repercusión— que permite clasificar los modos de ocupación del espacio público no como compartimentos estancos, sino como intensidades combinadas. A través de ejemplos recientes de la ciudad de Barcelona, se muestra cómo las protestas retoman lógicas heredadas de rituales religiosos, celebraciones populares, guerras, actos teatrales y escenificaciones urbanas. Se evidencia así que, incluso en un contexto de control creciente, las manifestaciones reaparecen allí donde el orden presenta fisuras. Cada elección espacial es leída como síntesis compleja entre memoria, mensaje y proyección, y como acto político de inscripción en el territorio.\n\nThis text explores why certain political demonstrations choose specific locations within the urban fabric over others. It begins with the premise that, despite the progressive loss of spontaneity in contemporary protests, they continue to function as tactical responses that inscribe conflict into the city. A theoretical framework based on three temporalities—tradition, conversation, and repercussion—is proposed, allowing protest spaces to be classified not as fixed categories, but as overlapping intensities. Through recent examples from the city of Barcelona, the text reveals how demonstrations inherit logics from religious rituals, popular celebrations, wars, theatrical acts, and urban scenographies. It argues that, even within a context of increasing control, demonstrations reappear wherever the urban order shows fissures. Each spatial decision is read as a complex synthesis of memory, message, and projection, and as a political act of inscription in the territory.",

          "abstract": "Este texto parte de la hipótesis de que la manifestación no solo recorre la ciudad, sino que la reescribe. Desde una lectura semiológica inspirada en Barthes, se propone entender la ciudad como un lenguaje, y al caminar como su forma más elemental de enunciación. A partir de allí, se reconstruye una genealogía crítica del caminar —de la deriva situacionista al flâneur moderno, del paseo estético a la marcha política— que culmina en la manifestación como práctica de escritura urbana. Se analizan sus recorridos, sus ritmos y sus tácticas como una gramática en acto, capaz de interrumpir, reinscribir y disputar el sentido del espacio. El análisis no solo sitúa al caminar como operación proyectual, sino que define a la manifestación como acto de enunciación que reconfigura temporalmente la ciudad y revela las tensiones estructurales de su orden urbano. \n\nThis text is based on the hypothesis that a political demonstration does not merely move through the city—it rewrites it. Drawing from a semiological reading inspired by Barthes, the city is understood as a language, and walking as its most basic form of enunciation. From this perspective, a critical genealogy of walking is reconstructed—from the Situationist dérive to the modern flâneur, from the aesthetic stroll to the political march—culminating in the protest as a practice of urban writing. Its routes, rhythms, and tactics are analyzed as a living grammar capable of interrupting, reinscribing, and disputing the meaning of space. The analysis not only frames walking as a projective operation, but also defines the demonstration as an act of enunciation that temporarily reconfigures the city and reveals the structural tensions of its urban order.",

          "authors": "Katja Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Recent reports have drawn attention to a growing ideological divide between young men and women in several Western societies, with women becoming more progressive while men lean increasingly conservative. Although widely discussed, this phenomenon lacks a robust theoretical framework and empirical validation. This study is the first to investigate this pattern in the German context. Based on original survey data collected in 2022, this paper examines nuanced gender differences across cohorts on a range of socio-cultural issues. The findings reveal a widening gender gap among younger cohorts - doubling in size compared to the oldest cohort. Young women, propelled by higher educational attainment and personal investment in progressive issues, emerge as the most progressive group. In contrast, young men show little to no attitudinal change across cohorts, maintaining similar levels of conservatism as their predecessors. One explanatory mechanism appears to be perceptions of fairness: young men view inclusive measures only acceptable if they feel like they are getting their own fair share in society. These findings suggest that recognition of marginalized groups is increasingly viewed through a zero-sum lens, indicating a deepening and likely persistent divide in socio-cultural attitudes with far-reaching implications for gender relations, political polarization, and social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we ask whether broader societal changes in Germany over the last three decades have been accompanied by a secular rise or decline in public concerns about crime. We conceptualize the aggregate effect of these changes as a period effect to be identified in a framework of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Upon evaluation of previous research, we argue that the secular trend is challenging to identify directly both for empirical and theoretical reasons. However, using Fosse and Winship’s bounding approach to APC analysis, we show that the challenge can be resolved indirectly, and identify a declining period trend under an intuitive and theoretically warranted assumption that crime concerns are unlikely to decrease from late adolescence into adulthood.",

These levels interact in a vicious cycle, reinforcing each other; macro constraints weaken micro standards, while negative micro experiences jeopardize macro sustainability. \nResults: Piecemeal reforms are ineffective. Overcoming the crisis requires an integrated systemic paradigm that links fundamental macro financial and governance reforms with the effective guaranteeing of rights and responsibilities at the micro level of service delivery to achieve sustainable resilience.",

          "abstract": "Guided by the social information processing models, this multi-method longitudinal study presents the first attempt to examine attentional processes through which interparental conflict may spillover to shape maternal and paternal parenting. Specifically, we examined whether maternal and paternal attention biases for a child's face may operate as indirect factors in the association between interparental conflict and both parents’ power-assertive discipline. Data were drawn from a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 235; 55.3% female; 56.2% of children were White, 21.3% were African American, and 16.2% were identified as mixed race), and we focused on the second (Child Mean age = 3.88 years old, N = 217) and the third waves. Parents’ attention biases for child emotions were measured by the dot-probe task, where we innovatively used child emotion expressions as the stimulus. For mothers, greater exposure to interparental conflicts was linked to elevated attention biases towards anger, which in turn was associated with a higher likelihood for power-assertive discipline. Follow-up analyses for power-assertive discipline across the moral and prudential domains indicated that such effect was particularly related to child transgression within the moral domain. In contrast, for fathers, we did not find significant indirect effects of attention biases for child faces that might account for spillover processes. Findings promoted the understanding of the process underlying the spillover of interparental conflict within the family system as well as maternal vs. paternal differences.",

          "abstract": "Recognition that discrimination can occur explicitly due to age/childhood – that children are \ndiscriminated against simply for being children – remains limited. Yet, numerous examples exist of \nchildren being treated less favorably than adults solely on the basis of age. This is also the case in \nmigration law, despite various measures aimed at preventing the ‘double vulnerability’ of migrant \nchildren from placing them at a disadvantage compared to adults.\nThis paper aims to examine discrimination based on age/childhood in the context of migration law \nby drawing on examples related to the child’s right to be heard, the assessment of asylum claims, and \naccess to family reunification. It explores the potential of the principle of non-discrimination, as \nexpressed in Article 2 of the CRC, to address adverse differential treatment of children relative to \nadults in migration contexts. The argument is made that systematically invoking Article 2 of the CRC \nto identify unequal treatment based on age has the potential to strengthen the rights of children in \nparticularly vulnerable situations, such as migration, and to challenge prevailing assumptions about \nthe legitimacy of, in practice, according children fewer or more limited rights than adults solely on \nthe basis of age",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Principle of Economic Entropy Increase to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of economic growth: through the expansion of scale and diversification of structure, economic systems overcome both quantitative and structural forms of scarcity. Building on the concept of economic entropy, the study develops a dual-dimensional model—scale entropy and structural entropy—to enable the quantitative assessment of entropy dynamics within economic systems. Economic entropy increase originates from the system’s intrinsic structural demands and determines the macro trajectory of institutional evolution. Accordingly, this paper is the first to propose and systematically demonstrate the core proposition that the market economy constitutes the fundamental trajectory of economic evolution. Market economies, with their superior self-organizing and adaptive capacities, embody high-entropy structures; in contrast, planned economies, constrained by “long-chain interventions” that crowd out market mechanisms, exhibit low-entropy structures and are ultimately to be superseded. This framework offers a new lens for understanding economic growth, institutional selection, and the evolution of complex systems, with significant implications for policy design and economic governance.",

          "abstract": "Chetty et al. (2022) present compelling evidence that economic connectedness—the connection between people from low- and high-income backgrounds measured using Facebook data—is a strong predictor of upward social mobility in the United States. Their analysis, based on a global regression model, offers a powerful national perspective but implicitly assumes spatial uniformity in this relationship. Building on their work, this study reexamines that assumption by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) to the same datasets. GWR enables coefficients to vary by location, uncovering spatial heterogeneity in the association between economic connectedness and mobility. Our findings reveal considerable regional variation: while strong positive associations are evident in areas like the Northern Plains, weaker or even slightly negative relationships emerge in the South and along the East and West coasts. These results suggest that the impact of economic connectedness may differ meaningfully across geographic contexts. Rather than contradicting the original conclusions, this study highlights the added value of spatially sensitive approaches, which can inform more nuanced and locally tailored policies aimed at enhancing upward mobility in diverse communities across the United States.",

The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

The literature on money in politics debates whether \"small\" individual campaign donors are more ideologically extreme than large donors. This paper reverses the question, investigating whether extreme candidates request smaller contributions from potential donors. Using data from U.S. congressional candidates' fundraising platforms in the 2020 elections, I examine how campaigns typically present a set of suggested donation amounts to solicit money from potential donors efficiently. While party, in-state income levels, and the usage of major fundraising platforms mattered, ideological extremism had no bearing on the amounts candidates asked for. Given that solicitation amounts have been long and easily optimized through A/B testing, I interpret this as extreme candidates not finding it profitable to ask for smaller amounts, which is more aligned with the view that small donors are not more ideologically extreme than large donors.",

Using Google Trends data from September 2018 to March 2025, it constructs innovative time series variables to capture the U.S. public agenda. The analysis reveals a structural shift in public sentiment beginning in October 2023. Prior to that, opinion was largely reactive to isolated extreme events. Afterward, discourse was driven by polarized narratives: (far)-left slogans such as “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea,” and far-right apocalyptic themes, proxied by interest in Jesus’ Second Coming. Moderate positions—such as “Gaza Genocide” and “Stand with Israel”—are generally marginal. These findings suggest a potential trajectory toward radical U.S. policy on the Israel–Palestine conflict. Future research should explore whether other Trump–Vance administration policies also reflect this apocalyptic public outlook.",

          "abstract": "Most smoking cessation research targets individuals intending to quit smoking, leaving a research and practice gap for individuals not actively contemplating quitting. Chatbots are easy-to-use scalable platforms to deliver behavior change interventions. Our goal was to develop and test acceptability and feasibility of a chatbot for people who are ambivalent about quitting smoking.  We completed two studies. In Study 1, n=309 people completed a cross-sectional survey that assessed user preferences for the proposed prototype using a discrete choice experiment. Three primary attributes were identified for the chatbot and programmed for user testing.  In Study 2, n=20 participants engaged with the chatbot for a 2-week period. Participants reported a significant reduction in the strength of their strongest urge over the 14-day period (t=-3.32; p&lt;.005). Our proof-of-concept chatbot prototype was acceptable and feasible. Next steps include refining our chatbot intervention prototype with enhanced participant-elicited preferences and efficacy testing in a larger-scale trial.",

          "abstract": "Healthcare systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges in balancing quality care delivery with environmental responsibility and economic viability. This article presents a comprehensive framework for sustainable healthcare implementation based on the triple bottom line approach, integrating economic prosperity, environmental quality, and social equity dimensions. Drawing from recent research and practical implementation strategies, particularly in Nordic healthcare contexts, this study examines innovative approaches including digital transformation, renewable energy adoption, green building standards, and community engagement initiatives. The framework demonstrates how healthcare institutions can achieve carbon neutrality while maintaining operational excellence and expanding access to underserved populations. Key findings indicate that integrated sustainability approaches can reduce operational costs by up to 30% while improving patient outcomes and staff satisfaction. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on sustainable healthcare practices and provides actionable insights for healthcare administrators, policymakers, and sustainability professionals.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former while following a lognormal distribution with the risk noise following a normal distribution). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option is an equity bond whose price minus the present value mirrors the overcharge or transaction cost. Our examples show how to compute debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misevaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "This review article examines interdisciplinary research on local religious congregations and their role as social service providers in American communities. This field of study has experienced sustained growth over the past thirty years, generating extensive qualitative and quantitative research on an estimated 350,000 congregations serving approximately 50 million weekly attendees. The analysis explores how congregations function as community institutions, their evolving relationships with surrounding neighborhoods, and factors influencing their social service involvement. Key findings reveal that congregations vary significantly in their community engagement, influenced by financial resources, leadership education levels, and ideological orientation. Middle-class congregations in lower-income neighborhoods show the highest levels of social service activity. Most congregations offer short-term assistance through food, shelter, and clothing programs, typically collaborating with secular agencies rather than operating independent programs. The collective contribution represents a substantial supplement to public social services. As community anchors embedded in local networks, congregations continue to shape and be shaped by their broader social context, making congregational studies a vital field for understanding American community life.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the strategic potential of city branding in African urban contexts through a case study of Accra, Ghana. Drawing on Hankinson’s Relational Network Model and Herstein’s Country–City–Region Branding Matrix, the research assesses how Accra can be positioned as a distinct and competitive urban brand within Ghana’s multicultural national framework. The analysis, based on secondary data, reveals significant opportunities in Accra’s cultural assets, diaspora engagement, and sustainability initiatives. However, it also highlights fragmentation in governance, limited stakeholder coordination, and the absence of a coherent brand architecture. Comparative insights from Seoul, Barcelona, and Cape Town demonstrate how city branding can be effectively institutionalized through participatory governance, strategic communication, and cultural investment. The paper concludes with policy recommendations aimed at integrating branding into Accra’s urban planning and development agenda. It argues that a stakeholder-driven, contextually grounded branding strategy could enhance Accra’s global visibility while complementing Ghana’s broader national identity goals.",

          "authors": "Hyemin Han",
          "abstract": "Researchers and educators have found that college students, who are entering young adulthood, are experiencing radical transitions to become independent individuals. Studies in moral psychology suggest that developmental changes occurring during this transitional period likely impact people’s flourishing in social and civic domains in the long term. Hence, educators working in higher education may need to understand moral development among college students well to facilitate the students’ positive youth development in their instruction and mentorship. In this chapter, I will overview theories and research findings about moral development among college students while considering their educational implications. Furthermore, I will suggest several educational strategies to promote ethical and positive development based on evidence to inform higher education instructors interested in promoting ethical development and flourishing in college students. At the beginning of the chapter, I will briefly review existing theories and empirical findings about moral development in various functional domains during late adolescence and young adulthood, where most college students are situated, for readers’ information. First, the classical theory of moral development focusing on moral judgment and reasoning, the (Neo-)Kohlbergian theory will be reviewed. According to this model, college students are experiencing the formation and consolidation of the postconventional schema, which is required for a sophisticated moral judgment to deal with complicated socio-moral issues. Second, I will examine recent advances in research on moral development during young adulthood that approach ethical development and functioning as multifaceted phenomena. These will include studies on positive youth development in moral domains (e.g., civic purpose development involving concerns on the beyond-the-self beings) and practical wisdom (phronesis) development. These novel research findings will provide integrative and comprehensive theoretical models of ethical functioning and development in college students. Given the classical developmental model could not completely address the gap between judgment and behavior, the up-to-date theories mentioned above will shed light on understanding the mechanism of ethical motivation and behavior for improving education. In the next part of the chapter, I will suggest several practical guidelines for instructors in higher education who intend to promote their students’ moral and positive development based on multidisciplinary research in moral psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science (particularly artificial intelligence research). I will focus on the role of instructors as students’ moral models and mentors assisting in exploring and expanding their ethical horizons and implementing learned morals and virtues into action in diverse situations and contexts. Findings from multidisciplinary research will be overviewed to support the necessity of the modeling and mentoring approach in ethics education in higher education. Furthermore, several instructional strategies to boost the effectiveness of the modeling and mentoring-based approach will be introduced along with supporting evidence from empirical studies.",

          "abstract": "How open access (OA) should be supported has been a frequent point of debate during the last three decades as different pathways have been created and evolved. One particular point of contention has been the use of institutional contracts between customer institutions and academic journal publishers, so-called transformative agreements (TAs), where subscription-based reading access is bundled with OA publishing rights. This study explores the motivational reasonings given by customers and publishers engaging with TAs. This study provides a thematic content analysis of customer and publisher statements from 95 press releases announcing new TAs involving five large scholarly journal publishers. Existing literature on motivational reasoning for open science, OA, and TAs was reviewed in order to create an initial set of codes to be used, which was complemented with an inductive process producing additional codes based on categorisation of reasonings that did not fit within the initial codes.The study found that TAs were supported for a variety of reasons, where both customers and publishers stressed better research dissemination, facilitating a transition towards OA publishing, and improved workflow management for publishing and invoicing. Customers emphasized economic and equality aspects while publishers did so to a notably lesser degree. This study complements the active area of bibliometric studies on TAs with a rich qualitative study based on a set of press releases that have not been used for this type of research, establishing a solid foundation for future studies to build upon.",

          "abstract": "We analyzed the moral valence of elite rhetoric on climate change in Norway (1,039 opinion articles across 5 years) and examined whether morally framing climate mitigation appeals to match people’s own values affected attitudes. Using a novel method for computational text analysis, we found elite rhetoric increasingly emphasized moral universalism (care, equality) over particularism (loyalty, authority, purity). In a survey experiment (N = 3,868), universalist values predicted agreement with all climate mitigation appeals regardless of framing, while particularist values predicted disagreement with all but one appeal. This appeal, focusing on national interests and respect for local communities, resonated strongly with particularists and reduced political polarization in appeal agreement, but was underrepresented in elite rhetoric relative to more divisive framings. However, moral frame exposure showed no downstream effects on broader climate attitudes. Nevertheless, we argue that the universalist bias evident in elite rhetoric may contribute to polarization over time.",

          "abstract": "The phenomenon of hijrah among the millennial generation has developed into a rapid socio-religious trend in the digital era. The hijrah community promoted by social media creates new values ​​and norms that differ from traditional religious understanding. This article aims to analyze how social values ​​and norms are formed in the millennial hijrah community and how this process shapes the religious identity of its members. Using a descriptive qualitative approach and literature study methods and social media content analysis, this study reveals that values ​​such as ukhuwah, public piety, and the spirit of da'wah are the dominant norms in the hijrah community. The process of forming these values ​​is explained through Peter L. Berger's social construction theory (externalization, objectification, and internalization), and is strengthened by Ibn Khaldun's Islamic sociology approach and gender norm studies from Syamsul Bakhri's works. The results of the study show that the hijrah community not only forms a new religious identity, but also influences the structure of social relations, gender roles, and religious expressions in the digital space.",

          "authors": "Nilanjan Raghunath; Vincent Chua",
          "abstract": "Mentoring is widely recognized as a catalyst for upward social mobility among youth from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. However, relatively little is known about how disadvantaged youth negotiate and experience effective mentoring relationships in practice. This study addresses that gap by examining the barriers and enabling factors that influence whether these young people can benefit from mentorship. The study employs a mixed-methods design, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data from Singaporean youth (ages 18–25) residing in public housing. This paper reports the qualitative results of the study, while the quantitative results are reported in a different paper published in a journal. The analysis explores personal narratives to illuminate the interplay of factors that shape access to mentoring relationships and the potential of these relationships to improve the life outcomes of low-SES youths. The findings indicate that low-SES youth in Singapore rely heavily on family and peer networks for guidance in decision-making, yet struggle to engage in formal mentoring relationships that provide practical, relevant support aligned with their aspirations and needs. These results underscore the importance of applying a social capital lens to mentorship initiatives, integrating them with youths’ existing support systems to ensure that guidance is meaningful for their upward mobility.\n\nThis research is funded by the Social Mobility Foundation (LKYSPP, NUS)",

          "abstract": "This research note engages political trust debates by foregrounding tiwala (trust) and pagsunod (submission) as relational, moral practices in Philippine urban governance. Drawing on five pilot interviews in Barangay Pinagbuhatan, Pasig City, it argues that trust is not merely an evaluative attitude or rational calculation but a dynamic, culturally mediated moral economy. This perspective challenges dominant Western-centric models that treat trust as a rational, pre-political disposition stabilizing democratic order. Building on an emerging trust cultures framework, the note shows how tiwala and pagsunod reveal trust as continuously contested and reshaped in everyday negotiations of care, legitimacy, and relational presence. These preliminary insights highlight how residents’ moral evaluations of leaders go beyond personalistic charisma to assess governance systems’ responsiveness and moral credibility. They also point to how hybrid governance environments—digital and face-to-face—shape trust cultures in transitional democracies. These reflections guide future comparative work across the Tiwala at Pagsunod (TaP) project’s three-city study.",

In the present research, I test the hypothesis that asking about criteria of nationhood using ranking would result in clearer factor structure than the commonly applied rating. I present robust evidence derived from confirmatory factor analyses that the models run on ranking data surpass the same models ran on rating data. A common factor model with a random intercept proved the best fitting one. I recommend best to worst ranking (a.k.a., drag and drop ranking) as the method of choice in assessment of the importance of the criteria of nationhood.",

          "abstract": "We conducted a correspondence study to investigate patterns of UK gender-parent hiring discrimination across skill levels before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic as labor supply and demand fluctuated. To test hypotheses, we sent pairs of fictitious call center worker, assistant restaurant manager, and accountant applications in response to 2,262 UK employer job postings between August 2019 and December 2021. We find no hiring discrimination against mothers applying for call center or accounting positions as compared with childless women during any period, and some disadvantage for mothers applying for assistant restaurant manager positions only pre-lockdown. Among men, only low-skilled fathers were more likely to be called back than childless men before and after the lockdowns, with a significant decrease in their hiring advantage during the pandemic. These results firstly indicate that employers rely more on assumptions about group productivity when male applicants lack objective measures of productivity. The drop in callbacks during lockdowns further suggests low-skilled fathers’ dramatic increase in caregiving and housework negatively affected employers’ perceptions of their greater productivity.",

          "abstract": "In the digital age, gambling has evolved from traditional physical spaces to virtual platforms easily accessible via smartphones. This shift has significantly impacted the gambling industry's profits, particularly in sports betting, which is heavily intertwined with football. Gambling companies have strategically aligned their products with masculinity and football fandom, fostering what some call the \"gamblification\" of football culture. In this climate, research has highlighted the multitude of harms associated with gambling, especially among vulnerable groups like young men. Public health interventions, such as the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) program, have leveraged the cultural significance of football clubs to promote healthy lifestyles and behaviour change. We carried out research that aimed to adapt this kind of intervention to address gambling harm among men through a programme we named Football Fans and Betting (FFAB). However, despite its intentions, FFAB faced a number of challenges related to the normalization of gambling within football environments and the stigma associated with seeking help for gambling problems. This paper examines the intersection of masculinity, football, and gambling harm prevention through the lens of the FFAB program. It suggests that disrupting the harmful relationship between gambling, sports, and masculinity requires contesting entrenched cultural norms and industry practices. It calls for tighter regulatory control, challenging responsible gambling discourse, and creating discursive spaces where men can address gambling harm without stigma. By reframing gambling harm as a systemic issue, attention can be redirected toward industry accountability and the creation of safer environments for vulnerable individuals.",

          "abstract": "The article examines the links between archaeology, nationalism and (crypto-)colonialism using the example of Iran. The starting point is that archaeology has been not only a scientific enterprise but also a deeply political project since its emergence. The central question is how archaeological knowledge has been instrumentalised in colonial and post-colonial contexts to construct national identities - often marginalising or ignoring cultural plurality.\nParticular attention is paid to the concept of crypto-colonialism, which describes the paradoxical power relations in formally independent but de facto hegemonic states such as Iran. In the area of conflict between adaptation to Western standards and self-assertion through recourse to an idealised pre-Islamic past, an archaeological practice developed that actively supported state power.\nCase studies are used to analyse the role of archaeology as an instrument of knowledge and power. The aim is to show the entanglements of researchers and to provide impulses for a critical-reflexive, decolonising archaeology.",

          "abstract": "The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) re-emergence as a major world power has prompted substantial questions regarding its aims and the potential for future global conflict. While many studies have approached these questions through the traditional lenses of foreign and security policy analysis, this study undertakes an analysis of contemporary Chinese popular cinema. The core premise is that popular media like cinema are important components of social systems of meaning making, informing everyday strategic ontologies of the international system. Film offers insight into how societies understand themselves as political actors in relation to others on the world stage, both reflecting and reinforcing dominant strategic ontologies. Our discourse analysis of 20 recent box office hits in the PRC thus provides clues into potential future policymaking logics. Within the article, we place particular emphasis on how representations of self and other enable and bound PRC agency on the world stage. Among multiple findings, we argue that the films reveal that the PRC understands itself as, above all, a status quo power with great respect for both international law and other actors’ sovereignty—a positive sign for those hoping to avoid military conflict. Nevertheless, the films also highlight deep and longstanding grievances over foreign interference in the PRC’s regional sphere of influence that have the potential to stoke conflict if aggravated in the future.",

          "authors": "Dinesh Deckker; Subhashini Sumanasekara",
          "abstract": "The number 13 is widely regarded as unlucky in many Western societies, yet its symbolic meaning varies significantly across global cultures. This superstition, known as triskaidekaphobia, raises questions about the interplay between myth, cognition, and cultural transmission. This study aimed to investigate the origins, evolution, and cross-cultural symbolism of the number 13, exploring how it has been constructed as a taboo or sacred number across different civilisations and religious systems. Adopting a qualitative narrative inquiry and comparative analysis approach, the study synthesised data from religious texts, mythologies, historical documents, scholarly literature, and architectural practices. Theoretical frameworks from symbolic anthropology, cognitive psychology, and sociology guided the interpretation of the data. Findings reveal that the fear of 13 is not universal but culturally contingent. In Christian and Norse traditions, it is associated with betrayal and cosmic disruption; in Ancient Egyptian, Hindu, and Maya cultures, it symbolises spiritual transformation and cosmic order. The modern institutionalisation of the taboo in Western architecture and media reflects the power of narrative and collective belief over objective reasoning. The number 13 functions as a symbolic threshold—its meaning derived from narrative structure, cultural boundaries, and cognitive heuristics. This study underscores the importance of viewing numeric taboos as culturally produced phenomena rather than inherent superstitions.",

          "abstract": "This research note focuses on the relationship between gender ideological pairings and the division of paid and unpaid work for different-sex couples around the transition to parenthood. We examine the social stratification of couples’ attitudinal-work arrangements, paying particular attention to the combined social classes of the partners. We contribute to the literature by adopting a linked-lives approach and explicitly considering couples as a meaningful unit of analysis; by jointly examining the three domains of ideological pairing, the gender division of paid work, and the gender division of unpaid work; and by including an often-overlooked driver of life course patterns, namely social class. We analyze panel data from Understanding Society, the largest household panel study providing a representative sample of the UK population, using multi-domain sequence analysis and logistic regression techniques. Our findings suggest a striking stability in couples’ ideological pairings and division of domestic labor around the transition to parenthood, with a preponderance of partners agreeing on traditional gender roles and women doing most of the housework. However, labor arrangements vary widely between couples, and social class (especially the class of the female partner) emerges as a critical determinant of how partners share paid work.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "Generative AI systems are increasingly integrated into knowledge workflows, yet their fluency and speed can obscure a critical threat: the erosion of epistemic integrity. Users may imitate AI outputs, converge prematurely, or misinterpret confidence as understanding—producing brittle knowledge loops that collapse under scrutiny.\nThis paper introduces a dual-friction framework to address these risks. The Memetic Design Loop models how mimetic desire and semantic drift unfold across human–AI exchanges, highlighting the cognitive vulnerabilities induced by fast, confident AI. To counteract this, we propose design interventions that embed intentional slowness, divergence, and reflective scaffolding into AI-mediated reasoning environments.\nDrawing from epistemic friction theory, mimetic philosophy, and regenerative design principles, we present a methodology that resists premature closure by foregrounding attentional rhythm, deliberative pause, and conceptual variation. We also offer a two-layered evaluative lens focused not on performance, but on epistemic resilience: the system’s capacity to sustain plurality, preserve semantic coherence, and foster reflective trust.\nAI systems do not merely process information—they shape the cognitive environments in which decisions are made, beliefs are formed, and knowledge is legitimized. As such, they must be studied not only as technical tools, but as socio-technical systems: assemblages of algorithms, interfaces, cultural norms, institutional logics, and human desires. This paper contributes to an interdisciplinary discourse at the intersection of design theory, epistemology, and social science by articulating how AI interfaces co-produce epistemic authority, and how design choices encode political, ethical, and cognitive consequences. We position friction not just as a technical affordance, but as a cultural and epistemic intervention—opening space for dissent, pluralism, and attentional agency in systems increasingly optimized for speed and conformity. In doing so, the work aligns with ongoing debates in science and technology studies (STS), critical AI ethics, and the sociology of knowledge infrastructures, offering both a critique and a design philosophy for preserving epistemic sovereignty in AI-augmented societies.",

Voters with reciprocity concerns are both prospective—that is, seek to select competent politicians—and retrospective—that is, reward fair actions and punish unfair ones. We focus on how electoral incentives induce politicians to exert effort (electoral control) and how voters remove incompetent politicians (electoral screening). We show that taking voters’ reciprocity concerns into account has important normative implications and can overturn results from standard models that neglect them: increasing transparency about the incumbent’s effort improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently strong reciprocity concerns; increasing benefits from office improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently low reciprocity concerns. Moreover, we show that reciprocity concerns can affect electoral screening, by affecting the competence threshold incumbents must clear to ensure reelection, generating incumbency advantages or disadvantages.",

Life course research often predicts single life events at specific stages, overlooking the sequential and dynamic nature of human lives. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty in life leads to various potential alternative pathways individuals may encounter. In this study, we perform sequence analysis to gain deeper insights into life course sequences and apply Transformers to model sequences of future life events focusing on individuals in Germany who are approaching retirement age. Our model forecasts these sequences from which we provide probabilistic assessments of alternative pathways. Through our analysis, we identify seven distinct late-career clusters, ranging from stable full-time employment, which exhibit high predictability and certainty, to persistent unemployment and marginal employment, which demonstrate greater volatility and uncertainty. Alternative pathways predicted by the model suggest that individuals in volatile career trajectories might have transitioned into stable employment under different opportunity structures. These findings underscore the potential for stability based on prior life course patterns and highlight the importance of proactive labor market policies. Our framework provides policymakers with actionable insights to design effective interventions aimed at supporting vulnerable populations and enhancing labor market policies.",

          "abstract": "This study presents the first academically grounded framework for developing a national biomethane strategy in Türkiye, addressing a critical gap in renewable gas governance. Using Italy as a comparative reference within a Most Similar Systems Design (MSSD) framework, the paper applies a structured policy transfer approach supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a policy comparability matrix, cosine similarity scoring (0.964), SWOT analysis, and the OECD’s Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) principles.\nThe framework integrates qualitative and quantitative tools to assess alignment in agricultural potential, infrastructure capacity, market regulation, and institutional governance. Key transferable elements from Italy include green certificate schemes, incentive structures for production with grid injection, and stakeholder mechanisms enabling biomethane scale-up. Türkiye’s strengths (e.g., biomass availability), weaknesses (e.g., institutional fragmentation), and opportunities (e.g., EU-aligned reforms) are examined alongside key threats, particularly the intrinsic complexities of its natural gas market and coordination gaps.\nItaly’s experience further informs broader strategic insights: prioritizing biomethane over biomass-based electricity generation, leveraging models like Biogasdoneright to integrate agriculture and energy, and positioning biomethane as a decarbonization tool for transport and industry—especially under the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This transition logic emphasizes biomethane in hard-to-electrify sectors, where it adds more systemic value than traditional biomass-to-electricity uses increasingly served by solar and wind.\nThe paper contributes to comparative energy governance literature by offering a replicable framework for institutional lesson-drawing. It provides actionable insights for emerging economies aiming to align bioenergy policy with long-term energy security, circular economy integration, and sustainability transitions.",

We categorize publishers according to their institutional and organizational characteristics and assess their coverage in WoS, Scopus, and OpenAlex. Our findings show that educational institutions are the dominant publishers in most countries, accounting for over 75% of journals in Colombia and Brazil and over 50% in Mexico, Argentina, and Poland. Finland is an exception, where scientific and professional associations lead (62.0%). Commercial publishers play a minor role, with their highest shares in Turkey (12.1%) and Poland (8.2%).

Drawing on an in-depth qualitative study of persistent poverty in Dutch urban contexts, it integrates empirical evidence with a relational theoretical framework. Building on Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus, field and capital, Archer’s morphogenetic approach, Emirbayer and Mische’s temporally embedded agency, and Lamont’s work on symbolic boundaries, agency is reconceptualised as emergent through social relations yet bounded by structural constraints. The article demonstrates how residents facing long-term poverty act in morally, temporally, and relationally embedded ways—navigating formal and informal economies, negotiating territorial stigma through boundary work, and coping with the symbolic violence of welfare bureaucracy. Agency is shown not as mere free will nor as a structural epiphenomenon, but as a contextually enacted capacity shaped by history and inequality. This advances the relational turn in sociology by illuminating agency’s structural embeddedness.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates how structurally poor urban residents in the Netherlands endeavour to convert limited economic, social and cultural capital into labour-market positions, and why formal routes fail while informal ones partially succeed. Drawing on Bourdieu’s concepts of capital, field, conversion and symbolic violence, we analyse 216 qualitative interviews from Amsterdam-Noord, Rotterdam-Delfshaven and Amsterdam-Bijlmermeer (1997–1999). An abductive thematic coding reveals that, in the formal field, participants encounter multiple barriers: insufficient finances preclude investment in education; welfare regulations penalise training; and low-paid “subsidised” jobs carry heavy stigma and minimal financial gain. In contrast, the informal economy permits partial “conversion” of under-utilised capital via trust-based networks and norms of reciprocity. Acquaintance ties enable odd jobs and self-provisioning, yielding predictable (unreported) incomes while preserving benefits. Yet informal work is illegal, precarious—subject to sanctions and irregular hours—and morally contested by some respondents. Crucially, even precarious informal work sustains dignity and self-worth, whereas formal options are either inaccessible or perceived as demeaning. We theorise these dynamics through Bourdieu’s notion of conversion capacity—the field-specific ability to transform one form of capital into another—and demonstrate that structural inequalities operate through symbolic misrecognition and field-specific logics. Formal fields impose conversion barriers and symbolic violence, devaluing the poor, while informal fields allow limited capital exchange on moral terms. Policy implications include the need to reconceive conversion capacity as relational and field-specific, shifting attention from individual deficits to structural constraints.",

Using survey experiments fielded in The Norwegian Citizen Panel, we assess how AI's role as a decision-support tool affects the importance citizens place on various bureaucratic traits. Our findings suggest that when street-level bureaucrats use AI, citizens will sometimes want bureaucrats that are more similar to themselves, and also tend to consider bureaucrats' technical expertise as less important. This suggests that as AI takes on more of the technical judgments that is part of bureaucratic decision-making, citizens place greater importance on the human elements of bureaucracy, such as shared experiences and empathy. This research highlights the growing need to understand how the use of AI will shift citizens' expectations of public institutions.",

          "abstract": "Persistent poverty often intertwines with humiliating encounters in welfare bureaucracies. This article examines how strict compliance demands can inflict symbolic violence and thereby reproduce poverty. Drawing on 216 in-depth interviews with long-term low-income individuals in the Netherlands, we use abductive qualitative analysis to explore experiences of welfare surveillance and stigma. We find that compliance is frequently experienced as humiliation, leading claimants to withdraw, self-exclude, and suffer relational disempowerment. Bureaucratic practices—through street-level discretion, compliance regimes, and exclusion—impose a demeaning “undeserving” identity on clients. This symbolic violence undermines claimants’ self-worth, discourages benefit take-up, and strains their relationship with the state. The article advances social policy theory by linking welfare compliance struggles to Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic violence and highlights the need for policy reforms to mitigate stigma and empower welfare recipients.

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "Persistent poverty raises questions about the role of social networks in facilitating upward mobility. Granovetter’s classic theory of the “strength of weak ties” posits that weak, bridge‐like ties can connect disadvantaged individuals to new opportunities, yet evidence from impoverished contexts suggests these ties often fail to deliver leverage. This article revisits the weak ties hypothesis in the context of long-term poverty in the Netherlands. Drawing on 216 in-depth interviews with low-income residents of urban neighbourhoods, we examine how social capital operates under conditions of scarcity and constraint. The findings reveal three interrelated dynamics that undermine the potential benefits of weak ties. First, dilemmas of honour and status lead people to avoid exploiting social connections for material gain, as they prioritise dignity and reciprocity norms over opportunism. Second, reciprocity expectations and the work of time show that unmet obligations and temporal lags in exchange erode trust, causing initially supportive ties to wither. Third, risk assessment and the cost of connection highlight how uncertainty and negative past experiences make individuals wary of new or distant contacts. Together, these factors constrain the usefulness of weak ties for getting ahead, even when such ties are present. We discuss how these findings refine social capital theory by illuminating the social processes that temper the “strength” of weak ties in persistently poor communities. Policy efforts to reduce poverty by “building bridges” must account for the contextually rooted norms of honour, reciprocity, and trust that condition network behaviour.",

This article challenges such views by showing that informal economies are structured by dense moral logics and informal systems of trust, control, and symbolic capital. Based on 216 in-depth interviews with low-income residents in disadvantaged Dutch neighbourhoods, the analysis reveals how informal exchanges are morally regulated through norms of honour, respectability, and reputation. These dynamics create boundaries between acceptable help, fair trade, and illegitimate hustling. While trust and informal surveillance foster accountability and solidarity, they also produce exclusionary hierarchies, gendered obligations, and moral tension. Rather than a retreat from norms, informal economies represent a contested moral field where individuals navigate the pressures of scarcity, dignity, and community judgement. The article contributes to theoretical debates on moral economy, social capital, and informal regulation, and cautions against simplistic policy models of self-reliant citizenship. Informality under constraint is not the absence of order—but the presence of a different, often invisible one.",

Our findings lead us to conceptualise ‘sedimented polarisation’—a discursive-material condition where polarisation becomes an empty signifier around which political discursive formations take shape. Despite Reddit’s design allowing cross-community engagement, we find minimal interaction between discursively dissonant spaces. While r/politics is often presented as a space for cross-ideological deliberation and exposure, it fails to function as a town square. We observe a fragmentation across political subreddits and discourses beyond the left-right dichotomy. These patterns emerge from an entanglement of platform design, community moderation practices, user agency, discourses, and broader socio-political contexts.",

While this is an important and intuitive finding, failed coup attempts are very rare events and hence leave large amounts of variation in minister removal unexplained. Autocrats are reactionary when a rare window of opportunity, such as a failed coup attempt, occurs. However, previous work also suggests that they are anticipatory and survival-seeking. We argue that autocratic leaders are strategic actors who take preemptive action against potentially disloyal elites, rather than risking a coup attempt being realized. Using structural coup risk as a lower estimate of a leader's own perception of coup risk, we find that it significantly contributes to the prediction of minister removals. Compared to failed coup attempts, we find that it substantially improves predictive performance across a number of metrics. Our findings contribute to nascent research on government stability and the survival of autocratic leaders.",

          "abstract": "Copyright bares an inner tension between cultural and market values: it historically oscillated between empowering creators through the market and protecting them from the market. How does this tension play in the digital age? To tackle this question, this chapter look at the salient parliamentary debates on the 2019 “copyright in the digital single market” directive, framed as a victory of culture against the market. We contrast this perspective by highlighting that, following the digitalisation of the economy, a new set of values entered the actors’ repertoire: open-access values. Thus, three competing sets of values framed MEPs’ interventions: culture, market, and open access. We argue that in the digital age, the conflict between market and culture that structures copyright policies is rebalanced to fit in a classical market regulation dilemma. Culture values, supporting market regulation to fight GAFA’s monopolies, are opposed to open-access values, supporting a free market to encourage digital innovation. Thus, both sets of values, whereas historically and socially developed in opposition to economic incentives, are mobilised to defend different market approaches (more vs. fewer barriers to entry).",

          "abstract": "Learner engagement is critical to student success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) coursework. However, the character of engagement is still debated. University courses, particularly in STEM, are complex, multi-context environments in which students must cognitively and behaviorally engage in class, recitations/labs, independent study, and high-stakes exams. We hypothesize that students show consistency in how they engage within each of the particular but show much less consistency across these varied contexts. \nKnowledge of the fine-grained structure of learning engagement can be used to refine pedagogy and improve learning outcomes. Applying new engagement survey instruments that were iteratively developed to be contextually meaningful, we first present an exploratory factor analysis applied to 1,176 students from two different courses and institutions. Then we present a confirmatory factor analysis applied to 772 students in a third course. The findings support a model in which places of engagement (e.g., lecture, studying) are central to engagement’s structure, and further, they suggest that each place of engagement has a dominant characteristic (e.g., predominantly cognitive or behavioral). This discovery prompts a reevaluation of prevailing STEM learning engagement theories and improves our understanding of engagement dynamics -factors crucial for improving undergraduate academic success in STEM.",

          "title": "From liberalisation to regulation: managerial political work in the European digital copyright policy (2014–2019)",
          "authors": "Céleste Bonnamy",
          "abstract": "The 2019 Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market represents an intriguing departure from the anticipated path of liberalisation in public policy. While it includes provisions seemingly aligned with the liberalisation of the Digital Single Market by relaxing digital copyright enforcement, it also introduces mechanisms that bolster digital copyright protection, signalling a shift towards market regulation. This paper explores why and how Jean-Claude Juncker’s European Commission proposed a directive featuring robust regulatory elements despite initial promises of copyright deregulation within the Digital Single Market. Combining insights from political economy and political sociology, I examine the concept of ‘political work’ as the practice of promoting, defending, and implementing a choice of public action. Within this framework, I identify a managerial dimension of political work involving political practices that influence the institutional structure and management of public action. Utilising a qualitative methodology involving twelve in-depth interviews with Commission officials conducted between 2018 and 2021, alongside document analysis, I demonstrate how Jean-Claude Juncker and his cabinet’s managerial political work, encompassing organisational reforms within the Commission, played a pivotal role in steering the proposed policy towards regulation.",

          "authors": "Signe Lund Mathiesen; Amanda Grenier; Walter Wittich; Mahadeo Sukhai; Bjorn Herrmann",
          "abstract": "Narrative engagement offers substantial psychosocial benefits, including cognitive health, emotional and social well-being, and longevity. However, vision loss in older adults can pose challenges in accessing printed narratives. As individuals may shift from print to auditory narratives due to age-related vision loss, understanding how this transition affects narrative engagement becomes crucial. The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.",

          "title": "Digital Authoritarianism: ICT-enabled Repression Across Regime Types",
          "authors": "Martina Lucaccini",
          "abstract": "Digital authoritarianism uses Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to sustain autocratic stability through surveillance, censorship, cyberattacks and social manipulation. While this phenomenon is central to modern autocracies, the borderless nature of cyberspace has enabled democratically elected states to adopt similar practices under certain conditions. Drawing on data from the Digital Society Project (DSP) and cross-national time-series analysis on the Digital Repression Index (DRI), this study reveals significant differences in the digital authoritarian toolkit across regime types. Closed regimes predominantly utilize tactics such as surveillance, social manipulation, and internet shutdowns, whereas democracies, despite possessing greater digital repression capacities, generally exercise restraint. However, when governed by illiberal leaders, democracies exhibit patterns of digital repression similar to their autocratic counterparts, challenging assumptions about the normative divide between regime types.",

          "title": "Who benefits most? Intervention-induced changes in the social networks of people living with dementia",
          "authors": "Doris Gebhard; Jan Ellinger",
          "abstract": "This is a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nFor most people living with dementia, their social network shrinks as the disease progresses, especially when they move into a care home. Many experience major barriers to build social relationships in the new living environment and additionally there is a lack of effective interventions to promote social contacts between residents. Considering this, the aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to investigate the effect of two interventions (physical activity [PA] vs. PA plus social component [PAS]) on the social networks of people living with dementia in long-term care facilities using an ordinal mixed-effects model, and (2) to identify the participants who benefit most from these interventions through descriptive profile analysis. Sociocentric networks of the intervention groups were assessed before and after the respective 12-week interventions. Photographs served as a facilitative tool, enabling participants to identify their social contacts and evaluate the quality of these relationships, categorizing them as positive regard, casual friend, or true friend. Loneliness, the importance of friendships within the facility and the attitude towards peer residents were assessed in interviews. 46 people living with dementia (87.1±7.3 years, 82.6% female) from six care homes participated in the interventions. In five out of six social networks, both graph density and weighted graph density increased. The average graph density across the PA groups increased by 14.8% and by 153.3% in the PAS groups. The results of the ordinal regression analysis confirm a significant positive time effect across both intervention types (β = 2.29, 95% CI = [1.36; 3.86]) as well as for each intervention type separately. Evident interaction effects (β = 5.76, 95% CI = [2.87; 11.57]) indicate that the time effect in the PAS groups (β = 10.68, 95% CI = [6.11; 18.69]) was significantly higher than in the PA groups (β = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.47; 4.63]). The profile analysis indicates that a higher level of cognitive functioning in particular contributes to greater benefit. The observed results fit in well with the current state of research and at the same time underline the benefits and necessity of using social network analysis approaches in research with people living with dementia in the long-term care setting.",
