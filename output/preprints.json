          "authors": "Lingbo Tong; Zhiyong Zhang",
          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are receiving more and more attention in the field of psychology. With the availability of software programs, the wide application of ANN becomes possible. However, without a firm understanding of the basics of the ANN, issues can easily arise. This paper presents a step-by-step guide for implementing a feed-forward neural network (FNN) on a psychological dataset to illustrate the critical steps in building, estimating, and interpreting a neural network model. We start with a concrete example of a basic 3-layer FNN, illustrating the core concepts, the matrix representation, and the whole optimization process. By adjusting parameters and changing the model structure, we examine their effects on model performance. Then, we introduce accessible methods for interpreting model results and making inferences. Through the guide, we hope to help researchers avoid common problems in applying neural network models, and machine learning methods in general.",

          "title": "Brain-based predictive modeling of mind-wandering and involuntary thought: the idiographic approach",
          "authors": "Lotus Shareef-Trudeau; David M. Lydon-Staley; John Medaglia; Aaron Kucyi",
          "abstract": "A substantial portion of waking life consists of mental experiences that arise involuntarily, including mind-wandering, spontaneous thought and rumination. Given that these experiences are fundamental to cognitive function and mental health, there has been growing scientific and clinical interest in using measures of brain activity to model and predict the momentary occurrence of these various forms of involuntary thought. In the most common machine learning approach in neuroimaging and electrophysiology research, model training data include neural features derived from a population of individuals, and testing is performed on held-out data in one or more individuals. However, sources of idiosyncrasy, such as individual differences in the nature of thought and brain functional organization, raise critical questions regarding whether population-derived neural models can generalize to individuals. In this article, we describe how an idiographic (person-specific) approach has potential to improve theory and practice in predictive neural modeling of involuntary thought. This approach emphasizes dense-sampling of individuals so that a diverse set of brain states and mental experiences can be modeled within a single individual, and rigorous tests of cross-subject generalizability can be performed. We review the advantages and shortcomings of both nomothetic (population-based) and idiographic predictive modeling approaches, including recent insights from dense-sampling neuroimaging studies that demonstrate person-specific brain-based predictions of mind-wandering. We discuss implications for developing personalized clinical biomarkers, strategies to overcome the practical challenges of an idiographic approach, and neuroethical concerns that must be considered as person-specific models may enhance the potential for accurate brain-based predictions of involuntary thought.",

          "authors": "Jordan Lee; Morénike Giwa Onaiwu; Megan Roberts",
          "abstract": "Many autistic adults report negative long-lasting consequences of their early childhood therapy experiences, and caregivers of young autistic children report that these services do not meet their child’s needs. Additionally, therapies in research contexts will often be implemented in family-centered programs such as Early Intervention (EI), but the child-focused nature of current therapies fail to help caregivers understand and support their child. This demonstrates the misalignment of autism therapy research with the goals of autistic people and caregivers, and the contextual demands of EI. This manuscript reports the outputs of a collaborative project in which 17 autistic adults, autistic caregivers, and non-autistic caregivers of autistic children developed research priorities and guiding principles for future early childhood autism research. These principles and priorities will provide a foundation for autism researchers to develop therapies and supports that are aligned with community needs and priorities, resulting in more equitable and effective practices for the diverse families served through EI and other early childhood therapy programs.

          "abstract": "While animal advocacy can be apolitical, in recent years U.S. conservatives have generally been less supportive of animal protection measures. However, there is room for positive change. In this study, we implemented qualitative methods to determine how animal advocates in the U.S. can leverage conservative political values to bring about legislative change for animals at the state and federal levels. Using a combination of academic literature review and desk research, we identified values demonstrated by the Republican Party of the United States, conservative U.S. media, and the Republican public, and determined how these align with animal protection goals and actions. By identifying areas of common ground, we show how animal advocates can work with conservatives to create a better world for animals.",

          "authors": "Kyle Fiore Law; Emily Gittle; Liane Young; Stylianos Syropoulos",
          "abstract": "Across eight pre-registered studies with both convenience and representative samples of American adults (N = 6,464), we provide strong evidence of widespread support for Initiatives for Future Generations (IFGs)—institutions and policies designed to ensure political representation for future generations. Despite broad bipartisan support, Americans significantly underestimate how much their peers favor these initiatives, a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. Nonetheless, providing accurate information about actual levels of IFG support corrects these misperceptions and boosts individual support. Additionally, interventions targeting intergenerational concern—frequently used in the field—effectively enhance support for IFGs without increasing pluralistic ignorance as an unintended consequence, suggesting that such interventions are a promising approach to fostering support for pro-future institutions and policies. Nonetheless, merely correcting pluralistic ignorance offers a promising avenue for boosting support as well, opening avenues for future research to investigate whether interventions as simple as correcting misperceptions may inspire more vocal support for IFGs and engagement in pro-future collective action. In sum, our findings suggest that policymakers have a clear opportunity to act by recognizing the broad public support for IFGs and implementing policies to protect future generations, ensuring long-term welfare without alienating any demographic.",

          "authors": "Hanna Feige; Timothy John Luke; Karl Ask",
          "abstract": "Research on perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) has primarily focused on heterosexual relationships with male perpetrators and female victims. The oversight of same-sex couples, and relationships with female abusers and male victims, has led to inconsistent findings in the literature. This incoherence might be explained by a lack of theoretical understanding of people’s beliefs and assumptions about IPV. Thus, this study aims to assess the structure of IPV prototypes of different binary victim-perpetrator gender combinations. Using a mixed-methods approach, a US- and UK-based sample (N = 161) gave open-ended responses on what they believe are common assumptions and beliefs about IPV scenarios. A psychometric network modeling approach was used to provide representations of the prototypes of the different IPV scenarios. Specifically, Gaussian graphical models of the responses were constructed, characterizing the correlations between the contents of participants’ responses. The findings show surprisingly strong global similarities between the prototypes, yet strikingly clear local differences in the domains of perpetrator, victim, relationship, and abuse.",

          "abstract": "Experimental evidence has profoundly contributed to our understanding of Mood Management Theory (MMT) in the context of music. Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services where selections can be guided by algorithmic recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT in a naturalistic setting by combining experience sampling with logged music streaming data, while accounting for algorithmic curation as a boundary condition to users’ music choices. In a pre-registered study using T = 6,918 observations from N = 144 listeners, results showed that mood, music selection, and algorithmic curation varied substantially from situation to situation. However, we found no effects between mood and music choices that would confirm MMT’s selection hypotheses, yet small mood-congruent music effects on mood. Algorithmic curation did not establish novel MMT-related choice patterns. Our findings suggest re-specifying MMT and related media use theories for daily life.",

          "authors": "Lesley Norris; David Barker; Ariella Rosen; Joshua Kemp; Jennifer Freeman; Kristen Benito; Project Harmony Team",
          "abstract": "Improving patient outcomes will be enhanced by understanding “what works, for whom?” enabling better matching of patients to available treatments. However, answering this “what works, for whom?” question requires sample sizes that exceed that of most individual trials. Conventional methods for combining data across trials, including aggregate-data meta-analysis, suffer from key limitations including difficulty accounting for differences across trials (e.g., comparing “apples to oranges”). Casually interpretable meta-analysis (CI-MA) addresses these limitations by pairing individual-participant-data (IPD) across trials with advancements in transportability methods to extend causal inferences to clinical “target” populations of interest. Combining IPD across trials also requires careful acquisition and harmonization of data, a challenging process for which practical guidance is not well-described in the literature. To fill these gaps, we describe methods and work to date for (1) harmonization of the largest IPD dataset available from 28 randomized controlled trials for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  treatments, along with target data from a clinical sample of treatment-seeking youth ages 4-20 with OCD and (2) the application of CI-MA to facilitate an understanding “what works, for whom?”. We also detail dissemination strategies and partner involvement planned throughout the project to enhance future clinical utility of CI-MA findings.",

          "authors": "Max Hinne",
          "abstract": "Bayesian inference is becoming an increasingly popular framework for statistics in the behavioural sciences. However, its application is hampered by its computational intractability -- almost all Bayesian analyses require a form of approximation. While some of these approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have become well-known throughout the literature, other approaches exist that are not as widespread. Here, we provide an introduction to another family of approximate inference techniques known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We show that SMC brings a number of benefits, which we illustrate in three different examples: linear regression and variable selection for depression, growth curve mixture modelling of grade point averages, and in computational modelling of the Iowa Gambling Task. These use cases demonstrate that SMC is efficient in exploring posterior distributions, reaching similar predictive performance as state-of-the-art MCMC approaches, in less wall-clock time. Moreover, they show that SMC is effective in dealing with multi-modal distributions, and that SMC not only approximates the posterior distribution, but simultaneously provides a useful estimate of the marginal likelihood, which is the essential quantity in Bayesian model comparison. All of this comes at no additional effort of the end user.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Nearly 40% of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) individuals become parents. Existing research highlights the intergenerational impacts of parents’ psychopathology on child psychiatric symptoms. However, there is a limited understanding of how parents’ psychiatric symptoms and experiences of stigma influence psychiatric symptoms in the children of SGM parents (hereafter SGM families).\n \nObjective: To investigate the impact of parents’ stigma experiences and psychiatric symptoms on their children’s emotional and conduct problems.\n \nDesign: Cross-sectional study using structural equation modeling with bifactor measurement models. Data were collected from 551 SGM parents.\n \nSetting: Community-based sample.\n \nParticipants: A total of 551 SGM parents (Mean age = 34.5 years, SD = 8.7 years) who reported their experiences of stigma, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and their children’s emotional and conduct problems\n \nExposure: Parental experiences of stigma, defined as discrimination and internalized stigma.\n \nMain Outcome and Measures: Parental externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, and children’s emotional and conduct problems.\n \nResults: There were significant correlations among general factors of parental and child psychopathology. Parental externalizing psychopathology was associated with child conduct problems, while parental internalizing psychopathology was linked to child emotional problems. General parental stigma was associated with both children’s overall psychopathology and emotional problems specifically, as well as parental internalizing psychopathology. Discrimination was associated with child emotional problems.\n \nConclusions and Relevance: Parental experiences of stigma in SGM families contribute to both parental and child psychopathology. This underscores the need for further longitudinal and multi-informant research to better understand these dynamics and develop interventions to support mental health in SGM families.",

          "authors": "Annie O'Brien; Margarita Panayiotou; Neil Humphrey; Joao Garcez Aurelio dos Santos; Suzanne Hamilton",
          "abstract": "There is theoretical support for, and emerging empirical evidence that, implementation variability (e.g., fidelity, dosage, quality) influences outcomes of school-based social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions, yet this relationship remains underexplored. This review aimed to (1) examine the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes and (2) identify and assess the quality of the methods used to establish this relationship, to reduce the research-to-practice gap and advance evidence-based practice. \n\nMethods. British Education Index, ERIC, PsycINFO, ASSIA, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science were searched, initially identifying 2,987 studies. A quality appraisal checklist was developed to assess the quality of research statistically examining the implementation-outcomes relationship. Extracted data were grouped according to the implementation dimension(s) assessed, the outcome domain(s) examined, and the statistical method(s) used. \n\nResults. Thirty-one studies met the review inclusion criteria. Quality assessment classified fourteen studies (45%) as low quality, fifteen (48%) as medium quality, and 2 (7%) as high quality. The most frequently examined implementation dimensions were dosage (n=16), fidelity (n=12), quality (n=10), responsiveness (n=6) and reach (n=3). Inferring the relationship between implementation variability and outcomes was hindered by the poor quality of studies and the heterogeneity, complexity, and resulting small sample size of comparison groups; calculation of meta-aggregative effect sizes was therefore not possible. \n\nDiscussion. This review reveals the paucity of high-quality research examining the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes. Accordingly, we propose the use of the aforementioned quality appraisal checklist to support and guide future research in this area, alongside recommendations to advance implementation science.",

          "abstract": "Although a number of studies have challenged the traditional assumption that there are truly homophonous words, they are exclusively based on English, a language in which duration is not phonemic.  This study extends research on the phonetic properties of homophonous words to Japanese, a language in which duration is phonemic. Based on a corpus of spontaneous Japanese speech, we found that 1) homophonous words differed in duration among the members of the homophonous group, 2) durations of homophonous words were positively correlated with degrees of certainty about the predicted word forms predicted from the word meanings, and 3) mora duration was sensitive to the contextual predictability of the mora within the word, while word duration was not sensitive to its contextual predictability.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted academic performance, exacerbating disparities among students from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. This study investigates SES´s influence on scientific literacy, essential for societal engagement in an increasingly science-driven world. Using linear models and meta-analytic techniques on 2018 and 2022 PISA data across 34 OECD countries (N = 438,688), results show a positive association between SES and scientific literacy (ß = .26 CI[.22, .28]). Additionally, a notable interaction effect between SES and the PISA cycle highlights potentially exacerbated educational disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic (ß = .06, CI[.03,.08]). The main novelty of the present paper lies in the combined analysis of two cross-sectional datasets from international large-scale assessments (LSA).  The results (1) deepen our understanding of educational inequalities and the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) demonstrate a new method to study effects via a quasi-longitudinal analysis of combined cross-sectional LSA datasets, and (3) highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SES-related inequalities in academic literacy.",

          "abstract": "Many perceive their digital media use to be out of balance and cope by recalibrating and reducing their use. One prominent goal of such digital disconnection is to improve well-being, yet past studies have yielded inconsistent results on whether this is an effective strategy. We test the associations of digital disconnection with a set of positive, negative, and social indicators of well-being in a two-week experience sampling study. N = 237 digital media users reported on T = 12,407 situations in their daily lives. Results show that in situations in which participants disconnected more than usual, they reported higher levels of affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness (within-person effects). In contrast, those who generally disconnected more than others reported no differences in well-being (between-person effects). Intrinsic motivation for disconnection positively moderated the associations with affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness between persons. Disconnection was not related to perceived stress, neither within nor between persons. The study further explores whether well-being effects differ depending on the aspects of digital media participants disconnected from. Overall, findings demonstrate how disconnection can be understood as a dynamic calibration of digital media (non-)use to achieve momentary – but not necessarily lasting – improvements in well-being.",

This study explored the hypothesis that content biases support the spread of nonadaptive information online. To test this, we analyzed 1,022,526 instances of engagement (reactions, comments, shares) generated by 356 misleading Facebook posts. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of visual material, cognitive factors of attraction (social, threat-related, intergroup-related information, positivity, and negativity biases), and engagement scores by fitting a Bayesian negative binomial model. Cognitive attractive features were present in 92% of the posts, but only visual material, intergroup-related information, and positive and negative sentiment increased engagement. The findings suggest that the specifics of social media, such as the visibility structures of platforms and competition from salient, accurate information, may moderate what gets transmitted.",

          "authors": "Oriane Chene; philippe fossati; Bernd Weber; Hilke Plassmann; Leonie Koban",
          "abstract": "Opinions of others influence behavior and decision-making, with important consequences for health. An unaddressed question is whether and how social influence can generalize across different situations or decisions. From a learning perspective, generalization is the transfer of previously acquired information to new stimuli and can be based on both perceptual and conceptual similarity. Here, we test whether social influence generalizes to new choices based on shared conceptual features, such as the healthiness and tastiness of different food items. We conducted three studies (total N = 468), in which healthy participants rated how much they would like to eat different food items and were subsequently presented with the ratings of several other people (‘social ratings’). Unbeknownst to our participants, they were randomly assigned to social ratings that either reflected a mainly health-driven valuation of food items (‘health group’) or to social ratings that reflected a taste-driven valuation of food items (‘taste group’). The results in all three studies showed that participants’ food ratings became more influenced by healthiness in the ‘health group’ than in the ‘taste group’. In one study, these effects further transferred to food choices in a naturalistic supermarket task. Our findings provide first evidence of generalization of social influence effects based on inferred social health norms. Futures studies could test conceptual generalization of other types of social and non-social learning and characterize the brain mechanism underlying these effects.",

          "authors": "Martin Vinck; Cem Uran; Tommaso Tosato; Marius Schneider",
          "abstract": "Theories suggest that cognitive processes like attention have a rhythmic nature, however there is rising controversy surrounding the empirical findings supporting this theory.  The controversy centers around the statistical methods employed by studies to test for rhythms in accuracy time courses (ATCs) around a behavioral event.  To detect rhythms, previous studies surrogates via shuffling-in-time, and then evaluated if significance occurs in a narrow frequency band (i.e. the presence of a spectral peak). \nIn a recent critique, which challenged the methodological foundations of an entire research field, Brookshire (2022) argued that the shuffling-in-time procedure does not effectively distinguish between periodic and aperiodic processes. Brookshire therefore proposed a new method to test for rhythmic modulations, by creating surrogates via a 1st-order autoregressive process (AR(1) method).  Strikingly, Brookshire reports that his AR(1) method does not replicate previously reported evidence for rhythmic modulations in all of 23 analyzed datasets, challenging a significant body of empirical work and a major theory of behavior and cognition. Here, we show that the evidence and arguments provided by Brookshire (2022) against the shuffling-in-time procedure are flawed.  Moreover, Brookshire's proposed AR(1) method has a low sensitivity making it irrelevant for the use cases it is designed for.

          "authors": "Natalie Bleijlevens; Tanya Behne",
          "abstract": "Do mono- and bilingual children differ in the way they learn novel words in ambiguous\nsettings? Listeners may resolve referential ambiguity by assuming that novel words refer to\nunknown, rather than known, objects –a response known as the mutual exclusivity effect. Past\nresearch suggested a bilingual disadvantage with regard to this disambiguation strategy,\nperhaps because, across languages, bilinguals’ experience contradicts one-to-one mappings of\nlabel and referent. Another line of research suggested a bilingual advantage in resolving\nreferential ambiguity, based on bilinguals’ advanced pragmatic skills. Here, we examine both\nthese claims in a preregistered study with comparable samples of mono- and bilingual 3-yearolds\n(n=74) and adults (n=86). We tested referent disambiguation and retention in two tasks:\nIn the Mutual-Exclusivity task, a speaker used a novel label in presence of a known and an\nunknown object. In the Pragmatic task, she used another novel label in presence of two\nunknown objects and participants could infer from the pragmatic context that the speaker\nreferred to the object that was new in their discourse. Mono- and bilinguals were equally\nsuccessful in inferring the correct label-referent links in both tasks and retained them after a\ndelay. These findings indicate that children with different language backgrounds can develop\nthe same strategies and pragmatic skills to learn novel words, highlighting the importance of\ntesting comparable samples of mono- and bilinguals. Children can use their lexical knowledge\nand socio-cognitive skills to infer the meanings of novel words, irrespective of whether they\nare acquiring one or more languages.",

          "abstract": "From the playground to the boardroom, social power shapes the way people think and behave. Social psychological research has provided a nuanced understanding of the different psychological and behavioural tendencies of powerholders. We add to this literature, suggesting that powerholders can differ in their construal of where their power originates from. Specifically, we differentiate construing the origin of one’s power as being based on personal merit and achievement (i.e., achieved power construal) from construing the origin of one’s power as being granted by others (i.e., entrusted power construal). We predicted that entrusted more than achieved power construal would increase powerholders’ psychological other-orientation - the tendency to put oneself into another’s shoes and to feel what they feel - and their altruistic behavioural tendencies. Using a multi-method approach, we tested these predictions across three studies (N = 926). We found that powerholders who adopted an entrusted compared to achieved power construal increased their psychological other-orientation and their altruistic behavioural tendencies. We discuss how our findings can be applied to the training of future powerholders and educate them about the reciprocal nature of power.",

This study examined the associations between birth order, sibling characteristics and parent-reported vocabulary size in 6,163 Norwegian 8–36-month-old children (51.4% female). Results confirmed that birth order was negatively associated with vocabulary, yet exhibited a U-shaped pattern. A ‘child-to-caregiver ratio’ in the household was introduced, in which old-enough siblings are considered caregivers for their younger siblings. This index explained variance in vocabulary better than birth order, and suggested that female siblings may adopt a caregiving role 1–3 years earlier than males, indicating sex differences in the age at which siblings contribute, rather than deplete, available resources. A child-to-caregiver ratio might better capture the interplay between language learning resources and demands within households.",

          "abstract": "Background: Evidence suggests that peer victimisation is related to suicidality and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, there is limited understanding of the association at the within-person level over brief periods, representing the most proximal effects of peer victimisation. \nMethods: Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) we explored the within-person reciprocal associations between various forms of peer victimisation—specifically physical, verbal, social manipulation, social rebuff, attacks on property, and electronic victimisation—and both active and passive suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and NSSI in adolescents over a brief (2 week) interval. Participants included 1,769 adolescents (46.0% male, 53.9% female, aged 13 to 18), recruited from academic and vocational high schools in China, participating in 3 measurement points. \nResults: Results indicated reciprocal within-person associations between verbal victimisation and subsequent active suicidal ideation and vice versa. Additionally, paths were observed from property victimisation to active suicidal ideation, from active suicidal ideation to social manipulation victimisation, from NSSI to verbal and social rebuff victimisation, as well as from suicide attempts to social rebuff victimisation. After adjusting for depression, several of the observed associations remained significant, including paths from both verbal and property victimisation to active suicidal ideation, from active suicidal ideation to verbal victimisation, and from NSSI to verbal victimisation. \nConclusions: These findings underscore the complex, short-term dynamics between different forms of victimisation and suicidality/NSSI, highlighting the importance of short-term monitoring and interventions that target both victimisation and suicidality and are sensitive to their short-term interrelations to improve effectiveness. The findings also suggest the need for future research with shorter timescales to capture the proximal effects of victimisation and better understand short-term predictors and fluctuations in suicidality and NSSI.",

In Experiment 1, participants completed an unfamiliar face matching task with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 2, participants completed the task twice, once with the Same/Different response options and once with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches, and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. Whereas we found no evidence that face identification decisions were influenced by the framing of response options, we found evidence of a robust base rate effect.

Here, I attempt to assemble these pieces into an overall picture, creating an integrative framework. Based on a large-scale behavioral experiment that consists of 40 million responses to 10,000 color patterns, a quasi-comprehensive exploration model of visual working memory, termed QCE-VWM, has been constructed. Despite its markedly reduced complexity (57 parameters as opposed to 30,796), the QCE-VWM outperforms neural networks in data fitting. This model provides an integrative framework for human visual working memory, reconciling previously conflicting concepts such as “slot” and “resource.” It modifies traditional methods, including Bayesian integration and the von Mises distribution, and identifies new mechanisms like “red advantage,” “red disadvantage,” “Matthew effect,” and “crosstalk.” This study underscores the value of large-scale behavioral experiments in crafting comprehensive models of cognitive mechanisms.",

The present study is an experimental design that seeks to investigate the effect gender has on the presence of negative tattoo stigma.  Participants (n = 114) were asked to rate their perceived competence of a clinical psychologist, their feelings toward the psychologist shown in their profile, and their attitude toward gender balance. Results indicated that there were no main effects of gender and tattoo presence on the participants' perceptions of a mental health care provider. There were also no significant interactions between the gender of a psychologist and the presence of tattoo stigma. This may suggest that people are becoming more accepting of body modifications as well as different genders in professional occupations, which is contrary to prior research.",

We reassessed the ontogeny of co-representation in 2-4 years old human children with a language-free task developed for nonhuman primates. Co-representation was already present and strongest in the youngest age class, and not constrained by Theory of Mind and inhibitory control. Together with the primate results, this suggests co-representation emerges spontaneously and automatically, and that not co-representation per se, but the flexibility to adjust when to merge and when not is the fundamental challenge for cooperation success. We show that human children and the most cooperative primates, the cooperatively breeding marmosets, rely on coordination smoothers (marmosets: mutual gaze; children: mutual gaze and communication) to achieve that.",

Yet, Einstein observed that knowledge stagnates without human imagination. \"Imagination,” he said, “is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”  In this study, we examined whether machines can have the potential to improve innovation. We employed the validated Divergent Association Task (DAT), an objective and reproducible measure of the ability to generate solutions that diverge from known or taken-for-granted solutions already in use. Our experiments indicated that, contrary to speculations, machines are no more creative on average than diverse human samples. Further, human creativity surpasses that of large-language model (LLM) in the right-hand tail of the distribution, indicating that humans collectively possess more creative brilliance relative to machines. When we collaborated with LLM partners by instructing LLMs to take the DAT as if they were creative geniuses like da Vinci, Curie, or Jobs, or from the perspective of different demographic groups such as a black person or a female, DAT scores significantly dropped relative to independent human or baseline LLM scores. Moreover, when we repeatedly instructed LLMs to think more creatively, machines were unintentionally and unwittingly pushed to create fake solutions that could mislead uninformed human partners. These findings were based on about 10,000 human observations from diverse international, educational, and cultural backgrounds, and hundreds of thousands of test results from different LLMs. The findings suggest machine creativity differs substantially from knowledge-based problem-solving and that human-machine creative partnerships may potentially inhibit innovation.",

          "abstract": "Mindfulness is known for its psychological benefits, such as stress reduction and emotional regulation, but its computational mechanisms, particularly in contrast to mind-wandering, remain unclear. This paper presents a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, minimizing variational free energy throughout past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a \"being mode\" (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a \"doing mode\" (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). We also identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes toward internally generated beliefs across network modules, spanning from past to future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states, where attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for future explorations of consciousness and pure awareness—a state of consciousness devoid of content.",

          "authors": "Danaja Rutar; Fausto Carcassi; George Deane",
          "abstract": "The active inference framework is increasingly influential as a unifying model of perception, action, and cognition. However, it is unclear how higher cognition, thought, and concept formation should be understood within active inference. In this paper, we argue that active inference has the resources to deliver an account of the Language of Thought. The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) posits that cognitive processes are underpinned by a symbolic system of internal representations akin to a language (Fodor, 2010). This \"mentalese,\" as it is sometimes referred to, supports the notions of systematicity and productivity, suggesting that thinking operates via syntactic rules and structured symbols, allowing for the capacity to produce and understand novel cognitive constructs (Fodor, 1998). While LoTH fell out of favour, it has had a recent resurgence, and a particularly promising version of it is the probabilistic Language of Thought (pLoT) which adds probabilistic processes to the LoT picture. We argue that the fundamental features of conceptual representation posited by the pLoT can be accounted for in active inference when we consider concepts as built up sequentially through a series of mental actions, or mental action policies articulated in active inference. Once constructed, concepts can be compressed, are then amenable to rapid deployment and can serve as primitives in the construction of more complex concepts.",

Support is high for showcasing green energy, green jobs, low-carbon transport and electric vehicles, and for showing the impacts of climate change. However, we also find and replicate evidence of varying-levels of hesitation across respondents about the inclusion of content that features either plant-based meals or vegan/vegetarian characters. Despite the caveats about representations of plant-based diets, the data suggests that - despite polarization in many other domains - a large proportion of Americans are strongly supportive of the entertainment industry using its cultural power to grant greater visibility to both the impacts of climate change and the range of actions that we can take to mitigate and adapt.",

          "abstract": "Forming new memories requires a focus on the external world; retrieving existing memories requires attention to our internal world. Computational models propose that the hippocampus plays a central role in resolving the tension between encoding and retrieval by alternating between states that prioritize one over the other. We tested two opposing hypotheses about whether encoding and retrieval states in the hippocampus are associated with a behavioral trade- off or behavioral coupling between encoding and retrieval, with retrieval operationalized as the use of existing memories to make predictions about the future. Across 3 Experiments (N = 197), participants viewed a series of scene categories that contained structure (e.g., beaches are followed by castles); this structure enabled memory retrieval to guide prediction. After structure learning, participants completed a simultaneous prediction and encoding task. They were shown trial-unique category exemplars and asked to make predictions about upcoming scene categories. Finally, they were given a surprise memory test for the trial-unique images. This allowed us to test whether there was competition vs. coupling between encoding of trial-unique images and prediction of upcoming images. We consistently observed coupling between encoding and prediction: accurate predictions were associated with better encoding, and factors that hurt prediction also hurt encoding. This coupling could not be explained by generic on- vs. off-task states. Together, these findings suggest that distinct encoding and retrieval states in the brain need not be associated with a tension between encoding and prediction in behavior; instead, these cognitive states may be cooperative rather than competitive.",

We interviewed ten autistic adults to seek their views on relationships between autism and kindness and ask them why others might think that autistic people are distinctively kind. Qualitative analysis suggested that there are multiple possible conceptualisations of kindness; that autistic people are often highly concerned about others’ experiences and preferences; that autistic people often use internalised rules of ‘appropriately kind behaviour’ to try to avoid ‘doing the wrong thing’ when reacting to their kind feelings and inclinations; and that autistic people often find implementing kindness most straightforward and rewarding when directed towards others who have apparently clear needs and routes to effective help-giving, e.g., close relatives, other autistic people, or loved animals or objects. Finally, participants also noted that others were sometimes distressingly unkind to autistic people, which could further complicate autistic people’s own kindness.

          "abstract": "Belief in conspiracy theories can be highly detrimental not only for the affected individual, but also for the wellbeing of society as a whole. Despite the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to their prevalence, we currently lack an integrated characterization of which underlying cognitive factors render an individual vulnerable to such beliefs. To address this gap, we utilized a battery of six cognitive tasks targeting distinct but overlapping cognitive attributes spanning different aspects of information processing from information perception, information seeking, and the evaluation and integration of information to make decisions. We then administered this task battery to a large online cohort. When integrating across tasks using unsupervised machine-learning and multivariate statistical methods, we find evidence to suggest that conspiracy believers exhibit a relatively specific but domain general deficit in the ability to effectively integrate and utilize empirical evidence, as well as an increased tendency to misattribute the consequences of their own actions to the interference of others.  These effects were found to be associated with conspiracy beliefs even after controlling for the effects of other psychiatrically relevant symptom dimensions such as schizotypy, anxiety, worry and depression. Our findings thus suggest the existence of a specific cognitive phenotype underlying susceptibility to conspiracy beliefs, which in turn could point the way toward more targeted interventions to mitigate their influence.",

          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, focusing on how different phases of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole) influence external stimulus processing. This is often studied by synchronising stimulus presentation with participants’ cardiac phases. However, there is considerable inconsistency in how these phases are defined across studies. As in biomedical disciplines, some studies use participants' electrocardiograms (ECGs) to define cardiac phases: systole is the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave, while the rest is classified as diastole. Other studies use a time-based heuristic approach, in which cardiac phases are defined based on the estimated arrival of baroreceptor afferent signals to the brain; however, conclusive evidence for this cardiac-driven effect is lacking. The variation between and within these methods has led to a confusing characterisation of systole and diastole, e.g., systole in one study can be considered diastole in another study, and vice versa. This heavily undermines interoception research and the interpretation of findings. We address this issue by outlining the current state of research on the effect of cardiac phases on stimulus processing, discussing the confusion caused by time-based heuristic approaches based on baroreceptor activity, and highlighting methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases. Rather than focusing on individual study findings, we emphasise the challenges these inconsistencies create, such as issues with replicability and interpretation, and provide recommendations for standardising methodologies to improve the reliability and comparability of future research.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Prosthetic hand devices are frequently abandoned as they are difficult to use and impose high mental workload upon users. However, researchers are yet to establish whether personality factors might contribute to these negative prosthetic hand experiences. In this study, we examined whether key prosthetic hand outcome measures were associated with the trait inclination for conscious movement control – a phenomenon termed “reinvestment” that can impair motor performance and deplete cognitive resources. \n\nMaterials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to a sample of upper-limb prosthesis users. Thirty-six respondents answered demographic questions and completed three questionnaires related to device satisfaction, trait reinvestment, and mental workload.\n\nResults: Correlational analysis revealed that a greater propensity for movement specific reinvestment was associated with lower prosthesis satisfaction, higher mental workload, and lower levels of perceived device predictability. It was also found that mental workload mediated the relationship between reinvestment tendencies and both device satisfaction and hours of prosthesis use per day.\n\nConclusions: This study provides the first evidence that trait reinvestment is negatively implicated in the control and satisfaction of prosthetic hand use. We suggest that training interventions for prosthetic hand use should aim to limit conscious control of movements.",

While the benefits of optimism have been extensively researched, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the direct impact of optimism training on the mental health of college students. This study aims to address this gap by exploring optimism training as a novel intervention method to improve mental health within an academic setting.\nMethods:\nA quasi-experimental design was employed, featuring pre-test and post-test measurements. The study involved an experimental group that received optimism training and a control group that did not. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was utilized as the primary tool for assessing symptoms of depression. Statistical analyses, including repeated measures ANOVA, were conducted to compare mean differences between the experimental and control groups across different study phases.\nResults:\nThe results demonstrated that optimism training significantly reduced depression symptoms in the experimental group. The mean depression score in the experimental group decreased from 17.19 in the pre-test to 13.57 in the post-test, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group.\nConclusion:\nThe findings underscore the effectiveness of optimism training as a low-cost and accessible intervention to enhance mental health among university students. This approach suggests potential integration into university counseling services to support students' mental health.",

          "abstract": "Super-recognisers are people with an extraordinary ability to recognise faces. Yet fifteen years after the term was coined, it remains unclear what distinguishes super-recognisers from other people, how prevalent they are, how we should study them – and why. In this chapter, I provide an up-to-date snapshot of super-recogniser research that addresses these critical issues. Prior work emphasises the practical implications of super-recognisers for important real-world decisions, such as when comparing a passport to a traveller or recognising a suspect in CCTV footage. But super-recogniser research is also helping develop basic understanding of individual differences in person perception: offering a unique window into how the brain optimises face identity processing, and the systematic relationships between identity processing and a broader network of related abilities.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Set for variability (SfV; the ability to disambiguate the mismatch between the decoded\nform of a word and its correct pronunciation) has been shown to predict regular and irregular word reading in children across both transparent and opaque orthographies. It has been offered that SfV is a crucial part of the decoding process associated with orthographic learning. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been suggested that SfV is more important when partial decoding occurs such as in irregular words or when children lack the decoding skills to fully decode the word. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the influence of SfV skill on the prediction of word reading is impacted by a word’s regularity and a child’s decoding skill. Methods: The present study examined whether the relation between SfV and word reading is moderated by a word’s spelling-to-pronunciation transparency rating and a child’s decoding skill using a cross-classified random effects model of 491 children and 160 words.\nResults: SfV was shown to be more important under conditions that may lead to a partial decoding such as when decoding skill is low or word transparency is low and was most important when both decoding skill is low and word transparency are low.\nConclusions: This suggests that when children with poor decoding skills read irregular words whose pronunciation is not readily available from its spelling, SfV is a large contributor to whether that word will be read correctly.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly criticized for not “understanding” language.  However, many critiques target cognitive abilities that, in humans, are distinct from language processing. Here, we instead study a kind of understanding tightly linked to language: inferring “who did what to whom” (thematic roles) in a sentence. Does the common training objective of LLMs—word prediction—result in sentence representations that capture thematic roles? In two experiments, we characterized sentence representations in four LLMs. In contrast to human similarity judgments, in LLMs the overall representational similarity of sentence pairs reflected syntactic similarity but not whether their agent and patient assignments were identical vs. reversed. Furthermore, we found little evidence that thematic role information was available in any subset of hidden units. However, some attention heads robustly captured thematic roles, independently of syntax. Therefore, LLMs can extract thematic roles but, unlike humans, this information influences their representations only weakly.",

It also provides evidence of convergent validity by demonstrating significant relationships with existing self-report scales in expected directions. Study 2A replicates results of Study 1 and extends them by showing relationships to performance-based measures. Study 2B examines longitudinal data to show test-retest reliability, assess relationships with change in other measures over time, and demonstrate how IPART scores are appropriately sensitive to emotional intelligence training. The IPART represents a novel, reliable, and valid tool for assessing individual differences in this important social-cognitive skill – including both the ability to recognize optimal responses and how often one in fact chooses those responses.",

We report the discrimination of a single-item vaccination intention scale and derive cutpoints in terms of sensitivity (true positives) and specificity (true negatives) in relation to subsequent vaccination status. \n\nSubject and Methods In a sample of UK adults (n=1119) recruited through an online survey platform, vaccination intention was measured on a 0–10 numerical rating scale (0=very unlikely, 10=very likely) at the beginning of the UK COVID-19 vaccination rollout (January 2021), and self-reported vaccination status was gathered after vaccination had been offered to all adults (October 2021). Discrimination of the scale was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. \n\nResults The responders reporting being vaccinated or unvaccinated were 1034 (92.4%) and 85 (7.6%), respectively. The area under the ROC curve was .956 (95% CI .943, .967), indicating a high degree of discrimination. The combined value of sensitivity and specificity was greatest at a cutpoint of 8 on the scale (sensitivity = .821, specificity = .988). If, however, the individual values of sensitivity and specificity are required to be simultaneously optimized, this occurs at point 6 (sensitivity = .887, specificity = .871). \n\nConclusion We recommend a 0–10 intention scale as a pragmatic measure of vaccination intention in public health practice, with a cutpoint of 8 on the scale as optimum, unless sensitivity and specificity are to be simultaneously optimized, when 6 is the optimum cutpoint.",

Exceedingly little is known about the developmental origins of parenting self-efficacy, in particular, the role of experiences in close relationships with family and friends well prior to becoming a parent. Here we used penalized elastic-net regression to estimate the portion of variance in parenting self-efficacy explained by experiences in close relationships from adolescence onwards. Data were drawn from a Dutch multiple-generation cohort study (TRAILS and TRAILS NEXT, est.2000) that has followed a cohort of young people from adolescence (age 11) into the early years of parenthood (age ~28). We included 387 parents with data on relationships with parents and peers in early to mid-adolescence adolescence and parenting self-efficacy at 3 months postpartum. More than one third of the variance in parenting self-efficacy could be explained by interpersonal experiences in adolescence, with positive facets in parent-child relationships as well as peer victimization being particularly stable predictors. Our findings show that preconception experiences in close relationships explain a substantial proportion of the variation in parenting self-efficacy.Though targeted research is needed to establish causal pathways, continued investment in interventions that promote relational health across adolescence may not only benefit young people now but also as future parents.",

The used subsample consisted of n = 199 parents (79% female, mean age = 30.48 when offspring were 30 months old) with n = 273 children. Internalizing problems at age 19 were significantly linked to parental stress in all models. We found no evidence of indirect effects of peer victimization at age 11 predicting later parental stress or self-efficacy via self-esteem and internalizing problems at age 19 when adjusting for stability in self-esteem and internalizing problems at age 11.

Specifically, we compare three measurement models: the EOB latent variable model, a residualized model, and a ratio score model. We report their reliability and examine their association with cognitive abilities (i.e., fluid intelligence and working memory capacity). We found that when a chance model of creativity is deemed to be an appropriate fit for a given dataset, as evidenced by Dataset 2 in our study, a cognitive interpretation of η is warranted (i.e., around 21% of variance can be explained by working memory capacity). Our work thus contributes to and refines related discussions that have previously viewed chance models of creativity as being incompatible with such a cognitive interpretation.",

Associations between parents’ SLEs and sleep characteristics during pregnancy, their mood during pregnancy and their depression at month 9 postpartum were investigated using correlational and mediation analyses.\nResults: Mothers’ (n = 328) SLEs in the 12 months preceding the first trimester of pregnancy were associated with: several measures of sleep disturbances during the first trimester; mood during the third trimester; and depression during the postpartum period. These associations were not significant in fathers (n = 318). Mothers’ sleep characteristics mediated the relationship between their SLEs and depressed mood. Most associations were weak to moderate.\nConclusion: Pregnant women’s stressful experiences in the 12 months preceding the first trimester of pregnancy are risk factors for concurrent and later mood disturbances.

          "abstract": "Sexual harassment, a pervasive form of gender-based violence, inflicts profound adverse effects on survivors. Observers' perceptions and responses to such incidents shape their attitudes and behaviors. A systematic comprehension of the determinants that influence observers' perception of harassment, as well as tendencies for victim-blaming and sympathy, is crucial for devising efficacious intervention strategies. However, the existing body of research on this subject is fragmented, and studies within the Chinese context are notably scarce. This study examined the factors that influence observers' perceptions and reactions to sexual harassment in China, including the type of harassment (gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, or sexual coercion), observer gender, and observer characteristics (empathy, moral sensitivity, willingness to engage in feminist behaviors, sexism, sexual narcissism, sexual harassment myths, and tolerance of sexual harassment). The type of harassment and the gender of the observers influenced their perception of harassment, emotional response, the level of blame attributed to the victims, and their sympathy toward the victims' suffering. Observer characteristics further modulated perceptions and reactions, bifurcating into two distinct systems. Observers with heightened empathy, moral sensitivity, and feminist action readiness (the positive system) exhibited increased sensitivity, emotional connection, sympathy, and reduced victim-blaming. Conversely, those with elevated sexism, sexual narcissism, sexual harassment myth endorsement, and harassment tolerance (the negative system) demonstrated diminished sensitivity, emotional engagement, sympathy, and augmented victim-blaming. The findings indicate that effective interventions to prevent and reduce sexual harassment should address the underlying beliefs and values that influence how people perceive and respond to sexual harassment.",

          "abstract": "Abstract:\nSchizophrenia is a complex disorder with symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and impaired social interactions, with a substantial part of research focusing on deficits in facial emotion recognition. Studies have shown that facial emotion recognition is crucial for social interaction, and schizophrenic patients often demonstrate significant impairments in this area. Prior research primarily concentrated on schizophrenic patients themselves, with less attention given to their first-degree relatives. This study investigates the ability to recognize negative facial expressions among schizophrenic spectrum patients (paranoid and non-paranoid), their siblings, and healthy controls. The innovation of this study lies in its comparative analysis of facial expression recognition abilities across paranoid and non-paranoid schizophrenic patients, their siblings, and healthy individuals, highlighting the potential trait-related underpinnings of these abilities within family lines. The research employed a cross-sectional comparative method, using convenience sampling at Razi Hospital in Tabriz, Iran. The sample included paranoid and non-paranoid schizophrenic patients, their siblings were categorized similarly and matched healthy controls. The Ekman 60 Faces Test was utilized to assess the recognition of basic facial emotions. The findings indicate significant differences in recognizing negative facial expressions among the groups. Paranoid schizophrenic patients demonstrated an inferior ability to identify negative emotions compared to non-paranoid schizophrenic patients and their siblings. This study contributes to the understanding of social cognition deficits in schizophrenia, suggesting that the ability to recognize negative facial expressions may be influenced by both the state and traits related to the disorder.",

          "abstract": "To effectively address intergroup violence, we must accurately diagnose the psychological motives driving it. Dehumanization—the explicit and blatant denial of an outgroup's humanity— is widely considered one such driver, informing both scholarly theory and social policy on intergroup violence. Nonetheless, dehumanization is often intertwined with intense negative affect, raising concerns that dehumanization’s explanatory power is much more restricted than widely assumed. In the extreme, “dehumanization” is merely another way to express intense dislike. If so, then theories of dehumanization distort our understanding of the true motives driving violence. Here, we test dehumanization’s reality and explanatory power through three complementary research streams that employ diverse methods and samples. First, we meta- analyze existing studies on dehumanization and dislike to establish their independent effects on violence (k = 120; N = 128,022). We then test the generalizability of these effects across four violent conflicts in the United States, Russia and Ukraine, Israel and the Palestinian diaspora, and India (NTotal = 3,773). In these studies, we also test whether individuals’ dehumanizing responses are mere metaphor or intended literally. Finally, we isolate dehumanization’s causal impact on violence in another US sample (N = 753). Our results converge to demonstrate that dehumanization is (a) distinct from dislike and often intended literally, (b) a particularly strong predictor of support for violence, and (c) can causally facilitate such support. Collectively, these studies clarify our understanding of the psychology driving violence and can inform efforts to address it.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that women’s parasympathetic responses to infant cry reflect regulation of arousal and are associated with caregiving behaviors. In particular, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) withdrawal in response to infant cry has been associated with maternal sensitivity. However, the ways in which multiple reproductive experiences (i.e., parity, conceptualized as giving birth and raising a child) can modulate women’s RSA  in response to infant cry is still unknown. The aim of this study was to test whether and how women’s RSA in response to infant cry was associated with parity. Participants included 184 women (62 nulliparous women; 86 primiparous women; 36 multiparous women). RSA was measured while women were watching a neutral video, followed by videos of crying infants. Analyses revealed that the cry condition was associated with a significant RSA withdrawal, compared to the baseline condition, in both multiparous and nulliparous women. A statistically significant RSA withdrawal was absent among primiparous women, possibly reflecting a more sustained physiological arousal to infant cry. Discussion focuses on the potential challenges in physiological regulation, indexed by RSA withdrawal, among primiparous women in response to infant cry. More sustained arousal may both support an increased focus on infant signals, but also predispose new mothers to perceive greater stress.",

          "abstract": "Some people appear to specifically search for bad news, or to prefer negatively valenced\ninformation more generally. While preferred intake of negative information may serve to\nconfirm one’s existing negative expectations it may also contribute to negative affect and\nneuroticism. Conversely, other people may prefer information that allows learning rather than\nconfirming existing expectations and individual differences in such preferences may be linked\nto trait openness/intellect. To assess associations between information preferences, negative\nexpectations, neuroticism, and openness/intellect, two studies (N=300 and N=161) were\nconducted. Participants completed a negative expectation questionnaire and rated whether\nthey would like to read the corresponding articles of 48 presented news-headlines. Headlines\nwere construed to suggest that the valence of the corresponding article would either be\nnegative, positive or neutral and were presented in negative-neutral or positive-neutral pairs.\nRatings were provided on 24 bipolar (Study 1) or 48 unipolar (Study 2) items. In line with\nassumptions, rating-intercorrelations support the existence of general tendencies to prefer\nnegative vs. neutral (and positive vs. neutral) news across different topics. Across studies, the\ntendency to prefer negative vs. neutral news was correlated with both generalized negative\nexpectations and neuroticism. Moreover, negative expectations mediated the relationship\nbetween neuroticism and preferring negative news, suggesting that negative information\npreferences may serve to confirm negative expectations in high neuroticism. In contrast,\nopenness/intellect, was linked to higher preferences for any news (Study 2) but particularly\nheadlines that indicated high information gain. These findings provide insights into\ninformation preferences and mechanisms for stabilizing expectations in personality.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground:\nAdvances in cancer treatment have significantly increased the survival rate of cancer patients, but these survivors often face challenges in the workplace. Existing literature highlights the significant influence of cancer on job performance, job satisfaction, and the increased risk of withdrawal intention. However, the effects of positive psychology interventions on cancer survivors, particularly in less urbanized settings and remote worker communities, remain underexplored.\nMethods:\nThis study investigates the effects of positive psychology interventions on job satisfaction, work engagement, and withdrawal intentions among cancer survivors in rural and remote workforce communities. A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 68 cancer survivors. The study used the Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Withdrawal Intention Scale to measure outcomes following a 14-session positive psychology intervention.\nResults:\nThe results revealed statistically significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control group. Job satisfaction mean scores increased from 50.23 to 58.94, work engagement mean scores rose from 26.79 to 31.05, and withdrawal intentions mean scores decreased from 48.35 to 39.05.\nConclusion:\nThese findings highlight the potential of positive psychology interventions to address the unique challenges faced by cancer survivors in remote workforce communities, particularly in less urbanized areas. By enhancing job satisfaction and work engagement while reducing withdrawal intentions, these interventions can significantly contribute to the occupational well-being of cancer survivors, advocating for their integration into cancer care and organizational practices.",

          "abstract": "In this article, I argue that fictionality—understood as a form of \"make-believe\" that requires the audience to suspend disbelief—has been largely absent throughout most of human history. This is due to two key factors: 1) humans are not psychologically predisposed to recognize fictionality, as it is cognitively demanding, and 2) traditional societies often have worldviews that allow for promiscuous causal possibilities, preventing narratives from being marked as fictional by their implausibility. I review extensive ethnographic and historical evidence suggesting that stories we now consider fictional were largely regarded as factual accounts of the past or attempts at such accounts. Additionally, I offer a critical discussion of how the absence of fictionality in diverse human societies impacts evolutionary theorizing about fictionality, as well as the broader cognitive and social consequences of (the lack of) fictional narratives.",

We aimed to determine the extent to which articles reporting RCTs of behavioural addiction interventions adhere to CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials) standards.\n\nMethods: We searched the PubMed database and Journal of Gambling Issues for articles reporting RCTs of interventions for Gambling or Gaming Disorder published between 2010 and 2023. We coded articles according to the number and percentage of relevant CONSORT items reported in their abstract and main text.\n\nResults: Sixty-three articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, 52 (82.5%) concerned Gambling Disorder and 11 (17.5%) Gaming Disorder. The mean percentage of items reported in abstracts and main texts was 34.5% and 58.6%, respectively. Rates of reporting were higher in our sample of behavioural addiction RCTs (Mdn = 57.6%) than in a sample of previously-scored substance addiction RCTs (Mdn = 54.1%) evaluated by Vasser et al.

Through this review, we have developed specific recommendations for improving CONSORT compliance (e.g., alternative ways of reporting adherence checklists, evidence-based education programs, and normalising reporting information that could be perceived as study shortfalls) which will boost the interpretability of the published behavioural addictions literature.\nThe review preregistration, materials, data, and analysis code can be accessed on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/8yskr.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation about vaccines poses a significant challenge to vaccination efforts, including in low- and middle-income countries. Pre-emptive strategies to neutralize the influence of misinformation have gained attention, with psychological inoculation theory found to be an effective framework. Digital games have emerged as engaging, cost-efficient, and scalable tools to implement inoculation interventions and promote health-related behaviors. The Cranky Uncle Vaccine game, co-designed in Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda, and piloted in Kenya and Uganda, aimed to establish the effectiveness of Cranky Uncle Vaccine in increasing vaccine acceptance, intent to get vaccinated, and discernment between vaccine facts and fallacies, as presented in this paper. Pre- and post-game surveys identified significant improvement in vaccine attitudes, with participants showing a more positive stance toward vaccination after playing the game. Among participants who expressed vaccine hesitancy before the game, 58% switched to being somewhat or very likely to get vaccinations after playing the game. Perceived reliability of vaccine facts increased while perceived reliability of fallacies decreased, indicating improved ability to distinguish true from false statements. Demographic factors such as education and age moderated the effectiveness of the game, with greater effects seen in lower-educated and older participants. The game's emphasis on the importance of vaccination, explanation of misleading techniques, and interactive learning contributed to positive outcomes, improving vaccine attitudes and reducing the influence of vaccine misinformation. Our findings highlight the relevance of game-based interventions in addressing misinformation and promoting vaccine acceptance.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of research, it has been difficult to resolve debates about the existence and\nnature of partisan bias—the tendency to evaluate information more positively when it supports, rather than challenges, one’s political views. Whether partisans display partisan biases, and whether any such biases reflect motivated reasoning, remains contested. We conducted four studies (total N = 4,010) in which participants who made unblinded evaluations of politically- relevant science were compared to participants who made blinded evaluations of the same study. The blinded evaluations—judgments of a study’s quality given before knowing whether its results were politically-congenial—served as impartial benchmarks against which unblinded participants’ potentially biased evaluations were compared. We also modeled the influence of partisans’ preferences and prior beliefs to test accounts of partisan judgment more stringently than past research. Across our studies, we found evidence of politically motivated reasoning, as unblinded partisans’ preferences and prior beliefs independently biased their evaluations. We contend that conceptual confusion between descriptive and normative (e.g., Bayesian) models of political cognition has impeded the resolution of longstanding theoretical debates, and we discuss how our results may help advance more integrative theorizing. We also consider how the blinding paradigm can help researchers address further theoretical disputes (e.g., whether liberals and conservatives are similarly biased), and we discuss the implications of our results for addressing partisan biases within and beyond social science.",

It remains unknown how perceived attractiveness and social affective judgements relating to one’s social circle size, enjoyability of interactions, and friendship quality are impacted by this editing process, or by disclaimer labels stating that editing has occurred. To address this question, we digitally ‘beautified’ photographs of 60 face identities to varying degrees (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) using one of the popular applications, and randomly labeled half photographs as edited and half as not edited. Participants rated the perceived attractiveness of each individual and made social affective judgements about them. As degree of photograph editing increased, so did the ratings of the individual’s attractiveness and perceived social circle size, although this appeared to come at the cost of reduced perceived friendship quality and interaction enjoyability. Finally, while attractiveness ratings were not impacted by the photograph being labelled as edited or not edited, individuals in photographs labelled as edited were perceived to have reduced friendship quality and interaction enjoyability. In summary, increasing physical attractiveness via photograph editing has nuanced effects on social affective judgements, and does not always lead to favorable social affective judgements of protagonists.",

This likely reflects the vast heterogeneity in subjective measures of SMU, coupled with a lack of consideration for the factors that influence different styles of SMU and drive individual differences in susceptibility to their effects. To advance our understanding of social media effects, the present study used a novel objective measure of individuals’ behaviour on social networking sites to examine whether distinct SMU styles are related differentially to social competencies that support real-world social interaction, and if these user characteristics mediate relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Methods: A total of 509 participants (261 females) completed the Social Networking Site Behaviour Task that measured styles of SMU objectively, the Multidimensional Social Competency Scale that captured self-reported competencies in seven domains of interpersonal behaviour, and four subjective measures of psychosocial wellbeing. Findings: We identify interactive, reactive and passive SMU styles, reveal that users expressing these distinct styles differ on several social competencies, and discover that these competencies mediate differential relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Discussion: Just as individual differences in social competencies manifest in face-to-face interactions, we suggest that they also underpin SMU styles and shape individual differences in susceptibility to their effects on wellbeing.",

This community-based study evaluated key program components – recordings, training, and feedback – over 10-weeks across three groups: full LENA StartTM program (n= 347), recordings and feedback (n= 66), and recordings only (n= 51). Overall, growth curve analyses revealed significant variability in all six outcome measures, emphasizing the complex factors influencing child and parent communication. Effects of time were significant, particularly on adult word count, conversational turns, and developmental snapshot scores. However, non-linear trends for adult words and conversational turns revealed an initial increase that levelled off across recording sessions. There were no significant group differences across time on any recording measures. Families who received feedback (LENA StartTM and Recordings + Feedback groups) increased the amount of family reading time, and families who received programming showed significantly greater increases in parent surveys measuring knowledge and confidence in parenting. Reported reading time was positively associated with the number of adult words and conversational turns measured by LENA recordings, as well as developmental snapshot scores. In contrast, electronic noise was negatively associated with the number of adult words, conversational turns, and child vocalizations. Implications for using the LENA StartTM program to increase language input to children are discussed.",

Prior knowledge tied to one’s socio-cultural experiences, known as cultural schema, plays a facilitating role in immediate memory performance. However, few studies extend this effect to delayed retention and long-term forgetting using coherent narratives. In the current study, we investigated the influence of cultural schema in prose retention and its effects on long-term forgetting. The awareness of the cultural properties implied in the prose was an index of activated cultural schemas. Recall performance was assessed across multiple time intervals. Consistently, cultural schemas enhanced the remembering of an integrated narrative for both schema related and unrelated information. The form of forgetting in prose memory followed a negatively accelerating pattern, which was more accurately described by a power function in both group and individual data. Notably, forgetting rates are independent of the degrees of acquisition predicted by varying activation of cultural schemas.",

We engaged 245 participants in six diverse tasks: morality judgments, opinion formation, knowledge questions, abstract reasoning, dot counting, and aesthetic evaluations, with each task presenting purported AI or human responses. Our results reveal that participants showed greater conformity to AI in the analytical tasks of dot counting and certain knowledge questions while conforming more to humans in tasks involving moral judgments, opinion formation, and aesthetic evaluations. Interestingly, neither perceived objectiveness nor prior GenAI usage consistently predicted conformity behavior across tasks.

          "abstract": "Gossip is often stereotyped as a frivolous social activity, but in fact can be a powerful tool for discouraging selfishness and cheating.  In economic games, gossip induces people to act more cooperatively, presumably to avoid the cost of accruing a negative reputation. Might even this prosocial sort of gossip carry negative side effects?  We propose that gossip might protect communities while simultaneously giving people the wrong idea about who’s in them.  Specifically, gossipers might disproportionately share information about cheaters in their midst, driving cynical perceptions among receivers of that gossip. To test these predictions, we first reanalyzed data from a prior study in which people played a public goods game and could gossip about their fellow players.  These participants indeed produced negatively skewed gossip: writing much more frequently about cheaters than cooperators, even when most people in their public goods game groups acted generously. To examine the effect of this gossip on cynicism, we ran a new experiment in which a second generation of participants read these gossip notes, and then prepared to play their own public goods game.  Gossip recipients inferred that the groups that produced these notes acted significantly more selfishly than they truly had–becoming both cynical and inaccurate based on gossip.   However, this gossip did not affect second generation participants’ forecasts of how their own group would behave, nor their own cooperative choices.  Together, these findings suggest that gossip skews negative, and, therefore, encourages outside observers to draw more cynical conclusions about groups from which it comes.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Trauma can have a range of effects on individuals over time, including the potential for positive changes in favorable outcomes commonly referred to as posttraumatic growth. The posttraumatic growth literature has been criticized for various methodological limitations and has largely neglected the exploration of factors that may strengthen or weaken posttraumatic growth trajectories. The present study contributes to this literature by investigating trajectories of five dimensions of posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating effects of health and financial difficulties on these trajectories. Method. Longitudinal data were collected monthly between July 2020 and December 2022 from a sample of employed adults in Germany, involving N = 1,678 participants over 30 time points (Nobservations = 29,552). Results. Results suggest that certain dimensions of posttraumatic growth showed significant increases (i.e., relationships) or decreases (i.e., spirituality, possibilities) over time, and that trajectories of three dimensions (i.e., relationships, appreciation, and strength) demonstrated distinctive patterns of interaction with health and financial difficulties. Conclusions. Findings are discussed in the context of the pandemic as well as dynamic theories of personality and identity, with implications for advancing posttraumatic growth theory and research.",

          "abstract": "When individuals repeatedly study and recall information across multiple learning trials their responses exhibit increasing levels of subjective organization. Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "authors": "Rhiannon Ueberholz; Harley Glassman; Adiel Mallik; Frank Russo",
          "abstract": "Undergraduate students report a high level of trait anxiety, which is a risk factor for further psychological decline if unmanaged. Common psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy are highly effective in improving symptoms of anxiety for those who are motivated to engage in psychotherapy, but they can be costly. Music-based interventions are cost-effective and have been found to improve indices of anxiety, specifically lower self-reported distress, reduced cortisol, and higher heart rate variability. More recently, music with auditory beat stimulation (ABS) has been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety to a greater extent than music alone. While there is limited empirical evidence, music interventions with ABS may also be effective at targeting neurophysiological markers of anxiety.  In this exploratory trial, fifty undergraduate students will be randomized to participate in a single session of music with ABS or pink noise. They will be asked to complete measures of self-reported anxiety. In addition, they will be asked to provide saliva samples (salivary cortisol), and wear electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the wrist (heart rate variability) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap (frequency band power measures of anxiety). It is hypothesized that those assigned to the music with ABS condition will experience a reduction in subjective and physiological indices of anxiety. A secondary exploratory aim of this research will be to test potential neurophysiological mechanisms of actions, including neural entrainment and differences in HRV and frequency band power, that may clarify the effect of music with ABS on anxiety.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of Parents' Beliefs about Children's Emotions Questionnaire (PBACE) in the Iranian setting. The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Findings from the bifactor model indicated that the measure could be considered unidimensional with some multidimensional features. Although the poor fit and lower Omega coefficient for the Parental Knowledge subscale suggest that it should not be used, the PBACE is recommended for research and clinical purposes in Iran due to its sound psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "Background. Mentalizing—our ability to make inferences about the mental states of others—is \nimpaired across psychiatric disorders and robustly associated with functional outcome. \nMentalizing deficits have been prominently linked to aberrant activity in cortical regions \nconsidered part of the “social brain network” (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal \njunction), yet emerging evidence also suggests an importance of cerebellar dysfunction. In the \npresent study—using a transdiagnostic, clinical psychiatric sample spanning the psychosis?autism-social anxiety spectrums —we examined the role of cerebellum in mentalizing and its\nunique contributions to broader social functioning. \nMethods. 66 participants (42 with significant social dysfunction secondary to psychiatric illness\nand 24 non-clinical controls without social dysfunction) completed a mentalizing task during \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear model analysis, latent variable modeling, \nand regression analyses were used to examine the contribution of cerebellum activation to the \nprediction of group status and social functioning.\nResults. Mentalizing activated a broad set of social-cognitive brain regions, including cerebral \nmentalizing network (MN) nodes and posterior cerebellum. Increased posterior cerebellum \nactivation significantly predicted group status (i.e., individuals with psychiatric disorders versus \nnon-clinical controls). Finally, cerebellar activation accounted for significant variance in social \nfunctioning independent of all other cerebral MN brain regions identified in a whole-brain analysis.\nConclusion. Findings add to an accumulating body of evidence establishing the unique role of \nposterior cerebellum in mentalizing deficits and social dysfunction across psychiatric illnesses. \nCollectively, our results suggest that the posterior cerebellum should be considered – alongside \nestablished cerebral regions – as part of the mentalizing network.",

          "authors": "Peter Anthony White",
          "abstract": "Michotte (1946/1954/1963) showed that visual impressions of causality can occur in perception of simple animations of moving geometrical objects. In the launching effect, one object is perceived as making another object move by bumping into it. In the entraining effect, the two objects move together after contact and the first moving object is perceived as pushing or carrying the other one. There has been much further research on the launching effect in particular, and citations of Michotte's pioneering work have increased rapidly in recent decades, underlining its importance in contemporary psychology and neuroscience. However, many of the experiments reported Michotte's book, exploring conditions under which launching and entraining do and do not occur, have never been replicated. The methodology, involving mostly a few knowledgeable observers and no statistical analysis, indicates that replication and extension would be desirable, to assess the reliability of the results reported by Michotte and to inspire further research on aspects of these perceptual impressions that have been neglected in more recent research. In this pre-registered replication study, fourteen experiments are reported that replicate and, in some cases, extend experiments reported by Michotte (1946/1954/1963). Some findings reported by Michotte were replicated, others only partly so, and in other cases results were different from what Michotte reported. Extensions to Michotte's experiments revealed numerous new findings and open up prospects for much more innovative research. The results also have significant implications for possible explanations for perceptual impressions of causality.",

          "authors": "David Goretzko; Philipp Sterner",
          "abstract": "When comparing latent means across groups, measurement invariance (MI) needs to be established to ensure that the test results are valid and meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models. We provide R functions within the R package EFAtree to easily implement EGA trees.",

          "abstract": "Motivations to avoid infectious disease seem to influence prejudice toward some groups, including groups not explicitly associated with infectious disease. The standard explanation relies on signal detection theory and proposes that pathogen detection should be biased toward making many false alarms (false positives) and few misses (false negatives). Therefore, pathogen detection mechanisms arguably categorize a broad array of atypical features as indicative of infection, which gives rise to negative affect toward people with atypical features. We will test a key hypothesis derived from this explanation: specific appearance-based prejudices are associated with tendencies to make false alarms when estimating the presence of infectious disease. While this hypothesis is implicit in much work on the behavioral immune system and prejudice, direct tests of it are lacking and existing relevant work contains important limitations. We will conduct a cross-sectional study with a large US sample that includes measures of tendencies to make false alarms and prejudice toward multiple relevant social groups/categories.",

          "authors": "Merethe Blandhol; Seoyoung Lee; Dan-Mikael Ellingsen",
          "abstract": "Living with pain that persists over months or years can take a significant toll and requires the use of different strategies to manage the pain in everyday life. Yet how individuals cope with chronic pain and why some people show better functional outcomes is not clearly understood. Previous literature on coping has often focused on describing different coping strategies and their comparative effectiveness, often with the assumption that some are overall less adaptive than others. Existing theoretical models of coping often lack descriptions of how factors unfold over time and often assume relationships between factors remain stable. However, pain coping is not only influenced by continuously changing internal and external contextual factors, but by changing interactions as the process repeats over time. Moreover, the short- and long-term efficacy of different coping approaches depends on individual appraisal of the momentary coping process. In this review, we first systematically synthesise previously published theoretical frameworks that have conceptualised the coping process in health- related stress and pain. Then, we present the ‘Dynamic Interaction Model of Coping in Chronic Pain’ outlining how five central factors: 1) controllability, 2) predictability, 3) pain salience, 4) personal resources, and 5) motivation, interact in a dynamic coping process in chronic pain. The model outlines putative pathways of moment-to-moment and long-term adaptations to pain, and potential targets for intervention are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Performing movements in simulated environments (e.g., virtual reality) can be advantageous in training scenarios and when experimentally separating visual and proprioceptive limb representations. However, compared to real physical environments, virtual environments differ in how the limb is represented (e.g., animated hand or cursor) and in the timing of the visual feedback (i.e., latency in rendering the tracked movement). Thus, the current study sought to explore the influence of both representation differences and additional visual feedback delays on sensorimotor control when moving in a virtual reality environment. Participants performed aiming movements in an environment in which they had vision of a cursor representing their index finger or vision of their actual upper-limb. Further, vision was available either only prior to movement onset (i.e., feedforward) or throughout the movement (i.e., online guidance). In the feedforward condition, only representation differences were present between effectors. In the online guidance condition, however, there was an additional feedback delay when aiming with the cursor (at least ~17 ms). Performance was quantified using efficiency (bits/second) calculated using amplitude, effective target width, and movement time. Movements were less efficient when aiming with vision of the cursor compared to vision of the upper-limb in both the feedforward and online guidance conditions. Further, the magnitude of the cursor-limb efficiency difference was larger in the online guidance condition compared to the feedforward condition. Overall, the results suggest that differences in representation and visual feedback delays can combine to produce less efficient movements when aiming in virtual compared to real environments.",

Hazard ratios (HRs) for any mental disorder and specific disorders were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.\n  \nResults:  The study included 1,986,490 pregnancies in Sweden (1,097,126 mothers, mean age at conception [standard deviation] = 31.1 [5.0]). In total 276,252 (13.9%) mothers were exposed to family loss. Loss of a family member at any time before or during the perinatal period was associated with an increased risk of any perinatal mental disorder (hazard ratio [HR] and 95% confidence intervals: 1.44 [1.41, 1.48]), particularly if the loss occurred during the perinatal period (HR [95% CI]: 5.86 [5.62, 6.12]). Loss of a spouse and child yielded higher HRs, compared loss of a parent or a sibling. The strongest associations were observed for postpartum mental disorders in relation to stillbirth (HR [95% CI]: 25.97 [24.60, 27.42]) or multiple losses during the perinatal period (HR [95% CI]: 16.92 [13.72, 20.86]). Family loss during the perinatal period was most strongly associated with stress-related disorders (HR [95% CI]: 16.90 [16.10, 17.75]), but also with depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Loss of a family member was associated with increased risks of first-onset perinatal mental disorders, particularly if the loss occurred during the perinatal period. Bereaved women may benefit from enhanced monitoring and screening for mental disorders during the perinatal period.",

All traits but openness evidenced small-to-medium bivariate associations with both psychopathology dimensions (z = |.18 - .46|). After adjusting for the covariance between internalizing and externalizing, each dimension showed a distinct personality profile. Internalizing was associated with neuroticism (β = .42) and negative-extraversion (β = -.37). Externalizing was associated with extraversion (β = .30), negative-conscientiousness (β = -.46), and negative-agreeableness (β = -.50). Most variance was driven by informant effects, particularly within the externalizing dimension and when personality and psychopathology were informed by the same person (i.e., mono-informant). \nStudy 2 was a preregistered replication and extension of Study 1 in a large cohort of youth (N = 10,414) using individual-participant, item-level data. Most of Study 1’s associations were replicated for higher-order scales (e.g., Effortful Control) and for their lower-order scales (e.g., Activation Control). Again, mono-informant effects were more pronounced than cross-informant effects. \nTaken together, these studies provide the first quantitative synthesis of associations between personality/temperament and psychopathology in youth. These preregistered quantitative findings are largely consistent with decades of theory (e.g., Tackett, 2006), evidence a robustness of effects across populations, and highlight the impact of mono-informant effects.",

It focuses on extracting context-independent mechanisms from computational models and neuroimaging data of states with disrupted self-specifying processing. A proof-of-concept is demonstrated using active inference models of meditative non-dual awareness and psychedelic ego-dissolution. The resulting predictions suggest that the hierarchical nature of neural systems may be a core mechanism for generating selfhood. The hypothesis posits that flattening the hierarchy in a system allows one to experience qualia without the psychological sense that they are given to a subject. This hypothesis is then implemented in a current computational model of selfhood (Reichle &amp; Boag, 2024). The paper provides two insights: (1) how to deduce core mechanisms of selfhood, and (2) specific guidance on which parameters to modify in computational models of consciousness or selfhood to simulate selflessness.",

It suggests that multiple versions of our conscious selves exist simultaneously across time, with each version only capable of experiencing a single \"now.\" The concept of information meshes briefly addresses questions of identity, memory, and shared experiences within this framework.

          "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is a promising approach to identify predictors/moderators for youth anxiety treatments. To this end, data from nine randomized controlled trials of youth anxiety treatments were harmonized into a dataset (N = 1362; Mage = 10.59, SDage = 2.47; 48.9% female; 71.9% White, 5.9% Black, Other, 5.9%; 10.8% Hispanic) and ML algorithms were used to predict outcomes. Models were then applied on an external validation sample in a research clinic (N = 50; Mage = 12.04, SDage = 3.22; 56% female; 76% Caucasian, 10% Black, 6 % Asian, 2% Other; 6% Hispanic). To examine predictive features by treatment type, Lasso Regression models were built separately for youth who completed individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family CBT (FCBT), sertraline alone (SRT), and combination of SRT and CBT (COMB). Automatic relevance determination (ARD) emerged as the best performing model in the harmonized (RMSE = 1.84, R2 = 0.28) and external validation datasets (RMSE = 1.87, R2 = 0.11). Predictive features of poorer outcomes were primarily indicators of symptom severity and trial effects, although predictors varied within treatments (e.g., caregiver psychopathology was predictive for FCBT; depressive symptoms were predictive for COMB). Implications for use of ML to identify predictors/moderators are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mianzhi Hu; Hilary Don; Darrell A. Worthy",
          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, human decision-making often involves adaptively leveraging different strategies to maximize gains. These strategic shifts, however, are overlooked by many traditional reinforcement learning models. Here, we incorporate parallel evaluation systems into distribution-based modeling and propose an entropy-weighted dual-process model that leverages Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent frequency and value-based decision-making strategies, respectively. Model simulations and empirical tests demonstrated that our model outperformed traditional RL models by uniquely capturing participants’ strategic change from value-based to frequency-based learning in response to heightened uncertainty. As reward variance increased, participants switched from focusing on actual rewards to using reward frequency as a proxy for value, thereby showing greater preference for more frequently rewarded but less rewarding options. These findings suggest that increased uncertainty encourages the compensatory use of diverse evaluation methods, and our dual-process model provides a promising framework for studying multi-system decision-making in complex, multivariable contexts.",

          "abstract": "The deployment of spatial attention generates distinct neural signatures that can be detected at the scalp. Here, we use multivariate pattern analysis of EEG data to decode the deployment of spatial attention, and ask if this is modulated by repetitive movements. 'Stimming' movements (also known as repetitive stereotypies), are widely reported in autism, but also present in some neurotypical individuals. Stimming has historically been viewed as a problematic behaviour, but many individuals claim that stimming benefits attention. We first validated our paradigm (a Posner-style cueing design), demonstrating above-chance classification of cue direction from around 300ms post-cue onset. We then investigated whether stimming modulates decoding accuracy and task performance. Our results, consisting of data primarily from neurotypical participants, do not suggest that stimming has a negative impact on an individual's ability to attend, unless the individual does not typically engage in stimming behaviours. This suggests interventions aiming to reduce stimming behaviours are not necessarily warranted and highlights the need for further research into the potential benefits of stimming specifically within the autistic population. Future research might also consider the potential overlap between autistic stimming and the fidgeting behaviours which are characteristic of ADHD, to help understand the significant overlaps between the characteristics of the two conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a leading cause of disability worldwide in children and adolescents, while its underlying pathophysiology remains largely elusive. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are considered intertwined regulatory systems crucially implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. This study explores the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between the ECS, specifically anandamide (AEA), and the HPA axis with its main effector cortisol and MDD status and severity in children and adolescents. \nMethods: Utilizing data from the omega-3-pMDD trial, a phase III Randomized Clinical Trial assessing the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in pediatric MDD, we examined hair AEA and cortisol concentrations in 124 children and adolescents aged 8-17 years, with MDD. Associations between MDD, symptom severity and hair AEA and cortisol concentrations were explored across four measurement time points (baseline, week 6, 24 and 36). Additionally, 127 healthy children and adolescents were examined once to enable cross-sectional comparisons between MDD cases and healthy controls.\nResults: Baseline comparisons for the 251 children and adolescents showed lower cortisol and AEA levels in hair of children and adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal multi-level analysis over all time-points further corroborated negative longitudinal associations between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with MDD.\nConclusions: Reduced baseline AEA and cortisol levels emerge as robust biomarker in depressed youth, while the negative longitudinal association between hair cortisol and depression symptoms might provide useful for therapy monitoring purposes. These results hold implications for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic response prediction in pediatric MDD.",

The authors highlight a number of important points of difference in which symptoms were “lumped” versus “split” in our output compared to the results in Gauld et al. (2021a)—an earlier study that aimed to inventory all of the different symptoms of the sleep-wake disorders. Martin et al. (2024) also highlight that some of these differences have important clinical implications for differential diagnosis and treatment planning for sleep-wake disorders. In this response to their commentary we consider our points of agreement, points of difference with minor implications for the patterns of symptom overlap described in the target paper, and one point of difference with more substantial implications (i.e., splitting vs. lumping several different insomnia symptoms). Overall, it seems likely that the different aims of our studies (mapping the patterns of repetition throughout the DSM vs. creating an inventory of symptoms from a clinical sleep medicine perspective) led us to err on different ends of the lumping versus splitting spectrum.",

          "authors": "Mahsa Hazrati; Pegah Nejat; Ali Daneshi",
          "abstract": "As a culture-sensitive theory in moral psychology, Moral foundations theory (MFT) has generated a considerable volume of studies since its inception. The theory has very recently been refined by splitting the Fairness foundation to Equality and Proportionality, leading to the introduction of a second version of its corresponding questionnaire, namely, Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2). Given the low internal consistencies of a number of moral foundations in the former version of the questionnaire (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire-1), the present study aimed to examine psychometric properties of the Persian MFQ-2, including its relation to MFQ-1. Data were collected from two separate samples (N1 = 381, N2 = 989). Internal consistencies of the subscales were acceptable and comparable to those from cross-cultural studies, in addition to showing an improvement over MFQ-1. Exploratory factor analysis led to four factors, with Loyalty, Authority and Purity loading on one, and Care, Equality and Proportionality each loading on a separate factor. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested acceptable fit for the proposed six-factor model and a number of second-order two-factor models. Subscales were most strongly related to their corresponding MFQ-1 subscales, confirming their convergent validity. We also replicated and went beyond the existing literature on sociodemographic correlates of moral foundations by investigating the relations between the revised set of moral foundations and both religiosity and political orientation in the context of the non-Western Iranian culture. Proportionality had the weakest relations to sociodemographics among all foundations. We close by discussing implications of the findings for the content validity of MFQ-2 foundations and justifiability of labelling them as individualizing and binding foundations.",

          "authors": "Inés Abalo-Rodríguez; Paco Calvo",
          "abstract": "Plants have traditionally been viewed as passive organisms, primarily reacting to environmental stimuli. However, research over the past century has revealed that plants exhibit a range of sophisticated abilities, such as integrating multiple sources of information, anticipating environmental changes, and communicating with other organisms. This has led to the emergence of plant neurobiology, which argues that physiology alone is not enough to fully comprehend the vast capacities of plants. Consequently, terms like ‘behaviour’, ‘intelligence’ and ‘cognition’ are applied to the plant kingdom, prompting ongoing discussions. As these notions pertain to the psychological realm, this paper incorporates the perspective of behaviour analysis to illuminate the current debate. This framework adopts an emergentist view of psychological phenomena, defending their irreducibility to physiological processes alone. Furthermore, behaviour analysis understands both behaviour and the ‘mind’ as psychological concepts that require learning processes for full comprehension, thereby highlighting their irreducible to physiology due to their distinct nature. Therefore, this approach emphasizes the importance of studying learning processes in plant neurobiology and addressing the methodological challenges it entails. In summary, this paper argues for the relevance of behavioural analysis in broadening our understanding of plant capabilities and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration. By integrating insights from behavioural analysis and plant neurobiology we can advance our understanding of plant intelligence and behaviour, challenging traditional views and enriching the scientific discourse on cognition and interaction in the plant kingdom.",

A set of external scales assessing various values were used for assessing convergent validity of MAC-Q. Both correlated seven-factor and second-order individualizing-binding two-factor models showed good fit, particularly for separate Relevance and Judgement sections. The majority of MAC-Q, especially Judgement, subscales correlated significantly and most strongly with their corresponding external scales. Alphas were generally higher for Relevance than Judgement subscales. Moreover, MAC-Q, especially Judgement, made significant improvement over MFQ in predicting most external scales. We conclude by highlighting MAC-Q subscales in highest need of internal consistency enhancement or content refinement, as well as providing suggestions.",

Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments.

In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "It is a well-established finding that more informative optic flow (e.g., faster, denser, or presented over a larger portion of the visual field) yields decreased variability in heading judgements. Current models of heading perception further predict faster processing under such circumstances, which has, however, not been supported empirically so far. In this study, we validate a novel continuous psychophysics paradigm by replicating the effect of the speed and density of optic flow on variability in performance, and we investigate how these manipulations affect the temporal dynamics. To this end, we tested 30 participants in a continuous psychophysics paradigm administered in Virtual Reality. We immersed them in a simple virtual environment where they experienced four 90-second blocks of optic flow where their linear heading direction (no simulated rotation) at any given moment was determined by a random walk. We asked them to continuously indicate with a joystick the direction in which they perceived themselves to be moving. In each of the four blocks they experienced a different combination of simulated self-motion speeds (SLOW and FAST) and density of optic flow (SPARSE and DENSE). Using a Cross-Correlogram Analysis, we determined that participants reacted faster and displayed lower variability in their performance in the FAST and DENSE conditions than in the SLOW and SPARSE conditions, respectively. Using a Kalman Filter-based analysis approach, we found a similar pattern, where the fitted perceptual noise parameters were higher for SLOW and SPARSE. While replicating previous results on variability, we show that more informative optic flow can speed up heading judgements, while at the same time validating a continuous psychophysics as an efficient method for studying heading perception.",

Results of Study 2 (N= 248) replicated these findings. Also, they showed that perfection strivers are more likely than excellence strivers to catastrophize about small mistakes, use reassurance seeking safety behaviors, and underperform in their exams. Excellencism and perfectionism are related but different pursuits, and their differentiation is essential to unveil the unhealthy role of perfectionistic standards in the nomological network of test anxiety.

Here, we present an overview of studies providing compositionality estimates for complex words, by defining a classification system that includes (1) the type of expression (compound nouns, particle verbs, derivations), (2) the language, (3) the level of description (i.e., focusing on individual constituents vs. the entire complex word), and (4) the information source providing the estimate (human judgments vs. computational models).

          "abstract": "Interaction effects are commonly investigated in psychological research. Spurious interaction effects can occur, for instance because the outcome variable is related in a nonlinear way to an independent variable. Our study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate to what extent interaction terms in linear models can approximate non-linear phenomena, and (2) to assess how well linear models capture non-standard moderation effects. \nIn Study 1, we created population data where the outcome variable was either monotonically or non-monotonically related to a predictor. In Study 2, we created population data sets, in which effects of one predictor on the correlation between outcome and another predictor were present. In both studies, we varied the correlation between the predictor variables, the signal to noise ratio, and the sample size. We applied linear regression models, both with and without an interaction term. We assessed the Type-1-Error rate, the sample effect size of the interaction effects, and the explained variance of the estimated model in the sample and in the population.\nFor study 1, we found that traditional interaction terms were associated with increased Type-I error rates, but small effect sizes. For study 2, we found that if the effect is non-monotonic a traditional interaction term in a linear model does not sufficiently capture such effects.\nWe conclude that relying solely on traditional interaction terms in linear models can be misleading. It may be beneficial to consider alternative modeling approaches or more flexible methods to better capture and understand non-linear and irregular dependency effects.",

Previous investigations of sleep-dependent memory consolidation have explored top-down mechanisms on memory selection (e.g., future relevance) or utilized stimuli that are easily differentiated by participants (e.g., emotional stimuli). Here, we tested the role of bottom-up influences on sleep-dependent consolidation, specifically testing whether the intrinsic memorability of a stimulus is related to how likely an image is to be remembered after sleep. We found that sleep selectively consolidated only high memorability images. Previous work has shown that participants could not reliably predict image memorability, suggesting that our observed benefit for high memorability images reflected an automatic selection process. We provide the first evidence that one mechanism of selective memory consolidation during sleep is based on perceptual features, suggesting that unconscious “relevance” at encoding impacts subsequent consolidation.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can quickly process groups of objects (ensembles) and build compressed representations of their features. What does the conscious perception of ensembles consist of? Observers‘ explicit access to ensemble representations has been considered very limited – any distributional aspects beyond simple summary statistics, such as the mean or variance, cannot be explicitly accessed. In contrast, here we demonstrate that the visual system can represent ensemble distributions in detail and observers have reliable explicit access to these representations. In our new paradigm (Feature Frequency Report) observers viewed 36 disks of various colors for 800 ms and then reported the frequency of a randomly chosen color using a slider. The sets had Gaussian, uniform, or bimodal color distributions with a random mean color. The distributions of responses – both aggregated and separate for each observer – followed the shape of the presented distribution. Modeling revealed that performance reflected integrated information from the whole set rather than sub-sampling. After only brief exposure to a color set, the visual system can build detailed representations of feature distributions that observers have explicit access to. This result necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how ensembles are processed. We suggest that such distribution representations are the most natural way for the visual system to consciously represent groups of objects. Explicit feature distribution representations may contribute to people‘s impression of having a rich perceptual experience despite severe attentional and working memory limitations.",

          "authors": "Marina Bornovalova; Haya Fatimah; Michael D. Hunter",
          "abstract": "Substance use relapse is difficult to define, and previous work has used one-size-fits-all ad-hoc definitions. Researchers have called for a dynamic and personalized understanding of relapse as a concept and model, necessitating novel statistical tools. We aimed to develop and validate a novel statistical model of latent relapse processes: the double-well potential model (DWPM). This model describes post-treatment substance use in terms of a dynamical system with stable equilibria of abstinence and relapse, a person-specific dominant equilibria (tilt), the ease of changing between equilibria (steepness), and an overall relapse risk (RR). Using timeline followback data from N=139 adults with a substance use disorder transitioning back to the community after residential treatment, we examined individual differences and the criterion-related validity of DWPM parameters to determine the clinical utility of the double-well model.  While non-use was the predominant stable state across participants, we found significant between-subjects variability steepness and RR. These individual differences were predictable via demographics, baseline psychopathology, treatment history, and treatment condition. Steepness and RR also predicted long-term outcomes, including life satisfaction and criminal behavior, above and beyond traditional metrics of relapse (proportion of days used, time to first use). Thus, the DWPM is a strong theoretical and statistical representation of the underlying relapse processes. Moreover, the parameters show criterion-related validity and may be useful in precision medicine.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of the active inference framework, two popular theories of consciousness high-light the relevance of insular cortex for interoceptive self-modeling (Fermin et al., 2022; Seth, 2021) and subcortical brain regions for qualitative experience (Solms, 2021). Both provide a compelling ecological argument for integrated conscious experience, i.e., self-organization of complex organisms with optimization goals that are usually parallel, multifaceted, and hard to reconcile. Computationally, both theories require some kind of self-model as basis, which could contradict credible reports of minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) (Metzinger, 2024). However, duality of conscious experience could be explained by a neuroscientific theo-ry of two distinct brain networks emerging from different neurodevelopmental pathways, leading to marked differences in cytoarchitecture and function (Luu et al., 2024; Sanides, 1962). System-A, originating from an olfactory system and amygdala-centered expansion gradient towards ventral cortex, could enable interoceptive self-modeling for habitual interac-tions with the body and the world. System-H, hippocampus-centered towards dorsal cortex, could enable less egocentric forms of cognition and experience. In this sense, MPE could be a less salient/habitual form of experience, when neither interoceptive/exteroceptive prediction errors nor spontaneous episodic memory reactivation provide self-referential engagement of System-A. System-H, if not operating on content, could give rise to self-less experience of the world as such.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates characteristics, predictors and outcomes of religious deconversion on a wide range of variables. The analytic sample for this study comprises n = 4451 respondents, including a longitudinal sample of n = 502, from two decades of mixed-method research on faith development, religious change, and deconversion in Germany and the US. The analytic strategy for the longitudinal sample adopts an exposure- and outcome-wide longitudinal design to examine cross-time associations of self-reported religious deconversion (‘deconverted from the religion growing up’ vs. ‘stayed with the religion growing up’) with a range of less studied predictors and outcomes, assessed on average eight years before and eight years after the report of deconversion. Measures include, but are not limited to religious schemata, religious centrality, fundamentalism, pluralism, God representation, mystical experiences, psychological well-being, personality traits, generativity, need for cognition, and intellectual humility. Results include the strong predicting effect of low scores on both truth of texts and teachings and self-rating as religious, and generally document lower scores on all dimensions of religiosity before, during and following deconversion; indications of a religious residue effect appear to be overturned by secularization trajectories toward religious irrelevance. Unique in our data, results indicate high openness to experience, low extraversion and low positive relations with others as predictors, while high need for cognition and low extraversion emerged as outcomes of deconversion. Finally, this study allowed the reexamination and general confirmation of the criteria for deconversion that were proposed in 2004 by Streib and Keller.",

To explore this discrepancy, we investigated the variables that might influence the processing of overtly presented derived words in German, focusing on the effects of semantic transparency, affix type and experimental task. Semantic transparency and affix type were manipulated across two tasks: cross-modal priming (N = 110) and auditory gap detection (N = 60). Results showed robust semantic transparency effects for all derived words. This was however further influenced by affix type, which modulated the processing of opaque but not transparent words; as well as the task demands. These results imply that morphological structure, affix type and task demands all combine to determine the processing and representation of derived words in German, bringing previously conflicting results across languages closer together.",

          "abstract": "Recent behavioral studies have shown that humans possess self-awareness of their individual timing ability in that they can discern the direction of their timing error. However, in these studies which included a single repeat (re-do) trial for each duration, it remains unclear whether the reduction in errors in the Re-do trials was due to self-awareness of individual timing ability or because the participants used the feedback from the initial trials to improve on the re-do ones. To investigate this further, we conducted a behavioral study in which subjects were divided into two groups: one in which the “Re-do” phase occurred frequently, but not always (80% of trials; called the “high double” group), and one in which Re-do trials were rare (20% of trials; called the “low double” group). This was done to test the possibility of subjects relying on the Re-do trials as a method of improvement. Subjects significantly improved in their performance on Re-do trials regardless of whether re-dos were rare or frequent. Further, an unexpected finding was observed, where subjects in the low double group also overall performed better than those in the high double group. This finding suggests that subjects, knowing that re-do opportunities were rare, engaged better timing at the outset; yet, these subjects still improved on Re-do trials, suggesting humans are able to incorporate both global uncertainty and feedback.",

          "authors": "Edmundo Lopez-Sola; Roser Sanchez-Todo; Jakub Vohryzek; Francesca Castaldo; Giulio Ruffini",
          "abstract": "The phenomenon of \"pure awareness\", central to many contemplative traditions, has recently attracted scientific interest for its relevance to the study of consciousness. In this paper, we investigate pure awareness through the algorithmic agent model, a computational framework with roots in algorithmic information theory. This framework proposes that agents build compressive models of the world for evolutionary success. Structured experience arises from running such models, thus linking phenomenology with computation and offering insights into the emergence of pure awareness in both natural and artificial systems. We propose that pure awareness, as a stand-alone phenomenon, may correspond to minimally structured experiences achieved through meditation, psychedelics, or other deconstructive practices. Crucially, while such experiences are often perceived as contentless or unfabricated, both phenomenological and theoretical evidence suggest that some degree of fabrication or modeling remains involved. A key hypothesis is that the phenomenology of pure awareness arises from a specific model: the agent's model of its own modeling process. Importantly, the agent's recognition of the modeling process can occur alongside other phenomenal content (as in non-dual awareness) and is associated with stable changes in valence computation, potentially reducing suffering. Our exploration offers new insights into consciousness science by examining the minimal possible experiences for an agent. It also contributes to refining our moral stance towards both natural and artificial agents and helps us better understand the mechanisms and constraints involved in facilitating such transformative experiences.",

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, 2,682 participants were tested online while 1,159 participants were tested in person as the original protocol called for. Our analyses revealed that the SMARTE score and sub-scores highly correlated with each other. Overall fluency metrics revealed more problems per unit time were completed in the laboratory setting, yet a host of experimental contrasts that manipulated the cognitive demands across problem types produced equivalent effects across both settings, suggesting these effects are quite robust across variations in study setting.",

The negative relationship between math anxiety and both WM and performance is well-established, and some studies have also found WM to mediate the effect of math anxiety on mathematics performance. However, much less is known, first, about the interplay of WM and positive motivational factors, such as interest in mathematics, and second, about the dynamics of these cognitive and affective processes, particularly among elementary school students. Consequently, in this study, we examined both the direct and mediated effects of math anxiety and interest through WM on fourth grade students’ (N = 332) performance in an arithmetic fluency task, while acknowledging their generalized anxiety. Findings from a model applying structural equation modeling showed math anxiety to predict performance negatively, while the effects of WM and interest were positive. There was also a negative indirect effect from math anxiety through WM to mathematics performance indicating partial mediation while a corresponding, but positive, effect was not found in terms of interest. Generalized anxiety also played a role in students’ domain-specific tendencies. The results emphasize the importance of acknowledging the interplay of cognition and affect in students’ academic pursuits.",

          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA), the feeling of being the author for one’s actions and their outcomes, is a critical factor in decision-making, particularly in moral contexts. While prior research has explored its neural correlates, most studies have focused on neutral tasks and convenience samples, overlooking the impact of moral decision-making. In addition, previous studies mostly focused on classic convenience samples, ignoring that some social environments may influence how authorship in moral decision-making is processed, such as the military. This study investigated the neural correlates of SoA in civilians and military personnel during moral decision-making, examining free and coerced choices in both agent and commander roles. Using an fMRI paradigm where participants could either freely choose or follow orders to inflict a mild shock on a victim, we assessed SoA through temporal binding (TB)—a temporal distortion that occurs when individuals make voluntary compared to less voluntary decisions. Our findings suggested that SoA is reduced when following orders compared to acting freely in both the agent role and the commander role. Several brain regions correlated with TB, notably the occipital lobe, the superior frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the precuneus, and the lateral occipital cortex. Importantly, no differences emerged between military and civilians at corrected thresholds, suggesting that the daily environment has only a small influence on the neural basis involved in moral decision-making, opening the path to a greater generalizability of the findings.",

          "abstract": "Identical memory items have the potential to reduce cognitive demands on visual working memory (VWM) and enhance its precision. Previous studies have investigated this question preliminarily. However, there is still some controversy surrounding this question, as we cannot confirm whether the benefits from identical items can be generalized to complex stimuli. This study aimed to explore it further. We investigated whether individuals compress the identical items within their memory range to reduce VWM capacity consumption. Participants performed a change detection task, memorizing the orientations of the memory array, which included three conditions: 1) four-same orientations, 2) two pairs of same orientations, and 3) four-different orientations. Using the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related potential component that is sensitive to the number of items stored in VWM, we found that the CDA amplitude in late-time window was significantly lower for the all-same condition compared to the partial same and all-different conditions, with no significant difference between the latter two conditions. Our findings suggest that participants compress identical information, reducing VWM capacity consumption and increasing the number of items that can be remembered. However, this compression is conditional and occurs only when the strategy is most efficient, as in the all-same condition.",

In the context of clinical psychology, trial designs using sequential Bayesian analyses have been proposed as a way to accelerate psychological treatment development. However, a focus on Bayesian analyses as a means to conduct sequential testing may hinder uptake of such methods due to a lack of familiarity amongst many researchers. Demonstrating how equivalent sequential analyses are possible using non-Bayesian (e.g., frequentist) analyses could increase the accessibility of these methods and thus the extent to which psychological treatment development research can benefit from more time and resource-efficient trial designs.

Compassion-focused therapy interventions, aimed at promoting self-compassion capabilities, have shown efficacy in improving mental health outcomes in autistic and non- autistic samples suffering from self-criticism that contribute to difficulties in emotion regulation. We explored the experiences of autistic adults during a brief one-week online self- compassion exercise to evaluate it’s feasibility and acceptability through self-report, experience sampling, and parasympathetic activity measured via HRV. Pre- to post- intervention comparisons showed significant improvement in trait self-compassion and fears of self-compassion, but this did not extend to acute measures of psychological distress\n1\n(depression, anxiety, and stress) nor difficulties in emotion regulation. HRV measures displayed significant increases during self-compassionate practice, although there were no significant changes in physiological reactivity pre- to post-intervention. Experience sampling measures found that whether participants acted on opportunities to be self-compassionate was predictive of concurrent evaluations of affective system activation, whereby acting self- compassionately was associated with greater reported activation of drive and soothing affective systems, and reduced activation of the threat affective system. Together, our findings support the use of multimodal approaches to investigating the accessibility and efficacy of compassion-focused approaches to resolving emotional difficulties experienced by autistic adults.",

Además, se evaluó el nivel de burnout mediante la escala Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (16) y se hizo la medición de la salud mental positiva utilizando la escala Lukat-Positive Mental Health Scale (14), ambas validadas al español (15)(17). Posteriormente se realizó el análisis de datos por medio del aplicativo SPSS mediante pruebas paramétricas y no paramétricas. \nResultados: Se encontró que el 100% de los estudiantes de medicina que participaron presentaron burnout, con un nivel de burnout moderado y alto del 72.4% de los participantes. Además, se evidenció que el burnout se presenta más en las mujeres y en décimo semestre en comparación con doceavo semestre. Así mismo con respecto, a los hábitos de vida saludables, se observó que, a mayor puntaje en los instrumentos de buena higiene del sueño y actividad física, mayor era la salud mental positiva y menor el nivel de burnout.

          "abstract": "Lesion characteristics (e.g., types, extents, and locations) vary widely in patients with moderate to severe Traumatic Brain Injury (ms-TBI). Automated tools for parcellating anatomical MRI scans, such as FastSurfer, assume the input brain has normal anatomy. Thus, heterogeneous lesions often cause parcellation errors. In this lesion simulation study, we test whether a recently developed lesion filling tool (Virtual Brain Grafting, VBG) reduces FastSurfer parcellation errors. T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were obtained from 140 healthy controls and 14 ms-TBI patients from the ENIGMA TBI working group. Binary masks indexing focal lesions (ranging from small [38mm3] unilateral, to large [164,291mm3] bilateral lesions) in the ms-TBI patients were each projected onto 10 healthy control T1w MRIs, creating a group of 140 synthetically lesioned images (lesions from 14 patients x 10 HCs T1w images). VBG was used to fill lesioned images with simulated healthy brain tissue, creating 140 VBG-filled images. A third set of lesion-free images were created in the same anatomical space, to be used as the “ground truth” against which to compare the lesioned and VBG-filled images. FastSurfer was used to parcellate the cortex. The accuracy of VBG filling was assessed qualitatively through visual inspection. Mean Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) and Percent Volume Differences (PVD) between lesioned and lesion-free images were compared to DSC and PVD scores between VBG-filled and lesion-free images, using paired sample t-tests.\nVBG-filled images predominantly showed anatomically plausible filling. However, several distinct boundaries and visible textural differences were observed, especially for lesions on the cortical ribbon. Near large focal lesions, VBG-filled images appeared more similar than the lesioned images to the ground truth (lesion-free images). Contrary to expectations, parcellations from lesioned images (DSC M = 0.93, SD = 0.03; PVD M = -0.40, SD = 1.7) had significantly higher DSCs [t(111) = 19.5, p &lt; 0.001], and lower PVDs [t(111) = 11.3, p &lt; 0.001] with the parcellations from the lesion-free images, compared to the parcellations from VBG-filled images (DSC M = 0.81, SD = 0.07; PVD M = -9.03, SD = 7.72). In other words, the parcellations from the lesioned images had closer spatial alignment and volume measurements were in greater agreement with the lesion-free (ground truth) images, when compared to VBG-filled images. \nThis unexpected finding might be due to a high frequency of smaller focal lesions in our TBI patients and a possible improvement in FastSurfer parcellations when encountering such lesions. VBG was not developed for lesions caused by TBI, and thus a lesion filling tool is needed that specifically addresses the heterogeneity of lesions observed in ms-TBI.",

Gender differences in mean wellbeing scores (men minus women) were computed in the overall sample and within each demographic subgroup, including age groups, household income levels, educational attainment, employment status, family structure, and residency.\nResult:  Overall, women scored higher in wellbeing metrics than men (e.g., the gap in mean life satisfaction: 0.55, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.47 to 0.64). This trend persisted across most subgroups, but there were no significant gender differences among teenagers (e.g., life satisfaction: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.32; composite flourishing score: -0.35, 95% CI: -2.14 to 1.42), individuals in their twenties (e.g., life satisfaction: 0.16, 95% CI: -0.08 to 0.41; composite flourishing score: 0.07, 95% CI: -0.97 to 1.11), and unmarried individuals with children (life satisfaction: -0.20, 95% CI: -0.54 to 0.45; composite flourishing score: -0.87, 95% CI: -3.46 to 1.72).\nDiscussion/Conclusions: While women generally reported higher wellbeing, certain subgroups exhibited unique patterns. Understanding these dynamics can inform targeted interventions to promote equity in wellbeing across demographic groups.",

          "authors": "Larry Douglas Fort; Cyril Costines; Marc Wittmann; Athena Demertzi; Timo Torsten Schmidt",
          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the conceptual and empirical study of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced pharmacologically or otherwise, driven by their potential clinical applications. To draw attention to the rich history of research in this domain, we review prominent classification schemes that have been proposed to introduce systematicity in the scientific study of ASCs. The reviewed ASC classification schemes fall into three groups according to the criteria they use for categorization: (1) based on the nature, variety, and intensity of subjective experiences (state-based), including conceptual descriptions and psychometric assessments, (2) based on the technique of induction (method-based), and (3) descriptions of neurophysiological mechanisms of ASCs (neuro/physio-based). By comparing and extending existing classification schemes, we can enhance efforts to identify neural correlates of consciousness, particularly when examining mechanisms of ASC induction and the resulting subjective experience. Furthermore, an overview of what defining ASC characteristics different authors have proposed can inform future research in the conceptualization and quantification of ASC subjective effects, including the identification of those that might be relevant in clinical research. This review concludes by clustering the concepts from the state-based schemes, which are suggested for classifying ASC experiences. The resulting clusters can inspire future approaches to formulate and quantify the core phenomenology of ASC experiences to assist in basic and clinical research.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental question in memory research has long been the interplay between briefly maintaining information in working memory (WM) and its enduring retention in long-term memory (LTM). Much of the research has explored how WM processes influence the formation of LTM and, in turn, how stored LTM can either support or disrupt WM performance. This Special Issue of Memory &amp; Cognition brings together cutting-edge research that delves into this relationship, showcasing studies that reveal the latest advances in the field. Additionally, it includes articles offering conceptual and theoretical insights to better understand the dynamic interaction between WM and LTM. The 25 articles presented here emphasize the ways in which information is transferred from WM to more durable representations in LTM as well as how WM flexibly draws on LTM to overcome its limited capacity. In many ways, the quality and quantity of contributions to this Special Issue highlight the importance of jointly studying WM and LTM, inspiring future work to challenge pre-existing conceptions and stimulate new directions in the field of memory.",

          "abstract": "The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to deteriorate with age, accounting for some forms of memory loss in older adults, akin to a mild form of hippocampal amnesia. Hippocampal impairment entails the loss of explicit memory (e.g., source recognition) despite preservation of implicit memory (e.g., priming, as observed in word-stem completion paradigms). Many have argued that the crucial factor differentiating between implicit/explicit memory tasks is whether retrieval is automatic or whether it intentionally references a specific episode. We tested an alternative explanation of the implicit/explicit dissociation based on the content of memory rather than different retrieval processes. Under this view, memory for complex, associative items (e.g., scenes) should be impaired by aging, regardless of retrieval mode (i.e., for both implicit and explicit tasks), whereas memory for simpler items (e.g., individual objects) should not. We tested implicit retrieval of objects and scenes in younger and older adults, cueing memory with a partial “patch view” of the images, analogous to word-stem completion; our findings supported the content-based explanation.",

Across 32 estimates from 9 independent samples, which all came from WEIRD countries and were of European ancestry (Ntotal=452,864), our meta-analytic estimate for the association between polygenic and phenotypic intelligence was ρ=.245 (p&lt;.001, 95% CI=.184 – .307), an effect of medium size. The meta-analytic estimate varied across samples, studies, and phenotypic measures of intelligence, and even after accounting for these moderators, polygenic score predictions remained significantly heterogenous.

          "authors": "Jonathan Lieberman; Patrick McConnell; Mar Estarellas; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "Focused attention meditation (FA-M) is a foundational and widely studied practice that cultivates sustained attention by focusing on a specific object, such as the breath, while disengaging from distractions. Numerous studies have investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of FA-M, examining aspects such as oscillatory activity, connectivity patterns, and neural entropy. However, despite this extensive research, clarity regarding the methodological approaches and key findings in this field remains limited. This scoping systematic review aimed to collate and interpret key information from EEG and MEG studies on FA-M, with a focus on study population composition, experimental design, and neurophysiological outcomes. Our findings revealed substantial heterogeneity in participant characteristics, potentially contributing to variability in neurophysiological results, while the choice of FA-M tasks and control conditions was relatively consistent. In terms of neurophysiological outcomes, consistent trends indicate that FA-M is associated with increased power in the alpha, beta, and gamma bandwidths, as well as heightened complexity and reduced criticality measures. Based on the findings of this review, we propose several methodological recommendations to improve the quality of future research. Additionally, we identified significant evidence gaps when considering the whole body of research, including the limited use of MEG and a lack of longitudinal studies, pointing to areas for future investigation. Overall, this review provides a firm grounding for the study of the neurophysiology of FA-M, as well as the study of advanced meditation and neuroscience-informed meditative development.",

For simple decisions, the threshold-based account, which says that individuals gather less evidence when responding quickly, is widely accepted. We present a fundamentally different account, arguing that evidence accumulation is more self-excitatory under time pressure, and show that it provides a better explanation of the SAT across six existing datasets (fits to 179 individuals across more than 78,000 trials). We demonstrate that this model better captures key behavioral patterns than the traditional evidence-threshold model, and is more parsimonious than a collapsing-threshold model, which can also account for the data in principle. Finally, we propose that self-excitation emerges from a confirmation bias in attention allocation, such that initially promising evidence is preferentially attended and so drives the decision process when making fast decisions.",

Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of their prevalence, impact, and nature. Here, this gap is filled via an analysis of &gt;29 million papers published in 19 disciplines over 200+ years. Results indicate that big team science is increasingly frequent – yet extremely rare – and generally focuses on building upon (vs. disrupting) lines of research. Consistent with collective intelligence theories, unusually large teams tend to have unusually large impact, in terms of median yearly citations. However, such teams navigate a diseconomy of scale, wherein adding co-authors yields diminishing increases in citations. An analysis of contributorship classifications from &gt; 47,000 papers further illustrates how the structure of scientific collaborations evolves in pursuit of such efforts. Consistent with structural differentiation theories, increasingly large collaborative efforts feature increasingly specialized roles. Taken together, results provide a systematic, evidence-based characterization of big team science: unusual endeavors wherein researchers typically adopt specialized roles and navigate inefficiencies to make unusually high impact advancements to existing lines of thinking.",

Baseline (pre-treatment) and 8-week (range 4-12 weeks) outcome data from the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were subjected to best-practice factor analysis (FA), item response theory (IRT) and network analysis (NA) approaches. Trial outcomes for the original summative scores and psychometric-model scores were assessed using multilevel models. Percentage differences in Cohen’s d effect sizes for the original summative and psychometrically-modelled scores were the effects of interest. Each method produced unidimensional models but the modified scales varied from 7-10 items. Treatment effects were unchanged for IRT (10 items), decreased by 1.3%-2.8% for NA (8 items), and increased by 11%-12.5% for FA (7 items). IRT and NA yielded negligible differences in effect outcomes relative to original trials. FA increased effect sizes and may be the most effective method for identifying the items on which placebo and treatment group outcomes differ.",

          "abstract": "Previous research proposed the devaluation of positive information, referred to as cognitive immunisation, as a mechanism underlying the persistence of negative expectations in depression. In a pre-registered experimental study, we tested this hypothesis by enhancing vs. inhibiting the engagement in cognitive immunisation and comparing it with a distraction control condition and a no-instruction control condition. In a sample of patients with major depression (N = 156), we presented participants with video recordings of other patients in which they reported on the positive effects of psychotherapy. Cognitive immunisation was manipulated by instructing participants to focus on similarities vs. differences between themselves and the persons from the videos. The results show that the other patients’ reports led to a significant increase in both participants’ expectations of future life events and their treatment expectations. However, there were no significant differences between the experimental conditions in expectation change, most likely because the manipulation was not powerful enough according to the manipulation check. Only in men the cognitive immunisation-promoting condition effectively blocked expectation change. This study shows that watching positive reports from other patients helps people with major depression improve their pre-treatment expectations. However, cognitive immunisation does not modulate this process, unless gender is considered.",

          "abstract": "Citizens are expected to hold corrupt politicians accountable. However, while observational studies and field experiments often find corrupt politicians re-elected, survey experiments show that citizens are unlikely to vote for corrupt candidates. This contradiction may arise because previous studies have not accounted for how citizens navigate political information in the real world. In this paper, we propose a model of corruption accountability that considers how citizens selectively engage with political information. We test this model using a PICA experimental design fielded in Spain. The results indicate that information selection can explain the limited consequences of corruption scandals, as not all citizens expose themselves to corruption information, and their likelihood to hold corrupt politicians accountable depends on their information preferences. These findings suggest corruption accountability may be increased not by informing those who select out of counter-attitudinal information, but by reaching inattentive citizens generally not exposed to political information.",

          "abstract": "Illegal dumping, the unauthorized disposal of waste in public spaces, poses significant environmental, social, and economic challenges, particularly in Ontario, Canada. This study investigates the drivers behind illegal dumping, with a focus on rural and urban communities in Ontario. Using a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys and interviews, we examine self-reported instances of dumping, attitudes towards waste management, and perceived barriers to legal waste disposal. The results reveal that inadequate waste collection infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and high disposal costs are primary motivators for illegal dumping. Additionally, a lack of awareness regarding proper disposal methods exacerbates the issue. While most respondents recognize the immorality of illegal dumping, rural participants show less guilt and are more likely to engage in the behavior. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, including the need for improved waste infrastructure, targeted educational campaigns, and increased enforcement efforts. By addressing these key factors, Ontario can mitigate the environmental and public health risks posed by illegal dumping, while fostering a culture of responsible waste disposal.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the rally-round-the-flag phenomenon of public opinion has increased in studies on reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In the same period, a separate research line has focused on political polarization and the strengthening of radical right parties in many countries. This study brings these two lines together by asking how public opinion in deeply polarized countries responds to violent international conflicts, which, under lesser polarization, would have likely led most citizens to close ranks behind the government and its war policy. To answer this question, we analyzed original panel data collected in Israel before and after the October 7 massacre and during Israel’s retaliation in Gaza. The findings reveal mixed patterns that we label “segmented rally:” The vast majority supported the war and trusted the security forces, but only a minority trusted the government and the prime minister. The analysis identified distinct sets of mechanisms of opinion formation. Rallying behind the war and security forces was motivated by feelings of threat, humiliation, and rage. In contrast, trust or mistrust of the government and the PM depended on whether respondents blamed the government or anti-government protests for the security crisis, an assessment driven by respondents’ preexisting views about the government’s “judicial reform” initiative. The paper concludes by discussing the mutual impacts of polarization and public reactions to crises.",

The concentration of HBE scholarship in English-speaking countries has led to missed opportunities to engage other partners in testing and expanding human behavioral ecological models of human behavioral and life history variation. In this review, we describe opportunities for broader human behavioral ecology-driven scholarship in the Chinese context. We introduce human behavioral ecology holistically, including its history, methodological frameworks, pet topics, recent integration with related fields, with a special emphasis on its recent integration with Chinese social, archaeological, and life sciences scholarship. We address potential criticisms of human behavioral ecology and how to ensure a robust and careful application of human behavioral ecology principles in the study of human behavior in China, past and present.

Here, we operationalize critical thinking skills into 6 measurable concepts (i.e., causation and correlation, independent data and replicates, reproducibility, credibility of sources, experimental control, and significance), and we explore whether teaching these 6 concepts enhances scientific literacy and/or resilience against fakeness (fake tweets) and misinformation. Mixed results from our study reveal that: 1) in a small group game on misinformation, critical thinking training significantly improves accuracy and speed in assessing the truthfulness of scientific information online; 2) in a large, preregistered, randomized trial, understanding and application of critical thinking skills concepts strongly correlates with participants’ ability to identify fake tweets and misinformation; however, critical thinking training with recorded videos does not enhance participants’ proficiency in detecting fakeness and misinformation. There is a need to develop innovative interventions to prepare people to respond to misinformation, which is fast-evolving. Tools to support misinformation-specific critical thinking skills have been largely unexplored, and we anticipate such tools might be a valuable contribution to help the public navigate infodemics.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing need to maximise the social benefits achieved from public investment in infrastructure, particularly with the transition to net zero economies. Project Delivery Models (PDMs)—the contractual agreements that set out roles and responsibilities for infrastructure project partners—can underpin the delivery of social benefits, yet the processes involving their selection are largely opaque. In this paper we explore how social considerations inform PDM selection and how this is facilitated by policy. We interviewed highly experienced procurement professionals from the sector about how social benefits and risks are considered. We also examined how the associated regulatory environment supports social considerations through documentary analysis of auditing guidance documents. We found that not only are social benefits sidelined in early project decisions, but social risks are inadequately considered. An entrenched gap in social expertise contributes to this situation while project compartmentalisation presents challenges for inclusion and transparency in decision-making. Current auditing processes provide little incentive for social benefit consideration and reinforce both risk framing and compartmentalisation of major infrastructure projects. The paper offers new and important insights into this early project stage and distils five recommendations for improving social benefit creation from infrastructure investments, particularly in developed economies.",

          "abstract": "Recovery efforts of existing South Korean watchtower sites have been conducted as part of local tourism efforts and have contributed to public interest in the conservation and study of said sites. An additional 21 sites have been excavated in 2023, deemed important enough for reconstruction efforts (Yang, 2023). However, while significant research exists on the archeological sites themselves, there is scarcely any public recognition of the soldiers that manned the stations and their subsequent socioeconomic standing. Popular culture has abbreviated depictions of Joseon-dynasty watchtowers to a similar level: (significant for) “an extensive communications network to deliver information about enemy forces, that also employed horseback riders as an emergency backup” (Ntl. Institute of Kor. History, 2024).  I argue this depiction is overly generic and implies equivalence to Eurocentric watchtower practices, ignoring the cultural nuances that made the position of the average Joseon-dynasty watchman significantly challenging and fundamentally divergent from then-contemporary watchmen in European countries. This paper subsequently attempts to discern and critically evaluate the sociocultural status of soldiers stationed at Joseon watchtowers (Bonghwa), comparing them against European watchtowers and their socioeconomic conditions. Specific sites include Caernarfon Castle and Cheonlim Bonghwa Watchtower at the site of Cheonlim Mountain, the latter of which has been accompanied by more thorough artifact and observational fieldwork analysis. Recovered artifacts include living quarters, barriers, and tools. Further literature analysis was conducted to discern the socioeconomic standing and practices of Bonghwa watchmen in context of mid-century Joseon dynasty caste systems. In combining fieldwork and sociocultural analysis, I develop a multidimensional account of Joseon watchmen and prove that the soldiers assigned to Joseon watchtowers, Bonghwa, are representative of an underrepresented social dynamic, as well as providing insights into the philosophical and theological differences between the Western sphere through material conditions.",

A topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127) shows this longstanding Romantic understanding has largely disappeared; today, Apocalypticism is by far the dominant genre for conceiving them. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive evaluations of leisure and consumption opportunities. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers.

However, current research on mitigating misinformation is fragmented across disciplines, highlighting the need for an integrated framework. We present the Socio-Ecological Responses to Misinformation (SERM) framework, which outlines the key actors and interventions needed to effectively combat misinformation in democratic systems. The framework proposes a three-tiered approach that includes interventions at the policy level (e.g., transparency regulations), the organizational level (e.g., educational programs in schools), and the social level (e.g., peer correction). These interventions target either the platform (e.g., transparency reporting) or the users (e.g., literacy). Ultimately, the interventions collectively reshape the information environment by supporting accurate information and reducing the amount of misinformation.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Alice Baker",
          "abstract": "This chapter provides an ethnographic account of how content creators present cancer cures on TikTok. It assesses the quality of cancer cure videos algorithmically recommended by TikTok, the radicalization pathways afforded by short video platforms like TikTok and their potential to cause online harms. Content creators commonly feature contrarian doctors and draw on a conspiratorial worldview to present various miracle cures as intentionally concealed and stigmatized by the establishment. This framing gives credence to creators’ claims and the cures they promote. It also presents TikTok as a more reliable platform from which to access health information censored by the mainstream. Since TikTok is used as a search engine by younger demographics, it becomes a key means of accessing health information. Using TikTok to access health information poses significant risks: First, the technological affordances of TikTok render the app susceptible to radicalizing users. While radicalization is not technologically determined by simply viewing content, radicalization can occur through the endless scroll of conspiratorial content algorithmically recommended to users searching for cancer cures on the platform through a gradual process of socialization. Second, short form videos can become a gateway to radical views because these videos commonly direct users to personal bios, websites and ecommerce stores. Third, radicalization and online harms can be facilitated by TikTok because the app provides accessible avenues for monetization that incentivize content creators to profit from fake cancer cures. This research has important implications for content moderators because the risk of cancer misinformation is not limited to the content uploaded the platform, but the ways in which short videos become a gateway to harmful products and more extreme, conspiratorial content.",

LLMs are designed to generate text that mimics human speech, often detached from factual reality, which poses risks when used unchecked. Developers and corporations advancing LLM technology argue for enhanced effectiveness through increased context window size and computational power. However, this paper challenges this assertion, arguing that augmenting the context window primarily improves the LLMs' ability to generate human-like narratives rather than enhancing their capacity for real-world decision-making. The paper advocates for a paradigm shift where LLMs move beyond merely sounding human to effectively adjudicating real-world challenges, emphasizing the need for ethical and practical advancements in AI development to mitigate the risks associated with misinformation and naive use of LLMs in critical decision-making processes. Finally, the paper proposes alternative approaches and criteria to address identified limitations; including grounded language models, causal reasoning integration, ethical frameworks, hybrid systems, and interactive learning.",

We find that violence against women is common, that most violence against women is not reported to the police, that violence by husbands is less likely to be reported than violence by others, and that the reporting of violence has not improved over the last decade and a half. These concerning findings highlight the urgent need for social and legal interventions to reduce violence against women, and to improve its reporting.",

          "abstract": "Large local government spending cuts in England, spanning over a decade of austerity politics, have severely restricted the universal services and public goods that shape parenting environments. Drawing on the Reproductive Justice framework, we ask whether restricting the right to parent in safe and healthy environments impinged on the right to have children. To do so, we introduce a new quantitative approach for “thinking with” Reproductive Justice. Using nationally representative UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) data and a within-between random effects model, we analyse whether local government spending cuts were associated with intersectional inequalities in childbearing over the 2010-2020 period. We find that local government spending cuts significantly decreased the probability of having a(nother) birth for women in the poorest households, by 9.1%, but not for women in the middle or richest households. Further, racially minoritised women across income categories were much more likely to live in local authorities that suffered substantial cuts. Although austerity policies may not have directly restricted people’s biological capacity to conceive, our findings show that local government austerity cuts unequally restricted the right to have children.",

Introducing the concept of ontological erasure, the study explores how certain groups and struggles are deliberately rendered invisible or depoliticized. Through reflexive thematic analysis and semiotic analysis, the research reveals how empathy is framed selectively to align with commercial interests, transforming ethical engagement into an emotional transaction designed for consumption. The findings demonstrate how brands curate visibility and moral recognition, deciding which causes receive public attention while marginalizing others. By developing the concept of affective recognition, this study highlights the selective emotional engagement embedded in branded content and considers the implications for public understanding of social justice and moral responsibility. The theoretical contribution advances the ethics of visibility, demonstrating how the boundaries of epistemic justice are redefined within the economy of empathy.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the ethical dimensions of health communication during the 2022 mpox outbreak, focusing on the interplay between social media and public health officials in shaping stakeholder responses. Based on semi-structured interviews, findings reveal that social media played a crucial role in information dissemination for months during the crisis, while public health officials were slow to offer clear guidance. While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.",

          "authors": "Cornelius Heimstädt; Maximilian Heimstädt",
          "abstract": "In many areas of life, people who search for expert advice can now obtain it through algorithmic expert services. With these services, expert advice is generated by an algorithmic system and provided over a digital interface. Human experts disappear from direct interaction with clients, but instead orchestrate the algorithmic generation of expert advice from the back office of these services. Algorithmic expert services are often associated with the hope of making expert advice available to a large number of clients in a profitable way. However, this expectation is challenged by research on the role of shared expert values in and around organizations. In this study, we therefore explore how human experts in the back office of algorithmic expert services deal with tensions between their expert values and the imperative of scaling. Empirically, we draw on ethnographic material from a startup developing an algorithmic expert service for agriculture. We find that the human experts in the back office experience tension between their core value (i.e., reducing the environmental damages caused by pesticides) and managerial demands to maximize the app’s user retention. The experts navigate this tension by constantly experimenting with new representations of advice in the app’s interface, a process in which they repeatedly embrace their core value while simultaneously reinterpreting it, until they eventually find a way of representing advice that accommodates both their core value and the monopolistic tendencies of digital capitalism. Our study thus contributes to debates about whether expert advice can be scaled up by organizations using algorithmic means, and the role of values therein.",

The study involved monitoring whether Snapchat’s friend recommendation algorithm would suggest connections to illegal drug dealers.\n\nResults: Within four days, 65% of the profiles were directed to drug dealers through Snapchat’s recommendations despite no prior engagement with illegal content. This shows that the algorithm can push users from legal to illegal activities directly in the app.\n\nConclusions: The findings highlight the role of social media algorithms in enabling digital drift into crime, transforming these platforms from offender convergence spaces to facilitators of illegal activities. Further research should explore algorithmic biases and their implications for digital criminology.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to environmental burdens, such air and noise pollution or the lack of available green spaces, has been linked to a multitude of detrimental outcomes. Previous evidence indicates that poor residents and foreign minorities in European cities are disproportionately exposed to environmental burdens. However, there are substantial but ill-understood differences between European countries and between cities within countries. To address this limitation, we utilise fine-grained 1km-by-1km neighbourhood grid data on objective air and noise pollution as well as green space availability, enriched with administrative data on poverty rates and foreign minority shares from all German cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. We examine whether poor residents and foreign minorities are more often affected by environmental burdens, how their exposure to environmental burdens differs between cities, and what city-specific contextual factors contribute to these between-city differences. We find evidence that foreign minorities are more likely to be exposed to environmental burdens, but poor residents are predominantly not. However, there is considerable variation between cities. The strongest explanatory factor for this variation is the extent to which disadvantaged groups live in central neighbourhoods, less so residential segregation of poor and foreign residents, or the scarcity of ‘clean and healthy’ neighbourhoods in a city. Against these results, we further explore empirically how the current wave of inner-city gentrification might ease environmental inequality in German cities.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the divergent development of the platform-based food delivery sector in Germany, focusing on why the ideal-typical gig economy model based on self-employed couriers has not taken hold. Unlike other countries, Germany stands out as an exceptional case where large food delivery platforms classify their workers as employees, providing them with rights and benefits such as minimum wage, paid vacation, and sick leave. The study uses a historical-sociological case study approach to reconstruct the development of the sector and the decision-making processes that have influenced this development. Drawing on historical institutionalism, the analysis examines different heuristics for divergent paths: self-reinforcing path dependence, self-induced reactive sequences, critical junctures, mindful path creation, and transformative incremental change. The study finds that early market shaping by the pioneering company Bringdienst.de (later called Pizza.de), which focused on equipping restaurants to deliver online orders without taking responsibility for the delivery itself, significantly influenced the market environment. In addition, a court ruling in 2020 has increased the risk perception of bogus self-employment among platforms, leading to the abandonment of the gig worker model with self-employed couriers. The study concludes that the critical juncture heuristic, combined with a shadow of the past effect of market constitution, best explains the unique development in Germany.",

During this period, Denmark experienced a cultural revival marked by the widespread influence of German philosophical thought, especially the ideas of Kant, Hegel, and the Romantics. The central objective of this research is to explore how the discussions on Romantic irony, subjectivism, and the cultural crisis shaped Kierkegaard's philosophical development. The analysis focuses on the main intellectual figures of the era, such as Johan Ludvig Heiberg, Hans Lassen Martensen, and Poul Martin Møller, and how their contributions influenced Kierkegaard's formative years. This work challenges the traditional view that isolates Kierkegaard from his contemporaries, proposing instead that he actively engaged with and responded to the ongoing debates of his time. By contextualizing his work within the broader cultural transformations of Denmark's Golden Age, the study aims to illuminate Kierkegaard's early philosophical positions and the origins of his concept of irony.",

Findings reveal a growing tendency of being childfree and not expecting to have children in life. In particular, they indicate a nuanced demographic gradient: we observe a decline in fertility desires and expectations with age, and a significant increase in the likelihood of not desiring children for women. Educational background, which was positively associated with fertility desires at the beginning of the observational period, in post-pandemic shows a negative or null relationship.

Internet searches can be precursors of conflict intensity as a result of e.g. an increase in protests, violent behavior, or public announcements. Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties. I demonstrate the value of salience variables using various out-of-sample windows and performance metrics on the country- and province-month level.

          "abstract": "A fundamental concern in studying social inequalities is understanding how socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages are passed down from generation to generation. However, previous studies have not adequately distinguished between the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to socioeconomic disadvantage. In this paper, we use Finnish register data on twins born from 1975 to 1986, considering a total of 7,628 pairs, to analyze how genetic and environmental factors are associated with dropout from secondary education, unemployment, and the receipt of social assistance during early adulthood. The results of the twin design show that not only environmental but also genetic factors play a role in all measured socioeconomic disadvantage outcomes. For school dropout and, particularly, unemployment, genetic components explain more than shared environment. Conversely, for the receipt of social assistance, the shared environment component is larger than the genetic component. This result indicates that living in impoverished economic conditions is more dependent on factors related to social resources than those related to genetic inheritance. Of all the measured indicators, the unique environment is the most important, indicating the influence of stochastic life events regarding socioeconomically disadvantageous outcomes.",

We find a clear divergence in fund managers’ preference for soft information. “Soft-information” managers hold fewer stocks and tend to invest in companies with high growth potential and significant idiosyncratic risk. Trades driven by soft-information acquisition are profitable, resulting in superior performance by these managers, especially in their holdings of stocks rich with soft information. Fund managers’ distinct preferences for soft vs. hard information create segmentation in both information acquisition and investments.",

          "authors": "Michael Grätz; Sonia Petrini",
          "abstract": "Equality of opportunity is a principle of social justice, although there are different conceptions of it. We distinguish between fair and luck egalitarian equality of opportunity. Both conceptions consider to be unfair inequalities in life chances resulting from ascribed characteristics such as social origin and sex. They differ, however, in that fair equality of opportunity considers it fair when innate abilities affect life chances. Luck egalitarianism places innate abilities in the category of morally arbitrary factors that do not provide a just basis for inequalities in life chances. Empirically, we use genetic information to measure innate abilities and compare this approach to observing abilities later in life. Using genetic information allows us to better disentangle the role of innate abilities from those of environmental influences and individual choices. We apply this approach to nationally representative data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). According to our results, luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity is considerably larger than fair inequality of opportunity, especially for education. Measuring innate abilities using genetic information leads to very similar conclusions as using abilities measured later in life, with slightly smaller differences between fair and luck egalitarian inequality of opportunity.",

          "abstract": "Units of analysis in social research do not respond uniformly to events and interventions. Yet it is not always clear which axes of heterogeneity are most important to consider before data analysis. We use causal forests to nonparametrically uncover heterogeneous treatment effects. We then adapt causal forests and advance causal mediation forests to assess heterogeneous direct and indirect effects. This novel adaptation explores heterogeneity in the causal paths linking a treatment to an outcome through a binary, multinomial, or continuous mediator. Both\ncausal forests and causal mediation forests robustly adjust for high-dimensional confounders, yielding asymptotically normal and n1/2 consistent estimates. We show that forest-based approaches often outperform alternative methods in identifying effect heterogeneity. We apply the forest-based methods to study the heterogeneous effects of four-year college on reducing poverty with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and 1997 cohorts and find large gains for disadvantaged youth.",

          "authors": "Kaitlyn E. Shaw; Kenneth Wallen",
          "abstract": "Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) were extirpated from central Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem (BE) by 1946. After a failed attempt to reintroduce grizzlies to the BE in the 1990s, individual grizzlies have been documented in the region since 2007, with natural recovery a future potentiality in the region. To proactively inform conservation and management efforts amidst potential natural recovery, an exploratory mixed methods research design used interviews and focus groups to assess BE residents’ opinions on grizzly bear management, tolerance of grizzlies, and trust in agencies to manage grizzlies. Results from thematic analysis reveal: (1) distrust of management agencies and conservation organizations that stems from general perceptions of untrustworthiness and the wolf reintroduction that occurred in central Idaho in the mid-1990s, (2) trust-building preferences, including accessible staff and participatory opportunities, and ways for agencies and organizations to increase perceptions of trustworthiness, (3) intolerance towards management that stems from perceptions of an inequitable constitutive process that excludes BE residents from decision-making, potential threats from Endangered Species Act regulations, and a lack of clarity about current and future management plans, (4) preferred actions to increase tolerance towards management, including a decentralized decision-making process, educational outreach about grizzlies, and a hunting season, (5) intolerance towards grizzlies that stems from safety, economic, and cultural concerns, and (6) tolerance towards grizzlies that stems from appreciation and the belief in their right to exist. Findings suggest improved communication efforts about management intentions and a more equitable constitutive process can address issues of tolerance, trust, social injustice, and the material and non-material costs of grizzly presence in the BE region.",

          "abstract": "Informal urban areas house an increasing share of urban growth on the African continent, with corresponding challenges in sustaining urban household food security and preventing childhood malnutrition. In a landscape of shrinking public safety nets, an unfavorable employment landscape, and the rising cost of natural disasters, kin support networks may offer resilience against the vulnerability of households with young children impacted by structural failures in urban food systems. We evaluate the role of kinship support in strengthening household food security and young children’s dietary diversity – and the influence of relative socioeconomic status (SES) on these relationships - in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Using four waves of longitudinal data on 1,194 mothers collected between March 2022 and October 2023, some captured during periods of food inflation, we find that 1) larger kin support networks offer protection against severe food insecurity for some households, but heighten food insecurity risk for others 2) household SES and network SES feature in reciprocal kin support dynamics that affect the direction of food insecurity outcomes, however 3) larger kin support networks improve children’s dietary diversity, regardless of household and network SES. In contexts of resource-interdependence, researchers should scrutinize the impact of current and proposed policies and programs on stratified food access, particularly on low-income extended family networks that are sensitive to changes in food prices and structural economic changes.",

          "authors": "Nicolai T. Borgen; Are Skeie Hermansen; Astrid Marie Jorde Sandsør",
          "abstract": "While there is extensive literature on intergenerational mobility in education, including the transition to PhD, much less is known about the transition to academic faculty. In this paper, we use unique register data following entire birth cohorts born from 1955 to 1985 in Norway, an egalitarian welfare state, to investigate the social origins of academic faculty. Despite free public higher education and PhD positions with competitive wages, potentially removing many barriers to entry, we find large and stable differences in the likelihood of becoming faculty members by parental education, earnings, and whether parents are faculty members. However, while the likelihood of becoming a faculty member varies widely depending on social origins, sorting into faculty positions seems to be explained mainly by differences in obtaining a PhD. Once we compare individuals with PhD educations, social origins do not seem to constitute an additional barrier to becoming a faculty member. Nevertheless, social origins influence the likelihood of obtaining a position at more prestigious institutions, and faculty members from more advantageous backgrounds have higher earnings. Thus, social origins shape academic careers beyond their effects on entering academia.",

          "authors": "Samantha G. Winder; Spencer A Wood; Matthew T.J. Brownlee; Emilia H. Lia",
          "abstract": "The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) manages over 560 National Wildlife Refuges and dozens of National Fish Hatcheries across the United States. Accurately estimating visitor numbers to these areas is essential for understanding current recreation demand, planning for future use, and ensuring the ongoing protection of the habitats, fish, and wildlife that refuges safeguard. However, accurately estimating visitation across the entire refuge system presents significant challenges. Building on previous research conducted on other federal lands, this study evaluates methods to overcome constraints in estimating visitation levels using statistical models and digital mobility data. We develop and test a visitation modeling approach using multiple linear regression, incorporating predictors from eight mobility data sources, including four social media platforms, one community science platform, and three mobile phone location datasets from two commercial vendors. We find that the number of observed visitors to refuges correlates with the volume of data from each mobility source. However, neither social media nor commercial mobile phone location data alone provide reliable proxies for visitation due to inconsistent relationships with observed visitation; these relationships vary by data source, refuge, and time. Our results demonstrate that a visitation model integrating multiple mobility datasets accounts for this variability and outperforms models based on individual mobility datasets. We find that a refuge-level effect is the single most important predictor, suggesting that including site characteristics in future models will make them more generalizable. We conclude that statistical models which incorporate digital mobility data have the potential to improve the accuracy of visitor estimates, standardize data collection methods, and simplify the estimation process for agency staff.",

          "abstract": "Employee turnover is a challenge for public sector employers. In this study, we used machine learning to develop and validate models to predict actualized turnover of Finnish public sector workers. The development cohort data (N=52 291) included 158 variables from 2018. We defined overall turnover (regardless of reason) and net turnover (excluding workers in retirement age) through eligibility to a follow-up survey in 2020. The validation cohort included 9030 hospital workers who responded to survey in 2017, with turnover assessed in 2019. Area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74-0.76) for overall turnover and 0.75 (95% CI 0.73-0.76) for net turnover. The validation yielded similar AUC values. Key predictors of turnover were younger age, shorter job tenure, and turnover intentions totaling over 70% of the net gain. Work-related exposures, of which low threat of lay-off and satisfaction with challenges at work were most important, had considerably lower predictive power (about 1% each). These results may offer insights for public sector employers in their efforts to reduce employee turnover.",
