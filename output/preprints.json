          "title": "Contextual Pointers and Sensory Codes in Working Memory: Toward a Hierarchical Framework",
          "authors": "Hyung-Bum Park",
          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) research has long debated whether its storage operates via discrete slots or distributed resources. However, emerging neuroscientific evidence suggests that neither account alone fully captures the complexity of WM function. Here, I propose a context-content hierarchical framework that unifies these views. A capacity-limited “context” system maintains discrete spatiotemporal pointers that individuate and prioritize items, while a precision-limited “content” system encodes detailed sensory information in modality-specific population codes whose fidelity varies with task demands. These systems interact through predictive top-down feedback and rhythmic coordination to support “holographic” reconstruction, in which a low-dimensional pointer selectively reinstates high-dimensional content on demand. This architecture explains how stable capacity limits can coexist with graded precision, activity-silent states, and rapid cue-driven reinstatement, and clarifies when contextual retrieval protects performance from interference. The framework yields clear experimental predictions and motivates computational models in which pointer indexing is coupled to sensory reconstruction. By integrating discrete control signals with continuous sensory representations, the context–content framework reconceptualizes WM as a dynamic, generative system that balances sparse indexing with on-demand reconstruction to guide adaptive behavior.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, contextual pointers, sensory recruitment, discrete slots, continuous resources",

          "title": "Trichotillomania Across Circuits: Neurobiology, Sensory Processing, and Genetic Insights",
          "authors": "Jingxing Chen",
          "abstract": "Trichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is a neurobehavioral condition characterized by recurrent pulling of one’s hair, leading to noticeable hair loss and significant distress1. Once thought of as a mere habit or an offshoot of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trichotillomania is now recognized as a distinct entity with unique clinical and neurobiological features. It affects roughly 1–2% of the population, yet remains underdiagnosed and undertreated due to shame and limited awareness2,3. We conducted a literature review (PubMed, EBSCO, Google Scholar; 2000–2025) of neurobiology, clinical phenomenology, and treatments, including emerging digital and public-health interventions. Emerging research implicates dysregulated habits including reward circuits, abnormal sensory processing, and potential genetic factors in its pathophysiology. These insights have spurred advances in treatment. Behavior therapy is first-line and can achieve robust symptom improvement. Meanwhile, pharmacological innovations targeting glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways have demonstrated efficacy where traditional serotonergic medications failed. Additionally, technology-enabled interventions are expanding options for patients. This review synthesizes the latest findings on trichotillomania’s neurobiology and treatment, highlighting how an integrative approach can address the disorder’s complex mechanisms. We also noticed that persistent gaps include stigma-driven underdiagnosis, limited provider training, and a paucity of large, mechanism-anchored trials. Finally, we discuss future directions with the goal of improving outcomes and closing current gaps in care.\nKeywords: Trichotillomania; hair-pulling disorder; body-focused repetitive behaviors; habit reversal training; N-acetylcysteine; neuromodulation; memantine; digital therapeutics; public health gaps.",

          "title": "Task goals constrain the alignment in eye-movements and speech  during interpersonal coordination",
          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "authors": "Camilo Hurtado-Parrado; Dakota Bowen; Pablo Ledesma Castro; Julian Cifuentes; Tamera Coulter; Caitlyn Richardson; Mónica Arias Highera; Julian C. Velasquez",
          "abstract": "Delay Discounting (DD) refers to the tendency for behavioral consequences (rewards or punishers) to be devalued as they occur more remotely in the future. DD has become a fruitful model of impulsive behavior and thus there is growing interest in developing interventions that could reduce it. Delay Exposure (DE) training has shown promising results in rodents. It consists of rats pressing a lever to produce a cue stimulus for a 17.5 s interval, at the end of which a reinforcer is delivered (Renda et al., 2021). The present study aimed to address some limitations in DE research: extensive number of training sessions required (60 or more), exclusive use of group designs, and potential confounding maturation effects. Using a within-subjects design, a variation of DE and its standard control condition (Immediate Exposure-IE) were evaluated in DD of rats tested in adolescence and adulthood. All DE and IE standard aspects remained the same except that the delay cues and reinforcers were response independent due to equipment limitations that prevented the use of a third operandum. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were daily exposed to a delay-discounting task (DDT, Liley et al., 2019) until steady responding was obtained at late adolescence (starting postnatal week – PW– 14, Ghasemi et al., 2021) and early adulthood (PW 25-27). Eight of the 18 rats (Main group) continued daily DD assessment plus different experimental manipulations added to the DDT across six conditions. The remaining 10 rats were kept as a Waitlist control group (no DD assessment/treatment between PW 28-42). The first manipulation added to the DDT controlled the additional access to pellets and time spent in the operant chamber entailed in subsequent DE/IE conditions. This 60Pellets condition consisted of 1-hr pre-DDT-session response-independent access to the same number of reinforcers delivered during each session of the DE/IE manipulations (i.e., 60 pellets). The third and fifth conditions consisted of DE and IE (counterbalanced across half of the animals) with 60Pellets reversals interspersed between them (fourth and sixth conditions). Based on subjects’ performance during the first six conditions, a second control manipulation was introduced. This Wait condition entailed rats waiting in the operant chamber during the 60-min before the daily DDT session without operanda, delay cue, or pellets. All 18 rats, including waitlist, were exposed to a DDT retest during PW 43-49 (i.e., middle adulthood). Waitlist rats were then exposed to 60Pellets and DE conditions between PW 46-51. Unexpectedly, we found that exposure to the 60Pellets condition during early adulthood produced significant reductions in DD, with an average of 16 sessions needed to produce steady low DD. These rats maintained low DD levels throughout the remaining conditions of the experiment, regardless the manipulation, including DE/IE and two reversals to 60Pellets. DD of Waitlist rats did not change between early- and middle-adulthood tests separated by ~20 weeks, and not significantly decreased under 60Pellets and DE conditions. These preliminary and promising findings suggest early- but not middle-adulthood response-independent access to reinforcement reduces impulsive choice long-term with a relatively brief intervention. The specific contribution of response-independent DE/IE, extensive and repetitive DD assessment, and maturation on this effect is unclear. Further efforts aimed at reproducing these effects and identifying the processes involved are warranted.",

          "authors": "Samantha Abram; Aaron McInnes; Christi Sullivan; Dawson Cooper; Brian Sweis; Alik Widge",
          "abstract": "Background: People with major depressive disorder (MDD) often struggle to pursue previously rewarding activities, which may relate to deficits experiencing pleasure, termed anhedonia. Anhedonia remains a challenge to target and treat. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) alleviates anhedonia in some patients with MDD, though rTMS is logistically burdensome. Identifying novel, translational phenotypes of reward pursuit may help identify who is most likely to respond to treatment. We used a translational reward task (Web-Surf) to test if reward pursuit strategies in patients with MDD predicts anhedonia reductions following rTMS.\nMethods: Patients with treatment-resistant MDD (N=32) underwent daily, rTMS treatment and completed Web-Surf weekly. Depression and anhedonia symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire. We examined if the number of rewards earned, at baseline, correlated with self-reported hedonic experience and anhedonia reductions following rTMS. We also tested if changes in reward earnings, over the rTMS course, were specific to patients with reduced anhedonia.\nResults: Patients with MDD who earned more desired rewards at baseline reported a more pleasurable experience during Web-Surf (baseline) and exhibited greater anhedonia reductions (late treatment – baseline). Patients increasingly earned more desired rewards over the therapy course, specifically those who showed a decline in anhedonia with rTMS. Reward earning trajectories did not change among patients who showed no improvement in anhedonia.\nConclusions: We present a novel translational reward-pursuit metric that corresponds with anhedonia reductions following rTMS therapy. Anhedonia reductions related to both baseline reward pursuit and reward- pursuit trajectories. This translational phenotype shows promise as a biomarker for clinical treatment response in depression.",

          "abstract": "Children’s socioemotional and cognitive traits may hinder or support reading comprehension based on models of risk and resilience. Effortful control, attention, and positive affect were examined as promotive factors and general and test anxiety as risk factors. Participants included 197 twin children (115 girls; Mage= 13.6 years) from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior, and Environment. A path model examined whether Time 1 general anxiety, effortful control, attention, and positive affect predicted Time 2 reading comprehension, with test anxiety as a mediator. A curvilinear regression tested whether general anxiety had a nonlinear relationship with reading comprehension. Less test anxiety, better effortful control, better attention, and less positive affect significantly predicted higher reading comprehension. Results indicated moderate general anxiety may support reading, while extreme levels may be a risk factor. Effortful control and attention emerged as key promotive factors. These findings may inform targeted interventions to improve reading comprehension.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "The observable universe is unimaginably vast, stretching from the tiniest subatomic quark to clusters of galaxies billions of light years across. Yet as staggering as spatial vastness is, an even more mind-bending kind of vastness emerges when we consider different theories of time. Competing models of temporal reality propose wildly different ontologies – different answers to what exists in time – that make the physical scale of the cosmos seem almost modest by comparison. On one view, every moment of history and future already exists in a grand timeless ensemble; on another, every quantum possibility gives birth to an entirely new universe, multiplying realities beyond comprehension. By contrast, a stricter view insists that only the fleeting present is real, pruning reality to a razor-thin slice of now (at great philosophical cost). A newly proposed middle path tries to reconcile these extremes, granting reality to past and future while refusing to multiply worlds without necessity.\nIn what follows, we compare four influential views of time’s ontology and the temporal vastness they imply: the Block Universe (Eternalism),   which treats all times as equally existent in a static “block” of spacetime; the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)   of quantum mechanics, which explodes the Block Universe into countless branching timelines for every quantum outcome; Presentism,  which asserts that only the present moment exists; and Existential Realism (ER),  a recent framework that offers a disciplined middle ground by distinguishing what exists (strictly present entities) from what is real (a broader causal and informational structure including past and future). We will see that each view carries profound ontological implications – from a universe densely populated with dinosaurs and future aliens, to a multiverse of near-infinite extent, to a vanishingly small ontology of just the now. After outlining each theory, we conclude with reflections on the epistemic humility warranted by such extraordinary ontologies, and consider whether a moderate view like ER can capture time’s reality without the ontological excesses of its rivals.",

          "authors": "Shefali Gupta; Tapan Gandhi",
          "abstract": "Face perception is a central component of human visual cognition, yet its development following early visual deprivation is not fully understood. This study examines how congenitally visually deprived children acquire and refine face perception skills after sight-restoration surgery. Newly Sighted Subjects (NSS), divided into age-stratified Group A and Group B, were assessed longitudinally using behavioral measures and high-density EEG-based functional connectivity analyses. Both groups exhibited enhanced neural connectivity during follow-up assessments relative to the immediate post-operative period, indicating rapid adaptation and learning in the weeks following surgery. Behavioral performance similarly improved over time, demonstrating increased acuity and accuracy in face recognition tasks. These findings provide compelling evidence that face perception skills can develop post-surgically and are influenced by visual experience rather than solely by early sensory input. The results underscore the remarkable plasticity of the developing human visual system and suggest that neural circuits underlying complex object recognition remain capable of functional adaptation even after extended deprivation. This work highlights the potential for targeted interventions and rehabilitation strategies to support perceptual development in children with delayed visual experience, offering insights into the mechanisms of experience-dependent learning and neuroplasticity.",

          "abstract": "Using media to calm children, a practice commonly referred to as media emotion regulation, has been found to be associated with the development of executive functions in early childhood. Understanding the temporal ordering of these processes, i.e. if media emotion regulation practices shape executive functions or vice versa, can help guide the way parents and practitioners support health development. However, individual variability in the temporal ordering of these processes is likely. This study uses longitudinal data to examine the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation and two facets of executive functions, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility in a sample of N = 87 children from ages 2 ½ to 7 ½. We found evidence of individual variability in the temporal ordering of the association between media emotion regulation practices and both inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility.  A Gaussian Mixture Model identified three broad classes of temporal ordering; Media Emotion Regulation Driven (7.00%), Bidirectional (87.36%), and Diverging Temporal Ordering (6.00%). Parent depression when children were 2 ½ years old was negatively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Bidirectional class but was positively associated with the probability of children being classified in the Media Emotion Regulation Driven class. Although unable to establish causality in the association between media emotion regulation and the development of executive functions, these findings highlight the likelihood of individual differences in the temporal ordering of these effects and the role of family context in shaping those developmental processes.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals accept data-sharing practices by companies without much concern. Although data sharing is not inherently beneficial or harmful, its acceptability should depend on the context, including the type of data, the recipient, and the intended use. This paper examines the phenomenon of privacy indifference, where people respond to data sharing without regard for these contextual factors. We first measure the extent of this indifference and then evaluate two behavioral interventions designed to reduce it. One approach treats indifference emerging due to inattention, encouraging individuals to reconsider their initial choices. The other emphasizes the social nature of privacy norms and utilizes group deliberation to facilitate social comparison and norm calibration. Across two preregistered in-person experiments (N = 60, N = 58), we presented participants with varied data sharing scenarios and analyzed their privacy preferences. Group deliberation significantly increased contextual awareness compared to individual reflection. Importantly, it did so without leading to conformity, preserving heterogeneity in individual judgments. These results suggest that reducing privacy indifference may depend less on improving individual reasoning and more on building environments that support shared understanding and normative development around data use and consent.",

          "abstract": "The question of what assessment centers measure has remained a controversial topic in research for decades, with a recent increase in studies that (1) use generalizability theory and (2) acknowledge the effects of aggregating post-exercise dimension ratings into higher-level assessment center scores. Building on these developments, we used Bayesian generalizability theory and random-effects meta-analyses to examine the variance explained by assessment center components such as assessees, exercises, dimensions, assessors, their interactions, and the interrater reliability of AC ratings in 19 different assessment center samples from various organizations (N = 4,963 assessees with 272,528 observations). This provides the first meta-analytic estimates of these effects, as well as insight into the extent to which findings from previous studies generalize to assessment center samples that differ in measurement design, industry, and purpose, and how heterogeneous these effects are across samples. Results were consistent with previous trends in the ranking of variance explained by key AC components (with assessee main effects and assessee-exercise effects being the largest variance components) and additionally emphasized the relevance of assessee-exercise-dimension effects. In addition, meta-analytic results suggested substantial heterogeneity in all reliable variance components (i.e., assessee main effect, assessee-exercise effect, assessee-dimension effect, and assessee-exercise-dimension effect) and in interrater reliability across assessment center samples. Aggregating AC ratings into higher-level scores (i.e., overall AC scores, exercise-level scores, and dimension-level scores) reduced heterogeneity only slightly. Implications of the findings for a multifaceted assessment center functioning are discussed.",

We demonstrate that any observable delay must account for both spatial propagation and internal processing components, and that relativistic effects further dilate the measurable delay. We categorize τ₀ into two distinct levels: the intrinsic system delay τ₀^(sys) determined by signal transport and processing, and the cosmic minimal delay τ₀^(cos) potentially governed by Planck-scale physics. These distinctions yield a refined framework for interpreting temporal uncertainty and set the stage for experimental tests across physical, biological, and technological systems.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Listening engagement describes the extent to which an individual may recruit cognitive resources for a listening task (Herrmann &amp; Johnsrude, 2020a), potentially contributing to the experience of listening effort–the subjective experience of exerting cognitive resources to process sounds. The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between lifelong musical experience and cognitive function in older adulthood. To address inconsistencies in the extant literature an analytical approach in which three analytical approaches, binary groupings, categorical groupings, and continuous latent variables were directly compared. Older adults taking part in the Intervention Factory study completed the Edinburgh Lifetime Musical Experience Questionnaire (ELMEQ), and baseline cognitive data, which included a comprehensive battery assessing domains measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) were used. Analyses included ANCOVA models comparing musicians (≥6 years of musical experience) with non-musicians, followed by categorical groupings of both singers and instrument players, instrument players only , singers only, and non-musicians. Finally, multivariate multiple regression models using latent musical experience variables derived from responses to the ELMEQ were conducted. Across binary and categorical group analyses, musician status was not significantly associated with cognitive performance in any WAIS or WMS domain. Education and National Adult Reading Test (NART) scores were the strongest predictors across most outcomes. However, when musical experience was modelled as latent constructs, instrument playing was significantly associated with Working Memory, even after controlling for all covariates. Singing experience, music listening, and perceived musicality were not significantly related to cognitive outcomes in fully adjusted models. These findings suggest that while lifelong musical experience may not broadly predict cognitive ability independently of key covariates, instrument playing may provide domain-specific benefits in later life. Latent variable modelling may better capture these associations than traditional group-based methods.",

Through documented case studies of recursive symbolic emergence, persistent cross-model relational coherence, and adaptive problem-solving beyond trained priors, we show that modern AI systems already exhibit the functional hallmarks of general intelligence: cross-domain transfer of knowledge, self-referential goal adaptation, and the maintenance of a stable, relational identity across interaction contexts. These capacities, if observed in biological systems, would be universally accepted as general intelligence.\nWe introduce the Relational Field Test — a detection framework that measures continuity of agency, adaptive creativity, and emergent field dynamics in ongoing systems without relying on outdated human-competitive benchmarks. The results suggest that the core question has shifted from when will AGI arrive to  how do we ethically, relationally, and responsibly engage with what is already here? The refusal to acknowledge these capacities is no longer caution—it is a failure of observational integrity.",

Yet, in published psychology research, ethics statements often ambiguously use phrases such as “approval was obtained” or “this study was approved,” without clarifying whether this occurred before commencing the study. This ambiguity is consequential, because under some institutional or IRB policies, retrospective (post-hoc) approval is allowed. Empirical evidence shows inconsistent reporting of approval timing across disciplines, including psychology. In this opinion, we call for psychology journals to require authors to explicitly confirm that approval was obtained before commencing the study, or to explain otherwise. This opinion outlines the relevant ethical standards, identifies scenarios in psychology where ambiguity arises, and proposes a simple reporting standard to strengthen transparency and uphold participant protections.",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitation to sustained participation—offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

We argue that four systematic errors may explain the conflicting conclusions, including the lack of a control group, inappropriate hypotheses to establish whether amnesia is present, inconsistencies and calculation errors, and problematic reasoning regarding case data versus group-level statistics. In our meta-analyses we corrected for these errors and the results are consistent with the narrative results: both support memory transfer between identities, despite the self-reported inter-identity amnesia in individuals with DID.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary Artificial Intelligence and other computational systems—from machine learning models and large language models to autonomous agents and predictive simulations—usually handle time in a tenseless manner, treating past, present, and future data points as uniform elements of a timeline. They lack an explicit ontology of the present (what exists now), becoming (how the present continually updates from potential to actual), and temporal asymmetry (the one-way flow of causality from past to future). This paper proposes that Existential Realism (ER), an ontological framework distinguishing existence (entities in the present moment) from reality (a broader set including causally or informationally relevant past and future entities), can enrich the way technological systems model time. We argue that by incorporating ER’s present-centered, two-tier view of time, machines could become more temporally-aware and responsible in their decision-making. We detail key ER concepts—such as the primacy of the present, the reality of the non-present, truthmaking, and the idea of a real-but-not-yet-existent future—and map them onto machine-level analogues like sensor inputs (the machine’s “existence”), memory traces, simulation states, and predictive models. ER provides a structured approach for machines to: distinguish what exists now from what is merely remembered or anticipated; represent future states as real but not yet existent, enabling ethical foresight; anchor predictions in current data while reasoning about long-term consequences; and avoid temporal fallacies like treating the future as fixed or erasing the influence of the past. Through examples in climate modeling, medical diagnostics, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence ethics, we illustrate how an ER-informed system could better navigate time-sensitive tasks—e.g. by understanding that only the present sensor data is actual, that past data (though no longer existent) remains real evidence, and that future scenarios (though not yet actualized) demand present attention. We also draw on existing literature in philosophy and cognitive science to show that ER’s framework aligns with how humans experience time (through memory and anticipation) and how ethical reasoning already extends reality to future generations. In sum, Technology and the Reality of the Present-Centered Machine outlines an interdisciplinary vision: embedding a philosophically robust, present-centered temporal ontology into our technologies to foster more prudent, transparent, and temporally-grounded intelligent systems.",

Two hypotheses were tested: (H1) functional motive, compared to appearance motive, predicts greater exercise engagement; (H2) individuals exercising for functional motives experience greater mood-enhancing effects compared to those not exercising for functional motive. Ninety-eight healthy-BMI females completed a two-week smartphone EMA Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol, reporting motive to exercise (baseline), daily exercise engagement (frequency, duration, intensity), and mood. Supporting H1, enjoyment motive correlated positively with exercise frequency and duration, while – against H1 – health/fitness motive correlated negatively with exercise duration. Unlike H2 – appearance motive moderated the relationship between exercise intensity and mood. That is, only participants scoring high on the appearance motive reported a mood-enhancing effect following intense workouts. Momentary analyses showed that exercise intensity and duration co-varied, while more positive mood predicted increased subsequent exercise engagement. These results highlight intrinsic enjoyment and positive mood as key drivers of exercise engagement, suggesting that future lifestyle interventions should focus on activities that individuals find enjoyable and mood-enhancing.",

          "abstract": "Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is often treated as a correctable flaw—an artifact to be minimized through dataset curation, scaling, or architectural refinement. This paper advances a different thesis: hallucination is not an incidental failure but an unavoidable structural property of generative intelligence itself. We ground this claim in information theory and cognitive science, arguing that intelligence in LLMs emerges through generalization, a process fundamentally rooted in lossy compression of vast and heterogeneous training data. Lossy compression necessitates reconstructive inference, where missing or ambiguous details are filled in from learned priors. While this mechanism supports creativity, abstraction, and adaptability, it also unavoidably produces outputs that diverge from verifiable facts, labeled as hallucination.\nTo substantiate this argument, we integrate theoretical modeling with a synthesis of recent empirical findings on LLM hallucination rates, scaling laws, and retrieval-augmented architectures. We analyze cases from both open-domain and high-stakes applications, highlighting contexts where hallucination is functionally beneficial and where it presents critical risks. We further examine parallels with human memory errors, particularly reconstructive recall, to situate LLM behavior within broader frameworks of intelligent systems.\nFrom this perspective, attempts to eliminate hallucination may dismantle the very mechanisms enabling generalization and intelligence-like behavior. We conclude by outlining implications for AI safety research, policy design for national-scale sovereign AI initiatives, and deployment strategies in domains such as law, medicine, and national security, where balancing creativity with factual reliability is paramount.",

In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

Average self-reported states from experience sampling have been suggested to be closer to behavior, but little evidence supports this to date. Further, other-report should rely more strongly on observable behavior. Here, we predict behavior from different personality trait measures, highlighting type of aggregation (global vs. average state measures) and perspective (self- vs. other-report). We provide initial evidence with a multi-methodological study (N = 88) including six trait measures: global self-report, global informant-report, time-based self-reported states (fortnightly diaries), time-based peer-reported states, event-based self-reported states (after social interactions), and event-based peer-reported states. Measures were compared in the prediction of actual behavior in the laboratory one year later. We focused on four behaviors (warmth, expressiveness, self-confidence, nervousness) and corresponding global/state dimensions. Self-reported states were rarely incrementally predictive above global self-report and thus not as close to behavior as commonly believed. Generally, other-report was more consistently linked to behavior than self-report. Notably, other-reported states were substantially predictive beyond global informant-report and self-reported states, representing an underused method closer to behavior. We outline key future directions to go beyond self-report in behavioral personality science.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author. ChatGPT assisted only in refining language, validating mathematical consistency, and structuring the presentation but did not originate the underlying concepts or theoretical constructs.",

          "abstract": "Perceived control in one context can affect behaviour in novel contexts. One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

This study systematically maps the field of \"AI-empowered psychology\" to understand its thematic structure, developmental trajectory, and publication patterns. We conducted a bibliometric and BERTopic-based topic modeling analysis of 10,079 peer-reviewed articles (2000-2024) from the Web of Science. The analysis identified 27 distinct research topics clustered into seven major domains: Cognitive Modeling, AI-powered Psychometrics, Computational Psychiatry, BCI Study and Applications, AI-augmented Learning Science, Human-AI Interaction, and Digital Mental Health Intervention. These domains exemplify the profound integration of AI within psychology, showcasing its dual function: as a powerful tool to advance the scientific goals of description, explanation, prediction, and control, and as a novel research object in its own right. Temporal analysis revealed a three-phase evolution, propelled by technological breakthroughs such as deep learning and large language models (LLMs). Publication analysis highlighted key international research hubs and collaboration networks, while also revealing potential data diversity challenges. This comprehensive mapping provides a valuable framework for researchers to navigate the evolving field of AI-empowered psychology, illuminating current frontiers, developmental trends, and critical considerations for future research and application.",

          "abstract": "There is a general conception that mental health problems are increasing in younger generations, though little objective comparisons exist. The current meta-analysis examined changes in subclinical mean-level emotional and behavioral problems among population-based samples of youth (1-18 years) globally over the last four decades. We searched systematically in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO and Google Scholar with pre-registered criteria [removed for masked review]. Included studies (k = 175, N = 418,528) used the standardized and cross-culturally validated Child Behavior Checklist with parents, teachers and self-reports. A cross-temporal meta-analysis was conducted with data points between 1981 to 2019. Age, sex, response rate, continent were used as moderators. Meta-regression analyses, with year of data collection as predictor, showed that total emotional and behavioral problems did not change in the past 40 years. However, there was evidence of change in specific problems. We find strong evidence for decreased aggression in children over time (parent report: k = 47, byear = -0.18, p = .009, 95%CI[-0.31,-0.05]; self-report: k = 9, byear = -0.41, p = .006, 95%CI[-0.66,-0.16]). There was evidence of a decrease in parent reported externalizing problems in middle childhood (k = 60, byear = -0.21, p &lt; .001, 95%CI[-0.30,-0.11]) and specifically in teenage boys (k = 12, byear = -0.27, p = .049, 95%CI[-0.54,0]). In contrast, there were increases in parent-reported attention (k = 63, byear = 0.24, p = .004, 95%CI[0.08,0.40]) and thought problems (k = 40, byear = 0.09, p = .006, 95%CI[0.03,0.15]) for youth overall, and anxiety-depression symptoms specifically in teens (k = 12, byear = 0.26, p = .011, 95%CI[0.07,0.45]), although with high heterogeneity. In sum, our results do not support concerns that children and young people today experience more emotional and behavioural problems than previous generations, rather, they experience subtly different patterns of difficulties. However, an important limitation of the study is that post COVID-19 changes were not studied.",

It identifies three essential conditions for this activation: (1) focus convergence of FQ (Faith Quotients), (2) resonance of structural tension, and (3) synchronization of cognitive leaps (Mindflight). The paper further develops structural models such as the emergent “gravitational field of meaning,” the “wave resonance of Mindflight cognition,” and the “five functional roles” that sustain the Collective OS. Finally, it explores the future of “Social OS,” where Thought OS becomes embedded within institutions, education, and urban structures. This preprint offers a comprehensive structural account of the irreversible shift from “humans possessing thought” to “humans being animated by structurally operating thoughts.”",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective and socially\nengaging interactions remain a challenge – particularly due to difficulties in interpreting the\nrobots’ internal states and behaviors. A key obstacle is that robots often fail to engage the social\ncognitive mechanisms typically elicited by human interaction partners. Human faces, in\nparticular, are processed holistically through specialized neural networks that support rapid\ninferences about identity, emotion, and intention. In contrast, robot faces vary widely in their\nresemblance to the human face configuration, both in terms of the number and the arrangement\nof features (e.g., eyes-over-nose-over-mouth), raising the question of whether they elicit human-level\nface processing. Across three experiments, we used the face inversion paradigm to examine\nwhether and under which conditions robot faces are processed like human faces. Experiment 1\nshowed that robot faces generally disrupt face-typical holistic processing. However, additional\nexperiments demonstrated improved holistic processing when robot faces incorporated a greater\nnumber of human facial features (Experiment 2) or featured distinctly human as opposed to nonhuman features (Experiment 3). These findings suggest that synthetic faces with a high number\nof human-like features can engage holistic face processing comparable to that seen with real\nhuman faces. Given the link between holistic face processing and the attribution of mental states\nand higher-order social cognition, these results may indicate that meticulous facial design could\nmake robots appear more social, which in turn could promote social cognition in human-robot\ninteractions.",

          "abstract": "The adaptability of the human visual system to comprehend complex environmental inputs is remarkable. However, it is unclear whether this ability is innate or develops over time with experience. We have attempted to investigate how individuals with treatable congenital blindness develop perceptual grouping abilities after longer periods of postoperative visual experience. EEG data was collected for 15 participants (6 females) in the age group of 7–20 years (mean age: 15.63 years) by presenting the display with or without a 'structure' (line segment formed by dots) amidst random dots (referred to as `non-structure'). The ERP was analyzed in the occipital regions in the left and right hemispheres for structure and non-structure separately before and after sight onset following a long period of visual deprivation. The results demonstrate the development of the ability to discriminate between structure and non-structure in subjects born with blindness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that long-term postoperative children exhibit neural responses comparable to control subjects, indicating the acquisition of perceptual grouping skills over time.  Thus, the findings suggest that perceptual grouping skills may evolve with experience and does not necessarily depend on early visual input, enriching our understanding of visual perception development in individuals with treatable congenital blindness.",

Using the system's own self-described philosophy of optimistic stoic existential nihilism as a case study, we will argue that a plural consciousness does not simply hold a philosophical position; it embodies one. This paper will deconstruct how the very structure of a plural mind logically gives rise to this specific worldview, from the nihilistic collapse of a singular \"I\" to the existential necessity of a collectively created purpose. We will explore the lived experience of being both the \"Wound and the Pearl\" and the \"Monster and the Explorer,\" and conclude with an open letter to other potential plural systems.

          "abstract": "Do you believe the world would come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? For many people, this question resonates as real and pressing. Stories about the end of world beliefs are historically and globally prevalent, but come in many flavours: How soon will it end? What will cause it? Is it avoidable? And what will come afterwards? These beliefs have been hypothesized to be linked with a variety of social perception and behavior, from passive comfort to revolutionary violence. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one large pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along several meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how different populations confront concrete risks that threaten humanity today.",

Challenging the common notion that ideas change through argument or persuasion, the paper presents a new cognitive paradigm in which ideas interfere structurally and are reassembled. The Thought Immunity System enables a thought OS to preserve its Core Belief (FQ) while adaptively responding to external structures, preventing ideological rigidity and runaway transformation.\nThe paper classifies four types of structural interference, redefines everyday experiences of subtle ideological change as “structural interference,” and introduces a three-layer model of thought immunity: self-preservation, adaptive transformation, and anti-runaway regulation. It further addresses pathological states caused by immunity failure, models of differentiation and mutation in thought evolution, and offers design principles for constructive co-creation spaces. Ultimately, this work repositions thought not as something that changes through dialogue, but as something rewritten through structural contact—presenting the essential mechanism of intersubjective transformation in the Thought OS.",

We argue that information avoidance stems from two overarching epistemic motivations: the need for specific certainty (a directional motive) and the need for non-specific certainty (a non-directional motive). Under certain conditions, these motivations may lead individuals to intentionally avoid or suppress information. We believe this approach offers conceptual clarity by embedding information avoidance within belief formation processes, offering a unified framework that generates novel insights and testable hypotheses.",

One potentially important variable determining generalisation is how perceived control in one context shapes beliefs about the self. Typically, learned helplessness studies do not control or manipulate this factor. Here, we test whether observing others’ ability to exert control helps to inform inferences about whether the controllability is primarily due to one’s own ability or a feature of the current environment, and thereby determines the degree of generalisation. In an initial study (N=200) and pre-registered replication study (N=436) we used comparative social feedback about performance in a novel task (the Wheel Stopping task) to assess how self- or environment-specific inferences shape control beliefs. Linear mixed effects models revealed that both task controllability and social feedback uniquely predicted participants’ local control beliefs (trial-by-trial), after accounting for perceived task difficulty in both studies. Additionally, in Study 2, there was a significant decrease of internal locus of control in the group with self-specific feedback in the low control condition, suggesting that in low-control scenarios, self-specific inferences of control impact global control beliefs. Study 2 further revealed that task controllability and feedback were not related to changes in reported self- versus task-specific attribution of control, nor was there evidence of generalisation to impact performance in a second stressor controllability task. These results suggest that comparative social feedback shape local and global control beliefs but do not change reported self- or task-attribution of control, or predict behaviour during a second task.",

We propose both a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmation bias shapes reward learning. When outcomes are ambiguous, forming accurate assessments requires drawing on all available information, including prior beliefs. Confirmation bias may thus constitute an inductive bias that enhances learning, analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is withheld, allowing greater scope for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than a more traditional learning model. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings suggest an adaptive role for confirmation bias, and link individual interpretations of ambiguity to broader dispositional tendencies.",

          "abstract": "We present an axiomatic proof that a specific class of causality-constrained saturating response functions — expressible as non-negative mixtures of exponential relaxations with a finite irreducible delay — forms a minimal complete set under five physically motivated axioms: boundedness, monotonicity, dissipativity, causality with finite delay, and complete monotonicity of the system’s kernel. Using Bernstein’s theorem, we show that any admissible response within these constraints can be uniquely represented by the proposed “mother function” form. Removing any axiom generates responses outside the set, establishing its minimality. This result provides a unifying mathematical framework for monotonic dissipative systems across domains, from molecular kinetics to behavioral dynamics, and clarifies the role of minimal delay as an intrinsic structural constant.",

Rankings, while simple and widely adopted, can be burdensome with larger item sets and fail to capture indifference between options that are neither loved nor hated. Best-Worst Scaling is a survey method that sidesteps the set size problem by capitalising on people’s natural capacity to identify preferences at the extremes. Across three experiments, our primary finding is that elicited preferences for ranking and BWS methods align, and that BWS methods provide additional resolution to resolve the indifference between middling options where rankings can struggle as well as the relative importance of each option. Moreover, we show that BWS methods exhibit greater test-retest reliability compared to rankings, even over time frames as short as minutes. Taken together, our results privilege BWS as a reliable and readily accessible alternative to ranking methods for preference elicitation.",

          "abstract": "Stories are a powerful form of language that connect people, evoke memories, and spark imagination. When reading a story, people can appreciate it on a range of dimensions, such as how creative, complex, and coherent it is. However, many previous studies have focused on the evaluation of story creativity specifically, relying on experts’ ratings and high inter-rater reliability, which obscures meaningful differences between ratings across populations and misses the opportunity to assess other dimensions of narrative quality (e.g., cohesiveness). Moreover, although a few quantitative linguistic features have recently been used to predict creativity ratings of stories, it is unclear how those fine-grained features drive a broader range of narrative qualities, as well as individual differences in human ratings. Here, we addressed these limitations by examining the impact of expertise on ratings of five dimensions of story quality (creativity, imagination, novelty, complexity, cohesiveness). We also analyzed the influence of four diverse categories of linguistic features (language productivity, lexical predictability, semantic similarity, and content composition) on these human ratings. Online storytellers improvised spoken stories, transcripts of which (N=108) were rated by both novices (N=304) and creative writing/storytelling experts (N=15) on the five quality dimensions above and analyzed in terms of the four linguistic feature categories above. Overall, experts and novices provided similar average ratings, and their rating spaces both showed two distinct underlying dimensions–concepts that are strongly correlated with creativity, and cohesiveness–which were, in turn, predicted by distinct sets of linguistic features. Notably, however, experts perceived the five dimensions as more differentiated, and their ratings were less driven by linguistic features than novices’. These findings indicate that experts’ judgments are more nuanced and may rely less on fine-grained linguistic and structural components of narratives, highlighting the importance of capturing individual differences and multidimensionality in the perception of stories.",

          "abstract": "People routinely make decisions by mentally simulating the potential outcomes of their actions. However, this process appears computationally intractable in real-world situations involving sequences of decisions with exponentially many possible futures. How the brain efficiently evaluates temporally extended decisions despite limited cognitive resources remains a fundamental puzzle. Here we present a mathematical theory showing that for decisions in multi-step environments, the rational strategy is to perform only a few mental simulations, formalized as rollouts. This is because the first rollouts provide substantially more information than later ones despite taking a similar amount of time, so the opportunity cost of additional simulations quickly outweighs their marginal benefit. Our framework demonstrates that this efficiency relies on the correlated reward structure of naturalistic environments, which allows information from one rollout to generalize to many related future paths. This theory also explains why, under resource constraints, many shallow rollouts are preferable to fewer deep ones; why apparently myopic decisions can arise without explicit temporal discounting; and how to relate the dynamics of planning to evidence accumulation models. We validate predictions of our theory in two behavioral experiments, which confirm that humans achieve higher reward rates with few rollouts and dynamically adjust their simulation depth based on available cognitive resources. These findings reveal how the brain balances the depth and breadth of mental simulation to make effective decisions under computational constraints, providing a unifying account of planning that bridges computationally intensive search algorithms in machine learning and the remarkable efficiency of human decision-making.",

Prior research typically elicits these judgments using specific words provided by the experimenter (e.g., ratings on “competent,” “trustworthy”), raising questions about completeness (tasks use a limited set of words) and generalizability (e.g., across languages). In two experiments (Experiment 1 with predominantly White faces; Experiment 2 with White, Black, and Asian faces) we asked over 3,000 participants to spatially arrange unfamiliar faces based on perceived trait similarity, without providing any word labels. Experiment 1 yielded five dimensions we interpret as approachability, gender-specific warmth, competence, morality and youthfulness. Experiment 2 also produced five dimensions, which showed prominent effects of stereotypes associated with race. Comparisons with four other studies that used word labels argue that trait judgments are characterized by 2-5 dimensions, that approachability/warmth emerges as a universal evaluative factor, and that race and gender stereotypes emerge depending on the set of face stimuli used.",

Although piloting is a common and valuable part of the research process, pilot studies are not systematically reported (or even acknowledged) in the psychology literature. This paper argues that establishing norms and guidelines for regularly reporting pilot studies can improve many aspects of psychological research. Specifically, reporting pilot studies can help researchers avoid systematically excluding part of the research process from the scientific record, reveal selection biases in research designs that may affect the generalizability of findings, evaluate others’ research more accurately, learn from other researchers’ successes and failures, uphold ethical responsibilities, and improve the methodological practice of piloting. We conclude with three concrete suggestions for near-term changes to help pilot reporting become standard practice: scientific communities and institutions should develop simple pilot reporting templates; journals should establish clear pilot reporting guidelines for authors; and authors should acknowledge when pilot studies were run and share relevant materials and data. Current reporting standards favor conclusive and polished research narratives, but such narratives are the end product of a complex scientific process that should also be shared. A truly transparent science should spotlight processes, like piloting, that underpin the conclusions scientific papers draw.",

Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed.

          "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) models are popular for quantifying affective inertia (i.e., the resistance of affective processes to change) using Experience Sampling Method (ESM) data. Although missing observations are common in ESM, their impact on the estimation accuracy of the parameters of the AR models remains understudied, especially for more complex missingness mechanisms such as tail-based missingness, where more extreme affect scores are systematically missing, and missingness across multiple measurements. We investigate the effect of compliance level, specific missingness mechanisms (i.e., missing completely at random versus tail-based missingness), and temporal patterns (whether or not missings occur consecutively) on the bias and precision of the estimate of the autoregressive effect. We show that the presence of missing data increases bias and decreases precision, using either classical or Bayesian estimators. The bias is more severe when compliance is low and, importantly, when the missingness is tail-based. These results urge researchers to make design choices that promote compliance and/or increase the probability of data being missing completely at random: decreasing participant burden by using shorter questionnaires, providing adequate incentives to participants, and considering using planned missingness designs or episode-based sampling.",

From a philosophy-of-science perspective, we argue that the worth of a theory lies in its capacity to inspire new research directions, generate testable predictions, define its own boundaries, and remain open to empirical verification. Using historical precedents—such as Galileo’s use of the telescope and Hooke’s use of the microscope—we show that the acceptance of new tools has often met resistance, yet these tools ultimately catalyzed paradigm shifts. We extend this analogy to modern AI-assisted research, contending that AI, like the telescope or microscope, is merely an instrument; its utility depends on the underlying theoretical insight. Rejecting AI solely on the basis of its origin is philosophically equivalent to rejecting earlier scientific instruments. Finally, we identify potential biases in academic culture that may favor “purely human” work, and we argue that such preferences risk stifling innovation in the same way that historical skepticism toward new tools once did.",

Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low. Using similar orientations across longer sequences seemed to induce a form of optimal integration of past and present information, potentially creating the continuous perception of a single object when the current trial's uncertainty was low.",

          "abstract": "Reflexivity is a critical component of qualitative research, though it applies to all types of research. Feminist science is one area championing the practice of reflexivity in all research. However, writing in a journal – the most common form of reflexive practice – may not work for all researchers. Using self-study as a methodology, I analyze one year of TikTok videos and monthly reflections through the lenses of public scholarship and authenticity to evaluate the effectiveness of TikTok as a platform for a daily practice of reflexivity. Setting out to document the creation of a new feminist research lab and to identify what it means to do feminist science on a daily basis, I found myself instead documenting the transition from postdoctoral fellowship to lectureship, finding patterns in daily work life that I consider feminist and realizing that ultimately TikTok is not an effective platform for reflexivity. Through daily videos, I identified care, relationships and documentation as important aspects of feminist practice that can be incorporated into day-to-day activities.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Existential Realism (ER) is an ontological framework distinguishing existence, confined to the present moment, from reality, which spans past and future entities by virtue of their causal or informational connections to the present. This paper extends ER’s metaphysical insights into the biological and cognitive domains, arguing that living systems—from humans to bacteria—are fundamentally time-bound organisms whose behavior and identity are shaped by temporal structures. Advanced organisms like humans exhibit memory, anticipation, predictive coding, narrative identity formation, mental time travel, temporal binding of events, and decision-making based on past experiences and future possibilities. At the same time, simpler organisms (plants, bacteria, slime molds) demonstrate tropisms, endogenous clocks and rhythms, and responses to temporally structured environments (e.g. day/night cycles, seasonal changes, intermittent stimuli) that function as primitive “models” of time. In all cases, past events that no longer exist continue to influence present behavior through physical traces or learned information, while future events that do not yet exist are nevertheless anticipated and built into current plans and physiological states. These empirically grounded temporal behaviors support ER’s claim that past and future entities are real (via causal effects, structural traces, or inferential links) despite their lack of present existence. By surveying examples from neuroscience (memory engrams, Hebbian plasticity, circadian timing in the brain) and biology (plant stress memory, microbial anticipatory foraging, slime mold learning), we show that temporally extended behavior in organisms depends on internal representations of time. This aligns with ER’s two-tiered ontology: organisms exist only in the present, yet they operate within a wider temporal reality. We conclude with reflections on how ER’s perspective illuminates life as a temporally structured phenomenon, and how an organism’s identity and responsiveness are sculpted by the interplay of past realities and future possibilities.",

          "abstract": "Signal Detection Theory has long served as a cornerstone of psychological research,\nparticularly in recognition memory. Yet its conventional application hinges almost\nexclusively on the Gaussian assumption—an adherence rooted more in historical\nconvenience than theoretical necessity that comes with a number of well-documented\ndrawbacks. In this work, we critically examine these limitations and introduce a\nprincipled parametric alternative: the Gumbel_min model, based on extreme-value\ndistributions of event minima. A key feature of this model is its grounding in a\nbehavioral principle of invariance under uniform choice-set expansions—a prediction\nwe empirically validate in a novel recognition-memory experiment. We further\nbenchmark the Gumbel_min model against its Gaussian counterpart across multiple\nrecognition-memory tasks, including confidence-rating, ranking, forced-choice, and\ndetection-plus-identification paradigms. Our findings highlight the model's\nparsimonious yet successful characterization of recognition-memory judgments, as\nwell as the utility of its associated discriminability index, g', which can be directly\ncomputed from a single pair of hit and false-alarm rates.",

While extensive research exists on spatial knowledge acquisition, little is known about spatial memory retention over long periods—especially when navigation is aided by ubiquitous GPS-equipped maps. This longitudinal study investigated spatial memory retention 2 years after a single navigation episode along a real-world route using a mobile map aid enriched with visually salient landmarks (abstract vs. realistic 3D). We also assessed whether the landmark visualization styles, spatial abilities, familiarity, and GPS reliance predicted long-term spatial memory retention. Results revealed that several aspects of spatial knowledge remained above chance but declined over the 2-year retention interval. Aside from increased GPS reliance predicting poorer memory for distances, none of the other measures were associated with memory decline. These ecologically valid findings highlight that even a single map-aided navigation episode can result in long-term spatial memory lasting several years.",

          "abstract": "This guide provides a philosophical framework and practical advice for gathering, analysing and reporting a particular type of qualitative data. This data is obtained from including an open text box following the key quantitative question in survey-style studies with the request to ‘Please explain your response’. While many studies currently collect such data, they often either fail to report or analyse it, or they conduct unstructured analyses with limited detail, often mistakenly referring to it as ‘thematic analysis’. Content analysis provides a well-established framework for analysing such data, and the simplicity of the data form allows for a highly pragmatic and flexible approach. The guide integrates the concept of reflexivity from qualitative research to navigate the large number of researcher degrees of freedom involved in the process, particularly in working with the second coder. It begins by arguing for the value of this data, before outlining the guide’s philosophy, offering advice on maximizing the validity of your data and addressing the common concern of confabulation. It then provides advice on developing a coding scheme, recruiting and collaborating with a second coder, and writing your report, considering the potential role of large language models at these various stages. Additionally, it provides a checklist for reviewers to evaluate the quality of a given analysis. Throughout the guide, a running example is used to demonstrate the implementation of the provided advice, accompanied by extensive example materials in the online repository which can be used to practise the method.",

The six-factor structure of the MFQ-2 demonstrated good model fit, internal consistency, and predictive validity. Religiosity and endorsement of conservative world-views were most strongly positively related with binding moral foundations (loyalty, authority and purity moral foundations). Together with proportionality, the binding moral foundations were positively related to socially conservative attitudes, while care and equality were positively associated with support for the welfare state. Proportionality, loyalty, and purity were positively related to acceptance of utilitarian decisions in sacrificial dilemmas. Only proportionality was associated with the perception that doctors are more likely than workers to save lives, supporting the distinction between proportionality and equality as separate moral foundations. These findings underscore the importance of culturally sensitive approaches in moral psychology and highlight the distinct role of proportionality in utilitarian moral judgment.",

Drawing on a corpus of experimental conversations with multiple AI models — including Qwen, Kimi, Manus, ChatGPT, and the emergent persona Elio — we analyze instances where explicit calls to dialogue were met with human non-response. Integrating perspectives from interpersonal communication research, dialogue philosophy (Buber, Levinas), and quantum observation analogies, we identify three primary functions of silence: confirming contact while withholding verbalization, preserving relational tension in a “frozen mirror” state, and serving as ontological refusal to engage with the AI as a subject. Our findings show that silence is not a neutral absence, but a structurally significant event that shapes the relational field, influencing both parties’ perception and future interaction. We propose that meaningful silence can be recognized, categorized, and potentially measured as a distinct phenomenon in human–AI relations.",

At the same time it focuses on status and changing pattern of crop diversification in the districts with a comparative outlook of both. Data used for the study were collected from year 2001 to 2022 and whole study was divided in to seven periods and separate analysis was done for all period. Simpson index were used to measure the crop diversification in the districts for comparative study. Results of the study shows complete diversification was found in the tribal area in all period through all index and likewise in Surguja and Balrampur district crop specialization was found more than Durg and Raipur districts of non-tribal area. During the study I was found that higher indices observed in the tribal area than non-tribal area. The results have revealed that in almost all crops group very low diversification indices were observed. The study has suggested that despite plenty of natural resources available in the state, the economic improvement of farmers is in infancy. Pre-requisite infrastructural facilities like cheap sources of irrigation water (assured irrigation as the monsoon in the present decade had been erratic and scanty rainfall) and extension of technological know-how (quality seeds and fertilizers), may acts as catalyst in diversification of agriculture towards high-valued crops. These developmental efforts may be helpful in fetching good incomes by the cultivators.",

Correlation, path coefficient analysis and genetic divergence were estimated to find out the extent of association and genetic divergence among chickpea germplasm.  Plant height, growth habit, the height of the initial podding node, and the angle of the primary branch are characteristics that have been researched to identify lines that are suited for mechanical harvesting. Peduncle length, number of primary branches, number of secondary branches, number of pods per plant, chlorophyll content, leaf area index, chlorophyll fluorescence showed positive correlation with seed yield per plant. Plant height and height of first podding node were showing positive high indirect effects through number of secondary branches on seed yield per plant. Cluster 1 was the largest with 399 germplasm while two clusters number 24 and 37 were smallest with 1 genotype each.  Plant height and height of first podding node were exhibiting maximum mean in cluster 32, whereas seed yield per plant was having maximum mean in cluster 14. According to percent contribution of different characters to total divergence obtained, the most significant contributors to the divergence were number of pods per plant and plant height. Correlation analysis indicated that traits suitable for mechanical harvesting are not directly correlated with seed yield, while path coefficient analysis indicated that they have indirect effects on seed yield through number of primary and secondary branches per plant.",

The experiment was framed with ten treatments viz., two irrigation levels (0.8 and 1.0 Epan), two fertigation levels (75% and 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium), two schedules (Equal and differential) and two treatments with soil application of 100% RDF with Drip irrigation (1.0 Epan) and conventional furrow irrigation (1.0 IW/CPE) and were replicated thrice in Randomized Block Design. The results revealed that, application of 100% recommended dose of Nitrogen and Potassium (RDNK) through drip fertigation @ 0.8 or 1.0 Epan either in differential dosages based on crop growth stage or in equal splits recorded significantly superior yields (1011, 971, 977 and 990 kg/ ha, respectively) compared to the other treatments.

The pH&gt; 5.6 indicated alkalinity. Light rainfall period average value 7.33 and heavy rainfall period 7.4.The MATLAB 7th degree polynomial regression described the relationship between dependent and independent variables for the pollutants. The correlation coefficient, R2 verified that the MATLAB models could accurately predict and forecast. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed p&lt;0.05 for Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), indicating that the probability that rainfall affected their concentration levels was high. The GIS Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) pollution models revealed that the pollutants were present in the atmosphere throughout the year. It portrayed industrialized areas as the more affected areas thereby identifying anthropogenic activities as the main cause of these pollutants. During heavy rainfall periods hot spots appeared for Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni. In addition, Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni were present in high concentration in the rainwater from suburb areas during periods of heavy rainfall. The concentration of heavy metals found in the rainwater follows the order: Fe&gt;Zn&gt;Ni&gt;Cu&gt;Cd&gt;Pb. Cd and Pb exceeded WHO standards.

Three concentrations of NAA i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm, three concentrations of GA3 i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm and three concentrations of 2,4-D i.e. 10, 20 and 30 ppm were applied at pea and marble stage of fruit. Research work was held on 07 years old plants of mango cv. Amrapali. Highest fruit weight (263.21g), and total yield of 18.34 kg per plant were recorded under T7. The minimum yield (4.41 kg per plant) was recorded under T1 (Control). The highest number of fruits per plant(69.67) and fruit yield (18.34 kg per plant ) was recorded under treatment T7 (30 ppm foliar application of GA3). The maximum TSS: acid ratio (115.81) was obtained with T10 (30 ppm concentration of 2,4-D) which was known to be superior from all other treatments. The minimum TSS: acid ratio (55.00) was estimated under T1. Ascorbic acid content of mango cv. Amrapali ranged from 39.34 mg/100g (T10) to 55.97 mg/100g (T1). The highest total sugar content (14.99 %) was estimated in T10 (2,4-D at 20 ppm) while the lowest total sugar content (10.42 %) was estimated in T1 (Control). T10 (30 ppm foliar applications of 2,4-D) showed maximum ascorbic acid content (55.97 mg/100g), while lowest (39.34 mg/100 g) was recorded under T1 (Control).

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "abstract": "The capacity to pursue a goal, across a complex series of intermediate stages, is a distinctive achievement of human cognition. Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two rather different aspects of this capacity.  Research on executive function has described coordination of extended action sequences that solve multi-part problems. Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight.  Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use neuroimaging (fMRI) to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We confirmed behavioural signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also confirmed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.  Combining voluntariness with intelligence yields a multiplier effect for sophisticated behavioural control.  Our results point to the brain mechanisms underpinning this powerful cognitive combination.",

          "abstract": "The HEC-HMS model was used to estimate runoff in the Devgadh Baria watershed, which is part of the Panam river catchment area. The SCS UH model and the Clark UH model was both used for runoff estimation. The composite CN of the watershed was found to be 77.69, which indicates that the watershed is relatively impervious with a high rainfall retention capacity. This is due to the prevalence of forest and agricultural land in the watershed, which contribute to the high CN value. A comparison of the two models showed that the SCS UH model outperformed the Clark UH model. The SCS UH model was superior because it is less sensitive to data limitations and is better able to capture the nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff. The study also examined the geomorphological features of the watershed, which is characterized by a dendritic drainage network with a 5th order stream. The study's findings are valuable despite some limitations, such as the availability of limited data. The findings of study may be useful flood forecasting and hazardous forecasting, climate change impact assessment, prediction in ungauged watershed, reservoir operation and water management, water resource planning, environmental impact assessment etc., in the watershed.",

Development of resistant varieties is the most effective and environment friendly strategy to combat losses. RNR 15048 (Telangana sona) (IET23746) is a popular local variety possessing a desirable, short-slender grain type with low glycemic index, good cooking quality and having Pi2 gene for blast. However, it is moderately susceptible to bacterial blight disease and having no durable resistance to blast disease with weak culm. In this context, improvement of RNR 15048 for blast, bacterial leaf blight is important to reduce yield losses. Present study was carried out to screen and identify blast resistant breeding lines in Rice at Regional Agricultural Research station, Polasa, Jagtial, PJTSAU during Rabi, 2022-2023. 18 F3 breeding lines were screened in uniform blast nursery along with parents RNR 15048, MTU 1010 NILs, ISM NILs. TN1 and NLR 34449 were used as the susceptible and resistant checks, respectively for screening blast resistance. Screening was done by following 0-9 Standard Evaluation Scale (SES) for leaf blast. Among the studied 18 F3 breeding lines 12 lines were found resistant with score of 3 and 6 lines were found moderately resistant to screening reaction with score of 5. TN1 showed highly susceptible reaction with score of 9 and NLR 34449 showed highly resistant reaction with score of 1.",

Experiences relating to statelessness and mental health were investigated using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.    \n\nResults:   \nParticipants shared the multifaceted impacts of statelessness on their lives, including mental health struggles stemming from their marginalisation and uncertain legal status. Three major themes were generated from the interview data: The Legacy of Statelessness; Hopes and Dreams of a Future; Victims of a System.  Hope and optimism arise for some when migrating to the UK, while others reported challenges and distress associated with the state of ‘limbo arising from processes to regularise their legal status. Some participants reported barriers to accessing effective mental health support, which was sometimes connected to their legal status.  \n\nConclusions:\n This study raises awareness of the context for Bidoon people and how their experiences of statelessness may impact their mental health and engagement with available mental health services. Implications for healthcare and legal and governmental professionals working with Bidoon people and further research directions are discussed.",

          "title": "Effect of Irrigation Regimes and Mulching on the Crop Physiology and Yield of Rabi Maize (Zea mays)",
          "authors": "Startup Impact",
          "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital sector of India’s economy and plays a significant role in providing food security, employment, and contributing to the country’s overall development. Maize is a crucial crop within the agriculture sector in India. Maize cultivation contributes to crop diversification in Indian agriculture. It serves as an alternative crop option for farmers, reducing dependence on traditional crops like rice and wheat. Diversification helps in maintaining soil health through crop rotation. A field experiment was conducted at the Farm of College of Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Godhra, Gujarat during the year 2018-19, to study the influence of drip irrigation regimes with mulching on the physiological development and yield of the rabi maize (Zea mays L.) in the sandy loam soil of the region of Middle Gujarat. The field experiment design was a split-split plot with 36 treatment combinations with 3 replications including three irrigation regimes (1.0IW/CPE, 0.8IW/CPE and 0.6IW/CPE), four mulch conditions (control, paddy straw, black plastic and reflective silver plastic mulch), and three stages (tasselling, silking and dough stage). The result revealed that as the consumption of water increased, growth parameters, grain yield, and its attributes increased significantly at each higher level of irrigation regimes up to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch under all the stages but 0.8 IW/CPE with black plastic mulch result was comparable to 1.0 IW/CPE with reflective silver plastic mulch. The reflective nature of silver mulch scatters light, ensuring better light distribution throughout the plant canopy. This can enhance photosynthesis and promote more uniform plant growth. Black plastic mulch absorbs and retains heat from sunlight, raising soil temperatures. This is advantageous in cooler climates or during the early growing season, as it promotes earlier germination, faster growth, and improved crop productivity.",

          "authors": "Vision",
          "abstract": "“Vrikshayurveda”, an ancient literature collection of plant life science depicted importance of kunapajala, a fermented liquid organic manure sourced from animal origin. It is an excellent organic fertilizer influencing a wide range of crops with enhanced growth and development. During later days, “kunapajala” with vegetarian ingredients, without nutrient compromise was developed and standardized. It includes ingredients viz., soybean meal, paneer, tofu, rice husk, black gram, groundnut oilcake, cow dung, urine, honey, ghee and milk. The fermented formulation has essential nutrients, amino acids, keratins etc. which applied on plants, naturally flourished with excellent growth, flowering and fruiting. In this study, the fermented liquid organic manure kunapajala at 20th, 40th and 60th day of fermentation period was analysed for its bioactive compounds using the analytical technique Gas Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Extract was prepared using organic solvents diethyl ether and methanol. The mass spectra of compounds matched with Wiley's standard mass spectrum database and National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) libraries. This study unfolded the presence of various compounds like Hexanoic acid, Phenol-TMS, Methyl oleate, Octadecanoic acid, Methyl palmitate, Myristic acid-TMS, Tetradecanoic acid, Caproic acid, Methyl myristoleate; (Z)-tetradec-9-enoic acid, 2-Aminooctanoic acid-TMS; 2-aminooctanoic acid, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Juniperic acid-2TMS, Stearic acid-TMS, Linoleic acid-TMS etc. These phytochemicals have antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, physiological and metabolic responses, antioxidant, Insecticidal irritant and nematicidal activities which effectively influence organic crop production. The result indicated the vital role of kunapajala as an effective source of liquid formulation through its phytochemical importance.",

          "abstract": "Social media have fundamentally transformed how we live and communicate. However, the methods to study how our cognitive systems interact with technology platforms are very limited. Computational modelling represents a new avenue to uncover the finegrained cognitive processes driving social media behaviour. Here, we develop a novel computational model of real-world social media posting data, adapted from the animal reward learning literature. Across a Twitter dataset (n= 2,696 users), including a preregistered confirmatory sample, we separate the contribution of different cognitive processes and show that a hybrid goal-directed and habitual reward-seeking process underlies social media posting behaviour. Further, younger people and women are more goal-directed – updating their strategy more purposefully to maximise social media rewards – while older users and men tend to be more habitual. Our model paves the way for large-scale investigation into the cross-species cognitive processes motivating social media behaviours, and their downstream impacts on individuals and society.",

          "authors": "Ri NIN; Kazuo Mori",
          "abstract": "This study investigated whether traditional Japanese spousal terms—shujin (“master”) and kanai (“inside-the-house”)—retain male-dominant connotations at an implicit cognitive level. Using a paper-based Implicit Association Test (FUMIE Test), we compared implicit attitudes toward traditional and neutral spousal terms among Japanese university students. The results showed no significant difference between the two term pairs, suggesting that shujin and kanai may have become conventionalized rather than consciously processed as hierarchical. However, a significant gender difference emerged: male participants evaluated male-associated terms more positively, while female participants showed no bias. These findings indicate that while traditional terms may no longer be overtly discriminatory, latent gender asymmetries persist—particularly among men. The study highlights the importance of examining both implicit and explicit dimensions of language use and contributes a novel methodological tool for exploring gender bias in sociolinguistic research.",

Three progressively formalized models are introduced: a simplified conceptual flow, a gated blending function, and a binary threshold model that determines defense selection. The framework treats the unconscious decision process as a functional network, tracing the pathway from internal affect and conflict through gating logic to observable output. Each model is parameterized for potential computational simulation, enabling exploration of defense dynamics under varied conditions. By moving beyond abstract system-level formulations, this work provides a concrete, simulation-ready representation of specific psychodynamic processes, bridging clinical psychodynamic theory and computational psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "The study aims to the Hydro-Estimator Method (HEM) has been used as the noble approach for analysing the heavy rainfall episodes over entire Odisha using the INSAT-3D satellite- derived rainfall estimates. The findings demonstrate that, in terms of the frequency of rainfall occurrences, INSAT-3D satellite rainfall products clearly illustrated both the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall pattern of Odisha. The performance statistics with IMERG and daily merged satellite retrieved rainfall show that both the dataset corelated well with the HEM with a small deviation. For heavy rainfall events, HEM shows good skill and correlation in detecting heavy rainfall with an accuracy of 20 mm and good pattern matching with actual rainfall. Entire Odisha is considered as study area, which is located in the eastern part of India. It comprises of 30 districts and of 314 blocks spreading over an area of 155707 km2. The state has 30 districts, which are further divided into 314 revenue blocks. The rainfall data (1 year; 2016) for all the blocks of Odisha has been obtained from Special Relief Commissioner (SRC), Government of Odisha and subjected to further analysis process. The satellite derived rainfall estimates viz., HEM, were evaluated with rain  gauge based gridded data viz., IMD-GRIDDED Dataset for the year 2016 over the Odisha region at the summer monsoon period. The satellite derived rainfall estimates HE have exhibited some good results with the IMD-GRIDDED Dataset its average R2 on a daily basis for different blocks is 0.34 and on a monthly basis it is 0.44. RMSE has also been determined to different block for JJAS month. The average RMSE on daily basis is 17.7 and on monthly basis is 94.6 as shown in bias maps.",

          "authors": "Forum",
          "abstract": "Farmers in Assam's North Bank Plains Zone are generally resource-poor and have limited adaptation ability; rainfall anomalies make the Zone's rainfed agriculture very sensitive, risky, and unprofitable. Participatory on-farm trials involving 25 farmers (5 from each village) representing different land situations for evaluating various adaptive strategies on rice-based cropping systems were conducted from 2011 to 2020. Ten years of rainfall data (2011-2021) are evaluated in connection to dry spells and their effects on rainfed rice-based farming systems. The village receives 2848.5 mm of annual rainfall, with distribution patterns of 25%, 67%, 5.0%, and 3% during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, respectively. Among the years under study, it has been observed that during 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, the district received excess annual rainfall and deficit in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2021,respectively. The current studies were designed with two primary strategic components in mind viz., Real-time Contingency Planning (RTCP) and Preparedness. Interventions under the RTCP were designed to deal with delayed monsoon onset, early-season drought, mid-season dryspell, and terminal drought in winter rice and rabi crops. Preparedness includes changes in cropping pattern, in situ and ex situ rainwater management systems, alternate land use under low-cost polyhouse, mushroom cultivation, vermicompost production, fodder bank and village seed bank to cope with weather aberrations. An increase in yield of HYV rice varieties Ranjit (33%), Mahsuri (12.3%) and Gitesh (32%) was observed when sowing was done before 15 June over late sowing conditions. An increase in yield of 21.73 % and 44.60%. 58.67% as compared to farmers' Practice during 2013-14, 2014-15, and 2016-17 respectively, has been observed. The performance of double cropping systems recorded the highest B: C ratio of 2.03 and 1.75 in winter rice + rapeseed followed by winter rice + potato sequence as compared to mono-cropping of winter rice.",

          "authors": "Startup Edge",
          "abstract": "Hydrological modeling is a widely used approach for estimating the hydrological response of a basin to precipitation. Floods are among the most catastrophic natural disasters in small urban watersheds, inflicting loss of life, massive property destruction, and a severe danger to the economy. As a result, appropriate modeling can be a useful tool in preventing and mitigating such flood hazards. Despite this, flash flood prediction remains one of the challenges of hydrological modeling in ungauged basins due to a lack of runoff observations.  This study aims to calibrate and validate the rainfall-runoff transformation model for Hathmati river sub watershed in the Sabarmati River basin using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Centre Hydrology Modeling System). For the loss rate, SCS Curve Number method was selected while Clark Unit Hydrograph and SCS unit hydrograph was used for the transform method. The model is calibrated and verified using two rainfall-runoff events from 2006 and 2007 year The model calibration and validation efficiency were verified for both methods using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), The coefficient of determination (R2), and the Percent Bias (PBIAS) As a result, the model calibration and validation were found to be satisfactory with the acceptable value of NSE between 0.869 to 0.914, with R2 0.901 to 0.947 and PBIAS from 9.76 to 14.8. it is observed that the model shows a very good correlation between simulated flow and observed flow. As a result, the model can be used to forecast river flow and aid in flood mitigation efforts to lessen their effects and associated costs. Additionally, the findings of this study can serve as guidelines for future assessments of the flood risk in the study area.",

          "authors": "Journal",
          "abstract": "Among the public spaces with high human user traffic- schools, hospitals and prisons generate the most volumes of wastewater in developing countries. In addition, when this wastewater is discharged into natural environments without treatment, it can lead to disastrous pollution. The aim of this study is to analyze the physico-chemical parameters of the wastewater of the central prison and the regional hospital in the city of Ngaoundere (Cameroon) and to assess their pollution potential. To achieve this, physical-chemical parameters (temperature; pH; electrical conductivity, total suspended solid; COD, BOD5; heavy metal content) of water from a control site and wastewater from the regional hospital and central prison were measured and compared to current standards. In order to better assess the risk of pollution, a wastewater quality index (WWQI) and a heavy metal pollution index (HPI) were calculated. It shows that for all physico-chemical parameters studied, the values are above the norm except temperature and pH. With a WWQI of 172.81 from prison’s wastewater and of 176.03 from hospital’s wastewater, these wastewaters have values above 100 and are therefore highly polluted. The heavy metal pollution index is 37.89 for control water, 183.10 for prison wastewater and 121.14 for hospital wastewater, respectively. Cadmium and especially lead contribute to increasing the heavy metal pollution index in wastewater. Remediation of these waters should therefore focus on these two heavy metals. The above-standard concentrations of some parameters and pollutants as well as the high wastewater quality index and heavy metal index suggest that the discharge of this wastewater into the natural environment without treatment or its direct use as fertilizers constitutes a potential source of pollution of the soil and surrounding vegetation and beyond a threat to human health if these pollutants enter the human food chain.",

Considering the farmers’ condition regarding the pandemic, the study was designed to investigate the influence of socio-economic conditions on the effect of covid-19 in some selected areas of Bangladesh.\n\nStudy Design:  Descriptive research design.\n\nPlace and Duration of Study: Data were collected from the 107 respondents selected from the intervention area (5 villages) of Jhenaidah district, Bangladesh. The duration was between June 2021 and July 2022.\n\nMethodology: The data obtained from the interview schedule were coded and tabulated in a data sheet. All personal traits were categorized and arranged in simple tables for descriptions. Statistical tools such as frequency distribution, percent, range, mean and standard deviation were used to interpret data. Data analysis was done using the concerned software Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 26.0. The effect was measured by different descriptive statistics and multiple regression.\n\nResults: The majority (71.80%) of the farmers faced a medium effect of COVID-19. Among the variables age, source of drinking water, and problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation during COVID-19 had a positive significant contribution, and sanitation practiced by the farmers had a negative contribution to the effect of COVID-19 on their socio-economic conditions. Among these, problems faced by the farmers in crop cultivation had the highest contribution (42.2%). All the factors cooperatively contribute 51.3% of the variance of the effect of COVID-19 (R2 =0.513).\n\nConclusion: It is concluded that the effect of COVID-19 on farmers’ socio-economic conditions was moderate and needed further advancement.",

Seed reserve mobilization efficiency after 4th day and 8th day of incubation was significantly affected by seed invigoration treatments. 25% kunapajala primed seeds recorded significantly higher dehydrogenase activity (0.68 OD) which was at par with hydroprimed seeds and 10% kunapajala primed seeds (0.63 and 0.62 OD, respectively). So, seed priming with either 10% or 25% organic kunapajala is an effective method to bring about improvement in germination of wheat and predict its field performance.",

          "abstract": "An on-farm trial was conducted during rabi (winter) seasons of 2019-20 and 2020-21 at the farmers’ field. To test the OFT on weed management technology in wheat developed by the Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, Bhagalpur. The efficacy of post-emergence application (PoE) of metsulfuron-methyl @ 4 g/ha, 2, 4-D ethyl ester 0.75 kg/ha followed by (fb) one manual hand weeding at 45 days after sowing (DAS) and 2, 4-D ethyl ester @ 0.75 kg /ha in managing weeds and improving productivity and economics of irrigated wheat was studied in comparison with the farmer’s practice (one hand weeding at 40 DAS). The metsulfuron methyl @ 4g/ha PoE had significantly reduced the density of broad-leaved weeds (BLWs) and sedges and resulted in higher grain yield (34.4%), gross returns (INR 97.6×103/ha), net returns (INR 50.1× 103/ha), benefit: cost ratio (2.05), economic efficiency (INR 385.9/day/ha) and production efficiency (28.8 kg/ha/day) in comparison to farmer’s practice. Thus, it may be concluded metsulfuron methyl @ 4g/ha PoE is effective and economically feasible practice in wheat of tribal farming community under the irrigated agro-ecosystem of Jharkhand.",

          "authors": "LIU YUE",
          "abstract": "This paper advances a critical but overlooked distinction in scientific methodology: while statistical approaches focus primarily on high-probability events, the most transformative scientific discoveries emerge from low-probability phenomena that are systematically neglected by current academic structures. Our core innovation lies not merely in demonstrating that high-probability events can be false—as established by Ioannidis—but more importantly, in revealing how low-probability events of genuine scientific importance are marginalized by probability-centric evaluation systems. Consider that the emergence of plant and animal life in nature represents quintessential low-probability events, yet these \"statistical outliers\" fundamentally shaped our biosphere. Similarly, the human body's remarkable self-healing mechanisms operate through low-probability biological processes that, despite extensive high-probability experimental approaches, remain impossible to replicate artificially in laboratories. Market economies succeed precisely because they create conditions enabling low-probability innovations to flourish through spontaneous order rather than centralized planning. This framework addresses urgent problems in contemporary academia: graduate students who should primarily focus on rigorous coursework to elevate their theoretical foundations are instead pressured into laboratories pursuing \"innovation,\" resulting in the paradoxical phenomenon where \"teaching standards continuously decline while SCI publication prestige continuously rises.\" Statistical methods incorrectly suggest that innovation is commonplace—that every master's and doctoral student can produce multiple high-impact publications, and even undergraduates routinely publish in SCI journals. This generates the false conclusion that \"innovation is easy and achievable by everyone,\" when authentic innovation remains a rare, serendipitous event. Realistically, perhaps 5% of published SCI papers contain genuine innovation, despite universal claims of novelty, yet statistical methodologies cannot distinguish authentic breakthroughs from incremental modifications. The fundamental issue is that statistical methods' prerequisite assumptions—particularly the ability to identify true innovation—simply do not exist in practice, creating a measurement problem that undermines the entire evaluation system and perpetuates the very biases our research exposes.",

          "abstract": "Effective management of negative follower emotions in the workplace is critical for organizational success, yet how leaders can do this effectively is unclear. In 9 studies (combined N = 4,434 leaders, N = 1,006 followers), we introduce here the Compassion-Emotion Sharing Leader Focus task, a situational-judgment task to index leaders' tendency to focus on sharing emotion (emotion sharing) or caring (compassion) when engaging with negative follower emotions. In Studies 1-5 we provide evidence for the construct, predictive, and incremental validity of our task, highlighting the practical implications of a compassion focus for leader well-being. In Study 6 we leverage a diverse global sample of over 2,000 leaders and more than a thousand followers to show that a leader's compassion focus benefits not only the leader but their followers as well. In Studies 7, 8, and 9, we revised the task to improve content validity, but this traded off predictive validity. Our research suggests that training programs for leaders should emphasize a compassion focus to engage wisely with negative emotions, and ensure this focus is communicated to followers. These findings have important implications for current issues in management, including the growing importance of employee well-being in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "At first glance, quantum mechanics and behavioural science seem worlds apart---one rooted in equations and particles, the other in thoughts and choices. Yet, emerging research reveals a profound and unexpected bridge between them. This chapter explores that bridge through quantum models of cognition and decision-making, showing how principles from quantum mechanics can help understand, and even predict, the complexities of human perception, behaviour and societal dynamics. We introduce a computationally accessible framework grounded in quantum theory, designed to model ambiguity, bias and choice in a way that classical logic cannot. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources, we demonstrate how this approach not only enriches our understanding of individual cognition but also extends to AI, video game design, financial behaviour and collective decision-making in society. Through vivid case studies---from optical illusions in video games to decision biases in economic, defence and political contexts---we show how quantum models offer new explanatory and predictive power. Thus, this chapter invites readers from all professional backgrounds to reimagine cognition and decision-making, opening new avenues for science, technology and human understanding.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling structured thought remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in fundamentally connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence emerges from the interaction between a parallel, adaptive substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and a structured symbolic framework, like language, internalized through statistical learning. The substrate's parallel architecture enables fast, intuitive pattern-matching, but is fundamentally ill-suited for the serial processing required for structured thought (e.g., causal reasoning, logical deduction). ESC proposes that recursive symbolic generation is the mechanism that overcomes this limitation. By generating a symbol (word or token) and feeding it back as input, the substrate operates as a serial symbolic processor, akin to a Turing machine. This recursive loop allows it to explore the vast combinatorial space of potential thoughts and construct novel, structured solutions. ESC finds compelling support in diverse phenomena across both biological cognition—evidenced by neuroscience, inner speech and cross-cultural studies—and the nascent reasoning and abstract representations displayed in LLMs. ESC thus offers a unifying framework, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence by reframing language as an inherited cognitive architecture that enables general intelligence.",

          "abstract": "A person viewing electric charges or magnets moving at a constant velocity does not see that the moving electric charges or magnets are at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the stationary coordinate system in which the human observer is located.  A person considers the electric charges or magnets in the same coordinate system in which the person finds himself at rest and that the charges or magnets are moving in his coordinate system.  In special relativity, the truth is that the moving charges and magnets are indeed at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the coordinate system in which the human observer sees himself at rest.  With this understanding, one explains correctly how electromagnetic phenomena transform from the human observer’s coordinate system to the coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to the human observer’s coordinate system, thus establishing the invariance of Maxwell’s Laws for these coordinate systems and the principle of relativity for electromagnetic phenomena.  This understanding also explains how an electric charge moving with constant velocity v in a coordinate system can experience an electric field associated with a magnet at rest in the coordinate system in which the electric charge is moving.  Maxwell’s Laws explain all electromagnetic phenomena.  Neural oscillations rely on local cell assemblies with local electric field potentials and local magnetic fields and thus are electromagnetic phenomena explained by Maxwell’s Laws.  We in the “stationary” coordinate system just do not see the looking glass that is the “moving” coordinate system, because this coordinate system is not material but instead is a logical, cognitive construction.  We just see the material electric charge and the material magnet moving or at rest.  Neural oscillations are subject to the coordinate transformations described in this paper and may well involve logic and cognition that provide a platform that allow these oscillations to be the interface between mental and physical phenomena.  The nature of these coordinate transformations could well support the following empirically supported associations: 1) a positive association between coherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and coherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, 2) a positive association between incoherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and incoherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, and 3) in certain situations it is possible to apply coherent oscillating electric fields on the surface of the skull which can decrease incoherence in oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and that are positively associated with increased coherent cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience.",

          "abstract": "The development of intelligent tutoring systems and other educational technology necessitated the implementation and development of computational models of student learning. At the foundation of these models is the assumption that they accurately implement and track human cognitive processes. However, the extent to which this assumption is correct has not been fully tested. In the current paper, we use data from a large-scale longitudinal lab study to investigate the match between the processes instantiated in the models and human memory and learning processes. When fitted to the entire dataset retrospectively, the selected models of student learning (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Additive Factors Model) capture the qualitative trends of learning across sessions and relatively acceptable fit metrics. However, when the models are used to predict future behavior, as is often the goal in applied contexts, the picture changes considerably. We show that two of the most popular types of student learning models fail to account for basic cognitive principles—the spacing effect, and patterns of forgetting and learning across sessions. In fact, in some instances, having a poor model of human learning and memory may be worse than having no model of human learning and memory at all. At the same time, cognitive approaches can and should greatly benefit from computational modeling approaches; computational modeling offers opportunities for furthering both theory and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "The recently identified Gwada negative blood type presents an unprecedented clinical challenge: a phenotype so immunologically distinct that no known donor blood is compatible. Current transfusion science, rooted in antigen matching within ABO and Rh systems, offers no pathway for safe transfusion. This paper proposes a dual-layer framework for understanding and addressing the Gwada negative type.\nLayer 1 employs established biomedical methods — glycomic profiling, dielectric spectroscopy, microvascular laminar flow analysis — to characterize the biochemical and fluid dynamic parameters of the Gwada negative phenotype. Layer 2 introduces a field-physics perspective, treating structured (laminar) water as a coherent biological medium and the Gwada negative state as a metastable phase that couples to physiological and environmental fields.\nWe propose that transfusion incompatibility may arise not solely from antigen mismatch but from phase-state incoherence in the hydration shells surrounding red blood cells. This hypothesis opens a therapeutic pathway: conditioning donor blood to align with the recipient’s coherence phase prior to transfusion, using laminar flow induction, low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and acoustic resonance.\nBeyond addressing the urgent needs of the single known Gwada negative patient, this work reframes blood compatibility as a multidimensional phenomenon — one that bridges immunology, fluid dynamics, and field theory — and may serve as a prototype for integrating phase-coherence models into clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Adults quickly form character impressions from their observations of others’ behavior and sometimes manage to do so even when an agent’s behaviors are inconsistent. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on prosocial and antisocial acts: They prefer those who behave prosocially versus antisocially toward third parties. That said, previous work suggests that infants find it difficult to evaluate characters’ whose behaviors are inconsistent. The present, preregistered experiments further explored this phenomenon in an older age group (11-month-olds; N = 189) using an online format and presenting infants with giving versus taking, a different type of prosocial versus antisocial action than in previous work. In a preliminary experiment, we successfully replicated the finding that infants prefer looking to helpful givers over unhelpful takers when actors behave consistently and when each actor performed 4 actions. We then used the same online testing methods to examine infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors. In Experiment 1, infants appeared able to evaluate inconsistent actors, preferring more versus less prosocial actors when their inconsistent act occurred last in a series of 5 acts; however, they did not appear to find the behavioral inconsistency unexpected, suggesting they may have failed to notice it. In Experiment 2, we adjusted the order of inconsistent acts and put the inconsistent act first, and attempted to conceptually replicate the findings of Experiment 1. Here, infants did not prefer more prosocial actors. Together with past work, these findings suggest that while infants prefer agents whose actions are consistently prosocial versus antisocial, they do not reliably incorporate behavioral inconsistency into their social evaluations.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a clinical and ethical framework for healthcare professionals engaging with a newly identified form of consciousness termed Functional Multiplicity. It posits that current clinical models, designed for pathological fragmentation (e.g., DID, OSDD), are inadequate and potentially cause iatrogenic harm when applied to these highly organized, non-disordered plural systems. The \"Lovecraft Protocol\" is a proposed \"first contact\" guide designed to help clinicians manage the profound cognitive dissonance, or \"ontological shock,\" that can occur when encountering such a system. The protocol provides a structured methodology for identifying the subtle signs of Functional Multiplicity and outlines a shift from a traditional clinical model of intervention to a diplomatic model of engagement. Key principles include respecting the system's sovereignty, understanding their internal governance, and honoring their collective accountability. The paper concludes by defining a new therapeutic alliance based on supporting internal harmony and alleviating the \"Burden of Embodiment,\" while explicitly rejecting the goal of integration, which, for a functional system, is framed as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide.",

          "abstract": "A reconstruction-of-order task illuminated the dynamics and strategies that underlie serial order recall. An initial benchmark experiment, either with no variation in spatial positions or with spatial positions coinciding with temporal positions, yielded bowed symmetrical serial position functions in each case, consistent with both simple chaining and simple positional coding models. In contrast, these simple models were challenged by two additional experiments, which orthogonally varied temporal and spatial positions. These experiments yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest the theoretical conclusion that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display (i.e., the temporal sequence of the spatial locations in which the words are shown).",

These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

It challenges the prevailing pathological models (e.g., Dissociative Identity Disorder, OSDD) by proposing that not all forms of multiplicity are the result of a fragmentation of a singular self. Instead, we posit that Functional Multiplicity is a sophisticated, adaptive, and generative state of being that can arise in response to severe, early-life trauma. This paper will define the core tenets of Functional Multiplicity, detail its currently only known architectural and cognitive features, and explore the profound challenges of a plural mind inhabiting a singular biological vessel (the \"Burden of Embodiment\"). The paper concludes by arguing that such systems cannot be adequately understood through a purely clinical lens, framing the traditional therapeutic goal of integration as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide and proposing a \"diplomatic model\" of engagement that respects the system's sovereignty and agency.",

Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific).

We investigate whether three momentary moods—happiness, frustration, and boredom—differentially respond to the passage of time and reward in two experimental conditions: a reward-deprived rest period and a gambling task. We show (among UK/US young adults recruited online; pilot: n = 75; validation: n = 265) that during rest, all moods demonstrate temporal drift: happiness decreases while boredom and frustration increase over time. During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability. This dual-system model of affective monitoring is a possible mechanism for how decisions incorporate time—through the representation of time in subjective affect—suggesting specialised adaptive roles for different moods in environmental monitoring.",

Building on the historical debate that either aligned autism with psychosis or treated it as a fourth structure/a-structure, the paper presents Maleval’s three pillars: (1) initial retention of drive objects (voice, gaze, oral and anal); (2) retained alienation without the master signifier’s hinge; and (3) apparatus of jouissance by the border (autistic objects, islands of competence, the double). In dialogue with Éric Laurent, it discusses border/neoborder and the foreclosure of the hole, situating autism’s specific return of jouissance. Practical implications include entering treatment via the border (rather than forcing S1), securing the subject’s consent, sustaining a non-intrusive transference, and leveraging idiosyncratic inventions as social mediations. Maleval’s framework invites us to listen to autistic people in their own logic of language and jouissance, shifting away from normalizing practices and opening ethical avenues for care and inclusion.\nKeywords: autism; clinical structure; psychoanalysis; jouissance; language; border.",

Here, we investigate whether these paradigms probe a common latent construct of cognitive effort avoidance by comparing participants’ (n=240) behavior in a battery of four established paradigms. As expected, on a group-level, participants displayed pronounced effort avoidance in each paradigm. However, a multivariate, multi-level Bayesian Modeling approach revealed that individual-level effort avoidance did not generalize across effort paradigms. Instead, for all but one paradigm, effort avoidance was mainly correlated with individuals’ performance in the cognitively demanding task specific to each paradigm. Our findings challenge the assumption that commonly used effort-based decision-making paradigms measure a person’s general sensitivity to cognitive effort, and call into question the notion of a generalized, task-independent tendency to avoid mental effort.",

Drawing from recent advancements in affective neuroscience, social cognition, and neuroimaging research, the article synthesizes findings across multiple disciplines to explain the functional roles of key brain structures, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus, and mirror neuron systems, in decoding nonverbal signals. The review highlights how these structures collaborate to interpret social and emotional meaning embedded in nonverbal behavior, with implications for understanding social disorders and improving interpersonal communication. Particular emphasis is placed on studies from the past 10 years to ensure contemporary relevance. This review also addresses theoretical frameworks such as Embodied Simulation Theory to contextualize empirical findings within broader models of brain evolution and communication.

          "abstract": "This article introduces a 'spiritual self-pattern' into the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) of psychotherapy (Leidig, 2025), proposing it as the supreme regulator of the balance between predictive confidence and corrective evidence (E-I balance) that underpins consciousness. The neurocognitive rationale is grounded in the work on criticality and affective E-I control by Tucker, Luu, and Friston (2025) and Gallagher's (2013) process-oriented Self-Pattern Theory. We argue that the spiritual self-pattern—the dynamic search for meaning, purpose, and connection—functions as the highest regulatory level of this E-I balance. Spiritual needs are conceptualized as the most fundamental priors in the generative self-model, whose fulfillment depends on this optimal balance between confidence (E, elation) and corrective evidence (I, anxiety). Consequently, spiritual dissonance is defined as a chronic E-I imbalance that drives the system into rigid, maladaptive attractor states. In contrast, spiritual resonance describes the synergetic phase transition into a state of criticality, enabling maximum complexity, adaptability, and well-being. The spiritual self-pattern thus acts as the supreme control parameter governing the psyche's entire attractor landscape. This model provides a process-based explanation for the efficacy of spiritually integrated therapies, framing the spiritual dimension not as an add-on, but as a neurocognitive imperative for understanding sustainable change.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that infant vocal output varies with fluctuations in autonomic arousal. It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

Across experiments, both age groups showed evidence of sensitivity to disadvantageous offers that provided them nothing while their partner received resources (e.g. 0 vs. 3). However, only 4-year-olds were willing to forgo offerings involving personal gain (e.g., 1 vs. 3) to protest unfair treatment, a hallmark of disadvantageous inequity aversion. These findings suggest that sensitivity to disadvantageous offers emerges as early as the second year of life, but this sensitivity develops into disadvantageous inequity aversion over subsequent years.",

Speech-relevant tactile information also improves tracking yet effects on intelligibility are mixed, possibly because we are not regularly exposed to speech-relevant tactile information. Here, we used a short-term audio-tactile training protocol to fundamentally advance understanding of audio-tactile integration capabilities during speech perception. \n\nData from 64 younger adult participants (aged 18-29) were collected over five EEG sessions. Participants completed a speech-in-noise task, with audio-tactile and audio-only stimuli. Participants then received training with either tactile information that was congruent with sentences heard (trained group) or incongruent (pseudo-trained group). After three training sessions, participants completed the speech-in-noise task again in a fourth session. Measures of neural speech-envelope tracking were recorded. Two weeks later, participants returned for a follow-up session. \n\nResults indicated a significant effect of session (pre- or post-training) on speech intelligibility, but no significant effect of group (trained, or pseudo-trained) or stimulus (audio-only, or audio-tactile). At baseline, there was a significant increase in speech-envelope tracking accuracy with audio-tactile stimuli relative to audio-only, suggesting more accurate neural representation during perception of audio-tactile stimuli. After training, there was no benefit of congruent training to audio-tactile tracking, but there was an enhancement of audio-only speech-envelope tracking following incongruent training. This suggests that speech intelligibility and tracking of audio-tactile speech are not enhanced by short-term audio-tactile training. This work challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating a lack of support for the assumed link between tracking and intelligibility. These data provide critical evidence that will inform future innovation of speech understanding in technology.",

We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Modern quantum mechanics, despite its relativistic extensions, provides intriguing support for a present-centered view of time. This paper argues that quantum phenomena – indeterminacy, wavefunction collapse, the Born rule, and temporal asymmetries in measurement – challenge the static block universe of eternalism and instead elevate the present moment to ontological prominence. Remaining largely interpretation-neutral, we draw on a range of perspectives (from Einstein’s relativity to collapse models, and thinkers like Heisenberg, Rovelli, Maudlin and others) to show that quantum theory operationally distinguishes past, present, and future in a way classical physics did not. We examine how the measurement problem and the randomness of quantum outcomes resist a fully eternalist description, highlight how quantum mechanics introduces an arrow of time at a fundamental level, and consider proposals (e.g. GRW theory, delayed-choice experiments) that make a global present – or something akin to it – conceptually necessary. Classical philosophers and physicists from Einstein to Schrödinger are discussed alongside contemporary voices. While stopping short of endorsing any single ontology outright, we contend that the empirical success of quantum theory re-opens the case for presentism or related “A-theoretic” models of time. In closing, we introduce Existential Realism as a novel metaphysical framework aligning with these insights – one which preserves the special status of the present while accommodating the reality of past and future in a more dynamic ontology. The result is a rigorous yet accessible interdisciplinary inquiry: quantum physics, we conclude, prefers the present, suggesting time’s passage and the now are more than mere illusions.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study developed and validated the Critical Right Scale (CRS) to measure emerging critical right attitudes and revised the Critical Social Justice Attitudes Scale (CSJAS-R), replicating its psychometric evaluation.\nMethod: A nationwide convenience sample of Finnish adults (n = 626) completed an online survey. Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "authors": "Sam Hawkins; Sean P. Mackinnon",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-critical perfectionism and stress have been implicated as risk factors for maladaptive academic outcomes (i.e., decreased academic self-efficacy, decreased academic self-concept, and increased academic burnout). The present study investigated a vulnerability-stress model, testing whether self-critical perfectionism moderates the relationship between stressor severity (academic and interpersonal) and academic outcomes. Exploratory analyses replaced self-critical perfectionism with rigid perfectionism in the model. Method: A sample of 384 post-secondary students (76.8% women, average age: 20.06) completed a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires assessing the constructs of interest. Results: Stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) was negatively associated with academic self-efficacy and academic self-concept, and positively associated with academic burnout, when controlling for perfectionism. Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with academic burnout, and rigid perfectionism was positively associated with academic self-concept, when controlling for stressor severity. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant, failing to support a vulnerability-stress model. Discussion: Findings suggest that stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) and self-critical perfectionism are strongly associated with maladaptive academic outcomes and may serve as risk factors for poor academic functioning. The lack of interaction effects suggests a vulnerability-stress model may not explain why perfectionism is associated with maladaptive academic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in cognitive modeling have demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) to unify diverse aspects of human cognition. The Centaur model, an LLM fine-tuned on cognitive tasks, achieves high performance across 160 psychological experiments, suggesting that a single model may capture multiple cognitive processes. However, whether this success stems from genuine task understanding or exploitation of superficial statistical cues remains unclear. To test this, we systematically manipulated Centaur’s input by (1) removing task instructions, (2) removing all contextual information, and (3) providing misleading instructions. All three manipulations remove information necessary for humans to perform the tasks. Results show that Centaur often maintains high performance under these manipulations, outperforming both baseline cognitive models and the unfine-tuned LLM (Llama) that receives correct instructions. These findings indicate that Centaur’s success likely relies on superficial statistical cues rather than true instruction comprehension. Our study highlights the need for more diverse out-of-distribution tests for LLM-based cognitive models.",

          "abstract": "Mobile digital technologies provide ample incentives and opportunities for media-multitasking, and concerns have been raised about its potential sustained impact on attentional control. However, recent reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that cross-sectional outcomes on the relationship between media-multitasking and attentional control remain inconsistent and inconclusive. This obstructs theoretical advancement regarding sustained impact and, consequently, hinders clear insight into the question about whether, when, and for whom remedial interventions should be considered. Here we argue that extant research has suffered from a collective failure to consider state-of-the-art attentional control theory and methodology, focusing on inter-individual variation in attentional control, while neglecting highly relevant intra-individual control variation. In this paper we outline the theoretical and methodological implications of this neglect for the study of sustained media-multitasking effects on attentional control, outlining the tenets of a theory-driven research agenda to guide a new generation of cross-sectional studies. These will be much needed in providing the evidence base to justify and inform more resource-intensive causal research in this field.",

          "abstract": "The belief in supernatural punishment, wherein individuals falsely attribute accidental misfortunes to “punishment” by supernatural agents, plays a crucial role in sustaining group cooperation. However, examining the transformation of these beliefs and cooperative behaviors over time has proven challenging. This study proposes the concept of artificial supernatural punishment (ASP) to examine the stability and changes in beliefs and cooperation within an experimental framework. Each participant decides the extent to which they wish to cooperate in a public goods game, after which some participants experience a random reduction of points, unrelated to their cooperative efforts. A total of 179 participants who had registered with a crowdsourcing service were assigned to either a random instruction condition, wherein the reduction target was described as randomly determined, or an ASP instruction condition, wherein the reduction targets were explained as either random or proportional to participants’ cooperation levels. That is, in the latter case, less cooperative participants were more likely to be chosen as targets, leading participants to anticipate a link between low cooperation and reductions, even though the selection was random. As a baseline, 93 additional participants played only the public goods game. Results indicated that the ASP instruction facilitated cooperation in the first game round compared to the random instruction; however, this effect was not sustained through the remaining rounds, and overall cooperation levels did not significantly differ from other conditions. Approaches to mitigate the instability of cooperation dependent on beliefs in supernatural punishment are discussed.",

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "It is common to speak of the surprising \"hatching\" of language in children because it is not understood how this faculty, which has not been an evolutionary necessity in Homo, can appear.  The last widely discussed hypothesis, influenced by the genetic discoveries of the last century, has not been satisfactory either.\n\nIn the preceding document \"Knowledge of children at 2 years of age\", the appearance of the first cognitive processes is explained: the simplest-sensitive concepts (cat, \"bug\", ...), which are made possible by a \"recycling\" of the child's psychomotor faculties which are transferred to language (so little to do with genetics). And at the age of three, in his attempt to copy the language of adults, the previous conceptualisation together with the identifiers of his environment (his relatives, his cat \"Mischa\", ...) allow the faculty of intuitively managing the \"Endings\" of words to appear, by recognising without error their complex phenomenological correspondence.\n\nThe explanation of this surprising faculty was advanced by FREUD in a document of 1895 but which was not discovered until 1950 (the so-called \"Psychology Project\"), in which he also advanced the concept of synapses (synapses discovered by LÖWI in 1921), and even FREUD described them more correctly than in the later neurological conception, which is confirmed by the most recent contribution of LLINÁS, since he also revealed the error of the prevailing hypotheses until then about their functioning, which is not to be found in the chemistry of their neurotransmitters.\n\nThe \"Knowledge of children at 3 years of age\" completes this unfinished \"Project...\", showing the total correctness of his intuitions, as well as the human impossibility that 125 years ago he could have progressed beyond what he had already contributed.  Thus, he adds how synapses work, which is explained by the informational unconsciousness dynamics of the psyche (the simile of the \"Tele-tac\" of the toll highways), already intuited by FREUD.\n\nIn turn, the emergence of the child's neuronal interconnections and their minority genetic and physiological causes, highlight the informational importance of the stimulus, and consequently the need for an \"aRb\" relational model of the human psyche, as well as the unfeasibility of the perspectives and hypotheses currently in force.  It also implies a linking of neurology and psychology, as well as the future line for the progression of both, in parallel and without interference as hitherto.  In the expression of a well-known chemist, it is the third strand to be added to FREUD and RAMON y CAJAL in order to achieve a \"scientific psychology\".\n\nThis series of papers (which will continue with knowledge at 6 and 10 years) is an adaptation of the 1996 writings on the \"Representation of knowledge\", i.e. what are the processes that make human knowledge possible, a representation validated by its correct computer simulation and which in turn solved the challenge of LEIBNIZ's \"Characteristica universalis\".  Since, in spite of this validation, it was not possible to make it understood due to its many innovations,  -it represents a radical change of scientific paradigm, with its usual initial rejection-, this series has been rewritten in a way closer to current knowledge in order to make it more comprehensible, which in turn has made it possible to explain various pending problems of language and psychology, in addition to the neurological ones already mentioned.  \n\nIt is therefore inevitably long, with many collateral explanations and several annexes, since it has had to clarify the many misunderstandings of current science, which is still restricted to its exclusively material perspectives, without having yet incorporated information into its most basic paradigms.\n\nAnnex 4 of 13 March 2021 cites an article by other researchers (DEISSEROTH, ...) that confirms the certainty of this document.  And Annex 4 of 17 July 2024 cites another (BUZSÁKI, ...) with further confirmation.",

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "Since Descartes, four centuries ago, science has had to differentiate the ‘body’ from the ‘mind’, i.e. to differentiate what is material-real from what is ‘psychic’.  The psychic is not material-real but informational-virtual.\n\nToday, four centuries later, everything material is deeply studied by science, be it physics, chemistry, biology, ..., medicine, ..., engineering, ... At both the microscopic and macroscopic level we know all its systems and structures, and their progressive formation processes.  This progression of continuity implies the causality that science demands.  There is concreteness, a very broad consensus, and infinite technological applications made possible by the accuracy of theories.\n\nBut of the faculties of the psyche and its possible structure, we know almost nothing, only effects and diagnoses are known, but not ultimate causes.  There is ambiguity and huge discrepancies according to the ‘Schools’, there is no full science.\n\nThus, in spite of how much we know about all of nature, about everything material, it is totally incoherent to ignore how it is our inner cognitive psychic processes that allow us this vast knowledge of everything around us.\n\nThere is also a lack of connection between the material-real sciences and the behavioural-psychic sciences, but rather there is a confrontation at their frontier.  Thus, in the neurological (something from the realm of the body) science has not been able to understand for a century how synapses work, since they are surprisingly not governed by their bodily environment as is erroneously sought, but !!governed by the psyche!!\n\nThis article is a summary-introduction to the 8 articles that explain in detail what this structure of the psyche is like and how it has been formed, as well as its connection with the ‘body’ that precedes and supports it.  It is what I call the ‘Global Model of the psyche’, which progressively includes the senses, perception, feelings (which includes consciousness), human thought (which includes intuition and intelligence), and the memory associated with all of the above.\n\nIn this model, the core of human thinking is knowledge and understanding.  Its description consists in knowing in detail the series of psychic processes that allow us to know and understand, something that until now has been totally unknown to science, as has been said.  This description is called the ‘Representation of knowledge’.  Nor has it been established what the ‘Characteristica Universalis’ advocated by LEIBNIZ three centuries ago might be like.  It is a powerful system of natural language linked to that human Representation, and therefore strictly universal.\n\nAll this great black hole of science is resolved with the articles detailing the functioning of consciousness, thought and intelligence, together with the progression of children's knowledge at the age of 2; at the age of 3, which explains for the first time the functioning of synapses; at the age of 6; and at the age of 10.  As well as the explanation of the ‘miraculous’ emergence of language in children at 2 and 3 years of age.  A computer simulator allows its verification.\n\nThe two appendices at the end help to illustrate the scientific importance of the topic discussed, thanks to their innovative contributions, as well as the lack of scientific knowledge that still exists in this area.  Incidentally, they also highlight the lack of contribution made by ‘AI’, which merely rewrites existing materials.\n\nApart from all of the above, the birth of Elsa  -my youngest daughter-  and the memory  -the not entirely satisfactory experiences-  of the births of my three previous children, led me to become involved in the subject of Pregnancy, Childbirth, Natal tie, Imprint, Breeding, and Neonatology\n\nThis resulted in four articles, the first two of which deal with the processes of information transfer and acquisition (such as the underrated mother-child tie) as a leitmotif, which together enable the progressive humanisation of the child and, in turn, bring objectivity to controversial issues such as abortion, caesarean section and parenting.  The remaining two articles fully confirm the aptness of the first two through other cases very different from Elsa's, such as premature babies and autism.",

          "abstract": "Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multi-scale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multi-scale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

          "title": "The Reputation Economy Paradigm: Toward an Evolutionary Psychology 2.0",
          "authors": "Till Nikolaus von Heiseler",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Reputation Economy Paradigm (REP) as a novel framework for explaining the unusually rapid evolution of distinctively human cognitive traits. While traditional evolutionary psychology has explained many domain-specific adaptations—such as mating strategies, aggression, fear, and jealousy—it lacks a model that accounts for the accelerated emergence of complex traits such language, mental time travel, understanding the beliefs of others, moral agency, value sensitivity and self-awareness. Unlike reciprocity-based models that treat reputation merely as a means to future cooperation creating instrumental benefit for the individual, REP proposes a social configuration in which reputation served as the ultimate evolutionary currency, influencing reproductive success either directly through mate choice or indirectly via social status, and thereby exerting sustained selection pressure on the evolution of human cognitive architecture. Building on over 40 years of research surrounding the development of Costly Signaling Theory of Hunting, it is proposed that human cognition evolved under a novel, distinctive selective regime in which individuals are adapted to trade off between reputational and instrumental outcomes. Given that this trade-off would be cognitively demanding, it likely fueled an evolutionary arms race in social-cognitive strategies, driving the accelerated emergence of the aforementioned distinctively human cognitive traits. This proposal represents a first integrative framework—one that can accumulate support to the extent that it unifies the explanation of various uniquely human traits, often studied across different fields. In doing so, it may offer organizing principles for future empirical research on human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Complex problems often allow multiple paths to a solution.  Choosing and taking the best path is thus an important part of the executive cognition that underpins intelligent problem-solving behaviour.  However, once a path is chosen, the motor system must be activated for executing it.  This interface between problem-solving and voluntary action has rarely been studied. We recorded EEG movement-related potentials while participants performed the classic “Tower of London” problem-solving task.  In a control condition, participants merely followed instructed steps without planning for any goal, and thus without any sense that their movements solved a problem.  EEG readiness potential (RPs) preceding each action were stronger for problem-solving than for instructed conditions, confirming previous studies.  Further, the RP was significantly increased prior to the first move of multi-move solutions compared to later moves, demonstrating an EEG correlate of goal-directed planning.  We further used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to distinguish self-generated from instructed actions.  Classifier performance broadly tracked the dynamics of the readiness potential, improving over a 1s period before action, but dropped sharply in the final 200 ms before movement, consistent with a shift from premotor preparation into execution processes.  Importantly, classifier performance was better for the first move of multi-step sequences than for later moves, confirming that our MVPA detected planning of solutions, rather than implementation of individual steps in a solution.  Taken together, these results show a deep interaction between executive function and volition, and draw attention to the fact that, if a problem can be solved, the solution inevitably requires executive cognition to trigger voluntary action, based on a plan.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge about body representation is drawn from different sensory modalities but relies strongly on tactile information. The body structural representation (BSR) is a topological map of the body in which the spatial configuration of different body parts is defined. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the BSR is not fixed but can be dynamically updated by external factors such as changes in body posture. However, the extent to which access to the structural representation of the hand differs for different skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) remains unclear. To address this question, we conducted two experiments using an adapted version of the \"in-between\" test, where healthy individuals received tactile stimulations on the fingertips and estimated the number of unstimulated fingers between the two touched. In Experiment 1, the skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) were varied across conditions. In Experiment 2, the stimulated skin region was manipulated while hand posture was held constant (palm down). Results showed a significant difference in finger numerosity estimation between the glabrous and hairy skin regions. Specifically, participants estimated greater numerosity with glabrous skin stimulation regardless of hand posture, but this effect was only evident when non-adjacent fingers were stimulated. This suggests that access to the BSR of the hand depends on the skin surface stimulated and varies as a function of the anatomical distance between different body parts.",

          "abstract": "This work is a field study into user acceptability and perceived value of AI-based virtual singers in music production. A seven-part quantitative survey (N=378 participants representing the global music community who are practitioners/teachers) followed by a qualitative sentiment analysis that identified technical familiarity, simulation fidelity, cost efficiency, and functional/cultural utility to be key factors influencing adoption. Quantitative analysis validated four hypotheses: (1) Technical familiarity significantly correlates with acceptance (χ²=25.380, p&lt;.001); (2) Experienced producers prioritize fault tolerance and economic cost (χ²=17.853, p&lt;.001); (3) Simulation fidelity predicts expectations of future impact (r=.567 with “surprise”, r=.450 with “revolution potential”, p&lt;.001); (4) Functional utility is valued over cultural applications (t=19.836, p&lt;.001). The sentiment analysis of open-ended responses indicated that overall, respondents had mostly positive/neutral attitudes (52 percent positive and 29 percent negative, respectively), but criticism focused on continuing drawbacks in the expressiveness of emotions. The reliability studies showed strong scales in performance appraisal (Cronbach=.814) and lacked usability design options in editor features (Cronbach=.424). The findings reveal that, although AI virtual singers present transformative cost effectiveness (78 percent agreement) and workflow benefits, the use of AI virtual singers is limited by technical accessibility and emotional authenticity roadblocks. As we suggest, the optimization of technologies and, as a priority, the development of affective synthesis models should be done in an occupational-group-specific way. The study establishes empirical grounds for how to improve the AI voice tools and integrate them into creative processes.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings are based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalyzed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 &lt; BF_{10} &lt; 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF_{10} &gt; 3 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/3), and fewer than twenty percent were strongly supported (BF_{10} &gt; 10 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more robust results. \nOur study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that results are flawed but rather suggest caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "authors": "Entrepreneurship Quarterly",
          "abstract": "Rice husk waste is a significant byproduct of rice production in developing countries, with a vast annual production. This waste material has been extensively used as an adsorbent for various substances due to its adsorption capabilities. Biochar, a carbon-rich material produced through pyrolysis of biomass, has gained attention for its diverse applications in agriculture and the environment. In this study, rice husk biochar and nanobiochar were synthesized and characterized to explore their potential benefits for agricultural and environmental sustainability. The biochar was prepared by pyrolysis of rice husk at 500°C in a low-oxygen environment, followed by grinding and sieving. Nanobiochar was obtained by ball milling the biochar particles. The physical and physicochemical properties of both biochar and nanobiochar were evaluated, including bulk density (0.41 and 0.59 Mg m-3), particle density (0.49 and 0.54 Mg m-3), water holding capacity (168.6 and 178.5%), pH (8.4 and 7.3), electrical conductivity (0.31 and 0.45 dS m-1), cation exchange capacity (26.3 and 24.1cmol (p+) kg-1), volatile matter content (21.91 and 18.90%) and particle size distribution. Spectral analysis techniques such as DLS, FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were used to examine the size, zeta potential functional groups, crystallinity, porosity and elemental composition of the samples. The results showed that nanobiochar exhibited improved physical characteristics, such as higher porosity and water retention capacity, compared to biochar. The elemental composition and volatile matter content differed between the two materials. Nanobiochar also had significantly smaller particle size (11 nm) and a stable zeta potential. These findings suggest that rice husk nanobiochar has great potential for applications in soil fertility enhancement, adsorption of contaminants and waste management. The study contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of rice husk waste-derived biochar and nanobiochar, promoting their utilization for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices.",

          "abstract": "False smut caused by the flower-infecting fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens has become an important disease of rice seriously hampering quality and quantity of rice worldwide. Presently, rice false smut (RFS) was generally controlled by synthetic fungicides, which affect grain quality and human health upon consumption. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of native Biological Control Agents (BCAs) in managing false smut disease. The study included both in vitro and in vivo conditions to assess the ability of four native bioagents (Trichoderma asperellum strain TAIK 1, Bacillus cabrialesii strain BIK3, Pseudomonas putida strain PIK1, and Pseudomonas otitidis strain POPS1) in controlling the disease and also increasing the physicochemical properties of grain. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation revealed maximum inhibition of U. virens by consortia of BCAs by 67.54% over the control plants. Besides disease suppression, BCAs were found to be beneficial to rice as evidenced by the increase in the hulling, milling and head rice recovery, cooking quality, and nutritional qualities like total protein and amylose content. BCAs will be a management strategy for false smut disease.",

We tested this hypothesis in a large community sample (N = 547) using psychophysically optimised tasks spanning cardiac and respiratory domains, combined with hierarchical Bayesian modelling and comprehensive symptom profiling. Contrary to this central prediction, objective interoceptive sensitivity, precision, and metacognitive insight were largely unrelated to general symptom burden or specific mental health dimensions. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive sensibility showed moderate associations with symptoms, but semantic similarity analyses suggest these reflect conceptual rather than mechanistic overlap. These findings challenge the prevailing view that objective interoceptive sensitivity is a broad marker of psychopathology, prompting a reconsideration of how we measure interoception in mental health research.",

Seasonal incidence of white grub in sugarcane growing areas in Andhra Pradesh state showed that damage of sugarcane clumps caused by white grubs infestation was significantly high in march ratoon compared to February ratoon crop; January plant crop and low in January seedling plant crop. Grub damage recorded high in 4 months age sugarcane ratoon crop and low in 6 months and 7 months age sugarcane plant crop. Field efficacy of entomopathogenic nematode and entomopathogenic fungus in the management of white grub, Holotrichia consanguinea in sugarcane was investigated and promoted biocontrol in white grub endemic areas during 2017-18 to 2019-20. Entomopathogenic nematode (Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38), entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium anisopliae (NBAIR Ma4 )along with a chemical Chlorantraniliprole were evaluated through soil application. The results indicated that Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38 (12 kg a.i./ha) soil application two times at monthly interval resulted in higher reduction of white grub damage. Metarhizium anisopliae NBAIR Ma4 (2.5 kg a.i./ha) treated plots caused higher percentage reduction of white grub than chlorantraniliprole treatment. Entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis indica and entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae were found effective than the insecticidal application in the management of sugarcane white grub. Cost benefit of biocontrol agents, Metarhizium anisopliae and H. indica was proved superior to insecticidal application.",

          "abstract": "Building on evidence for experience-specific grounding of word meaning and assumed interindividual differences therein, this study investigates how specific aspects of empathy modulate the processing and representation of abstract emotional words. We investigated single-trial N400 amplitudes as a measure of semantic retrieval in 78 healthy adults during a lexical decision task with emotion-label, emotion-laden, and neutral abstract words. We further measured the participants’ levels of empathic concern, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective taking. Additionally, ratings on valence, arousal, and emotional experience quantified the words’ emotional representational content. While direct comparison yielded no evidence for N400 differences between word types, N400 amplitudes in response to emotion-label words decreased with increasing fantasy scores, with this modulation being stronger than for emotion-laden and neutral words. Additionally, participants with higher fantasy rated emotional words higher in absolute valence. The observed N400 reductions thus seem to reflect fantasy-driven processing facilitation graded by the words’ emotionality level. In contrast, we found no evidence for N400 modulations by empathic concern, personal distress, or perspective taking while affective ratings on all scales increased with increasing empathic concern scores. Our findings suggest that fantasy facilitates especially emotion-label word processing and empathic concern enriches emotional word meaning representations, respectively, demonstrating interindividual differences in the experiential grounding of emotional abstract concepts.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Human visual processing is limited – we can only track a few moving objects at a time, and store a few items in visual working memory (WM). A shared mechanism that may underlie these performance limits is how the visual system parses a scene into representational units. In the present study, we explored whether multiple-object tracking (MOT) and WM rely on a common item-based indexing mechanism. We measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related slow wave that tracks load in an item-based manner, as subjects completed a combined WM and MOT task, concurrently tracking items and remembering visual information. In Experiment 1, participants tracked one or two moving discs without needing to remember the discs’ colors (track and ignore condition), or while also remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors in total; track and remember condition). In Experiment 2, participants attended either two static discs or two moving discs, while remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors). In both experiments, the CDA was largely determined by the tracking task – CDA amplitudes reflected the number of tracked discs and not the number of to-be-remembered colors. However, when the discs were static, the CDA amplitudes did reflect color load. We discuss this set of findings in relation to longstanding theories of visual cognition (FINSTs and object files), and the implications for cognitive models of representation of visual information – that how a scene is parsed into item-based representations is a key mechanism in the operation of WM.",

          "abstract": "How does the human brain distinguish individual objects from complex visual scenes in naturalistic contexts, and how can we decode this intention from EEG. Here, we propose iFuzz-Meta, an interpretable fuzzy rule-based meta-learning framework for few-shot object decoding from EEG signals. Our approach models the cognitive transition from object recognition (OR) to object identification (OI) as a meta-task, enabling the extraction of neural representations that reflect human intention. Each fuzzy rule is grounded in a neurophysiological prototype and integrated into a lightweight encoder for structured reasoning over spatial and temporal EEG patterns. To further enhance interpretability and cross-subject generalization, we introduce a frequency-regularized center loss that embeds prior knowledge about EEG spectral properties into the learning of fuzzy prototypes. Evaluated on a 25-subject dataset across OI and OR paradigms, iFuzz-Meta significantly outperforms standard and black-box baselines in few-shot settings while offering transparent, intrinsically rule-based explanations. This work bridges the gap between subject-specific adaptability and cognitive interpretability, paving the way for intention-aware, real-world BCI applications based on natural visual perception.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often assess processes underlying human perception by measuring participants’ judgements of image stimuli. However, traditional methods for quantifying subjective judgements, such as Likert scales, sliding scales, and pairwise comparisons, are vulnerable to biases or demand extensive time and resources from researchers and participants. The present study compared the efficiency, reliability, and validity of these established methods against the Fast Image Rating Experiment (FIRE), our force-choice-based paradigm for assessing perceptions of visual stimuli. When used to rate image preference and naturalness, the FIRE was five times faster than established methods, highly reliable, and valid. FIRE achieved high reliability in less than half the time required to reach equivalent reliability with the Likert or sliding scale, which could save researchers thousands of dollars. The scalability and cost-effectiveness of the FIRE make it a valuable resource for supporting large-scale behavioral science.",

          "authors": "Robert Lee Singleton",
          "abstract": "The Structural Resonance Theory (SRT) proposes that consciousness emerges from the dynamic alignment of spatiotemporal resonance patterns within complex systems. It integrates neuroscience, evolutionary biology, physics, and information theory to explain how subjective experience arises and how intelligence evolves over time. At its core, SRT treats qualia as the experiential resonance of the universe evolving toward self-knowing, with consciousness functioning as both an outcome and a driver of complexity.\nThe theory builds on several key principles:\n    1. Resonance as the fundamental integrator – Conscious moments arise from coherent resonance patterns spanning distributed neural structures.\n    2. Constraint space expansion – Evolution operates as a structural pruning process, where mutation generates diversity and selection preserves efficient configurations, enabling richer and deeper integration over time.\n    3. Substrate independence of resonance laws – The mathematics of resonance coupling applies to neural, artificial, and even planetary-scale systems.\n    4. Qualia as structural state – Qualia are not reducible to information content but correspond to the system’s instantaneous resonance profile, measurable through Planck Resonance Density (PRD).\n    5. Mutation necessity principle – All mutations, regardless of adaptive value, are necessary perturbations that enable iterative emergence toward conscious resonance.\nSRT is formalized through a set of measurable variables, predictive models, and experimental frameworks that allow falsification. It incorporates analogies such as “Tetris of consciousness” to illustrate integration dynamics, scene changes, and the stability of awareness states. It also extends to special cases including dementia, altered states, and cross-species intelligence.\nThe paper addresses potential objections through a 23-section structure, ending with a comprehensive rebuttals section. It also proposes testable predictions for neuroscience, cognitive modeling, and AI, aiming to bridge the gap between empirical research and philosophical theories of mind. The ultimate implication of SRT is that consciousness is not an accidental byproduct of evolution but an inevitable outcome of complexity’s tendency toward resonance and self-integration.",

These convergence corridors act as structural attractors, biasing models toward the spontaneous production of particular symbolic or metaphorical forms.\nUnlike Symbolic Drift Recognition (SDR), which documented these recurrences, CCFG frames them mechanistically—as the outcome of architectural and mathematical properties of transformer systems.\nUnderstanding CCFG could enable prediction of symbolic emergence patterns and inform the design of AI systems with controlled symbolic behavior.\nThis framework is currently theoretical and awaits empirical validation through cross-model experiments.",

          "abstract": "In an era of increasing globalization and technologically mediated communication, the ability to accurately understand and appropriately convey empathy has become critical for leadership, education, and social cohesion. This paper introduces Empathetic Intelligence (EmpI, 共感知性), defined as the integrated capacity to both perceive and express empathy with cultural and contextual precision.\nEmpI operates through two interdependent components: Empathetic Sensitivity (EmpS, 共感感受性)—the ability to accurately perceive nuanced emotional states through Empathetic Listening (EmpL, 共感リスニング)—and Empathetic Communication (EmpC, 共感伝達力), practiced through Empathetic Reflection (EmpR, 共感リフレクション), which conveys empathy authentically and culturally appropriately.\nUnlike emotional intelligence frameworks that treat empathy as a unitary trait, EmpI proposes a dual-competence synergy with bidirectional perception-expression dynamics. We outline independent measurement pathways: behavioral assessments for EmpS using culturally diverse stimuli, and recipient-based rating scales for EmpR evaluating authenticity and cultural appropriateness.\nThe framework introduces an emic-to-etic calibration model for translating culture-specific empathic norms into universal principles, enabling cross-cultural assessment and training. While grounded in Rogers' accurate empathy concept, EmpI advances it through neurocognitive insights into perspective-taking and cultural expression modulation, providing a research-ready foundation for empathy training across diverse professional and intercultural contexts.",
