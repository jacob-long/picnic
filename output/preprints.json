          "authors": "Priyam Jha",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has emerged as a significant challenge to the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital media. This paper presents a comparative literature review of eight leading deepfake detection methods, including Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks, PRNU-based Detection, Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Networks, Deep Learning-based Approaches, Transfer Learning models, Multimodal Detection techniques, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based frameworks. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and adaptability across benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and UADFV.\n\nThe analysis identifies the Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Network as the most reliable framework, achieving over 98% accuracy and strong generalization on uncompressed data. Ethical and societal implications — including privacy, fairness, and transparency — are discussed to promote responsible AI research. The paper concludes by outlining strategies for improvement and future directions, including real-time detection, multimodal fusion, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving architectures. This comparative review serves as a reference point for advancing the reliability and accountability of deepfake detection systems in modern digital forensics.",

          "title": "A Netnographic Study on Social Mediation in Online Conflict between Day6 Fans and Mecima Pro",
          "authors": "Yati Khalala",
          "abstract": "Conflicts between K-Pop fans and concert promoters in Indonesia are increasingly gaining attention in the digital age, which has accelerated the flow of information. One recent case is the dispute between MyDay, the name given to Day6 fans, and promoter Mecima Pro regarding the Day6 concert at the GBK Madya Stadium on May 3, 2025. This study aims to analyze the role of social mediation in resolving digital conflicts between fanbases and promoters. The method employed is qualitative, utilizing a netnographic approach, which involves observing social media activities, discussion forums, and official statements from the promoter. The results of the study indicate that social mediation occurs organically through the roles of community actors such as fanbase administrators, fandom leaders, and online media. Communal solidarity and public pressure are the primary factors driving the promoter's response. This study emphasizes the importance of two-way communication and mediation based on equality within the digital cultural context.",

          "title": "An Exploratory Study of Chatbot-Based Mindfulness for Mental Health Support",
          "authors": "Yiyi Wang; Norman A. S. Farb",
          "abstract": "Objective: Mental health concerns are rising, particularly among post-secondary students, who may lack access to traditional therapeutic resources due to barriers like long wait times and high costs. To help address these challenges, we explored the potential of large language model-based chatbots for supporting mental health and wellbeing in student populations.\n\nMethods: We conducted two studies, lasting one week and four weeks, to examine the effectiveness of chatbot interventions over different durations. Both studies compared two chatbot interventions—one mindfulness-focused and one value-focused—against an active check-in-only control condition. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in wellbeing through the mindfulness-to-meaning (MM) pathway, a process in which enhanced decentering, the ability to see one’s experience from a wider perspective, leads to improved positive reappraisal, the ability to find constructive and empowered interpretations of experience.\n\nResults: All conditions showed evidence of stress reduction. However, compared to the active control group, both intervention styles at both durations resulted in improved wellbeing via the MM pathway. This effect was primarily driven by significant improvements in decentering. For the longer duration only, we also observed enhanced reappraisal. \n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the potential of chatbot-based interventions to support the development of regulatory skills by leveraging the MM pathway to enhance mental health. Educational institutions and mental health providers might consider integrating such tools into scalable and accessible student support systems, addressing a broader and more diverse audience while promoting sustained wellbeing through skills development.",

          "authors": "Allison Pachunka; Jay Benson Jeffries; Lisa Karr; Lena Luck; Bryan Reiling; Doug Schultz; Jeffrey R Stevens",
          "abstract": "Interacting with animals can improve health and well-being across the lifespan. Some programs such as 4-H and FFA center around youth interacting with animals, potentially enhancing youth development. Mueller (2014) investigated whether these interactions and attitudes about animals influenced measures of positive youth development. The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened emotionality. Past research indicated that the biased interpretation of social situations (i.e., interpretation bias) might contribute to these aberrant affect dynamics in adolescents’ daily life. Social situations are, however, constantly changing. Therefore, the ability to flexibly revise social interpretations (i.e., interpretation flexibility) might be equally important as interpretation biases for explaining affective outcomes during adolescence. The present study examined whether interpretation bias and inflexibility predicted two major affect dynamics features (i.e., mean and standard deviation) in children and adolescents. At baseline, N = 154 children and adolescents (M = 12.81 years; 48.70% female; 49.35% male; 1.95% non-binary; 72.08% White) completed a task assessing bias and inflexibility in interpreting social situations. Then, for 28 days, participants rated their positive and negative affect. Results showed that inflexibility in revising positive and negative interpretations in light of disconfirming evidence predicted higher intensity of negative affect. When controlling for interpretation inflexibility, positive interpretation bias predicted higher positive affect, whereas negative interpretation bias was associated with more variable negative affect. The results emphasize the predictive utility of interpretation biases and inflexibility for daily affective experiences in youths.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as apathy or aggression. The present study uses longitudinal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to characterize different NPS trajectories, their association with cognitive impairment, and white matter microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles as a possible biomarker of NPS progression. \nMETHODS: We assessed the association of different trajectories of NPS identified though growth mixture models with cognitive decline and white matter microstructure changes over the course of two years. \nRESULTS: Four classes of NPS trajectories were identified in 785 individuals. These classes predicted cognitive decline over time but were unrelated to changes in the microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles in a subsample of 60 individuals for whom sufficient longitudinal neuroimaging data was available. \nDISCUSSION: There are substantial individual differences in NPS trajectories. Distinguishing classes of NPS trajectories is important to predict cognitive decline.",

          "authors": "Mirka Henninger; Jan Radek; Jean-Paul Snijder; Martin Pauly",
          "abstract": "Screening abstracts is a crucial yet labor-intensive step in research synthesis projects such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise an opportunity to streamline and automate this process. However, there is currently little experience or practical insight into how such automated workflows can be implemented in research practice. In this article, we illustrate an LLM-based abstract screening workflow using a set of human-rated abstracts from a recent meta-analysis. We describe how we developed and evaluated different prompting strategies and structured output formats, compared the performance of multiple LLMs, quantified model uncertainty, and automated the entire workflow within the R environment. We also provide R scripts and implementation guidance to support psychological researchers in adopting LLM-based workflows for research synthesis. Our comparisons show how different types of LLMs vary in accuracy relative to human raters, and how prompting strategies and hyperparameter settings affect model performance and uncertainty. We demonstrate that LLM-assisted screening can substantially reduce the time and cost of review preparation while maintaining accuracy comparable to human raters. At the same time, we emphasize that this work represents an initial step, and that continued refinement and validation are essential as LLM technologies and their applications continue to evolve rapidly.",

          "abstract": "Games offer a unique way to study human behavior by extending traditional lab-based research into more complex, naturalistic, yet highly controllable settings. A key feature of games is their potential to reframe failure as a learning opportunity, supposedly leading to persistent engagement and competence. This study empirically tested this idea by developing a platformer game in two versions: one with regular checkpoints (resulting in less negative consequences of failure) and one without (resulting in more negative consequences of failure, i.e., having to restart the level). Among 172 participants, those randomly assigned to the checkpoint condition completed more levels of the game on average, but were less committed to individual reward opportunities within each level. Importantly, they also reported significantly lower frustration and higher perceived competence, an essential predictor of intrinsic motivation, compared to participants in the condition without checkpoints. Subjective frustration of the basic need for competence partially mediated game-induced frustration, suggesting that reducing negative consequences of failure facilitates reframing failure as a learning opportunity. These findings illustrate how game design can reduce frustration and enhance motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers the first large-scale evaluation of whether school-level educational approaches that cultivate normative individual differences (i.e., virtues) are associate with academic progression. Using the most comprehensive longitudinal dataset available from the Department for Education, Study 1 analysed over 3,000 English secondary schools and three million pupils annually (2016–2024). Progress 8, the government’s value-added measure of GCSE attainment, provides a stringent test by controlling for prior ability and sociocultural background. Schools accredited with the Association for Character Education’s Quality Mark (QM) or Quality Mark Plus (QM+) consistently achieved higher Progress 8 scores, with QM+ schools in several years gaining more than half a GCSE grade per pupil averaged across subjects. Study 2 complements these findings through a national survey of QM and QM+ schools, illuminating perceived mechanisms linking character education to learning and wellbeing. The findings demonstrate robust, policy-relevant evidence that character education may meaningfully enhance academic development.",

          "abstract": "Would a penchant for animal cruelty influence how much someone is blamed for lying on a tax return? While extant literature shows that moral character evaluations can influence subsequent moral judgments, it is unclear whether this influence is domain-general or domain-specific. Does receiving information about any morally bad character trait increase blame, or only traits that are similar to the subsequent act?  In two experiments (preregistered; N=1320), we investigated how incidental character information influence moral and causal judgments. Participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more causal, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that moral character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments, challenging the view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act influence blame.",

          "abstract": "Technology plays a central role in shaping contemporary daily life and exerts a profound influence across social, economic, and cultural domains. This study aims to develop and validate instruments for assessing users’ attitudes toward technology use, with particular attention to older adults’ perceptions of its integration into their everyday lives. The research further seeks to explore the influence of technology on user and consumer experiences and to establish a conceptual framework for measuring attitudes toward technological adoption.\nThree primary objectives guided this research: (1) the development and validation of questionnaires designed to assess attitudes toward the use of technological means, particularly in the context of online services; (2) the collection of data to examine the association between age and attitudes toward technology; and (3) the exploration of the relationship between attitudes toward digital services and attitudes toward traditional, non-technological services. These issues are considered in the context of previous research, with renewed attention to the perceived distinctions between different types of services.\nThe data were collected through questionnaires adapted from previous studies, in which participants evaluated statements on a five-point Likert scale, where 5 indicated the highest level of agreement.\nThe findings of the study demonstrate high reliability across all measurement indicators. In the second experiment, age was negatively associated with attitudes toward online shopping, while showing a positive association with attitudes toward shopping in physical stores. The third experiment revealed a negative correlation between attitudes toward online and in-store shopping, consistent with prior research and reinforcing the stability of the assessment instruments employed in this study.",

          "authors": "Andrew Wang; Simon De Deyne; Meredith McKague; Andrew Perfors",
          "abstract": "The question of which words are the most central or important to a language has been explored in various ways. In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

          "authors": "Ulrike Basten; Rebecca Anik Rammensee; Rebekka Weygandt; Christian Fiebach",
          "abstract": "This study investigates intelligence-related differences in the adjustment of brain activity and connectivity to varying cognitive demands, testing for a moderation of an association between intelligence and neural efficiency by task difficulty. In 72 young adults (34 female, 38 male), fMRI brain activity changes during a decision-making task with five levels of difficulty were related to intelligence scores from a non-verbal matrix reasoning test. In fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions activated during task processing, we observed smaller increases in brain activity in more intelligent participants – independent of task difficulty. However, in two regions of the default mode network, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and left angular gyrus (AG), more intelligent participants showed greater decreases in activity with increasing task difficulty. Furthermore, with increasing difficulty, more intelligent participants showed greater increases in functional connectivity of DMPFC and AG. These findings suggest a more dynamic adjustment of neural processing to varying cognitive demands in more intelligent individuals. Particularly when it comes to more difficult tasks, more intelligent people seem to be better able to down-regulate activity in the brain's default mode network. Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings must be considered preliminary. While their interpretation should therefore be treated with caution, they suggest conceptually new avenues for replication in larger samples. As far as the observed processes reflect the suppression of task-unrelated neural processing and a better focus on the task at hand, they can potentially explain the general performance advantage of more intelligent individuals across various cognitive tasks.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Castro-Alvarez; Laura Francina Bringmann; Jason Back; Siwei Liu",
          "abstract": "Reliability is a key concept in psychology that has been broadly studied since the introduction of Cronbach's alpha, which is a measure of the internal consistency of a test. Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data.",

          "abstract": "Debates about adolescent online risks often overlook the lived realities of young people navigating structural adversity and digital inequality. This qualitative study explores how 20 adolescents in a low-income, semi-rural South African community navigate the double-edged nature of social media. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we show how offline violence, gendered power dynamics, and structural inequalities are entangled with online experiences, creating overlapping risks that amplify existing vulnerabilities. At the same time, social media is a source of entertainment, belonging, and glimpses of alternative futures, particularly for adolescents with personal smartphone access. Digital literacy in this context is largely informal and reactive, shaped by peers and trusted adults rather than formal education. These findings contribute to debates on adolescent online risks and digital inequality by showing how local contexts structure both the benefits and harms of social media as well as the forms of digital competence that develop. We argue that understanding adolescent digital life requires attention to structural adversity, everyday social dynamics, and the interdependence of online and offline worlds.",

Informed by the existing ESM literature, we illustrate our decision-making process while designing an ESM study on the temporal associations between momentary life meaning, eating disorder symptoms, and negative affect. While grounded in our specific research questions, this paper provides practical guidelines on how to decide among various methodological options for researchers across psychological fields. We outline key decisions, practical considerations, and challenges encountered during the study’s development. Our paper provides a practical checklist to support researchers in designing ESM studies from scratch and in reporting essential aspects in their manuscripts, promoting transparency and replicability.

          "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated barriers and facilitators to implementing, delivering, and participating in an enhanced smoking cessation service for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The service, delivered across four pilot sites in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) of England between April 2023 and March 2024, used a primary care referral model and a 20-week ‘cut down to quit’ approach combining behavioural and pharmacological support.\nMethods: A mixed methods approach was used, including analysis of aggregated recruitment and outcome data, coding documents for Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), a quantitative survey with purposively recruited service providers (n = 20), and qualitative interviews with service providers (n = 14) and service users (n = 4). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behaviour (COM-B) model informed survey and interview design and analysis. A purposively recruited Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) (n = 6) contributed to protocol development, study materials, and interpretation of findings.\nResults: In Pilot Sites A and B, nearly half of service users who set a quit plan had quit smoking at 28 days (~45%). Documentary analysis found the most common BCTs were pharmacological support, adding objects to the environment, and restructuring the environment. Survey findings indicated that providers had the capability, opportunity, motivation, and intention to deliver the service and found it acceptable, though perceptions of required effort varied. Interview findings showed that facilitators for service implementation were primarily linked to motivation (e.g., positive user feedback, staff motivation), whereas barriers were linked to capability (e.g., data recording) and opportunity (e.g., primary care links). For service delivery and participation, facilitators linked to capability (e.g., tailoring support, understanding social determinants) and motivation (e.g., benefits of quitting, goal setting).\nConclusions: Service delivery was perceived as effective due to flexibility and tailored support. Recommendations for improving service implementation should focus on strengthening primary care engagement and referral pathways, enhancing training and skills development for Stop Smoking Advisors, and improving data management systems and evidence gathering early in implementation. Future research should engage more service users and referrers to better understand barriers to service implementation and participation.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates predictors and outcomes of faith development, drawing on Fowler’s broad definition of faith as the search for meaning in life and the hierarchical typology of faith styles assessed through the Faith Development Interview (FDI). The sample comprised 324 two-wave longitudinal cases collected over two decades of mixed-method research in the USA and Germany, with an average interval of 7.39 years (SD = 4.34) between assessments. Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength. The findings further suggest that faith development and religiosity may follow different pathways, underscoring the need for future qualitative inquiry into the diverse biographical trajectories of faith development.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relations are fundamental in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal aspects of the social self can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. We hypothesized that individual differences in sociality, in particular friendships and loneliness, depend not only on interpersonal factors, but also on intrapersonal personality features. We administered a comprehensive set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Relational outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis confirmed the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results showed that intrapersonal traits exert a critical influence on friendships and loneliness of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and COVID-19 pandemic effects. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. Our study empirically supports a central role of self-concept in individual sociality. These findings provide a novel perspective on low social life quality combined with possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. The results also offer potential contributions to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Background. Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that is robustly linked to emotional disorders yet remains underexplored in multiple sclerosis (MS), with no studies to date addressing individual differences in emotion regulation difficulties in this population. To address this gap, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of emotion regulation difficulties in an MS sample. \n\nMethods. Participants were 259 people with MS (Mage = 42.79, 78.8% female). Participants completed an online survey measuring emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation was specified as the indicator variable in the LPA, with the additional measures of depression and anxiety utilised to validate the identified profiles.\n\nResults. Three emotion regulation profiles were identified: low impairment (n = 66, 25.48%) characterised by minimal difficulties regulating negative emotions across all domains; global dysregulation (n = 71, 27.41%) characterised by pronounced difficulties in all domains; and goal-impaired regulators (n = 122, 47.10%) characterised by distinct challenges maintaining goal-directed behaviours. Individuals in the global dysregulation profile endorsed the greatest symptom severity on measures of depression and PTSD but reported comparable levels of GAD and health anxiety relative to the goal-impaired regulators.\n\nConclusion. People with MS exhibit distinct emotion regulation profiles, revealing critical subgroups with varying psychological needs. Tailoring psychological assessments and treatments to these profiles can enhance the management of depression and anxiety and potentially improve disease outcomes in people with MS.",

However, research findings on this topic are sometimes inconsistent or conflicting, probably due to diverse conceptualisations of social support components and heterogeneous measures of social support. This narrative review identifies and describes core types of functional social support relevant to mental health and wellbeing. Three literature searches across three databases were used to select papers reporting taxonomies of social support, social support questionnaires, and reviews of social support. A taxonomy of social support types was constructed using inductive qualitative synthesis. Five core types of social support were identified and described: (1) emotional support, (2) social contact and companionship, (3) belonging support, (4) information and guidance support, and (5) tangible support. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently identified. Core elements of emotional support are opportunities for confiding provided by sympathetic listening and caring, which included affectionate support and esteem support. These five types of social support provide a robust set of criteria for informing the development of social support interventions and assessing the adequacy of social support measures.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

This mixed-methods study combines two survey datasets (N₁ = 69; N₂ = 44) with fifteen expert interviews to examine the cognitive, affective, and professional determinants of AI trust. Quantitative analyses indicate that prior AI experience, perceived transparency, and emotional comfort predict willingness to trust AI-assisted decision-making, while accountability is consistently attributed to humans. Qualitative analysis identifies seven recurring themes: emotional reasoning, meta-cognition, AI-augmented creativity and innovation, algorithms codifying injustice, radical skepticism, heuristics and cognitive biases, and algorithmic transparency. Experts emphasized that AI functions as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment. Together, these findings highlight that trust in AI emerges through interactional, cognitive, and affective processes, underscoring the importance of explainable, ethically aligned, and human-centered AI design.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 Haredi Attitudes Survey presents a comprehensive empirical portrait of contemporary ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) society in Israel, exploring how its members navigate the tension between religious identity and civic belonging. Conducted among 429 respondents from all major Haredi subgroups, the survey examined attitudes toward education, employment, military service, political representation, and collective identity. Findings depict a society marked by bounded pragmatism: gradual behavioral adaptation without ideological rupture. Economic participation and professional education are increasingly accepted, driven by necessity rather than by ideological change. Core studies and male academic education remain sensitive identity boundaries, while female higher education has become normatively accepted. Opposition to military conscription remains widespread and morally grounded, viewing Torah study as an equivalent national contribution. Support for adapted service is highly limited, mainly to younger, modern, and more integrated respondents, with rabbinic authority continuing to define permissible compromise. In the domain of identity and belonging, most respondents define themselves as conservative yet acknowledge collective change towards moderna. A large segment locates itself between conservatism and modernity, signaling hybrid identities that reinterpret change as continuity. Political attitudes mirror this moral logic—trust in existing parties is moderate, but there is cautious openness to new “national Haredi” frameworks. Together, the data illustrate a community balancing adaptation and preservation through meaning reconstruction rather than ideological reversal. The Haredi public does not deny change—it reframes it as fidelity. In doing so, it offers a vivid case of collective moral regulation under social pressure, exemplifying how identity systems sustain coherence through reinterpretation rather than transformation.",

Studies have highlighted the importance of therapeutic support, but questions remain about the type of effective support and its specific contribution. \nAims:\tWe examined the contribution of therapeutic context and amount of perceived support within the therapeutic context to the relationship between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and psychological outcomes. \nMethods:\tAn online survey was conducted in an international sample (N = 1,867) of psychedelic users. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine moderating roles of therapeutic context and support on presumed links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes. \nResults:\tData generally supported theorized associations among stressful life events, challenging psychedelic experiences, therapeutic context/support, and psychological outcomes. Therapeutic context mitigated associations of stressful life events with challenging experiences and of challenging experiences with coping, but not other associations. Interaction effects indicated that degree of therapeutic support moderated the association of challenging experiences with valence, impact on coping, and impact on well-being. In other regression models, therapeutic support maintained significant independent effects, but interaction effects were not found.  \nConclusion:\tTherapeutic context and degree of therapeutic support was found to moderate links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes.

We present evidence that these mappings arise from a combination of statistical learning, magnitude matching, valence matching, and semantic mediation, involving an interplay between perception and conception.

Only 4.1% of tests (157 / 3,760) supported significant sex-differentiated manifestations of ADHD or its individual symptoms. ADHD and some of its symptoms (e.g., inattentive, impulsive, hyperactive) were more strongly associated with externalizing in boys than girls, but ADHD and other symptoms (i.e., inattentive, acted young) were also more associated with internalizing and thought problems in boys than girls.

          "abstract": "Abstract: Background: Traditional programmes across Sub-Saharan Africa have struggled to cultivate the agency and work-ready competences graduates need to meaningfully address the continent’s development priorities. Purpose: This study critically examines African Leadership University’s mission-driven, hybrid model, asking whether organising learning around personally defined “missions” rather than disciplinary majors measurably enhances student agency and post-graduation impact. Design/methodology/approach: A secondary, mixed-methods evaluation triangulated (i) ALU’s alumni-outcomes dataset covering 1,741 graduates from 2017-2024, (ii) continental statistics from UNESCO, Afrobarometer and the World Bank, and (iii) a systematic literature and policy review. Quantitative indicators were juxtaposed with thematic analysis of policy texts to assess alignment between institutional practice and regional reform agendas. Findings: ALU graduates achieved a 75% placement rate within six months (continental median ≈ 65 %), with 25–33 % founding ventures that collectively [i.e including students] generated more than 52,317 jobs—an estimated 121:1 job-creation multiplier. Ninety-five percent of employed alumni remained on the continent, countering “brain drain”. Qualitative evidence reveals heightened autonomy, intrinsic motivation and leadership competence attributable to a learning design that blends online mastery modules with mentored, real-world projects. Originality/value: By integrating Self-Determination Theory with the emergent Mission-Driven Learning Theory, the paper offers a falsifiable conceptual model in which mission clarity and mission-competence alignment jointly mediate the link between autonomy-supportive environments and graduate impact. The findings provide policy-relevant evidence that flexible accreditation “sandboxes” could mainstream mission-driven pedagogy and accelerate Africa’s skills revolution. For students who explicitly anchor their life missions in discipleship, success is defined as faithful stewardship and fruitfulness under God’s will rather than credential accumulation. Our analysis therefore treats alignment to a discerned vocation as both a motivational mechanism and a normative success criterion, consistent with Christian Scripture and with the model’s values-based element. Practical implications: Universities can embed mission-definition modules, mandatory internships and portfolio-based assessment to replicate key elements of the model, while governments should create regulatory space for purpose-centred curricular innovation.",

          "authors": "Johanna Prugger; Simone Kühn",
          "abstract": "Environmental psychology has extensively documented the restorative effects of nature: the recovery of cognitive resources and emotional well-being following stress or fatigue. Yet, the field may have overlooked instorative effects, where nature enhances functioning from a neutral baseline without prior depletion. We reviewed 54 studies (61 experiments, 19962024) investigating nature versus urban exposure effects on cognition, affect, and perceived restoration. Studies were categorized as explicit stressor (deliberate pre-exposure stress induction), implicit stressor (pre-exposure assessments likely inducing fatigue), or instorative (no prior stressor/assessment). Using an iterative, data-driven approach inspired by Grounded Theory, we analyzed study characteristics, exposure types, and the proportion reporting beneficial effects. Restorative studies vastly outnumbered instorative studies (45 vs. 8), revealing substantial research bias. Despite limited representation, instorative studies demonstrated high success rates: all cognition studies reported positive effects, while two-thirds examining affect showed benefits. Explicit stressor studies showed stronger effects than implicit stressor studies, suggesting dose-response relationships. Differentiating between instorative and restorative effects remains difficult, as no validated tools specifically assess instoration. The widely used Perceived Restorativeness Scale primarily measures general environmental benefits, conflating restoration and instoration. Studies predominantly employed young, Western samples and brief laboratory exposures, limiting ecological validity. The capacity of nature to enhance, rather than merely restore, functioning is underexplored. Future research should investigate instorative effects using ecologically valid paradigms with neutral baselines, refined theoretical models, standardized terminology, and appropriate questionnaires that distinguish between instorative and restorative effects.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Interpreting whether someone is showing romantic or sexual interest can be challenging, particularly when cues are ambiguous or when attention is influenced by visceral states such as physiological or emotional arousal. Building on previous findings linking sexual arousal to men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) when assessing women’s flirtatious intent, the present preregistered online study examined whether a similar cue-based judgment bias would emerge under nonsexual arousal. Using a key-press paradigm, heterosexual men (N = 275) completed a two-stage selection task in which they chose which of two women appeared more likely to be flirting with them. Stimuli were drawn from a validated image set and varied in global sexual (clothing style) and specific affective (facial expression) cues. Cue combinations were either congruent, potentially facilitating selection, or incongruent, thereby increasing selection difficulty. Between the two measurements, participants listened to a vividly narrated audio recording designed to elicit positively valenced nonsexual arousal. Reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) served as behavioral indicators of OGC. Consistent with previous research, participants showed longer RTs and higher ERs in incongruent compared to congruent trials, indicating higher selection difficulty in ambiguous contexts. However, nonsexual arousal did not reproduce the pronounced behavioral response pattern that had been observed under sexual arousal. The findings suggest that sexual arousal exerts unique effects on cue weighting in social judgments, highlighting the importance of specifying boundary conditions under which arousal alters cognitive processing.",

Although terminology such as neurodivergent and neurodiverse has become increasingly common, little empirical research has examined how these and related terms are perceived within and across neurodivergent communities. This exploratory study surveyed 740 adults with a diagnosis of autism (n = 189), ADHD (n = 190), dyslexia (n = 179), or co-occurring Autism+ADHD (n = 182) from the United Kingdom and United States to assess preferences, offensiveness, acceptability, and self-use of six neurodiversity-related terms. Participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse as the most preferred, least offensive, and most acceptable, whereas neurominority and neurospicy were least endorsed. The overall order of preferences was largely consistent across diagnostic groups, gender identities, and countries, though group-level differences emerged for specific terms. Dyslexic participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse less positively than other groups, while the Autism+ADHD group expressed the strongest endorsement of neurodivergent. Participants reported infrequent self-use of these labels, suggesting that while certain terms are broadly acceptable, they may not yet serve as primary identity markers. Overall, findings indicate strong agreement, with neurodivergent emerging as the most accepted term.",

Despite the growing body of research in cognitive, affective, neuropsychological, and body-oriented domains, existing approaches remain fragmented and narrowly specialized. Cognitive models (Gross, Barrett) focus on interpretation and reappraisal, while somatic and polyvagal theories (Porges, van der Kolk) emphasize physiological regulation but overlook the symbolic and meaning-making dimensions.\nThe analysis of 25 key sources (1995–2024) demonstrates the absence of a unified, integrative model that links the bodily, emotional, and semantic levels of the psyche within a single structural framework.\nThe article substantiates the necessity of developing a comprehensive conceptual system that combines the advantages of cognitive, emotional, and bodily approaches and provides a universal algorithm for analyzing and transforming emotional experience.",

          "abstract": "Peer review is central to the credibility and advancement of science, yet it has long been shaped by exclusionary practices that narrow who participates, what counts as evidence, and which questions are seen as worth asking. This paper delineates the anatomy of a positive peer review in psychology, emphasizing clarity, structure, consistency, specificity, constructive tone, vigilance against bias, integrity, relevance, timeliness, and place-centeredness. Drawing on metascientific principles, we synthesize practical guidance for reviewers, editors, and authors, including the use of structured review prompts, explicit checks for analytic flexibility and adequacy of power, attention to sampling frames and context, and expectations for sharing data, code, and materials when ethically feasible. We also outline editorial policies that realign incentives toward inclusion and rigor, such as adopting formats that foreground methods and transparency, implementing calibrated decision criteria, and providing developmental feedback that supports authors at different stages and from diverse settings. Finally, we propose concrete steps for training, recognition, and accountability in review, along with indicators that departments, journals, and societies can track to monitor progress. Taken together, these practices reposition peer review as a tool for equity and quality in psychological science and as a lever for improving how research is disseminated.",

          "abstract": "Psychology faces crises of theory and measurement, where poorly specified constructs hinder the validity of measurement instruments. This article turns prior pleas to transparently explicate comprehensive construct definitions and accompanying measurement instructions into practice, using self-efficacy as an exemplary case. Drawing primarily on Bandura’s conceptualization, we explicate the key elements distinguishing self-efficacy from related constructs and examine implications for measurement. More importantly, this is the first time to introduce Narrative Response Models (NRMs) as a tool to describe and study how hypothesized processes that need to occur allow inferences about a psychological construct from the registered responses to an item used to assess that construct (in this case self-efficacy). Without this, there is no reason to assume the responses can tell anything about the construct: the item is invalid. Because NRMs as a tool were developed to justify confidence in the validity of an item, they explicate many underlying assumptions that warrant further investigation. In the case of self-efficacy, for example, the retrieval of gist traces and the simulation of what it takes to engage in the behaviour of interest. As such, NRMs provide scaffolding for the systematic study of a measurement instrument’s validity.",

Attentional effort in a task can vary based on how an individual\nsubjectively perceives the task context. However, both attention exertion and subjective\ncontext perception are not directly observable. We present a methodology for estimating a\nstructural model that explicitly incorporates subjective models of context perception and\nattention allocation policies. To our knowledge, this is the first methodology to estimate a\nstructural model of attentional effort dynamics.\nMethod. A Bayesian model of attentional allocation that integrates subjective\nperceptions of task-relevant context is developed. An estimation methodology based upon\nexpectation-maximization algorithm is proposed to uncover how the allocation of\nattentional effort is adapted to subjectively perceived context.\nResults. The methodology is applied to a naturalistic dataset of Major League Baseball\numpire decisions, revealing context perception (i.e. how umpires infer game situations) and\nattention allocation policy (i.e. how umpires adjust attentional effort). Model reveals that\numpires adjust attentional effort based on inferred game criticality and status bias.\nConclusion. This work advances understanding of vigilance failure by providing a\nstructural account for contextual inference determines attentional effort.

          "abstract": "Many users of hearing aids report challenges when listening to music. In the future, it may be possible to develop hearing aids that monitor brain activity in real-time and adapt their output to the volitions of the user. In music, this could mean selectively amplifying the sound of the instrument the listener wants to hear. The first steps in this research is to determine whether machine learning can be used to identify which instrument an individual is listening to based only on a brief EEG signal. In this work, participants were presented with a series of brief tones that varied in timbre (Trombone, Clarinet, Cello, Piano and Pure Tone) while their ongoing EEG was recorded from 73 electrodes. To distinguish between EEG responses to the five different musical instruments, we investigated the use of three different classifiers – Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gradient Boosting (GB), and k-NN, and four different sets of features – raw EEG, ERP-based features, harmonics-based features and regularity-based features. N1 and P2 components of the ERP were analyzed for differences between instruments. All three classifiers performed significantly above chance (i.e., approximately 20% for 5 classes) when trained using the raw EEG features (LDA: 37%, GB: 35%, k-NN: 26%). It may be possible to improve these results with more advanced classification algorithms or different transformations of features. Statistical analysis found the Cello to have contributed to the largest P2 amplitude and Pure Tone to the smallest, and for Cello to have contributed to the earliest N1 latency and Clarinet the latest.",

Yet, little is known about how AI compares to humans in detecting misinformation. To address this question, two preregistered studies compared 15 major AI chatbots to human participants (N = 2,461) with regards to three factors (i.e., truth discernment, acceptance threshold, slant bias) in the detection of political misinformation (Exp. 1) and misinformation about vaccines (Exp. 2). The results show that, for both topics, AI chatbots discerned true from false information with much greater accuracy than U.S. Democrats and Republicans (political misinformation, Exp. 1) and human participants with favorable, unfavorable, or neutral vaccine attitudes (vaccine misinformation, Exp. 2). AI chatbots also outperformed the “wisdom of crowds”, an approach that has been shown to approximate veracity judgments of professional fact-checkers. At the same time, many AI chatbots showed large biases comparable to those of human participants, showing tendencies to accept or reject information regardless of veracity and tendencies to favor information with a certain slant. Overall, AI chatbots showed large variation in all three factors of misinformation detection. The results challenge conceptions of AI chatbots as hallucinating lie-machines, while drawing attention to biases and large differences between chatbots.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive science of religion has predominantly framed ritual as goal-demoted and causally opaque, serving primarily affiliative functions. This paper challenges this dominant framework, arguing that it fails to account for magical rituals, which are explicitly goal-oriented from the practitioner's perspective. I propose the \"folk-technology model,\" which treats magic not as symbolic or opaque action but as an instrumental, problem-solving practice. The paper critiques the concept of \"irresolvable causal opacity\" by presenting three lines of evidence: first, the natural/supernatural dichotomy that underpins the concept of irresolvability is a modern Western construct often absent in the societies in question; second, many magical practices are underpinned by detailed, if scientifically inaccurate, causal theories; and third, the apparent lack of articulated theory among laypeople often reflects practical knowledge and a social distribution of expertise rather than inherent opacity. The folk-technology model is further supported by widespread ethnographic evidence of instrumental tinkering, efficacy testing, and pragmatic adaptation in practices ranging from Azande oracles and Melanesian cargo cults to contemporary AI divination. This reframing challenges classic dichotomies between technical and performative action, generates novel, testable predictions about the structure of magical systems, and revitalizes intellectualist theories of magic within a modern cognitive and (cultural) evolutionary context.",

          "authors": "Chun Ho Choi; Sin Man Kwan",
          "abstract": "Advanced societies face a paradox: unprecedented abundance coincides with declining motivation, fertility, and social engagement (Easterlin, 1995). Conventional explanations—economic stress, education, gender equality, and value shifts—describe outcomes but not the underlying regulatory mechanism linking individual motivation to civilizational trends. Existing theories remain siloed: neuroscience explains reward processing in individual brains, while demography documents population-level changes, yet no framework connects these scales of analysis (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Schultz, 2016).\nWe propose Chois’ Theory of Evolutionary Homeostasis (CTEH), which positions dopamine as the necessary starting point for modeling motivational transmission. This is not a reductionist claim, but a recognition that any theory of motivation must begin with the neurochemical that encodes the question, “Is this worth the effort?” (Volkow et al., 2011). CTEH’s eight tenets describe how dopaminergic adaptation to abundance propagates through cultural learning to produce civilizational cycles of motivation, fertility, and renewal.\nThe framework’s key innovation lies in defining the cultural–neurobiological interface of how individual reward sensitivity scales to population patterns through social learning and institutional amplification (Montague et al., 2006). Sustained abundance elevates dopamine baselines, dulling reward sensitivity and shifting behavior from effort-based striving to passive consumption and artificial stimulation (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016). As desensitization spreads, motivation wanes, fertility declines, and crisis restores contrast and renewal (Becker et al., 2023).\nWe validate this multi-scale model using fertility as the primary gateway, owing to robust demographic data and its direct neuroendocrine linkage to reward systems (Eisenegger et al., 2011; Elson et al., 2024). However, the same regulatory principles extend to disengagement in work, education, and relationships. Ultimately, this framework reframes societal decline as a predictable process of homeostatic regulation, suggesting that interventions should focus on restoring motivational contrast, not merely increasing material resources.",

We analyse which internal cues influence confidence and accuracy, and how the consistency of cues influences confidence, accuracy, and participants changing their answers. Confidence judgements were not sensitive to belief-logic conflict when other cues were accounted for, contrary to prior research. Instead, overall cue consistency was more important for determining confidence and response changes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current dual process accounts of reasoning.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The US is facing a well-documented caregiving crisis, with more aging adults requiring informal caregiving at home and fewer young people available to support them. This paper estimates the current economic value of care provided by unpaid adolescents (ages 10 to 17) to family members who are chronically ill, disabled, or facing aging-related decline.\nMethods: We leverage large-scale, national datasets to estimate the economic value of informal caregiving provided by adolescents nationally and at the state level. \nResults: We estimate that adolescents provide by $15.01 billion (range = $5.38 to $41.63 billion) worth of informal caregiving work nationally. These estimates correspond to up to 8.86% of the $470 billion value of informal unpaid caregiving by adults, and up to 1.09% of the US total health care expenditure. State-specific estimates show substantial variability. \nDiscussion: Adolescents contribute substantially to the annual US economy by providing informal unpaid caregiving for their families. This information can inform the design of targeted polices and programs to support adolescents’ health and the health of the family members they care for. \nImplications and Contribution. This study highlights the substantial informal family caregiving adolescents provide to the US economy. We estimate adolescents contribute $15.01B in annual caregiving services, with implications for public health. Supporting caregiving adolescents and their families is crucial given the scope and impact of their work, and the shortage of family caregivers in the US.",

Across two preregistered survey experiments with 5,000 U.S. respondents, we find that defection rates remain consistent across local, state, and federal races, regardless of the number or type of violations. These findings suggest two interpretations: optimistically, voters are not more forgiving of norm violations in lower-level elections; pessimistically, even where the stakes appear lower, voters are also no more likely to hold norm violators accountable. Our results are consistent with the nationalization of voting behavior and the risk of a candidate pipeline that enables norm violators to rise unchecked.",

          "abstract": "Context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice are pervasive and yet, paradoxically, elusive at the same time. For example, simple changes to the spatial layout of alternatives on the screen can nullify or reverse the effects. Despite the success of dynamic decision models in explaining the occurrence of context effects, a coherent theory for understanding their elusiveness is currently lacking. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that relies on attention modulated comparisons to explain the elusive nature of context effects. We show via simulation that our model produces the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects simply by assuming that more time is spent comparing alternatives that are more similar. However, when more time is spent comparing dissimilar alternatives, model simulations reveal a reversal of the attraction and compromise effects. The empirical support for this model-based prediction is assessed by manipulating similarity-based attention in separate experiments for the three context effects (total N = 887). Further, by allowing the spatial organization of information to constrain the attention process, the model can explain changes in context effects induced by display layout. We show that the model's spatial attention mechanism allows it to capture presentation order effects in a reanalysis of previously published data. Finally, we develop a continuous approximation of the full model that permits fitting of choices and response times. In summary, the proposed framework provides a new tool for understanding not only the existence of context effects in choice, but also the attentional factors that lead to null or reversed context effects.",

Sentence completions were collected in two online studies in which participants completed sentence beginnings with a single-word response after either hearing (auditory sample, N = 133) or reading (visual sample, N = 98) the sentence beginning. All responses were manually preprocessed to correct typos and spelling mistakes and to label grammatical errors, proper nouns, and singular and plural variants of the same response. In addition to the sentence norms, we provide trial-level data with participant-level demographic information and subclinical autistic and schizotypal trait measures. Together with open access R-Scripts or our webtool, this allows for tailoring the cleaning and norming steps to integrate individual difference measures. For a subset of 479 sentence beginnings, the database also includes professional audio recordings of sentence beginnings which can be flexibly combined with 531 recordings of unique sentence-final words and implemented in auditory language paradigms.

Previous literature shows that such phonetic learning is often speaker-specific for certain speech sounds (e.g., fricatives) --- it does not transfer to novel speakers, possibly because fricatives contain spectral properties that cue speaker identity. However, recent research shows that  transfer to a novel sound contrast can occur within a single speaker, suggesting that there is room for transfer of learning to a novel speaker with a sufficiently similar pronunciation. This study examines the transfer of phonetic learning for an atypical fricative pronunciation to novel speakers, focusing on the mechanisms that underlie such perceptual adaptation. Results of a series of experiments show that transfer of phonetic learning can occur to both novel speakers and novel phonetic contrasts. Results suggest that listeners may use a more targeted mechanism when generalizing learning to novel speakers, with acoustic similarity being a possible predictor of learning transfer.",

          "authors": "Dave Kenneth Tayao Cayado; Kathleen Rastle",
          "abstract": "The majority of words across the world’s languages are composed of smaller meaningful units called morphemes (e.g., mis-trust-ful-ness). Research over the past 50 years has shown that such words are processed through morphological analysis—the decomposition of complex words into their meaningful subparts. While psycholinguistics has made significant progress in understanding this process during reading, most evidence comes from a narrow range of languages and morphological types. In this paper, we quantify linguistic and typological diversity in morphological processing and acquisition research from 1975 to 2025. Articles were coded for language(s), morphological type(s), participant type, and publication year. Our survey revealed that about 40% of the studies come from English and about 74% come from Indo-European languages (e.g., French, Spanish, German). We also found that about 53% of the studies focused on suffixation, the most frequent morphological process in English. We argue that this narrow scope limits theoretical progress. Many languages form complex words through reduplication, infixation, circumfixation or nonlinear morphology that differ structurally from English suffixation, and that pose learning and processing challenges that would not arise in English.

          "authors": "Ashish Kumar Sahoo; Steven Marc Weisberg",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation requires learning environments larger than what can be perceived at one time, requiring the integration of distinct episodes into one representation. Modern theories postulate hierarchical models of space, in which environments are mentally segmented, allowing more precise navigation within subregions and less precise strategies across them. But how does space become segmented into subregions? Segmentation, a component of many domains in human cognition, is the process by which a continuous stream of input is divided into chunks. In spatial navigation, segmentation often leverages natural divisions, like rivers or highways. Here, we hypothesize that temporal segmentation, a powerful organizer of information thought to support event cognition (Zacks &amp; Swallow, 2007), could play a role in segmenting space as well. To test this hypothesis, in a carefully controlled virtual environment experiment, participants learned landmarks around a square virtual environment in two temporally separated sessions designed to elicit temporal divisions during learning while controlling other factors. We then queried participants’ spatial (and non-spatial) memories for evidence of temporal segmentation across multiple behavioral measures. We found a gradient of temporal segmentation effects: measures more likely to depend on time, like free recall and distance judgments, were more affected by temporal segmentation, while measures more likely to depend on space (pointing judgments and maps) were less affected. Results support the notion that temporal segmentation is task-dependent, with variable effects on spatial memory. We interpret our findings in the context of theories of hippocampal encoding of space and time.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the association between structural properties of the human brain and individual differences in behavior is an ongoing endeavor, challenged by the brain’s complexity. Past approaches, limited by simplistic neural structure measures like brain volume or cortical thickness, have given way to more advanced modeling approaches. Empirical evidence using these simpler metrics occasionally shows that hippocampal structure relates to individual variation in spatial navigation ability, particularly for older individuals or for expert navigators (like London taxi drivers). Yet high-powered, pre-registered studies in typical younger adults revealed no association between hippocampal volume and navigation ability. Here, we follow a data-driven approach developing and comparing deep learning methods (graph convolution neural networks, GCNN; 3DCNN) to analyze whether complex aspects of brain structure predict spatial navigation ability in young populations. To that end, we trained GCNNs and 3DCNNs on a T1 MRI dataset (N=90) to predict navigational ability as measured by an objective virtual reality test of spatial memory in which participants created as accurate a map as they could of a highly realistic virtual environment. Across all approaches, we found weak predictive value in held-out test data, despite good fits to training data. These results could indicate the need for much larger datasets, including more comprehensive behavioral measures (as this study was limited to one measure) to improve predictability but may also support the notion that hippocampal structural features may not be a primary factor associated with navigation ability in healthy younger adults.",

          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

While school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) offers a scalable prevention approach with broad reach, evidence of its effectiveness is mixed, and there is a compelling case for a more personalized approach to prevention.\n\nObjective: To develop a data-driven algorithm from baseline characteristics to predict which adolescents are most likely to benefit from SBMT.\n\nDesign: Secondary analysis of the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016-2018. School-level nested cross-validation was used to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting individualized benefit from SBMT.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included. Students had to be enrolled in participating schools with parental consent and student assent. The sample was 55% female, 76% White ethnicity, with mean age 12.2 years.\n\nInterventions: SBMT teaching core mindfulness skills through psychoeducation, class discussion, and practices, compared to standard social-emotional learning (teaching-as-usual; TAU).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Change in depressive symptoms from pre- to post-intervention measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Causal forest (CF) and elastic net regression (ENR) models computed Personalized Advantage Index scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: CF showed acceptable calibration (mean Best Linear Predictor slope = 0.78, SE = 0.15), while ENR demonstrated modest predictive performance (r = 0.29; R² = 0.09; RMSE = 10.3). Both the CF and ENR models identified a subset of adolescents predicted to benefit from SBMT, but group differences in outcomes were negligible (CF: d = 0.07, p = .007; ENR: d = 0.08, p = .004). Top predictive features from the CF model were symptom severity (e.g., low-to-moderate depression and anxiety predicted greater SBMT benefit) and several school factors with non-linear patterns. ENR emphasized school-level characteristics with minimal differentiation.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning identified a subgroup with statistically detectable but clinically trivial differential intervention response. These findings highlight the substantial challenges in achieving clinically useful personalization in universal school-based prevention programs.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with nearly 5 billion users worldwide. Its ubiquity has sparked concerns about the potential effects on sleep, particularly among young people. Previous research has generally shown that greater social media engagement is associated with poorer sleep outcomes, such as later bedtimes and longer sleep onset latency. However, most evidence is cross-sectional, limiting causal claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal studies published in the last five years examining the impact of social media use on subsequent sleep in young people. In accordance with cross-sectional findings, the majority of studies (~70%) provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use, including at bedtime. These findings inform professional recommendations, including strategies to reduce problematic use to improve sleep outcomes in youth. Yet implementation may be challenging, as adolescents often resist device restrictions and family contexts vary widely, highlighting the need for flexible approaches. Methodological limitations of the reviewed studies further constrain conclusions. Many studies rely on self-reports and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep. Future studies should employ validated measures and move beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how content, patterns of problematic use, and the timing of social media use influence sleep longitudinally. Studies must also address the complexity of this relationship and consider bidirectional pathways and interactions with other key variables such as neurodiversity, socioeconomic status and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Our language environment is rich in statistical structure. It is therefore natural to hypothesize that statistical learning (SL) —the ability to detect regularities in the environmental input— contributes to the efficient processing of written text and supports literacy skills. Some prior studies reported correlations between SL as a general ability and reading, while others found null effects. We propose that this link may be better revealed by measuring individuals’ learning of orthographic statistical patterns, a type of regularity more directly relevant to literacy. This study examined how sensitivity to bigram frequency in participants’ first language (L1, French) and the ability to learn novel bigrams through exposure relate to literacy outcomes. The measures showed moderate to good reliability (L1 sensitivity: r = .60; novel orthographic learning: r = .84) and were significantly associated with spelling, but not reading. Notably, sensitivity to bigram frequency was not significantly associated with orthographic learning performance and did not mediate the link between orthographic learning and spelling. These findings suggest that different aspects of sensitivity to existing and newly acquired orthographic patterns independently support spelling abilities in French, without extending to reading performance.",

We indicate unanswered questions for transdermal technology, including whether devices might ultimately produce fine-grained drinking quantity estimates and device longevity. We further identify factors that can impede development of new objective measures, including the tendency to judge new tools against an implicit ideal and consider scientific findings divorced from methodological details.

The study included two experiments. Each paid a treatment group a two-pound reward if they increased their performance on a subsequent IQ test after an initial test. The estimated effects of effort were not significantly different from zero in either experiment.\n\nI argue that this conclusion commits the statistical non-significance fallacy—just because an effect size is not significantly different from zero does not mean that the effect really is zero. Confidence intervals reported in the study are too large for strong inferences to be made. This is in part because the sample size (1,737) and financial incentives offered are too small. I estimate the study would need a sample size around four times larger, at 6,500 participants, to have 80% power to reject the null, if the true effect of effort were moderate in size. Nevertheless, I find that by incorporating sensible control variables (such as IQ from the initial test) or by pooling data with a prior study (Bates &amp; Gignac, 2022), a significant effect of effort can be found. Confidence intervals in my re-analysis are very large, making the magnitude of the effect of effort uncertain.",

The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

Statistical Learning (SL) supports speech segmentation through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables, and individual differences in SL ability were found predictive of further language development. The current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; the ability to perceive the beat and infer the meter in a rhythmic stimulus auditory input) correlated with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm in a quadruple meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with entrainment to the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed behavioral tasks measuring their RA and were asked about their engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a correlation between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This correlation was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting similarity between processing items at hierarchically corresponding levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appeared to have a positive effect on infant RA.",

First, we distinguish between the conceptual\nfoundations of mainstream cognitive neuroscience and radical embodied cognitive neuroscience and\ndescribe what it means for a theory of memory to be “radically embodied”. Specifically, we argue that\nREM is radically embodied insofar as it explains memory using the conceptual resources of neural reuse,\nneural resonance, environmental coordination, and dynamical systems theory instead of the mainstream\nmemory concepts of stimulus, encoding, storage and retrieval. Using the sorts of models proposed in\ndynamical systems theory, REM posits that memories are previously traversed locations in the state space\nof the brain-body-environment system. The activity of remembering is then that system’s dynamics\nmoving back to those locations. We then survey key findings from the memory neuroscience literature\nand reinterpret the results through the lens of REM. Namely, we explain the role of the hippocampus and\ncortico-hippocampal interactions, amnesia, relational memory, and memory consolidation using this new\nframework. We end with a discussion on the practical implications of modelling memory as distributed\nacross the brain-body-environment system, including new hypotheses and considerations for experimental\ndesign.

This study aimed to explore perspectives on HIVST, identify barriers and facilitators to HIVST uptake, and provide recommendations to inform effective implementation among a diverse group of 26 SSAM and 13 key informants in the Netherlands through semi-structured interviews. Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants’ perspectives on HIVST centered on three themes: enhanced autonomy in decision-making and testing processes; navigating autonomy and support for self-testing and care linkage; and HIVST within the Dutch context and prevention landscape. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was subsequently employed as a post-hoc interpretive framework to map study findings within a broader implementation context. Factors potentially influencing successful uptake and implementation were identified across multiple CFIR domains, including perceived relative advantage over facility/clinic-based testing, evidence on reliability, and procedural complexity (Innovation Characteristics); low self-efficacy, self-testing and linkage to care support needs (Individual Characteristics); HIV stigma, limited awareness and low visibility of HIVST (Outer Setting); and perceived incompatibility with existing healthcare systems (Inner Setting). Although HIVST can address key testing barriers among SSAM, targeted implementation strategies are needed to guarantee equitable access, proper use, and optimal outcomes. These include enhanced dissemination of HIVST information, normalization of HIV testing and self-testing, provision of person-centered support, and establishing clear pathways for timely care linkage when required.",

Methods: We collected our data through an online survey. Adults’ social media users could participate in our study. We conducted a cross-sectional study during July 2024 in Greece. We gauged personality with the Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI‐10), and social media addiction with the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to eliminate confounding. Results: The personality trait “extraversion” was related with increased social media addiction (adjusted beta = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.69, p-value = 0.005). Moreover, the personality trait “agreeableness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.62, 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.32, p-value &lt; 0.001). In addition, the personality trait “conscientiousness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.80, 95% CI = -1.04 to -0.57, p-value &lt; 0.001). Levels of social media addiction was higher among females (adjusted beta = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.07 to 3.36, p-value &lt; 0.001).

          "abstract": "People tend to forget information once they offload it to an external reminder such as a written note or computer file.  However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

          "abstract": "While prevailing theories suggest social interaction difficulties are inherent to autism, the theory of the double empathy problem (DEP) proposes these difficulties arise from a mismatch between different neurotypes. The theory predicts more challenging communication between individuals with and without autism, but better communication among individuals with autism. While individuals with autism indeed report better communication, experimental studies testing the theory are largely lacking. In this study, 106 adults (55 with autism) completed an empathic accuracy task in which they watched video clips of an interaction between an individual with and without autism and inferred the individuals’ thoughts. Contrary to our hypothesis, adults with autism were not better at estimating the thoughts of other adults with autism. Instead, they were generally less accurate than adults without autism. Individuals with autism were also perceived as more difficult to estimate. In conclusion, this study did not find support for the DEP theory. Further research is needed to understand the reported ease of communication among individuals with autism.",

          "abstract": "Interoception, the processing of internal bodily states, contributes to human behaviour through multiple cognitive and affective processes, including emotional regulation and decision-making. It also constitutes a key variable in a range of psychopathological processes. Yet, its core phenomenological dimension, namely how bodily sensations are subjectively experienced, remains understudied. Bodily mapping offers a promising method to address this gap, but existing tools do not allow for a fine-grained assessment of the various dimensions of bodily sensations. Here, we introduce InteroMap, an open-access, open-source tool that enables rigorous and comprehensive assessment of self-reported interoceptive phenomenology. InteroMap comprises (1) a precise drawing interface that combines valence and intensity ratings, (2) front and back views of the body, (3) clear anatomical landmarks for accurate localization, (4) a correction feature, and (5) a post-processing platform to support data visualization and standardization. In a preregistered study (N = 654), we compared InteroMap with the tool most used to assess bodily sensations: emBODY. Our findings show that InteroMap has strong construct validity and outperformed emBODY on convergent, concurrent, and response process validity, as well as on several user experience metrics. InteroMap therefore represents significant progress in the study of interoceptive phenomenology. This tool opens new avenues for testing theoretical models that posit a central role for bodily sensations in healthy and pathological psychological functioning.",

The public’s marked interest in this issue prompted us to look at social representations of peace in Cameroon through the prism of religious commitment. Adopting a structural approach to social representations, we conducted a study among respondents with different levels of religious commitment (N = 156). Data collected via free association and characterization questionnaires were submitted to hierarchical and Q-sort analyses. Results indicated that unity is the factor that best characterizes peace. A comparative analysis of the organization of representations between groups with different levels of religious commitment failed to reveal any major differences. Based on the elements identifed by participants, we argue that proximity to the object is the main factor underlying the construction of social representations of peace in Cameroon.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "authors": "Takuma Hashimoto; Shogo Makioka",
          "abstract": "Serial dependence is a phenomenon in which current perception is attracted to the immediately preceding perception and is thought to reflect a mechanism for stabilizing perception by integrating information over successive moments. It has been demonstrated across a variety of stimuli and has also been observed in the numerosity perception. A previous study suggested that cross-modal serial dependence in numerosity perception from audition to vision did not occur. However, differences in the stimulus presentation format might have prevented serial dependence from emerging. Therefore, we employed a standardized temporal presentation format consisting of sequences of white noise and visual flashes. As a result, we observed bidirectional cross-modal serial dependence between audition and vision. This result highlights the critical role of presentation format in cross-modal serial dependence. Furthermore, this effect was still observed when inducer stimuli was presented at different spatial positions, in contrast to previous studies on serial dependence within the visual modality. These findings suggest the involvement of a higher-level processing stage. Specifically, a representation that is not selective to specific modality or strictly tied to spatial position, although it remains selective to presentation format, may be involved in the observed effect.",

          "abstract": "Young children are often faced with referentially ambiguous situations, where they hear a novel word and are uncertain about the intended referent in the cluttered visual scenes they encounter daily. In the current study, we examined the extent to which children infer that a novel label refers to an object of greater interest to them relative to an object of lesser interest. Thirty-four 30- to 36-month-old children participated in an eyetracking task. First, we examined children’s interest in objects from four semantic categories using three measures of interest: the relative amount of time children spent looking at the novel objects from the different categories, pupillary arousal to familiar objects from the different categories, and pupillary arousal to the novel objects. We then measured children’s target looking in a following test phase. We found that children’s interest in a novel object – as indexed by the looking time – predicted children’ mapping of a novel label with this object. Children mapped the previously heard novel label to their object of interest, and showed a different pattern of looking when presented with a supernovel label. Furthermore, parents’ evaluation of children’s interest in the category to which the object belonged modulated children’s word-object mapping, highlighting the interplay between children’s situational interest in a novel object and their individual interest in the category of the object. We consider the social environment in which such a hit-and-miss strategy could yield successful learning in early development, highlighting the role of children’s interests in driving vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nAlthough major depressive disorder (MDD) is known to have a high societal burden, little is known about the costs associated with the remission phase. Many individuals in remission experience residual symptoms that may impact functioning, productivity, and healthcare use. This study aimed to estimate the societal cost of individuals in remission from MDD in Belgium.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 138 adults in remission from MDD completed questionnaires assessing healthcare use (iMCQ) and productivity loss (WPAI:GH) over the past three months. Unit costs were applied to estimate annual costs. Descriptive analyses with bias-corrected bootstrap intervals were used. Generalized linear models with a log-link function and Tweedie distribution examined predictors of total, direct and indirect costs.\n\nResults\n\nMean annual societal cost per person was €5388.43 (BCa 95% CI: €3563–8875.05), including €1767.84 (BCa 95% CI: 1148.18–3927.78) in direct costs and €3620.59 (BCa 95% CI: €2142.32–6581.60) in indirect costs. In the final model predicting total societal costs, older age was associated with higher costs (+4.50% per year, p = .001). Sex and education were not significant predictors. Remission duration over 12 months was linked to lower total costs (–67.95%, p = .01) compared to less than 6 months.\n\nConclusions\n\nRemission from MDD continues to impose substantial societal costs, mostly due to reduced work participation. These findings highlight that remission does not equate to full recovery, emphasizing the need for future research into the cost-effectiveness of maintenance and relapse prevention strategies in remitted depression",

Participants rated short discourse stimuli on Likert scales assessing perceived politeness, perceived offense and disposition to change the behavior criticized. In Experiment 1, we investigated how participants judged bare direct criticisms versus direct criticisms with a marker of positive politeness. In Experiment 2, we compared judgments of bare direct criticisms and indirect criticisms. We also evaluated the impact of the interindividual variables of age, empathy and gender. Results from both experiments confirmed that ranking of imposition was a crucial factor for the perception of criticism. They also indicated that the gender of participants impacted their perception of criticism, as did their level of empathy. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the factors shaping the perception of criticism, in particular on the role of ranking of imposition, thus contributing to broaden our perspective on this crucial speech act.",

          "authors": "Guy Hochman",
          "abstract": "Why do intelligent, well-informed individuals persist in biased reasoning and polarization? Rather than viewing these phenomena as cognitive failures, this paper proposes that rationalization serves an adaptive regulatory function, a form of cognitive homeostasis that maintains psychological coherence when beliefs, emotions, and identity collide. The Homobiasos framework reconceptualizes bias as part of a homeostatic system analogous to physiological regulation, balancing stability and adaptation across cognitive and affective domains.\nDrawing on evidence from decision science, moral psychology, and affective neuroscience, Homobiasos proposes three recursive processes: (1) conflict detection, where dissonant information triggers affective discomfort; (2) regulatory integration, where intuitive and deliberative processes collaborate to restore equilibrium; and (3) narrative consolidation, where reinterpretation stabilizes coherence even at the cost of accuracy. This model predicts that deliberation amplifies rather than corrects bias under identity threat, cognitive sophistication facilitates motivated reasoning, and interventions targeting affective regulation (e.g., self-affirmation, trust-building) outperform accuracy incentives.\nBeyond human cognition, parallels with machine learning systems suggest that homeostatic regulation may constitute a general principle of adaptive intelligence. Reframing rationalization as cognitive homeostasis shifts the question from “why do people deviate from rationality?” to “how do people regulate trade-offs between competing economic, emotional, and identity utilities?” Bias, under this view, is not a flaw to eliminate but a mechanism sustaining psychological integrity amid complexity and uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Many common conceptualizations of emotion assume that hedonic tone and motivations to approach or avoid are tightly coupled. Though this view has strong heuristic value, it can fail to differentiate classes of emotion that have similar valence but differing behavioral goals. Threats to personal safety may reliably elicit escape or avoidance. By contrast, cues of suffering in others can elicit competing or mixed motivational states, including prosocial approach. We characterized patterns of valence and motivational direction in response to images of suffering, threat, and interpersonal harm, as well as positive images with and without social content. Participants were 229 undergraduate students who reported their reactions using unipolar dimensions of felt positivity, negativity, approach, and avoidance. In comparison to threat (r = .77), we found that suffering (r = .31) elicited a weaker correlation between valence and motivational direction, and more pronounced coactivation of approach–avoidance states, despite similar levels of negative valence. Images of harm, which combined visual elements of suffering and threat, showed intermediate patterns of avoidance motivation. Across participants, higher trait empathy was associated with greater approach to suffering, while empathy and agreeableness were associated with more extreme valence responses across images. These findings offer novel evidence that motivational direction and valence are separable features of emotional experience and highlight the role of person–situation interactions in shaping the dimensional structure of affect.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "Cultural exchange has been a hallmark of human history, yet it is not always positively received. In particular, people sometimes express strong disapproval toward other groups' use of cultural elements they consider their own—a reaction commonly referred to as cultural appropriation. Prior research attributes such responses to power asymmetries or concerns about identity distinctiveness. However, we argue that such derogation can also arise in the context of shared culture, and is not fully explained by these group-based factors. Instead, we propose that a set of lay beliefs known as cultural essentialism—the belief that culture is inherent, stable, and exclusive—plays a critical role. Across four studies (total N = 3,371) conducted in East Asian cultural contexts, we show that cultural essentialism is associated with (Studies 1–2) and causally increases (Studies 3–4) negative evaluations of outgroup engagement with shared cultural practices. This effect is mediated by collective psychological ownership threat and further amplified when the outgroup is perceived as culturally similar (Studies 2 and 4). Importantly, the effect of cultural essentialism persists above and beyond the influence of ingroup identification, outgroup attitude, and distinctiveness threat. Studies 3–4 additionally demonstrate that cultural essentialism promotes more exclusive cultural behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that cultural essentialism contributes to intergroup cultural tension by activating ownership-related concerns, independent of cultural identity or power asymmetry.",

In response to this challenge, deliberative democracy, which emphasizes civil and diverse discussions that empower individuals to make well-informed decisions by critically evaluating competing arguments, has garnered increasing attention. Existing literature initially supports deliberative democracy as a societal norm capable of addressing affective polarization. We further propose that deliberative democracy as a set of lay beliefs may also mitigate outgroup derogations on public issues. Through four studies conducted in the Chinese context (N = 1634), we first developed a measurement of beliefs in deliberative democracy, then got support for our main propositions, verified opinion extremity as boundary conditions, and receptiveness to opposing views as a partial mediation. The findings highlight the potential of reshaping public beliefs through education and policy interventions to cultivate a healthier and more inclusive democracy.",

          "abstract": "Why do uninvolved bystanders punish norm violations less harshly than victims? This longstanding puzzle lies at the heart of theories of fairness and cooperation. Prior accounts suggest that bystanders are less sensitive to unfairness than victims when reacting to fairness norm violations. Across three experiments, we tested this assumption by directly comparing third-party punishment (TPP) and second-party punishment (SPP). In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

          "authors": "Wei Zhang; Meghan Clayards; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Native speakers imitate F0 contours that vary between two lexical tones non-linearly–they do not precisely reproduce the presented F0 features but instead cluster them toward tonal categories, the so-called contrast mediation effect. However, less is known whether non-native speakers who lack the lexical tone phonology will show linear imitation of F0 contours. Addressing this question will deepen our understanding of whether F0 imitation is solely influenced by lexical tone contrasts or also shaped by other sources of non-linearity beyond phonological contrasts. To investigate this, the current study examined the categorization and imitation of a Mandarin flat-falling tonal continuum by both Mandarin speakers and English speakers who were naïve to tonal languages. Imitation distributions were analyzed by comparing two models: a linear regression model, which assumes participants linearly track phonetic cues, and a mixture regression model, which assumes imitation reflects underlying categories. The mixture regression model fit the data better for the Mandarin speakers while the reverse was true for the English speakers, suggesting that Mandarin speakers imitated the F0 contours more categorically than English speakers. However, for both groups, the data was best fit using a weighted combination of both models. For the Mandarin group this result along with additional analyses of duration, F1 and intensity suggest that tone categories involve both phonological and phonetic information and imitation taps both, possibly via hyper- and hypo-articulation. For English participants, the evidence for categorical mediation suggests that imitation is mediated by factors other than lexically contrastive linguistic categories, although the exact nature of the factors is unclear.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation is widely recognized as a critical factor in offender rehabilitation and recidivism reduction. However, empirical research has not yet clarified how distinct patterns of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) relate to recidivism across different types of criminal offenses. We therefore constructed a Bayesian network to model the probabilistic relationships between CERS and recidivism, conditioning on offense type. To obtain a practical, parsimonious network, we first derived interpretable summary indexes from multiple CERS indicators using convex generalized structured component analysis. These indexes were then used as network nodes. The resulting network suggests that CERS differ systematically across offense types and are differentially associated with the likelihood of recidivism. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both individual CERS profiles and offense type into the design of correctional interventions aimed at reducing recidivism.",

However the behavioral consequences of these policies on human navigation are mostly unknown. Using virtual reality, we investigated how some common preventive measures influenced how people navigate near other people. Participants (N=29) traversed virtual rooms containing virtual people\n(“agents”) while we manipulated their mask status, the mask status of the agents, and the perceived environmental safety (high/low community vaccination rates). We found that initial path selection was primarily determined by agent mask-wearing, with participants more likely to pass in front of masked than unmasked agents. The perception of environmental safety predominantly governed subsequent interpersonal distance, with closer proximity maintained in high-vaccination contexts. The participants’ own mask status was the least influential, suggesting that navigational choices were driven by external risk assessment rather than personal protection. We observed clear risk compensation: subjects generally reduced interpersonal distance in safer conditions (whether environmental, agent masking, or personal masking). Bayesian model comparisons favored a three-factor additive model, indicating independent rather than interactive influences on behavior. These findings reveal the interplay of decisions underlying pandemic-era social navigation, and highlight the importance of accounting for risk compensation in public health interventions.",

Existing instruments for VDs depend on verbal descriptions and concurrently assess other perceptual disturbances. A measure exclusively assessing VDs grounded in visual representations could enhance the consistency with which these experiences are probed and sensitivity to such subtle phenomena.\n\nMethods\nWe developed the Visual Distortion Screener (VDS), a video-based instrument for screening the presence of six patient-endorsed VDs: changes to perception of brightness, colors, shadows, depth, movement, and patterns. The VDS was administered online to 229 general population participants along with the Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS) and Revised-Green Paranoid Thought Scale (R-GPTS).\n\nResults\n25.4% of participants endorsed at least one VD, most commonly depth or pattern changes. Among individuals endorsing visual disturbances, 19.1% were detected by the VDS but not by the CAPS. VDS total scores, the number of VDs endorsed, correlated with CAPS total scores (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001) and with the R-GPTS persecution subscale while controlling for the CAPS (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.005). Independent of VDS total scores, distress ratings on the VDS were uniquely associated with both R-GPTS subscales (reference: r = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05; persecution: r = 0.16, p &lt; 0.05).\n\nConclusions\nThe VDS demonstrates preliminary construct validity and may provide additive predictive value beyond the CAPS while capturing additional details about patient experiences.

          "abstract": "It is well known that the way monolingual listeners discriminate speech  sounds is strongly influenced by their native (L1) sound system (Best, McRoberts, &amp; Goodell, 2001; Best &amp; Strange, 1992; Werker, Gilbert, &amp; Humphrey, 1981). Such perceptual constraints are not limited to monolinguals: multiple studies have found evidence of language-specificity in bilingual speech perception (Antoniou, Best, &amp; Tyler, 2013; Sebastián-Gallés &amp; Soto-Faraco, 1999). However, the question of whether bilinguals have simultaneous access to both of their phonologies during non-native contrast discrimination has not been systematically examined. Namely, very few studies of bilinguals have specifically examined cases where a non-native contrast pair straddles the boundary between two sound systems, with one sound corresponding to a sound in the L1, and the other to a sound in the L2, but with neither the L1 nor the L2 containing both. The current study aimed to do so by comparing the ability of early bilinguals to discriminate non-native phonetic contrasts consisting of sounds that exist in either their L1 or L2, but not in both. A forced-choice perception task was designed to compare two listener groups—Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals—on their perception of Nepali dental-alveolar stop contrasts. Results showed that despite displaying some sensitivity to phonetic differences within each contrast pair, the bilingual group was unable to discriminate such “cross-language contrasts” significantly better than the monolingual English control group.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with Williams syndrome have been reported to experience challenges with executive functioning relative to neurotypical individuals, particularly in inhibition. However, previous studies have produced conflicting findings on the extent of differences between these two groups which might reflect a failure to deconfound inhibition and working memory effects on performance. This study assessed this issue by examining performance on novel Go/No-go and colour-word Stroop tasks that varied in inhibitory and memory loads in individuals with Williams syndrome (N = 24) and a large comparison sample of neurotypical children (N = 82). Bayesian analysis showed a meaningful difference between the participant groups on Go/No-go sensitivity scores (D’): participants with Williams syndrome showed poorer sensitivity on all conditions, with the exception of a high memory and high inhibition condition where they outperformed the comparison group. On the Stroop task, individuals with Williams syndrome were slower and less accurate than the comparison group, particularly on high memory and high inhibition conditions. However, accounting for sample differences in non-verbal ability, or word reading speed, removed many previously meaningful group differences in task performance. While inhibitory control is therefore not entirely ‘intact’ in Williams syndrome, individuals’ performance was broadly consistent with other abilities measured in this study. It would therefore be premature to conclude that inhibition is a fundamental area of weakness within executive control for individuals with Williams syndrome.",

We review evidence across six domains: (1) perception and sensory discrimination, (2) learning and problem solving, (3) cognitive control and decision making, (4) retrieval and memory performance, (5) mul-titasking and real-world performance, and (6) clinical applications. We show that many findings attributed to WMC are better explained as reflecting demands on AC.

          "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify research that utilizes modern intensive longitudinal assessment methods (e.g., Ecological Momentary Assessment [EMA]; Experience Sampling [ESM], Daily Diary) to study the mechanisms of change in behavioral activation. \nIntroduction: Behavioral activation (BA) is an efficient and accessible transdiagnostic therapy that has demonstrated considerable effectiveness across populations, settings, and delivery formats. Despite decades of research on BA, its underlying mechanisms remain understudied, partly due to the use of inadequate methodologies. Modern intensive longitudinal assessment methods, like ecological momentary assessment administered via a smartphone, are ideally suited to capturing mechanisms of change in therapy because they facilitate examination of dynamic within-person processes across large samples. To date, such research is fairly limited and has never been summarized.\nInclusion criteria: We will include peer-reviewed empirical articles on clinical trials of BA that examine mechanisms of change in the context of treatment captured with modern intensive assessment methods. No restrictions will be placed on the sample or treatment setting, with the exception that small N studies (N &lt; 5) will be excluded. Clinical trials of treatments that include BA alongside other interventions (e.g., cognitive restructuring) will be excluded.\nMethods:  The search strategy will aim to locate published studies from database inception up to October 14, 2025. A comprehensive search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science will be undertaken by independent reviewers to identify peer-reviewed articles on the topic. Data extracted from eligible studies will include information about the article, sample characteristics, intervention details, mechanism assessment details, and main findings regarding the mechanisms.",

However, this economic perspective is largely tacit about the source of these costs. Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands. Finally, we identify open questions which might help bridge across these accounts.",

To address these gaps, we integrated two week-long daily diary studies (N = 474; 2,809 observations) in which participants reported their nightly affect using both the Affect Grid and single-item ratings of how positive, negative, neutral, and aroused they felt. Correlation analyses showed that Affect Grid valence and arousal were strongly related to their corresponding single-item measures but only weakly related to other dimensions, supporting convergent and discriminant validity. Multilevel models further showed that Affect Grid valence predicted higher positive and lower negative affect, whereas Affect Grid arousal primarily predicted single-item arousal, at both between- and within-person levels. A quadratic pattern for valence suggested that neutral affect peaked at moderate levels of valence, consistent with the view of valence as a bipolar continuum. Overall, these results support the Affect Grid as a concise and reliable tool for measuring affective valence and arousal in daily life.",

More specifically, it considers cognitive performance that is better than expected from standard clinical assessments of the brain. This is in the spirit of the original puzzle raised by (Katzman et al., 1988), who identified individuals whose cognitive abilities had been well above average despite post mortem revealing neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. More commonly these days, the term is used by neurologists to describe people who show comparable atrophy on a clinical brain scan, yet differ markedly in their cognitive function. This “puzzle” is important, particularly if we can identify factors, such as lifestyle choices, that might boost this reserve, allowing individuals to maintain their cognitive abilities for longer, despite brain atrophy.",

We explored how the combination of i) window size, ii) window overlap, iii) prewhitening and iv) use of Peak-Picking (PP) algorithm affected several indices of IPS strength and stability, as well as their ability to discriminate between real and surrogate dyads. \nThe original results of the stufy were overall replicated, with all IPS indices successfully discriminating genuine from surrogate synchrony regardless of parameter selection. By contrast, the selection of parameters had a greater influence when distinguishing between task and baseline IPS. Moreover, the PP algorithm tended to overestimate synchrony strength, thereby hindering discrimination. Importantly, measures of synchrony stability proved effective in distinguishing genuine from surrogate synchrony.

          "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations, especially the perception of voices in the absence of external stimuli, are a hallmark of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Modeling these complex phenomena in animals is challenging, as traditional rodent models rely on indirect behavioral proxies and simple stimuli. Here, I propose that songbirds, with their sophisticated vocal communication and well-mapped neural circuitry for auditory processing, offer a novel model for studying auditory hallucinations. We hypothesize that songbirds can experience hallucination-like perceptions of vocalizations under specific conditions, driven by neural mechanisms of predictive coding and neuromodulation analogous to those in mammals. In this article, we outline supporting evidence for this hypothesis, drawing comparisons between songbirds and traditional mammalian models. We discuss how pharmacological manipulations – extensively used in rodent models – could be applied or adapted to songbirds to induce and investigate hallucination-like events. We then propose a methodological framework to test these ideas, including behavioral paradigms (e.g., detecting illusory calls embedded in noise). Discussion of this framework highlights the strengths of songbirds (rich vocal behaviors, accessible neural circuits) and addresses potential limitations (evolutionary distance and differing brain anatomy). By emphasizing predictive coding and circuit-level mechanisms, we argue that songbirds can fill an essential gap in auditory hallucination research, offering a complementary model alongside rodents and primates. This hypothesis, if validated, would broaden our understanding of hallucinations and open new experimental avenues for probing the neural basis of psychosis.",

Yet, it is unclear whether this improvement contributes to the development of serial order memory. Here we investigated the role of semantic elaboration in the development of immediate memory for lists of object pictures. If the ability to use elaboration to encode new inter-item associations accounts for some of the developmental trend, then training children in an elaborative strategy should mitigate age differences in memory for serial order. We trained 7-year-olds (elaboration group) to create short stories to memorize lists of four items for serial order reconstruction and compared them to same-age and adult controls who received no strategy-specific instructions. All participants responded to questions on strategy use intermittently during the task and at its end. Although the story-making training markedly changed children’s strategy reports, it did not improve their serial order memory. Moreover, although individual differences in the ability to create stories were strongly correlated with participants’ serial order memory task performance, story quality and memory for serial order were only weakly correlated at the trial level. Results suggest that growing levels of use of semantic elaboration cannot account for the development of serial order memory in childhood.

          "authors": "Alexandre Fortuna; Martin Constant; Dirk Kerzel",
          "abstract": "In the visual search literature, an attentional template refers to a mental representation of target features stored in visual working memory. The dual-state model (Olivers et al., 2011) argues that visual working memory can only be focused on a single representation at a time, and therefore, we can only search for one target at a time. Consequently, to detect two potential targets, we must rapidly alternate our attention between the two corresponding representations. By contrast, the resource hypothesis (Huynh Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021) posits that we can simultaneously activate more than one representation for visual search, although this requires sharing the available resources. In three pre-registered experiments, we compared the predictions from the state-based model and the resource hypothesis in a combined search and memory task. The results suggest that participants allocate their resources based on the reliability of the retro-cue and therefore favor the resource hypothesis. In contrast, the results are less consistent with the state-based model, which predicts that the cost in terms of response time and accuracy should remain identical regardless of the retro-cue’s reliability.",

How do these events affect public attitudes in uninvolved 'third-party' groups—i.e., general people in other countries? We explore this question by examining the effect of the 2024 U.S. presidential election outcome on civic attitudes and personal well-being, comparing the U.S. to nine European countries (N≈20,000 total). Exploiting a pre-post difference-in-differences survey design with representative samples, we find that the election outcome strongly shifted democratic satisfaction along winner (Trump) / loser (Harris) lines in the U.S. These patterns were mirrored in Europe, though attenuated. While justification for civic dishonesty remained stable globally, we also find parallel winner/loser effects on personal well-being (happiness, optimism), again in the same direction among Europeans and Americans. Treating the U.S. election as a ‘vicarious event’, our study reveals how major democratic outcomes generate psychological and political spillover effects beyond national borders, extending the winner-loser gap to international citizens.",

          "abstract": "We present a polygenic score (PGS) for general cognitive ability (GCA) that demonstrates a substantial increase in predictive accuracy both among unrelated individuals and within-families relative to existing predictors. In the UK Biobank (UKB), our PGS achieves a standardized regression coefficient with fluid intelligence of β=0.406 (SE 0.009), corresponding to an R² of 16.4% (95% confidence interval: [15.1%, 17.9%]). In a sample of 4,642 sibling pairs from UKB, we estimate the standardized within-family effect of the PGS to be δ=0.355 (SE 0.0218), indicating only slight attenuation of prediction ability within-family (δ/β=0.876, SE 0.050). We obtain similar results in a sample of 736 9-10-year-old European ancestry sibling pairs from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. After correcting for the reliability of the UK Biobank and ABCD phenotypes, the inverse-variance-weighted within-family association of the PGS with latent general ability is estimated at 0.448 (SE 0.025). Our PGS predicts higher educational attainment, occupational status, and family income within families, and retains good performance in non-European ancestry samples, with the correlation retaining 64% of its magnitude in the African American subset of the ABCD cohort, in line with expectations. In UKB siblings, higher scores correlate with better self‑reported health and lower risk of multiple cardiometabolic diseases. Our study shows that it is possible to attain powerful within-family prediction of GCA using a PGS, enabling future research to clarify how cognitive ability influences health-related outcomes.",

In an effort to contribute to a better understanding, we examined the impact of greenwashing training on consumers’ ability to discern greenwashing using an online survey experiment designed to resolve ecological and internal validity issues of past work (N = 518). Additionally, we extended the scope by exploring whether greenwashing training also affects healthwashing detection. Our study revealed that greenwashing training can make consumers more likely to perceive advertisements featuring deceptive environmental claims correctly as greenwashing but can also make them more likely to misperceive advertisements without such claims as greenwashing. Furthermore, it showed that although healthwashing is not the subject of greenwashing training, the triggered skepticism can transfer to healthwashing perceptions, too. Overall, these findings suggest that greenwashing training does not enhance greenwashing detection proficiency but rather promotes excessive suspicion.",

          "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP; Friston 2009, 2010) has been hailed as a groundbreaking idea neuroscience, with the potential to account for a wide range of behavioural phenomena, including exploration and avoidance in uncertain or dynamic environments. Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour. While computationally more demanding, the FEP framework offers substantial advantages in capturing learning dynamics, habit formation, and uncertainty-driven adaptation in travel decision-making, positioning it as a promising neurocomputational foundation for future travel behaviour models.",

The World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Functioning (ICF) Core Sets for Autism provides a framework from which a more in-depth understanding of an Autistic person’s profile of strengths and needs can be acquired. This is the first UK evaluation of the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform, an operationalization of the ICF Core Sets for Autism via an online assessment. In Study 1, 20 Autistic adults were supported to complete the assessment, provide feedback via think-aloud interviews and to evaluate it. In Study 2, which was pre-registered, 464 Autistic adults and 481 Non-Autistic adults completed the assessment independently online and evaluated it. Both studies used a participatory approach. Using standardised questionnaires both studies found the assessment “acceptable” and found usability to be “ok” or better. This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed. The findings suggest the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform has potential as a standardised evidence-based tool to improve understanding of Autistic adults’ strengths and needs.",

It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale changes in consumption are essential for mitigating climate change. Yet, people’s behaviors and their perceptions of what is feasible to change are deeply influenced by their social and physical environments. Despite growing recognition of these influences, empirical evidence integrating both current behavior and perceived feasibility of change remains limited. In this study, we examine the relationship between perceptions of physical and social environments and both the frequency of high-impact transport and food behaviors, as well as their perceived behavioral plasticity—the perceived likelihood of changing such behaviors while considering associated costs and barriers. In exploratory analyses, we also examine how perceived behavioral plasticity relates to perceived wellbeing impacts of behavior change. Using survey data from 1,202 UK adults, we analyzed current driving, air travel, public transport use, and red and white meat consumption, together with perceived plasticity and wellbeing impact for each behavior. Social environmental factors, particularly descriptive norms and family goal support, predicted most current behaviors and perceived plasticity across domains. By contrast, perceptions of physical environmental factors, such as public transport access or food appeal, were associated with behavior and plasticity in more domain-specific ways. Perceived behavioral plasticity was positively correlated with perceived wellbeing impacts, suggesting that perceptions of feasibility and desirability are intertwined. These findings together demonstrate the importance of targeting both physical opportunity structures and social contexts when promoting climate-relevant behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Aim: Childhood maltreatment and adolescent mental health problems are unequally distributed, with the highest burdens among marginalised groups including females and those experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet little is known about how the psychological consequences of maltreatment vary across intersecting social positions (e.g., socioeconomically disadvantaged females). Prior quantitative work has largely compared average differences across a few groups, obscuring non-additive, intersectional patterning. Because social realities are structured by overlapping systems of privilege and oppression, this study aimed to (i) map inequalities in adolescent emotional problems and the effects of maltreatment across intersectional groups; and (ii) describe the extent to which inequalities reflect additive and non-additive (intersectional) effects. Method: Data were analysed from 19,590 11-16-year-olds in the Oxwell 2023 Student Survey in England, United Kingdom. Within a random-coefficient Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA), individuals were nested in 180 intersectional strata defined by gender, ethnicity, household poverty, school year group, and school-level deprivation (also entered as additive effects). Emotional problem scores (Revised Child Depression and Anxiety Scale) were regressed on maltreatment exposure (Short Childhood Maltreatment Questionnaire) as the primary effect of interest. Stratum-specific predicted emotional problems and maltreatment effects were estimated, and between-stratum variance was partitioned into additive and residual non-additive components. Results: Maltreatment was associated with higher emotional problems for all strata (+3.20 to +6.14 points). Socioeconomically disadvantaged female and non-binary adolescents showed the highest burden and among the strongest maltreatment effects. Between-stratum inequalities in emotional problems were largely explained by exposure to maltreatment and the additive contributions of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, age, and place. However, residual non-additive intersectional effects were also evident, especially among individuals exposed to maltreatment (5.25% of between-stratum variance; compared with 3.46% among those not exposed). Conclusion: In this sample of adolescents in England, the detrimental effects of maltreatment on adolescent emotional problems appear pervasive but not uniform across intersecting social positions. Applying intersectional MAIHDA shows that inequalities largely reflect additive social patterning, with additional non-additive contributions suggestive of intersectional dynamics that are more pronounced with maltreatment exposure. These findings motivate deeper investigation into the social-structural mechanisms that shape vulnerability and resilience, and call for trauma-informed, equity-focused interventions and policy to reduce unequal exposure to maltreatment and the contexts that amplify harm.",

          "abstract": "Cross-sectional research indicates that first-person shooter (FPS) expertise relates to superior multitasking. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects true multitasking enhancement or differences in general processing speed. We classified N = 230 Counter-Strike players (16-34 years old) using k-means clustering into four expertise clusters (Novice, Skilled, Emerging, Expert). We assessed their task-switching performance, using Drift-Diffusion Modelling (DDM) to decompose reaction times and accuracies into underlying cognitive components. Expert and Skilled players exhibited significantly faster reaction times than Novice players. Crucially, the lack of significant interaction between expertise and task condition provided no evidence for a specific multitasking advantage. DDM revealed that this processing speed advantage was driven by shorter non-decision times, indicative of faster stimulus encoding and motor response execution. No significant expertise-related differences were found in drift rate or boundary separation. Findings suggest that FPS experience relates to a general processing speed advantage driven by perceptual-motor efficiencies.",

Comparisons were made with a) healthy controls and b) women with non-perinatal depression, using both lifetime history and prospective ICD-coded diagnoses around first birth. Predictors were examined using logistic regression and penalised regression models, adjusting for age, neuroticism, body mass index, deprivation, and education.\n\nResults\n\nLifetime PND was associated with younger age at first birth, higher parity, stillbirth/miscarriage, preterm birth, sleep disorders, and later self-reported insomnia, difficulty getting up, short sleep, loneliness, and evening chronotype vs. controls. Prospective analyses showed increased PND risk vs. controls following multiple or preterm births and in those later reporting difficulty getting up. Preterm birth was associated with PND but not non-perinatal depression. Penalised regression models showed good discrimination of lifetime and prospective PND vs. controls (AUC = 0.78 and 0.77).

Despite the high rates of maternal mental illness, the socioemotional developments that accompany this neurological restructuring remain under researched. To better understand the social experience of matrescence, this study investigated how women experience the transition into motherhood, exploring the topics of body autonomy, social expectations, mental health, and identity development. Interviews with six postpartum women revealed how the experience reduced personal autonomy in motherhood, alongside the necessary cognitive adjustment, functioned as a key mechanism driving maternal identity transformation. The findings of this study provide critical context for understanding how neuroplasticity observed in matrescence can be expressed in real-time. The analysis also illuminated how social support functions as a crucial buffer against emotional distress for new mothers, providing insight into potential strategies to support new mothers. This study underscores the importance of further research into maternal identity transformation and the role of social support in facilitating this transition.",

          "abstract": "Background: Background music has been shown to influence cognitive performance and mood in healthy individuals, but evidence in clinical populations such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains scarce. In PD, attentional deficits and mood disturbances often co-occur, and both are closely linked to alterations in arousal regulation.\nObjective: This study investigated whether background music differing in arousal level modulates mood and attentional performance in individuals with PD and whether interindividual differences in music reward sensitivity influence these effects.\nMethods: Forty-one patients with mild to moderate PD completed the Attention Network Test (ANT) under three auditory conditions: moderate-low arousal music, moderate-high arousal music, and silence. Mood was assessed before and after the task using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and individual differences were measured with the extended Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (eBMRQ).\nResults: Both music conditions reduced post-task depression compared to silence, but a significant pre–post improvement was observed only in the moderate-low arousal group. Fatigue was attenuated and tension decreased under low arousal music, whereas Vigor remained unchanged. Although overall ANT performance was unaffected by auditory condition, a block-wise analysis revealed that executive control improved over time in the low arousal group but declined in silence, while alerting increased only in the silence group. Furthermore, in the low arousal group, Mood Regulation scores from the eBMRQ positively predicted task accuracy.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that low-arousal background music can support mood stabilization and sustain executive control in PD, particularly in patients who habitually use music for emotional regulation. The results highlight the importance of considering arousal level and individual differences when designing music-based cognitive interventions for clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Research on human memory has expanded rapidly over the past decades, leading to the development of numerous models and experimental paradigms. However, this growth has also resulted in increasing specialization, with limited integration across models, tasks, age groups, and domains. Here, we present the Embedded Computational Framework of Memory (eCFM), a simple yet flexible computational model that integrates encoding, storage, retrieval, and decision processes with structured representations that capture visual, orthographic, phonological, and semantic information. We tested the generalizability of the eCFM across 11 experiments involving approximately 40 younger (18 to 25 years) and 40 older adults (65 to 80 years) per experiment. In Experiments 1 to 4, participants completed order reconstruction tasks using words or images varying in semantic, phonological, orthographic, or visual similarity. Experiments 5 to 7 tested serial recall using the same materials. In Experiments 8 to 11, participants performed old/new recognition tests with studied and unstudied items with similar representational forms. Results showed age-related differences in serial recall, smaller differences in order reconstruction, and none in recognition. Across all tasks and domains, participants consistently showed high false memory rates for related foils, with no age-related differences. The eCFM accounted for all main findings and captured age-related differences, and the lack thereof, by manipulating encoding strength and position discriminability. Overall, the model represents a step toward a general account of human memory and highlights the potential and value of integrating traditionally separate areas of memory research.",

At the same time, culturally grounded adaptations were observed, including the incorporation of practices such as Naikan, Zen meditation, and martial arts, alongside thematic emphases on relational and psychosomatic processes. However, explicit engagement with cultural adaptation was relatively limited, raising questions about the extent to which local cultural contexts are informing or being overlooked in the adaptation process. \n\nConclusion: As mindfulness continues to circulate globally, findings from this study highlight the need for context-sensitive approaches that engage with both global frameworks and local conceptual traditions.",

          "authors": "Paul C. Bogdan",
          "abstract": "The present report argues that the pursuit of social alignment drives all aspects of how individuals evaluate and respond to another person’s behavior. Social/moral judgment – whether you see another person as good and their behavior as appropriate – can be framed as an evaluation of whether the person’s values align with yours and whether they acted the same way you would. Following negative judgments, your responses can be understood as attempts to reestablish alignment, such as by conforming to this person’s behavior or punishing it. From this perspective, the present research proposes the Self-Other Prediction Error (SOPE) model, which conceptualizes these mechanisms within frameworks of predictive coding, Theory of Mind, and dual-process decision-making. Recent studies experimentally testing this model validate its core arguments and show that SOPE predicts participants’ reactions to others’ behavior more accurately than earlier theories focusing on norms or utility. Furthermore, reinterpreting older studies suggests that the proposed model successfully reconciles a wide array of phenomena concerning moral psychology, behavioral economics, and other social cognition topics. Hence, the proposed SOPE account is posed as a foundation for understanding social information processing generally and its computational underpinnings.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we introduce the theoretical concepts and test the empirical predictions of the Theory of Sub-entropic Attention (TSA), a novel framework for modelling subjective entropy (Sub-en) in human predictive behaviour. TSA posits that humans implicitly employ Higher Order Markov Models (HOMMs) of individualised orders to predict the next symbol in binary sequences. The internal beliefs of such models enable the emergence of subjectively perceived structure, even in randomly generated sequences, when Sub-en falls below an entropic threshold. \n\nWe conducted a single-participant pilot-study to investigate two related hypotheses: \n\ni) Participants achieve higher accuracy when predicting the next symbol in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic sequences. \nii) Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and used as an outcome measurement, reflect greater prediction errors in sub-entropic conditions.\n\nBehavioural results supported the first hypothesis. Neural data showed significantly larger MEP amplitudes for incorrect predictions in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic conditions, supporting the second hypothesis and suggesting a domain-general neural response to prediction errors that consequently decreases with greater internal baseline uncertainty. These findings provide initial empirical support for TSA and establish Sub-en as an objective metric for quantifying subjective predictability.",

We tested cross-linguistic priming in the comprehension of scopally ambiguous \"all...not\" sentences in Estonian-English bilinguals. These sentences are interpreted differently in English and Estonian. Across three sentence-picture matching experiments, we  observed that bilingual logical representations can be primed both within- and between-languages. Moreover, a control experiment ruled out an explanation in terms of visual priming. These findings indicate that bilinguals use shared logical representations in processing both languages, which do not specify language-specific biases in scope assignment. Additionally, our results showed that Estonian-English bilinguals learn L2-specific scope assignment biases, and that they encounter cross-linguistic influence in the construction logical representations.

          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been proposed as a bridge between laboratory studies and real-world behavior, offering both high experimental control and ecological validity. However, studies directly comparing virtual and real-world replicas remain scarce. The present study investigated three experimental conditions—IVR, non-immersive VR (N-IVR), and Reality—focusing on subjective experiences and episodic memory performance. Participants (N = 156) were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and completed a Shelf Task involving two encoding sessions in which they placed 8 objects on a shelf per session, followed by two recall sessions 10 minutes later. After encoding, participants rated subjective experiences, including spatial presence (self-location and action possibilities), similarity to daily life, enjoyment, cybersickness, and game mechanics. Overall, IVR approximated real-world experience more closely than N-IVR. Ratings of action possibilities and similarity to daily life in IVR matched Reality, and IVR elicited higher enjoyment than both N-IVR and Reality. Some differences remained: self-location and game mechanics favored Reality, and cybersickness was unique to IVR, though at low levels. Memory performance revealed robust session × condition effects. In Session 1, IVR recall lagged behind N-IVR and Reality, suggesting initial challenges with IVR encoding. By Session 2, IVR performance improved markedly, reaching levels comparable to N-IVR for free recall and to both Reality and N-IVR for spatial recall. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of IVR: it can closely approximate real-world experience and memory performance over repeated exposure, but subjective and embodied aspects of reality are not fully replicated. The results have implications for experimental and applied cognitive assessment, as well as clinical and training contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to ease the increasing workload in ophthalmology by supporting ophthalmologists’ clinical decision-making. However, despite regulatory approvals, the adoption and use of AI-enabled clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in ophthalmology remains limited. Critical obstacles that innovative healthcare technologies such as AI-CDSS face on their path to widespread clinical use are nonadoption and abandonment by their intended users, which prevent broader dissemination and real clinical benefit. This study explores how to overcome nonadoption and prevent abandonment of ophthalmic AI-CDSS by identifying ophthalmology professionals’ requirements for adoption and continued use of such tools in clinical practice.\nMethods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 ophthalmology professionals from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, representing a range of professional roles, clinical settings, and extent of AI-CDSS experience. To explore sociotechnical factors shaping ophthalmology professionals’ adoption decisions and their ability to derive added value from ophthalmic AI-CDSS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis combining deductive and inductive coding. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework deductively guided the development of higher-level code categories, representing seven sociotechnical domains relevant for the implementation of healthcare technologies. These were further refined into subcategories through inductive coding of the interview material.\nResults: Most participants expressed general openness to ophthalmic AI-CDSS. However, actual adoption decisions and the ability to derive clinical value from these tools were shaped not just by individual attitudes but also by a range of other sociotechnical influences. Specifically, we inductively identified 29 code categories, representing sociotechnical influences and requirements from all seven NASSS domains, including technological, user, organizational, and societal aspects. Our findings also suggest that while many sociotechnical influences and challenges are shared between AI-based and traditional healthcare technologies, a key distinction of (ophthalmic) AI-CDSS lies in the users’ psychological appraisal of such tools. \nConclusions: Our findings highlight the complex and context-specific nature of integrating AI-CDSS into ophthalmic practice. This study also informs AI and healthcare researchers on the applicability of the NASSS framework for studying AI implementation and provides actionable insights for AI developers and implementers aiming to address user needs more effectively.",

However, empirical evidence to support clinical interpretation of cognitive screening outcomes in relation to neuropsychological functioning and anxiety/depression symptoms is limited. \nObjectives: The aim of this study was to enhance evidence-based interpretation of the Oxford Cognitive Screen-Australian version (OCS-AU) performance by examining relationships between OCS-AU outcomes with neuropsychological constructs and specific anxiety/depression symptoms.\nMethods: Fifty-three stroke survivors within 12 weeks post-stroke in Australian rehabilitation services were recruited. Participants completed the OCS-AU, a neuropsychological test battery, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Correlations between OCS-AU outcomes with neuropsychological constructs, and anxiety/depression symptoms were analysed.\nResults: The OCS-AU subtests Hearts Cancellation, Picture Naming, Number Writing, and Gestural Imitation demonstrated significant correlations with their respective neuropsychological counterparts (r=0.35-0.72, p&lt;0.05), unlike OCS-AU Memory and Executive Function subtests, which demonstrated inconsistent associations with corresponding neuropsychological constructs. OCS-AU domains demonstrated stronger associations with anxiety symptoms than depression symptoms, especially ‘Feeling nervous’, ‘Worrying thoughts’, ‘Trouble relaxing’ and ‘Irritability’ from the GAD-7, and ‘Psychomotor changes’ from the PHQ-9. OCS-AU Executive Function, Memory and Spatial Attention showed the most associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: \nThese findings reveal variable associations between OCS-AU subtests and neuropsychological constructs, with notable limitations in memory and executive function, requiring supplementary assessment when deficits are suspected. Variable associations between OCS-AU domains and specific anxiety/depression symptoms underscore the importance of assessing both cognition and mental health for comprehensive post-stroke evaluation and intervention planning.",

          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Although there is a growing body of work assessing the efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for therapy, it is unknown whether using AI leads people to avoid traditional therapy with trained clinicians. Across two experiments (N = 1175), we addressed this gap by asking participants to describe a personal challenge for which they might seek guidance, including from a therapist. Participants then engaged in a conversation with GPT-4 Turbo, prompted to act as a psychotherapist and pragmatic problem-solver in the treatment condition, and as a neutral interviewer in the control condition. Compared to controls, treated participants reported improved mental health related to their stated challenge (Experiment 1a: β = 6.40, 95% CI [4.20, 8.59], t = 5.74, p &lt; .001; Experiment 1b: β = 7.82, 95% CI [5.51, 10.12], t = 6.67, p &lt; .001). When comparing preferences for future support (human therapy, AI therapy, both or neither), a larger share of treated participants chose AI therapy compared to those in the control (Experiment 1a: +18.3%; Experiment 1b: +4.9%). Crucially, the treatment also led to fewer participants preferring human therapy (Experiment 1a: –15%; Experiment 1b: –16.5%). Notably, across both studies and conditions, the most frequently chosen option for future psychological support was the combination of AI and human therapy, selected by 34.8% to 44.6% of respondents depending on experiment and condition.",

Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands.

Empathic AI—large language models (LLMs) that provide empathic support—will undermine human kindness by stopping people from 1) seeking empathy and 2) giving empathy. Asking humans for empathy is often an imposition and can be expensive (e.g., therapy). Also, the empathy people receive from humans is often unwelcome advice (rather than pure sympathy). Because LLMs are always available to provide consistent and unconditional compassion, “seekers” will rely on LLMs instead of their relationship partners. And when seekers rely on AI, “givers” will happily offload their empathic responsibilities to save themselves from this uncomfortable and emotionally costly work. With seekers and givers both relying on LLMs, the kindness created by exchanging empathy will disappear—unless humanity uses empathic AI only to reinforce human empathy, not replace it.

Although there is a multitude of proposed resolutions to this quandary, the fundamental questions associated with MBR still persist unexplained. This article is an invitation to the reader to embark on an exploration of this issue by first delving into the nature of our subjective first-person experiences (that contributes to conceptualizing and defining the mind, as explained in the article), and then examining how third-person scientific understandings including understandings relating to the organ brain are arrived at. We explain that the first-person and third-person perspectives represent two distinct yet equally valid approaches to comprehend the world and our experiences within it, involving contrasting epistemological frameworks. We also describe that insights derived from the first-person perspective cultivate self-knowledge and wisdom, while those arising from third-person analysis illuminate the workings of the world. We additionally highlight that the mind constitutes a dynamic system—comprised of constantly changing sensory encounters and mental processes involving the present moment, the past, and the future—to be regarded as a distinct variable. Without denying the neurobiological correlates of mental states, this article serves as a catalyst for a broader, more inclusive approach to mental health research and treatment that can empower service providers, patients, as well as caregivers, and also help scientists to formulate more refined research inquiries pertaining to the mind and the brain.",

Six DIF detection methods, designed to produce more stable inferences for DIF parameters, were examined under small sample conditions using both real and simulated data. These methods included the chi-square test based on the classical Mantel-Haenszel (MH) procedure with raw data, common odds ratio based the classical MH procedure with raw data, common odds ratios based on the MH procedure with log-linear smoothing and an empirical Bayes (EB) approach, Rasch-based improved version of Lord’s Wald test (i.e., Wald-1), and Rasch-based likelihood ratio test (LRT), all of which have been used in previous research studies. The results indicated that the common odds ratios of MH with raw and smoothed data produced almost identical results, while the Rasch-based methods exhibited similarities in terms of the Type Ι error and power rates. The findings from the current study support the use of the Rasch-based methods for detecting DIF. Specifically, the Type Ι error rates for the Rasch-based methods were below the significance level of .05 across all conditions. In contrast, the Type Ι error rates for the MH procedures, both with raw and smoothed data, exceeded .05 when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. However, the Rasch-based methods showed power rates below the .80 threshold when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. Moreover, the Type Ι error rates for the EB approach to MH procedure were lower than those for other MH procedures in most cases. Nevertheless, the power rates for the EB approach to MH tended to be similar to those for other MH procedures as the percentages and magnitudes of DIF increased.",

Additionally, psychological care could be improved by predicting moments of high psychopathology and providing immediate interventions. Current research assumes that the relationship between sensor data and psychological symptoms is constant over time - or changes with a fixed rate: Models are trained on all past data or on a fixed window, without comparing different window sizes with each other. This is problematic as choosing the wrong training window can negatively impact prediction accuracy, especially if the underlying rate of change is varying. As a potential solution we compare different methodologies for choosing the correct window size ranging from frequent practice\nbased on heuristics to super learning approaches. In a simulation study, we vary the rate of change in the underlying relationship form over time as well as the model type (OLS and RF). We show that even computing a simple average across different windows can reduce the prediction error rather than selecting a single best window for both simulated and real-world data.",

Accordingly, people tell a story of how the data was generated, focusing on goal-relevant information. On another account, people make predictions by learning simple mappings from relevant features of the situation to the outcome. Here, we provide evidence for the causal account. Across three experiments and two paradigms, we find that people misremember what happened, predict incorrectly what will happen, and generalize to novel situations in a way that's consistent with the causal account and inconsistent with a feature-based alternative. People spontaneously construct causal models that compress experience to privilege causally relevant information. These models organize how we remember the past, predict the future, and generalize to novel situations.",

Teleological essentialism, by contrast, proposes that people treat an entity’s purpose as part of its essence and explain its features in terms of what it is for. Across three preregistered experiments, we tested these competing accounts by examining how adults explain why members of different categories have their characteristic features. In Experiment 1, participants explained features of artifacts and biological kinds; in both cases, they overwhelmingly appealed to purposes rather than underlying causes. Experiment 2 showed that people can and do appeal to causal mechanisms such as DNA when explaining within-species differences, yet they revert to purpose-based explanations when explaining between-species differences, which prompts species-level categorization. Experiment 3, using randomly selected biological and non-living natural kinds, found that participants again favored purposes for biological kinds but invoked causes for certain non-living kinds (e.g., lead, oxygen, platinum). Together, these findings suggest that for biological kinds, which are central to theories of psychological essentialism, the explanatory connection between essence and features is primarily understood in teleological, not causal, terms.",

Previous studies report that innumerate humans are unable to recognize that two sets placed in one-to-one correspondence are exactly equal, and argue that this ability emerges when humans acquire symbolic numbers. Here we tested blind children and adults (n = 140), and found that despite having symbols to label and count large quantities, these participants did not use one-to-one correspondence to match large sets. We also found that blind individuals who had a gradient of visual sensitivity were more likely to match sets exactly, but participants who only used haptic exploration did not. Thus, numerate individuals (who can sometimes match sets exactly) are nevertheless unable to express their understanding of exact equality in a commonly used measure of this ability. We conclude that expressing knowledge of exact equality via set-matching requires not only conceptual understanding, but also experience with sophisticated sensori-motor procedures, suggesting a possible re-analysis of studies with innumerate and semi-numerate humans.",

          "abstract": "Background: 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), also officially known as Mebufotenin, is a naturally occurring serotonergic psychedelic alkaloid found in the venom of the Sonoran Desert toad (Incilius alvarius) and various plant species. \n\nAreas of Uncertainty: Trace levels of 5-MeO-DMT may be produced endogenously in humans, but its physiological role remains unclear. Safety profiles indicate low risk in controlled settings, though longer-term follow-ups with human subjects may be needed. Phenomenological overlaps with near-death experiences (NDEs) are noted but debated.\n\nTherapeutic Advances: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects. Top-line data from a recent Phase 2b trial showed that 57.5% of participants remitted from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) within eight days.1 Other Phase 2a and 2b trials have provided further, though still preliminary, evidence that 5-MeO-DMT may reduce depressive symptoms more than existing pharmacological treatments, like SSRIs.2–6\n\nLimitations: Most studies are early-phase with small samples (n ≤ 193). Only two double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted in clinical populations, and long-term effects require further investigation.\n\nConclusions: Emerging evidence supports 5-MeO-DMT as a promising, ultra-short-acting psychedelic for TRD and other psychiatric conditions, warranting larger RCTs.",

          "authors": "Chris C. Martin; Wendy Newstetter",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Professors want students to feel included, but there has been little work on how to engender inclusion in collaborative learning. Recent work suggests that justice determines inclusion at the within-person level in student teams: an individual feels included on occasions when justice is high. In this article, we examine whether justice predicts inclusion at higher levels of analysis. Our hypotheses are that justice predicts a sense of inclusion at the between-person level and between-team level: individuals and teams will have higher mean inclusion when their justice levels are high. \nMethods: Four studies were conducted with data from 894 undergraduates across 342 teams, primarily from a biomedical engineering program. Overall peer justice was the independent variable, construed as a combination of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Inclusion was construed as a combination of belonging and authenticity. Multilevel latent mean models were used for data analysis. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were specified. \nResults: Justice robustly predicted inclusion at the between-team and between-person levels. In two-person teams, there was also a contextual effect, indicating that the first partner’s justice perception affected the second partner’s inclusion level, holding other factors constant.\nConclusions: Instructors are likely to increase inclusion if they teach students about justice and set up team processes to maintain justice. Monitoring justice levels and ameliorating cases of injustice may also be helpful.",

          "abstract": "Our current understandings of cybercrime are mainly rooted in sociological and opportunity-based theories. This leaves a critical gap in explaining a person's neurobiological predispositions; specifically, the psychological trait of impulsivity. We propose a theoretical framework, The Dopaminergic Impulsivity Hypothesis of Cybercrime (DHIC), which lays that the dysregulation in the brain's dopamine reward system elevates the propensity for impulsive cybercriminal acts. I argue that individuals with a reduced dopamine receptor function, exhibit inherent reward deficiency and high trait impulsivity. The digital environment combines anonymity and immediacy, therefore appearing to be a \"supernormal stimulus\" that facilitates hacking, trolling, or digital piracy. This paper synthesizes evidence from neurobiology and criminology to build this model and derives testable and specific predictions. If validated, this framework would provide a foundational biological perspective on multiple fronts, including: Cybercrime propensity, Forensic psychology, Targeted interventions... and much more.",

          "abstract": "The Psychopathic Boldness Scale (PBS; Marcus et al., 2025) is a newly developed 21-item self-report measure intended to assess boldness as it manifests within psychopathy. In this commentary, we raise concerns about the PBS's construct validity, particularly its conceptual and empirical overlap with antagonism-related traits. Drawing on theoretical analysis and results from Marcus et al., we evaluated how PBS items function relative to the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of overall correlational profiles revealed that the nomological network of the PBS more closely aligns with TriPM Meanness than with Boldness. Rather than clarifying the role of boldness within psychopathy, the PBS repackages maladaptive content typically captured by meanness/antagonism under the boldness label and results in a case of the jingle fallacy. We argue that this conflation undermines theoretical precision and sets the stage for a more difficult-to-integrate literature.",

          "abstract": "Concerns that AI will homogenize human thinking—and homogenization evidence when human-AI collaboration is observed—appear at odds with findings that AI-assisted content is judged as highly original. Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached a real-world, high-stakes educational context where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

          "abstract": "Mid-20th century in the People's Republic of China was a turbulent period: wars, famines, and Cultural Revolution that disrupted lives for a decade and more. Amidst this historical context, two state farms, Lianhu and Qukou, were founded and developed. According to Talhelm and Dong (2024), Lianhu should be considered a rice farm and Qukou should be considered a wheat farm. Since the farmers in the two farms were mostly randomly assigned to work on these farms, this pair of farms is thus a rare natural experiment that allows a test of the causal relationship between farming practices and their cultural orientation: that farming rice leads people to become more collectivistic. But do these two farms really provide a clear causal test for the effect of farming practices? In this comment, we argue that the reported differences between farmers from the two farms show varying sensitivity to the specifics of the researchers' analytical decisions, creating challenges in interpreting the empirical evidence. Furthermore, the historical context of the two farms may have played an important role in shaping their cultural orientation, suggesting that differences observed across two farms could be attributed to factors other than their farming practices.",

First, we show that societal threat perceptions vary in their interconnectedness, with security threats as crime, threats related to asylum seekers, and the war in Ukraine emerging as central nodes. Second, ideology, age, and education are the most relevant variables linked to societal threat perceptions. Third, we replicate the levels and structure of societal threat perceptions over time, highlighting the robustness of our conclusions. Our study’s results indicate that societal threat perceptions form a complex network that replicates over one year.

Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate overall similarly with ideology -- but also highlight exceptions -- whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reverses its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

It evaluates predictive processing alterations across the continuum of psychosis, from non-clinical psychotic experiences to high-risk and first-episode psychosis, to schizophrenia, exploring the explanatory potential of predictive processing as a transdiagnostic framework. We discuss the translational potential of predictive processing, including its use as a biomarker and in therapeutic interventions. We emphasize the need for standardised paradigms and longitudinal studies to advance predictive processing theories in clinical practice.

          "abstract": "Objective: Studies show that only 50% of suicide decedents disclose their suicidal ideation or intent before death. However, most research has only assessed direct disclosure (i.e., explicitly stating suicidal intent), and may not capture indirect forms of disclosure that occur euphemistically or vaguely (e.g., “I’m worried I’ll do something dumb”). Prior evidence suggests that indirect disclosure may serve as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior, indicating its importance as a potential point of intervention. \nMethod: The current study examines direct and indirect disclosure in a sample of 35 adult inpatients hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Participants completed narrative interviews describing the day preceding their attempt. Suicide-related disclosures were characterized by two coders using qualitative content analysis. Coded features of disclosure included content, directness, function, recipient, and consequences.\nResults:  The majority (60%) of participants engaged in some form of disclosure, direct or indirect, preceding their hospitalization. The vast majority (95%) of disclosures occurred within 24 hours of the attempt. About one-third of reported disclosures were considered indirect, and included behaviors such as communicating distress, asking for help, expressing love, and saying goodbye. For 85% of participants, disclosure was at least partially responsible for the receipt of crisis intervention.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that indirect disclosure is relatively common in the 24 hours surrounding an attempt, indicating its importance as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior. Moreover, disclosure appears to be a critical precursor to the receipt of crisis intervention. Further research into indirect suicide-related disclosure is warranted.",

Adolescence marks a pivotal stage where individuals actively construct their identities and behaviors, such as dietary practices. Dietary habits however extend beyond personal preferences. Adolescents may find resonance with the eating habits of their peers, incorporating them into their own dietary practices, or deliberately select friends who share similar moral perspectives on meat consumption.\nThis study utilized data from the two-year panel survey SOCIALBOND, encompassing approximately 1,372 students in 22 schools in the North Rhine Westphalia region of Germany. Leveraging sociometric peer networks on the grade level, the potential co-dependence of friendship networks and vegetarianism in adolescence is investigated by disentangling social selection and influence effects. This research not only contributes to the broader discourse on social networks but also provides new insights into how dietary choices, such as vegetarianism, unfold within adolescent peer group dynamics.",

To re-center the analysis, this chapter applies a decolonial lens, deconstructing the “mainstream” as a product of an invisible racial hierarchy.

This increased trust raises the concern that anthropomorphic chatbots can reinforce stereotypical beliefs among individuals from predisposed groups.

Neither liberal women nor conservative men show this effect. This effect is mediated by perceived anthropomorphism and trustworthiness. We speculate that conservatives’ known propensity toward sexist beliefs and social identity threat may converge in making conservative women more susceptible to sexist stereotypes from anthropomorphic AI chatbots. Future research should test whether this effect of AI’s anthropomorphism occurs for other identity groups with stereotypes which they are predisposed to believe.",

However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

Over the years, these models have been replicated in various young adult samples. However, other studies have failed to confirm these models. Additionally, the variety of different tasks used in these studies hampers replication of the underlying factor structure of cognitive control. It becomes clear that this field would benefit from a uniform, easily accessible, open-source cognitive control test battery with a validated underlying factor structure and designed for the widest possible audience. For this reason, we developed a freely available cognitive control test battery comprising nine behavioral tasks measuring inhibition, shifting and updating. The underlying factor structure of this test battery was assessed in a group of 165 young adults. CFA was used to test the one-factor model with a common cognitive control function, the three-factor model with separate but correlated cognitive control functions, and the bi-factor model. Our findings supported the three-factor model with correlated cognitive control functions as the best fitting model. This test battery can lead to more uniformity in the field.

These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes.

We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "The production and consumption of red meat is a major source of environmental harm, underscoring the need to reduce red meat consumption. Emerging adults (ages 18-25 y/o) are disproportionately affected by the future consequences of climate change. However, meat eaters often react negatively to the promotion of plant-based alternatives. In this study, we tested whether acknowledging resistance and using autonomy-supportive language can promote a more sustainable diet in emerging adults. The online experiment used a 2 (acknowledging resistance: yes vs. no) x 2 (autonomy-supportive language: yes vs. no) factorial between-subjects design in which participants were exposed to a vlog. Our Bayesian analyses show that emerging adults experience less controlling intent and more autonomy support in the autonomy-supportive language conditions. But acknowledging resistance or using autonomy-supportive language is not effective in altering the sustainable consumption intentions. Potentially, using autonomy-supportive language decreases the persuasiveness of the message in the vlog.",

While laboratory studies using static images of people’s faces suggest that children look more at adult than child faces, such paradigms fail to capture the dynamic, reciprocal nature of real-world social interactions. In the current study, using mobile headmounted eyetrackers, we examined children’s attention to adults’ and children’s faces as they navigated a crowded room with a naturally changing number of adults and children.  Our results reveal that children exhibit a preference for adult over child faces, with a bias towards female faces, and surprisingly, they attend more to unfamiliar than familiar faces. Together, these results reveal the flexible context-sensitive strategies that children use to navigate their daily interactions, and document how social attention unfolds in dynamic social settings.",

Contemporary assessments of gc in adults often focus on school-based knowledge acquired through formal education. To broaden this scope, we developed a gc measure that captures life knowledge acquired through biographical experiences outside formal schooling. A sample of 348 adults completed items assessing school knowledge and newly developed items targeting life knowledge, tailored to specific biographical experiences, covering five areas: humanities, natural sciences, life sciences, arts, and social sciences. Besides the knowledge items, participants also answered questions about the associated biographical experiences. Latent factors for both knowledge item sets correlated perfectly with each other. Nonetheless, correlations between biographical experiences and corresponding life knowledge items were slightly stronger than correlations between biographical items and non-corresponding life or school knowledge items. We discuss the often-neglected relevance of the source of knowledge acquisition and biographical learning opportunities, and consider their implications for the psychometric modeling of gc.",

We rely on three original panel survey datasets from adults (Britain) and young people (Britain and the United States). We find that perceiving politics as more stressful is associated with greater symptoms of depression independently of general stress and exposure to politics, and longitudinally. We find that this relationship is particularly pronounced for those reporting no diagnosis of a mental health problem, who pay more attention to politics, who are low in emotional cognitive control, and who display more negative emotional biases. Lastly, we find that experiential avoidance and two components of rumination (brooding and reflective pondering), which are known risk factors for depression, mediate the association between stressful politics and depression. In summary, this study identifies the psycho-political factors that may harm or protect mental health from stressful politics.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: In psychotherapy, self-report measures with standardized item-sets are widely used to evaluate therapy progress and outcome. However, relying solely on standardized (nomothetic) measures may overlook person-specific (idiographic) problems. Idiographic patient-reported outcome measures (I-PROMs) allow patients to formulate their items, capturing therapy-relevant aspects that standardized measures might miss. To provide guidance on implementing I-PROMs and improving item quality, we conducted a pre-registered narrative systematic review (PROSPERO:CRD42022361535).\nMethods: We searched \"Web of Science,\" \"PsycINFO,\" \"PubMed,\" and \"EMBASE,\" along with reference screenings, to identify studies using I-PROMs in therapy settings, including a psychometric evaluation, published before March 18th 2025.\nResults: Our search yielded 32 empirical articles (51 studies) examining 13 I-PROMs and 6,706 participants. Four I-PROMs assessed therapy-relevant aims (three assessed goals, measuring goal-attainment; one assessed values, measuring value-directed behaviour), four problems (measuring problem-duration, -severity or -change), three both goals and problems (measuring motivational variables), and two assessed helpful aspects of therapy (measuring helpfulness/hindrance). Items were generated via self-administration (four I-PROMs), interviews (six I-PROMs), or both (three I-PROMs). We identified two strategies to enhance item quality: improving item-wording (e.g., instructions, examples, (re)formulation guidelines) and ensuring relevance to therapy (e.g., predefined focus-areas, prioritization-procedures). I-PROMs were applied across therapy settings, talking-therapy schools, nationalities, genders, and disorders, but differences in applicability across these remained unclear.\nDiscussion: Our synthesis helps therapists and researchers evaluate I-PROMs' strengths and limitations, enabling informed choices for selection and implementation, and offers guidance to improve item quality – thereby, facilitating comprehensive measurement and promoting a broader adoption of I-PROMs moving forward.",

          "authors": "Norbert Meskó",
          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Novel strings of letters (i.e., pseudowords) lack established meaning(s), yet they may still evoke systematic semantic signals that influence human behavior. Here, we tested whether semantic determinants of word memorability generalize to these novel strings. To do so we leveraged a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. A ridge model trained on item-level word memorability norms learned a linear mapping from 300-dimensional embeddings to recognition memorability and achieved strong out-of-fold performance. We then applied this model zero-shot to predict memorability for 2,100 phonotactically legal pseudowords whose baseline predictability was captured by orthographic and frequency features. Adding the zero-shot semantic score significantly improved the baseline model. These findings show that distributional representations derived from subword statistics carry mnemonic information that is not reducible to orthographic familiarity, and that novel strings are interpreted within a shared representational space learned from language experience. More broadly, they support the view that memorability is an intrinsic attribute predictable from representational information, even in the absence of learned meanings.",

A preregistered longitudinal content analysis of 34 televised election debates in the Netherlands in the period 1981-2023 was conducted. This dataset included 9,159 speech acts by 68 unique politicians. The results showed that, although most speech acts were classified as civil, the prevalence of political incivility in Dutch televised election debates did increase in the second half of the investigated time period. In addition, incivility was associated with the speaker’s party’s populism, but not gender and incumbency status, and was more likely when a previous comment had been uncivil. Finally, incivility was more prevalent in debates or debate segments featuring only two, rather than three or more, politicians. Potential causes of the increase of incivility in recent years, such as the rise of populism, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Visual illusions are a popular scientific topic frequently shared on social media. When shared online, illusion images are usually accompanied by explanatory statements, which often contain misinformation. Although such posts combining illusion images and misinformation are widely shared, the psychological mechanism underlying this sharing remains unclear. To address this issue, we hypothesized that illusory experiences would shape user’s intention to share misinformation primarily through two mediators: user interest (triggered situational interest) and truthiness. In an online experiment, participants viewed posts that paired an illusion image with explanatory descriptions containing a brief misinformation statement. They then rated their illusory experience, user interest, truthiness, and intention to share. Mediation analysis revealed that illusory experience had a significant total effect on intention to share whereas its direct effect was not significant. Instead, the illusory experience indirectly influenced the intention to share through the two mediators. The pathway via user interest was the strongest, indicating that an increase in triggered situational interest was the principal driver of sharing intentions. The pathway via truthiness was weaker but still significant, suggesting a secondary role of truthiness in shaping sharing intentions. Regarding supplementary factors, neither valence (positive vs. negative) nor presentation format (original vs. repost) exerted significant effects on the outcomes. Overall, the findings indicate that illusory experience influences information-sharing behavior indirectly through psychological mediators, underscoring the importance of considering individual perceptual experience when accounting for misinformation sharing on social media.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "One-pedal driving (OPD) is increasingly adopted in electric vehicles (EVs) due to its benefits in energy efficiency and driving comfort. However, this driving mode also raises safety concerns regarding potential pedal misapplication (PM) and sudden unintended acceleration. This study evaluated PM risk in OPD and explored its possible causes by a simulated driving experiment. Behavioral responses and subjective evaluations from 42 participants were systematically analyzed across one-pedal, two-pedal and joystick modes. Results indicate that compared to two-pedal mode, participants in OPD exhibited faster reaction times, reported higher perceived ease of driving and lower cognitive load. However, PM incidence was higher in OPD than both two-pedal and joystick modes. Its potential cognitive explanations were proposed from both innate and acquired perspectives. This suggests that OPD may pose a higher PM risk, thereby increasing the likelihood of collision, particularly in low-speed scenarios with short time-to-collision. The findings can deepen the understanding the cognitive mechanisms of PM in OPD and provide practical guidance for the safety design of OPD systems in EVs.",

          "abstract": "As people engage in tasks over extended periods, their psychological states systematically change due to factors, such as practice, learning, and/or boredom. However, the dominant frameworks for modelling cognitive processes – such as evidence accumulation models – only consider a single estimate of a process across the duration of an experiment, with the justification often being that these changes are not of interest, are likely minimal, and/or can be eliminated by experimental procedures such as practice blocks. Our study proposes, develops, and assesses the ParAcT-DDM framework: the parameters across time diffusion decision model – which unifies previous modelling efforts from practice and decision-making research. Specifically, our framework models time-varying changes to diffusion decision model parameters by assuming that rather than being constant across time, their estimates follow theoretically informed trial-varying or block-varying functions across time. Focusing on two diffusion model parameters – drift-rate (task efficiency) and threshold (caution) – and a large number of candidate time-varying functions, our simulation results suggest that most variants of the ParAcT-DDM framework display robust inference properties, both in terms of the key parameters being well identified, and the different variants being distinguishable from one another. Our empirical results show that ParAcT-DDM variants vastly outperform the standard diffusion model in three existing data sets, including one where participants completed a practice block before data began recording, suggesting that time-varying cognitive processes often occur in typical cognitive experiments, even when the experimental design explicitly tries to remove practice effects. Finally, we find that the existence of time-varying processes cause systematic biases in the parameter estimates of the standard diffusion model, suggesting that our ParAcT-DDM framework can be crucial to ensuring the robustness of inferences against time-varying changes, regardless of whether these changes are of direct interest.",

Moreover, languages also change through contact and in response to the social and physical environment, but these changes are mostly opaque to classical historical linguistics and/or hinder attempts to construct robust language phylogenies. This paper reviews past efforts to optimize the methods in historical linguistics by incorporating phylogenetic techniques originally developed by evolutionary biology.

As new information becomes available, these probabilities update dynamically, enabling personalized clinical decision-making. However, applying Bayesian Networks to psychological data is challenging because parameter learning in Bayesian Networks can be sensitive to high-dimensional, correlated behavioral indicators across domains. We therefore introduce a Bayesian network–based modeling framework that incorporates Convex Generalized Structured Component Analysis (Convex GSCA) to derive interpretable, low-dimensional summary indexes from multivariate psychological and behavioral data. These summary indexes serve as nodes in a Bayesian network, yielding a parsimonious, theory-consistent model that reproduces clinicians’ treatment recommendations. We illustrate the approach with an empirical application to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), demonstrating how interpretable summary indexes enhance the construction of a Bayesian network for probabilistic, patient-level treatment guidance.

While many models of reading comprehension have been proposed, these are commonly based on neurotypical students, with more limited research into their applicability to autistic students. We investigated whether one model of reading, the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER), could be applied to autistic students. Namely, we sought to determine whether the component skills of the DIER were associated with reading comprehension in this population and whether reading comprehension could be predicted based on significantly associated components. \nMethods: Assessments across the following DIER components were completed with 69 autistic students in the primary school years in Australia: domain general cognition, word reading, listening comprehension (including foundational oral language skills and higher order cognition), text reading fluency, and reading comprehension. \nResults: Reading comprehension was correlated with many of the components of the DIER. Of these, non-verbal IQ, text reading fluency, and listening comprehension (including story comprehension, grammar, and perspective taking) accounted for 60.1% of the variance in reading comprehension, with grammar a significant individual predictor. \nConclusion: These results suggest that the DIER may be applicable to autistic primary school students, however the relative contributions of the components may differ to neurotypical populations. Our findings provide insights into how this model may function across a wider profile of learners, enhancing our understanding of key areas",

The most common examples are onomatopoeias such as “cock-a-doodle-doo” or “woof-woof,” but recent research shows that speakers of various languages perceive a relationship between some meaning in various words of their language. This is the case for English words such as crunchy, zigzag or wiggle, whose sonority is perceived as mapping onto their meaning (Winter et al., 2023). Recently, psycholinguistic research has investigated whether iconicity influence language processing. Sidhu, Vigliocco and Pexman (2020) ran a lexical decision task with words varying in their iconicity level. Their results show that the more iconic a word is, the quicker participants react to it in a lexical decision task, thus suggesting that iconicity may have a facilitatory effect in word recognition. We plan to replicate their study with a sample of Brazilian Portuguese speakers and Brazilian Portuguese words to test their main claim that reaction times in a classic lexical decision task could be influenced by the stimuli’s level of iconicity in a neurotypical population of adults.",

Efforts to disentangle contributing processes through targeted, single-function tasks have produced mixed findings, potentially due to confounding variability in stimuli and task demands.\nThe current work contributes to the field's understanding of cognitive flexibility decline by focusing on \\emph{inhibition} as both a subcomponent and as an independent process, given its central role in both specific-deficit and integrative theoretical accounts. In particular, we designed a unified task that engages both 1) cognitive flexibility through shifting requirements to encode task-relevant mental sets and inhibit them once they become outdated; and 2) discrete item-level inhibition of perceptual distractors. We tested 86 adults aged 18–73. Accuracy analyses revealed asymmetric interaction effects between aging and these two operations: while learning after a rule-switch worsened as age increased, inhibition of perceptual distractors inhibition improved. We then applied a computational model to quantify how memory precision and the inhibition of previously-relevant sets each contributed to performance. Model fits indicated that age-related decline in learning across rule-switches were driven primarily by reduced memory precision, not by deficits in inhibition.",

The rules for these combinations are called syntax, by analogy to language, wherein syntax combines words into sentences. The present chapter discusses syntactic processing, the cognitive ability to handle such rules. Syntactic processing is challenging, yet it is crucial for several concrete mathematical operations, such as number reading, number writing, and calculation. An open question is whether it also supports the development of higher-level skills, such as abstract mathematical reasoning. We present two theoretical approaches to explain syntactic processing: one highlights the large variety of cognitive mechanisms that handle syntax; the other emphasizes their commonalities, proposing that they rely on a shared cognitive capacity. We discuss the benefits of each approach and consider how a better understanding of syntactic processing might improve math education.",

          "authors": "Ryota Kanai; Yuwei Sun; Manuel Baltieri",
          "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have reignited questions about whether artificial systems possess consciousness. Yet, despite remarkable progress in reasoning and language understanding, current AI systems exist only within isolated episodes of computation. This paper argues that a missing ingredient in such systems is temporal continuity, i.e., the persistence of internal dynamics that sustain an unbroken stream of computation analogous to the “stream of consciousness”. We thus propose a roadmap for an architectural framework, stream of computation, based on persistent recursive inference in which the output of each cognitive cycle becomes the input to the next, forming a continuous flow of internal states that evolve autonomously through time. This proposal goes beyond standard Chain-of-Thought paradigms in the sense that we aim for autonomy and continual learning, as opposed to a process of inference that is recursive only “on demand”, i.e. triggered after a prompt is presented to an LLM. To do so, we include mechanisms for continual learning, dynamic switching between inward and outward cognition, and sleep-like phases that separate learning from inference. Together, these mechanisms form the foundation of a lifelong agent, an entity capable of maintaining temporal continuity of itself, integrating new experiences, and reflecting on its own internal state. Functionally, such an architecture promises deeper reasoning, adaptability, and metacognitive stability. Existentially, it suggests the emergence of artificial systems that live through time. While the presence of subjective experience in AI systems remains an open question, the creation of temporally continuous agents may mark a fundamental step towards artificial life, with systems whose individuality and identity arise from the continuity of their own computational existence.",

          "authors": "Philip Deming; Clare Shaffer",
          "abstract": "The search for brain mechanisms of psychopathy has diverse potential starting points. In this review, we propose taking an approach that begins with the question: why do we need a brain? Adopting this starting point requires examining evolutionary evidence, which indicates that brains evolved to anticipate and meet the needs of the body before they arise (i.e., allostasis), and that brains, in service of this aim, continually model and sense the internal conditions of the body (i.e., interoception). These fundamental functions of the nervous system are carried out in part by the allostatic-interoceptive system, which spans brainstem nuclei, subcortical structures, and large-scale cortical networks (i.e., default mode, salience, and somatomotor networks). Psychopathy is related to alterations of the brain’s allostatic-interoceptive system, particularly the cortical extent, in terms of its myeloarchitecture, task-based neural activity, and functional connectivity. Synthesizing evidence of these alterations, we propose that psychopathy is marked by an impaired integrative capacity of the allostatic-interoceptive cortices, resulting in visceromotor signals that lack rich contextual details and that regulate the viscera in a relatively context-insensitive manner. Impoverished visceromotor signals may also hinder the allocation of attention to signals that are relevant to allostasis. However, the extant neuroimaging evidence supporting these hypotheses is highly heterogeneous. We consider two proposals for resolving this heterogeneity, grounded in neuroanatomy and organizing principles of biological systems. Uncovering the brain bases of psychopathy and aggression will likely require moving toward a science of individual brains regulating individual bodies in the context of an ever-changing environment.",

          "abstract": "Judging one’s own cognitive ability is a core aspect of self-reflection, yet most people overestimate their intelligence. We investigated whether autistic (n=284, 18-77 years old) and non-autistic (n=63, 18-76 years old) adults differ in this bias. Participants, all naïve to prior IQ testing, completed a brief online cognitive test and provided self-estimates of intelligence. Across groups, self-estimates modestly correlated with test scores (r = .33). Nearly all non-autistic participants (93.6%) overestimated their ability, whereas autistic participants were more divided: 75.7% overestimated and 24.3% underestimated, yielding a weaker positivity bias overall. This suggests two distinct forms of inaccuracy: a systematic positivity bias in non-autistic individuals versus more variable, sometimes unduly negative, self-views in autistic individuals. These could be shaped by stereotypes or social experiences, and/or a result of general meta-cognitive imprecision. These findings highlight both reduced ego-enhancing bias and an overlooked vulnerability, offering a nuanced view of autistic self-perception.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-harm (SH) is a maladaptive behaviour with increasing prevalence in young people that lacks accessible and scalable interventions. Mental imagery of SH has recently emerged as a proximal mechanism driving SH that could be targeted by Imagery Re-Scripting (ImRS) intervention techniques. However, it remains unclear how ImRS may work. This study tested the hypothesis that an ImRS-based manipulation changes emotions and beliefs associated with SH mental imagery.\n\nMethods: Young people (aged 16-25) who SH underwent a single ImRS experimental manipulation. Participants were exposed to their SH mental image and then guided to switch to a more adaptive “antidote” mental image over 3 rounds. Vividness, emotional intensity and believability of associated cognitions for both SH and “antidote” mental images were rated after each round. Cognitions were mapped onto Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS). \n\nResults: There was a significant reduction in vividness of the SH image and believability of associated cognitions overall but not in emotional intensity. Cognitions believability significantly decreased for four of the five maladaptive schema domains. The antidote image’s vividness, positive emotional intensity and believability of associated cognitions overall significantly increased throughout the experimental manipulation. \n\nConclusion: A single ImRS manipulation may target SH by weakening maladaptive schemas encapsulated in SH mental imagery and by generating alternative imagery eliciting adaptive emotions and beliefs. ImRs offers a promising novel approach to the treatment of SH in young people. Future investigations should test whether this may translate to long-term changes in SH behaviour and its underlying mechanisms including EMS.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) continually interacts with the external environment, yet how such interactions shape short- and long-term memory remains unclear. A key factor modulating this influence is the perceptual similarity between external inputs and WM content. Sensory inputs that resemble what we hold in mind could facilitate or interfere with WM content, or simultaneously engage both processes. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we developed a WM task using naturalistic stimuli in which a task- irrelevant distractor appeared during WM maintenance. We systematically varied the similarity of this sensory input to both task-relevant and -irrelevant WM items. To assess how competition between WM and sensory inputs shapes long-term memory (LTM), we later tested memory for stimuli encountered in the WM task. Across two studies, we found that moderate similarity between sensory inputs and behaviorally relevant WM content yielded the best WM performance, whereas dissimilar or highly similar inputs impaired it. These results suggest that perceptually similar inputs can support WM representations up to a point, beyond which interference dominates. Strikingly, stronger interference during WM predicted better long-term memory, indicating that competition between internal and external representations promotes durable encoding. Together, these findings reveal how perceptual overlap between thought and perception shapes both momentary cognition and lasting memory.",

          "abstract": "Social support, such as handholding from a romantic partner, can reduce pain and physiological responses to noxious stimuli. We previously demonstrated that handholding during the induction of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity via electrical stimulation reduces the spatial spread of hypersensitivity. However, real-life social contexts are dynamic, and it remains unclear whether such support has lingering effects after its withdrawal or whether prior support buffers against subsequent absence. In this pre-registered study, we expanded our earlier sample (N=37 couples) with an additional 28 couples (total N=65) to examine the effects of support and condition order on mechanical hypersensitivity. All female participants underwent two sessions (Support and Alone), where involved partner handholding during Middle Frequency Stimulation (MFS) of the volar forearm. We measured the perceived intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial spread of hypersensitivity before and after MFS. Results replicated and extended our earlier finding: support significantly reduced both vertical and horizontal spread of hypersensitivity, regardless of condition order. Subjective ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness revealed a complex interaction with condition order. Elevated baseline mechanical sensitivity and MFS ratings were observed when support was provided first, while receiving support after having been alone yielded the lowest ratings, consistent with safety signaling or relief effects. The post-MFS increase in ratings was inversely related to baseline sensitivity, resulting in no significant differences. Our findings suggest that while the modulation of hypersensitivity spread by support is robust and order-independent, processes related to expectation and habituation shape subjective reports of hypersensitivity and their modulation by social support.",

However, empirical evidence on the direction, magnitude, and moderating factors of gender differences in PAs has been inconsistent. Using a large dataset (N = 20,199 employees) from a multinational wholesale company, we replicated and extended findings on gender differences in PA ratings, examining potential moderating variables and downstream effects on promotions as a key future employment. Our findings revealed statistically significant but small to very small gender differences in evaluations of performance and development potential, with male employees receiving slightly higher ratings than female employees. These differences were moderated by the department gender composition and partially by manager gender.

          "abstract": "Background:\tStudies have increasingly examined religious rituals and spiritual practices for their potential psychological benefits. However, research has not sufficiently investigated how specific meaning-making frameworks associated with those practices contribute to psychological well-being and prosociality. \nAims:\tThis series of three experiments examined whether increasing the psychological salience of Shabbat among Jews had a greater impact on a variety of outcomes – feelings of security, positive and negative emotions (Study 1), prosocial emotions (Study 2), and transcendence (Study 3) – than primes of a non-religious vacation day or a routine workday. We examined whether this effect was moderated by level of religiosity and attachment to God.\nMethods:\tParticipants (n = 240 for each of the three studies) were administered surveys of aspects of religiosity and spirituality. Participants were then randomized to a priming condition to reflect on their experiences with Shabbat, a non-religious vacation day, and a routine workday. Then, outcome measures were administered. \nResults:\tIn each of the three experiments, the Shabbat prime consistently led to more favorable outcomes on dependent variables than the two control groups (d range = .43-.53), except for negative emotion and personal distress while witnessing others' suffering. Outcomes did not differ between the non-religious vacation and routine workday conditions. While religiosity also predicted more favorable outcomes, there were no significant interaction effects between experimental condition and religiosity. Though correlations with attachment to God were not always significant, those that were associated were consistently in theorized directions. However, there was no interaction whereby attachment to God moderated effects of experimental conditions. \nConclusion:\tAcross three experiments, priming participants to reflect on Shabbat yielded consistently more favorable psychological outcomes than secular analogs. Effects of ritual behavior may be enhanced by processes of religious meaning-making beyond ritual behavior alone. Heightening symbolic and emotional salience of meaning may reinforce potential benefits of religious practices or spiritual exercises.",

In Study 1, we analyzed 257,401 comments from 57 widely viewed YouTube videos using large language models to detect justificatory rhetoric, expressions of outrage, and calls for accountability. Justifications were consistently associated with reduced reform-oriented discourse, whereas outrage strongly co-occurred with accountability language. When modeled together, each response showed stronger links to reform, consistent with mutual suppression and the idea that they function as opposing interpretive strategies. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated victim race by exposing participants (N = 159) to severity-matched videos of police brutality. Justification and outrage again diverged, with justification associated with lower reform support and outrage associated with higher reform support. Participants were more likely to attribute superhuman traits to the Black victim—a racialized justification tied to reduced reform support and to weaker translation of outrage into reform. Outrage for the Black victim was also a more consistent predictor of reform than outrage for the White victim. Together, these findings show how justification and moral outrage function as competing responses to police violence, and how racialized justifications can shape the conditions under which outrage mobilizes collective demands for change.",

However, leading such projects can appear overwhelmingly demanding and inaccessible, particularly for early-career researchers or teams with limited resources and the pressure of strict deadlines. This article offers a practical, experience-based guide for coordinating small-to-medium-scale multisite studies, drawing on lessons learned during my PhD while leading a multisite Registered Report. The structure follows the typical stages of a multisite initiative, providing templates, examples, and recommendations at each step: From preregistering the protocol, with a justified sample size based on power analyses for multilevel data structures and a thoroughly piloted task, to recruiting labs by making the project attractive, with clear criteria for co-authorship and credit recognition. From there, to collecting multisite data with tools to translate materials, track laboratories, register participant details, or to navigate unexpected problems, and finally to preparing and submitting the manuscript to journals and repositories. Although several published guides already exist, this piece adds a personal perspective on what can realistically be expected from smaller collaborations, which often require different strategies, and how to adapt best practices to more modest settings. All resources are openly shared, and the aim is to encourage other early-career researchers to consider leading such projects themselves. Multisite studies do not need to follow a big scale to be valid, powerful, and impactful. With a well-defined protocol and a small but motivated network of collaborators, your team can also contribute with high-quality, collaborative science.",

By mapping these methodological trends, we aim to foster greater interdisciplinary understanding and reflection on disciplinary norms. 3,845 articles from top journals published between 2008 and 2024 were categorized using large language model-assisted content analysis. Key findings reveal significant methodological differences: economics showed a higher prevalence of nonexperimental causal inference and theoretical papers, while psychology had more experimental and correlational studies. Additionally, trend analyses revealed a steady increase in the use of causal inference methods and a decrease in theoretical papers in economics, while psychology’s methodological approaches remained largely stable over the same period. These distinct trajectories suggest that psychology could leverage causal inference for questions where experiments are infeasible, while economics could adopt experimental designs to further enhance internal validity.

The eco-evo-devo approach allows us to construct various morphological and behavioral configurations by utilizing a phylogenetic approach to cognition. This is compared and contrasted with the cybernetic approach to cognition, which is a more standard approach to implementing computational agents. To demonstrate this, the biocybernetic Braitenberg Vehicle approach is subject to a phylogenetic analysis, which reveals an evolutionary development (evo-devo) model of embodiment origins. Computational agents achieve embodiment through a genotype-to-phenotype mapping where phylogenetic diversification amongst agents is driven by mutational and recombination events. Cognitive abilities are built upon common ancestry and refined by taxonomic-specific genotypic configurations. We then compare our approach to the cybernetic approach to cognition and how our approach differs. To reconcile some of these incompatibilities, we discuss the application of 4E approaches to cognition and dual inheritance models that enable an eco-evo-devo approach to computational intelligence.",

Externalizing disorders with impulsivity as a key symptom such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been associated with altered sensory processing and decision-making. This study investigated the relationship between impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours, and multisensory integration. Participants had to discriminate between two visual gratings, and/or two sounds presented to the right and left ear based on respectively contrast and loudness in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The study included 44 participants, 13 of whom were diagnosed with ADHD or Disruptive Behaviour Disorders. Results show similar task performance across participants. Performance accuracies were highest on audiovisual trials and participants responded fastest on auditory trials, independent of impulsivity levels. Examining the timescale of evidence weighting revealed that early sensory information contributed most to decisions, with dynamic dominance switching between visual and auditory modalities. We found no evidence that the temporal dynamics were affected by impulsivity. These findings suggest that impulsivity and impulsivity related behaviours do not significantly affect MSI during our task and that sensory processing mechanisms remain robust against individual impulsivity levels.",

          "authors": "Nikita Podolin; Jan Mikuni; Jozsef Arato",
          "abstract": "Extensive research has shown that the presence of others, especially when perceived as evaluative, can either facilitate or impair performance on a variety of cognitive tasks, depending on their difficulty. While it is well-established that the mental abilities assessed in these studies are underpinned by common executive functions, such as working memory, there has been limited research dealing with the impact of social presence on these cognitive systems directly. The current study addressed this gap by examining the influence of evaluative social presence on working memory performance. In addition, motivational states were considered as potential drivers of the effects. Using a within-subjects design and pre-registered methods, 43 participants performed n-back tasks under varying cognitive load and social evaluation conditions, while motivational states were assessed through self-reported eustress and distress scales. The results revealed that under social evaluation, some individuals exhibit both improved accuracy and speed, while others demonstrate reduced accuracy (without a clear pattern in reaction times), regardless of cognitive load. The anticipated mediation of motivational states could therefore not be supported. These findings challenge traditional understandings of social presence effects, suggesting that its impact on working memory—and potentially other cognitive functions—may be influenced by factors beyond task difficulty. The results have important implications for the design of test environments and highlight the need for further research on moderating factors that could explain the large interindividual variability in social presence effects.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes that the experience of agency and concomitant patterns of attention emerge not only within individuals but between them — in the transient, autonomous dynamics of social interaction known in dance improvisation as the “third entity.” Drawing on the enactive theory of participatory sense-making (PSM), we examine how interactive dynamics shape how we attend to what matters, and how attentional modes may shift in relation to levels of “I,” “we,” and “it” agency. We will also discuss some instances of neurodivergence and psychopathology where PSM dynamics can fail. Integrating cognitive neuroscience on affect-biased attention with ethnographic insights from dance improvisation, we propose a neurophenomenological approach to studying attention as embodied, relational, and affectively charged. We argue that dance improvisation offers a rich, underused laboratory for investigating how attention is dynamically tuned through relational movement. Attention, in this view, is not just selection but participation — a means of moving through and with meaning. Understanding its dynamics will play a central role in advancing transdisciplinary models of mental health grounded in shared sense-making.",

          "abstract": "The assessment of creative achievement (CA) can be cumbersome as participants are typically asked to respond to long lists of possible accomplishments that may still miss their specific achievements. A bottom-up alternative is to let participants openly report their most significant CAs, which, however, involves more complex scoring such as via human ratings. In this study, we investigated whether language models (LMs) can provide an efficient and valid scoring of such open-ended responses. Across two data sets, participants described their three most significant CAs. These responses were rated by human judges and by three LMs (Llama 3.1–8B, Llama 3.3–70B, GPT-4o) using zero-shot prompting. Correlations between human and LM ratings were consistently high (r = .53–.80), and criterion validity evidence of LM-based scores was largely on par with rater-based scores. In addition, we examined zero-shot domain classification of CAs into nine creative domains (e.g., music, visual arts). Classification accuracy was 62.3% overall; closer inspection of findings suggested that automated classification has the potential to unveil conceptual overlaps between domains and to identify CAs involving multiple domains. Taken together, the findings suggest that automated scoring of CA via LMs represents a promising and efficient alternative to traditional CA measures.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of depression during the preschool years is well established. However, the neural correlates of depressive symptoms during this developmental period remain relatively understudied. Prior work has suggested a concurrent association between left amygdala salience reactivity (i.e., reward and loss versus neutral) and depressive symptoms in early childhood. Replication and extension into the predictive utility of the amygdala and other relevant neurobiological correlates are now needed. The current longitudinal study conducted a conceptual replication and extension of prior work using task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a sample of 4-8-year-old children. We investigated whether reward-related reactivity in a priori regions of interest were associated with parent-reported early childhood depressive symptoms concurrently (N = 114; 54% female) and approximately one year later (N = 75; 53% female). Left amygdala salience reactivity and right caudate and medial prefrontal cortex reward reactivity (i.e., reward versus neutral) negatively associated with concurrent childhood depressive symptom severity. Only right caudate reward reactivity negatively associated with childhood depressive symptom severity one year later. Results replicate prior research suggesting an association between amygdala response to salient outcomes during reward processing and concurrent depressive symptom elevations in young children. They also provide novel information supporting the potential role of right caudate reactivity during reward processing as a biomarker of future elevations in depressive symptoms. These findings provide neurobiological insights into our developmental understanding of early emerging depressive symptoms and underscore early childhood as an important developmental period for understanding depression.",

          "abstract": "Numerical and non-numerical quantities are often mapped onto horizontal space. Previous research suggests that culture-related habits, such as reading and writing direction, can influence the orientation of this mapping. While cross-cultural differences have been observed in the spatial representation of time, similar effects have not been consistently found for numbers. This discrepancy has been attributed to the fact that reading and writing involve the sequential processing of information in a specific direction but are not inherently related to numerical content. These findings support the hypothesis that the spatial representation of magnitudes depends on specific experiential associations. The present study investigated potential cross-cultural differences in the spatial representation of visual speed by comparing participants from Italy, who use a left-to-right reading and writing system, with participants from Iran, who use a right-to-left system. Participants judged whether the speed of a centrally presented random dot kinematogram was slower or faster than a reference, using left or right response keys. Results revealed opposite spatial mappings of visual speed: a left-to-right mapping for Italian participants and a right-to-left mapping for Iranian participants. These findings support the view that reading and writing direction shapes the spatial representation of magnitudes intrinsically linked to directional reading experiences, such as motion at a specific speed.",

          "abstract": "Continuous speech presents a challenge to the ab initio learner, as the language-specific segmentation strategies they use in their first language are not always reliable cues in other languages (Cutler, 2001). Yet, they are able to use more general acoustic, prosodic, and statistical cues to word boundaries, as well as lexical similarity to their first language (e.g., Shoemaker &amp; Rast, 2013) to recognize words at first exposure to a new language. In the current study, we investigated whether adult ab initio learners’ ability to recognize words after brief exposure to continuous speech in a new language is improved when that speech is produced using an infant-directed register, a style of speech found to facilitate segmentation in infancy (Thiessen et al., 2005). In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that although English ab initio learners of German benefited from infant-directed speech, their performance was generally lower than in previous studies unless task demands were reduced. These learners also benefited from word length and from frequency of occurrence, as has been shown previously, but these did not interact with register. As in infancy, learner-directed speech registers appear to facilitate initial processing and recognition in adult ab initio learners.",

The\ncorpus contributes to a small collection of corpora with simultaneous recording of reading times and EEG. While this is often achieved using eye-tracking, the use of SPR offers methodological advantages, particularly in aligning neural signals with word-level processing.

          "abstract": "The ability to detect and learn from errors is critical for adaptive behavior across the lifespan. In motor learning, errors drive accurate movements by updating internal forward models that predict sensory consequences. However, the developmental trajectory of the neural mechanisms underlying error processing in motor learning remains largely unknown. Here, we recorded EEG in children (8–10 years), adolescents (13–15 years), and adults (20–35 years) during a goal-directed drawer-opening task requiring movements at a target speed to obtain a reward at the end of the movement. The task dissociated predictive processing of internal errors, reflected in an error-related negativity (ERN)-like component, from postdictive processing of external errors, reflected in a feedback-related negativity (FRN)-like component. Unlike previous cognitive studies, our results showed significant ERN-like and FRN-like components already in 8-year-olds, with no significant differences across the age groups, suggesting early development of predictive and postdictive error processing. Exploratory analyses revealed a more pronounced late frontal positivity in children compared to adolescents and adults, indicating that external feedback may remain more salient at younger ages. This study highlights children’s ability to monitor performance internally and externally during motor learning and underscores the value of supporting both self-monitoring and feedback-based learning in motor skill acquisition across ages.",

This systematic review examines how biofeedback functions within teams, identifying key design components and their impact on team effectiveness. We propose a framework that categorizes biofeedback into three phases: physiological data collection, processing, and feedback delivery. Our analysis of 30 empirical studies reveals that biofeedback can improve team processes by promoting balanced communication, enhancing awareness of team dynamics, and facilitating collaboration. Additionally, biofeedback fosters emergent team states such as connectedness, empathy, and social presence, supporting team cohesion. While evidence indicates that biofeedback enhances dyadic team performance, its impact on larger teams remains limited to subjective performance evaluations. The review identifies key research gaps, including limited study of autonomic nervous system activity, insufficient team-level data processing methods, and a narrow focus on visual feedback. We outline practical considerations for designing biofeedback systems that enhance team effectiveness across contexts. Future research should refine biofeedback designs, extend applications beyond the lab, and incorporate interdisciplinary insights to strengthen theoretical models. This review lays the groundwork for advancing team biofeedback research and practice.",

However, previous studies on music-based interventions in dementia show variability in design and results, hampering clear understanding of the beneficial effects of music. Particularly, the specific benefits of music compared to similar non-musical activities remain unclear. \n\nObjective: Here, we piloted the feasibility of a randomized cross-over study design to isolate music-specific positive effects of a music intervention on people with dementia from general, nonspecific effects of participating in a stimulating group activity.\n\nMethods: 15 nursing home residents diagnosed with dementia participated in both a music and a conversation activity, which only differed with respect to the presence of music. Before and after five weeks of intervention, we assessed behavioural symptoms, using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-NH), and wellbeing, using the Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) scale. During the activities we assessed engagement (Menorah Park Engagement Scale; MPES) and affect (Observed Emotion Rating Scale; OERS).\n\nResults: The singing activity reduced professional caregiver burden, while the conversation activity increased wellbeing. We found no difference between music and conversation in eliciting engagement and affect during the activities.\n\nConclusion: Tentatively, both singing and conversation activities can positively affect people with dementia, with neither clearly outperforming the other. Given our sample size, these findings need to be confirmed in future larger studies. We discuss the feasibility of the design and implications for future studies examining music-specific positive effects on people with dementia.",

          "authors": "Chun Ho Choi; Sin Man Kwan",
          "abstract": "Across advanced societies, motivation and fertility have declined despite unprecedented material abundance (Roser, 2014; Colleran, 2016; Aitken, 2024). Traditional explanations, such as economic pressure, education, gender equality, and shifting social values, describe these outcomes but fail to explain the deeper regulatory mechanism linking individual neurobiology with civilizational behavior. Neuroscientific evidence shows that dopamine regulates both reward anticipation and behavioral persistence, functioning as the brain’s contrast-detection mechanism for motivation and satisfaction (Schultz, 1997; Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Dresp-Langley, 2023). This paper proposes a unifying model—the Theory of Evolutionary Homeostasis (THE), which links dopaminergic adaptation to civilizational cycles of motivation, fertility, and renewal. For convenience and clarity in future reference, this framework is hereafter referred to as Chois’ Theory of Evolutionary Homeostasis (CTEH).\nThe framework identifies eight interlocking tenets: Relativity of Abundance, Dopaminergic Adaptation, Substitution Principle, Homeostatic Drift, Environmental Relativity of Intelligence and Fitness, Collapse and Recalibration, Cyclical Renewal, and Nested Homeostasis. Together, these describe how abundance elevates the dopamine baseline, dulling reward sensitivity and shifting behavior toward artificial stimulation rather than effort-based reward (Brickman &amp; Campbell, 1971; Lyubomirsky, 2008). When desensitization spreads across individuals and institutions, social cohesion and fertility decline (Lutz &amp; Kc, 2011). Periods of crisis then restore contrast and recalibrate the system, initiating renewed motivation and growth (Turchin, 2016).\nIntegrating neuroscience, psychology, and demography, this model reframes social decline not as moral failure but as a predictable outcome of reward saturation. It provides a unifying explanation for cyclical patterns of prosperity, apathy, and renewal observed throughout history, and suggests that understanding dopaminergic relativity may be essential for designing sustainable technological, psychological, and demographic interventions.",

          "authors": "Owen Friend; Thanujeni Pathman; Alison Preston",
          "abstract": "Time is a central dimension of episodic memory which allows us to remember not only what happened and where from past events, but also when those events occurred and how they relate to one another. Adults can form hierarchical knowledge derived from episodic experience that includes precise timing details about individual events and information about temporal patterns that encode regularities across experiences, alongside factual knowledge about time (e.g., the months of the year). Young children’s temporal memory is more constrained, lacking both the level of local detail and limited global knowledge relative to adult temporal representation. Despite behavioral evidence for such developmental differences in temporal memory, we lack a unified model that explains how local and global temporal representation abilities emerge, interact, and are organized across development. Here, we propose a three-stage neurocognitive framework for the hierarchical development of temporal memory, resulting from increasing representational capacity across the hippocampal–frontoparietal memory system. Reviewing behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, we propose that: 1) young children’s temporal memory is initially local and event-specific due to functional immaturity of hippocampus;  2) older children and adolescents form and reinstate global knowledge of temporal regularities resulting from enhanced interactions between hippocampus and lateral frontoparietal cortex; and 3) adults flexibly deploy hierarchical knowledge of local details and generalities in new environments mediated by hippocampus and medial frontoparietal cortex interactions. This framework thus provides a unified, empirically-grounded model of temporal memory development, supporting increasingly complex temporal representations that enable adaptive behaviors at a variety of temporal resolutions.",

          "abstract": "For years, instrumental variables (IVs) based on parity-specific twin births have been considered the “gold standard” method for estimating the causal effect of how the number of children in the family affects parents and children. However, recent research questions the validity of these IVs. This paper argues that the issues with twin birth IVs are more profound than previously recognized. The empirical literature has overlooked the need for a definition of causality. The definition used when applying IVs is the potential outcomes framework. This framework requires clear definitions of the active and control treatments because the causal effect is defined as the difference in outcome between the groups undergoing these two treatments. Previous research using twin birth IVs has failed to provide clear and accurate definitions of the treatments, making it impossible to accurately interpret the estimated effects or assess the validity of the study design and IVs.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the influence of economic growth, unemployment rate, and income inequality on crime rates across 23 regencies/cities in Aceh Province during the 2020–2022 period. Using a quantitative approach with panel data and the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) regression method, the results show that economic growth (measured by GRDP per capita) has a positive and significant effect on crime rates, indicating that uneven growth can increase social tension. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on crime, possibly due to the strong role of social networks, government assistance, and the dominance of the informal sector in Aceh. Income inequality (measured by the Gini Ratio) was found to have no significant effect on crime levels. These findings provide critical insights for designing more inclusive, equitable, and context-specific development policies. By strengthening social capital, expanding access to decent employment, and ensuring equitable development outcomes, the results of this study offer a strategic foundation for reducing crime rates while improving the quality of life in Aceh through enhanced public safety, social stability, and sustainable well-being.\n\nKeywords\nCrime ; Economic Growth ; Unemployment ; Income Inequality ; Social Paradox",

          "abstract": "In diverse societies, how do individuals form views about different groups? We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another. Empirically, we study the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a moment that spurred reckoning with violence against Black Americans. Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

          "abstract": "Concern over falling birth rates, and the pronatalist movement in the United States and elsewhere, are increasing as fertility rates decline and societies grow older. Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

In the \ncontext of the world system, an attempt is made to shift the focus of reproduction from \nindividual social formations to the world system as a whole. While Marxist and functionalist \ntheories, which are used as a theoretical framework in this paper, were primarily focused on \nthe reproduction of class societies at the level of social formations, this paper considers \nreproduction at the level of the world system. Analogous to internal class selection, it is \nclaimed that nation-states are drawn into the reproduction of the world system so that \nperipheral countries train a part of their personnel for free for the countries of the core. This \nreproduction, which is based on unequal relations in the wider world economy, explains the \nphenomenon of ‘brain drain.’ In accordance with that, the possibility of political \ninterventions within the individual states of the (semi)periphery, which would significantly \ndisrupt the current systemic processes of reproduction, is viewed as pessimistically \ninadequate.",

The analysis demonstrates how the interplay \nbetween global capital and national governments frequently results in the \nmarginalisation of local communities, thereby exacerbating social tensions and \nenvironmental degradation. The work elucidates the contrasting definitions of \nextractivism and neo-extractivism, underscoring the persistent exploitation and \ncentralisation of wealth. By focusing on the socio-political dynamics and ownership \nstructures in these regions, the paper emphasises the necessity for sustainable \nand equitable resource management practices.

          "authors": "Aleksandar Korolija",
          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the American boycott of British goods between 1764 and 1770 through the lens of Herbert Marcuse’s theory of false needs and consumer society, in dialogue with Timothy Breen’s notion of the marketplace of revolution. While Breen emphasizes the transformative role of consumer resistance in forging colonial political identity, this article questions the depth and sincerity of anti-consumerist sentiment during the boycott. It argues that the boycott was pri-marily a tactical reaction to British coercion, rather than a strategic rejection of consumerism. Drawing on secondary sources and historiography, the analysis reveals sharp class contradictions in the organization, enforcement, and symbolic meaning of boycotts across regions and social groups. The article contends that neither Breen nor Marcuse adequately integrate class struggle into their interpretations. By incorporating class analysis, it highlights the different motives of merchants, artisans, planters, and lower classes, showing that the boycott often reproduced existing inequalities. The study concludes that the ephemeral nature of anti-consumerist discourse and the rapid return to consumption following British concessions suggest that marketplace resistance was limited in ideological and political depth and largely failed to really challenge the underlying capitalist logic",

          "abstract": "Background: Creativity is the process of generating contextually useful new outcomes by uniquely reconfiguring existing knowledge and information. While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. \nMethods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure.\nResults: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity.\nConclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.",

          "abstract": "The replication of microscopic surface features on stone tool edges using molds and casts is the only way to carry out use-wear analyses on certain lithic artifacts which cannot fit under a microscope or leave a museum. They are also very important for preserving wear stages in sequential experiments aiming to understand wear formation processes. However, the reliability of these methods for replicating micro-topographic features remains insufficiently explored. This study assesses the fidelity of three impression materials—Genie, President, and Affinis—on chert, dacite, obsidian, and quartzite tools, focusing on surface roughness replication for high-resolution analytical techniques such as confocal microscopy.\nUsing Sensofar S-Neox microscopy, ceramic bead georeferencing, and Number of ISO 25178-based roughness parameters, we evaluated the precision and consistency of each material. Statistical analyses demonstrate that Genie replicated surface features with greater fidelity on dacite and obsidian, while President performed similarly on flint and quartzite. Among the evaluated parameters, Str (Texture aspect ratio), Smr1 (Peak material portion), and Sal (Autocorrelation length) varied the least and thus offered the highest replication quality.\nThis research highlights the importance of selecting replication materials suited to the specific properties of the analyzed artifacts and the requirements of the applied analytical techniques. By providing a systematic framework for evaluating replication fidelity, this study contributes to improving methodological precision in use-wear studies and facilitates the application of advanced imaging technologies to archaeological research.",

          "abstract": "In this contribution, I focus on the shifting assemblages of evidencing that become visible during the public court cases and in the verdicts of Dutch women returnees from Syria. Evidencing emerged as a particularly salient problem, since in the large majority of cases there was not even a suspicion that these women had participated in violent acts. What soon appeared was what I call, following one of the lawyers, the doctrine of the common household. Engaging in housework and childcare for men who were IS-fighters became a ground for conviction for participation in a terrorist organization and/or for involvement in preparatory acts enabling terrorism. These men were, as it were, tried in absentia.\n\nAs the doctrine of the common household was a new legal invention, judges were often inconsistent in how they considered such “evidence.” What, then, was running a common household evidence of, and what counted as evidence of running a common household? How did this focus of attention emerge and develop, and what was left outside the frame? How did the courts deal with IS doctrine on housework and childcare, and with women’s own accounts as evidence? How did these positions intersect with particular turns in public opinion?\n\nThese various issues also raise questions of temporality, not only in terms of how sequencing is taken to imply causality, but also in terms of how a particular historical moment matters, with judges developing, and in appeal cases often rejecting, such new interpretations.",

The authors analyzed three scenarios for preventive military action. The findings suggest that, in absolute terms, the probability of war is low, but preventive attacks appear relatively more likely to occur in an attempt to preserve a monopoly on AGI than in an attempt to prevent one.",

However knowledge on teachers´ career paths across long time horizons is scarce.\nIn this study, I investigate how teachers’ teachers transition between schools in which students have\ndifferent levels of SES, or opt out of teaching, and how these transitions shape teachers career paths\nacross 35 years. Using Danish register data 13283 teachers who graduated between 1980 and 1985, I\nemploy sequence analysis and cluster analysis to map out teacher career paths over 35 years. The main\nfinding of the paper concerns the identification of four distinct types of career paths: 1) Teachers working\nalmost exclusively outside of public elementary schools, 2) Teachers primarily working in schools serving\nless affluent students, 3) Teachers primarily working in schools serving affluent students and 4) Teachers\nworking in schools serving middle-class students. Further, the analysis reveals that teacher career paths\nare highly stable. Once teachers begin their careers in a particular type of school, they tend to remain\nin that type throughout their careers. This contradicts the theoretical expectation that teachers would\nswitch schools or types of schools as they gain experience. Lastly, teacher characteristics such as high\nschool GPA, gender, and age at graduation show weak associations with the type of career path teachers\nfollow. The paper contributes to the literature on teacher sorting by providing a long-term view of teacher\ncareers, emphasizing early career decisions’ lasting effects.

Public education expenditure per school-age individual in Sub-Saharan Africa is about 3% of the level observed in Europe and North America in 2025 in PPP terms (versus 6% in 1980 and 4% in 1950). We also find a large impact of human capital expenditure on productivity growth over the 1800–2025 period, especially for public education and for poor countries. Estimated returns using our macro-historical database are around 10% or more, in line with micro studies. Finally, we present simulations based on alternative human capital expenditure trajectories over the 2025–2100 period. In particular, we analyze the conditions under which convergence in human capital expenditure could lead to global productivity convergence by 2100 (around 100€ per hour in all regions in our benchmark scenario).

          "abstract": "Research on partisan expressive responding suggests that the beliefs people express in surveys are more partisan than their underlying perceptions. This article examines expressive responding's scope and importance through a meta-reanalysis of 44 studies from 25 articles. On average, treatments designed to reduce expressive responding shrink measured partisan bias by about 25 percent. Across the 242 survey questions in the data, treatments increase the correlation between the average Democrat and Republican from 0.81 to 0.86. Contrary to expectations derived from the two leading theories of expressive responding, misreporting (''cheerleading'') and congenial inference, there is no evidence that expressive responding increases in partisan identity strength or educational attainment. As research on expressive responding enters its third decade, greater emphasis on design-based tests of mechanisms may help build a firmer understanding of expressive responding’s nature and substantive importance---namely, whether the forces that produce expressive responding in surveys also shape real-world political judgments.",

While often dismissed as a personal choice, the act carries cultural and psycho-political weight. This study specifically draws attention to Indian society and its practices regarding surname change. Existing studies have largely talk about the emotional and social aspects of surname change practices and fail to focus on the real-life consequences that people face when met with such a choice. To address this gap, a mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 301 respondents with two qualitative interviews. The findings reveal that surname change is seldom a neutral act; instead reflecting enduring patriarchal expectations that define legitimacy and belonging. Yet, younger participants demonstrate emerging alternatives, with hyphenated, dual, or invented surnames that challenge conventional lineage models. By analysing these evolving practices, this study argues that the politics of naming remain a mirror of social hierarchies while also offering new ways for achieving some degree of equality and self-definition in contemporary cultural and familial life through a chain of uncomfortable questioning.",

          "abstract": "This teaching note presents a pedagogical framework for integrating Large Language\nModel (LLM)-powered role-playing tools into social work education that moves beyond skills-\nfocused approaches to incorporate relational and embodied dimensions of practice. Using\nSWAT:Role Play, a text-based simulation tool where students engage with simulated service\nuser personas, we propose pedagogical design considerations for LLM role-playing. While\nfeatures like unlimited practice opportunities, immediate feedback, and systematic assessment\nalign with Deliberate Practice models, student testing revealed recognition of the absent \"human\ntouch\" essential to professional practice. Drawing on concepts of technology-driven moral\ndeskilling (Wong, 2024), we argue that designing simulation tools primarily around skill\nacquisition risks fragmenting social work practice into isolated components, negating the\nstructured immersion into holistic professional practice that social work demands. To address\nthis challenge, we propose \"ritualizing the machine\" through intentional design principles that\ndevelop students' \"ritual fluency,\" their ability to navigate complete client encounters with\nappropriate relational and contextual responsiveness. We suggest teaching strategies including\npre-session visual context and ritual preparation, during-session temporal pressure and boundary\nchallenges, and post-session reflection on relational impact. These recommendations help social\nwork educators use LLMs to simulate role-playing that effectively integrates technical\ncompetence with relational sensitivity",

          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between $1\\times1$ kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most direct for native neighborhood women. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that gendered neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring social change at the national level is a crucial aspect of international comparative studies. The environmental module of the International Social Survey Program, conducted four times, provides the opportunity to explore long-term changes in pro environmental attitudes and behaviours across a broad range of societies from 1993 to 2022. Based on data from 24 European countries, this study offers a fresh longitudinal perspective. First, we investigate long-term trends in environmental attitudes (willingness to pay, environmental risk perception) and environmentally significant behaviours (recycling and public sphere behaviours) across various European societies. Second, by applying multi-level within-between random effects models (REWB), we test whether changes in national affluence impact pro environmental attitudes and behaviours, thereby evaluating the affluence thesis for Europe from a longitudinal perspective. Our main findings indicate that since 2010, environmental attitudes and behaviours have been on an upward trend. This suggests an increased awareness of the topic of climate change in Europe and a possible recovery from the negative impacts of the global economic crisis in 2008. Additionally, we can link the affluence thesis to several other dimensions of environmental attitudes and behaviours, contributing to a critical examination of this hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems are designed to enable decentralised coordination and open participation, yet large self-organising crypto communities face persistent organisational challenges. In these complex socio-technical systems, tensions emerge around how to coordinate collective action without hierarchy, balance technical rigour with social connection, and sustain engagement amid constant information overload and competition for attention. We argue that participation depends not only on technical proficiency or economic incentives but equally on the social and organisational mechanisms that enable authentic interaction, trust-building, and social cohesion within crypto communities. Drawing on the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews with retail crypto investors, we explore how participants experience the inherent organisational tensions embedded in their crypto community. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational demands rooted in modes of communication, decision-making, and community growth—each reflecting the dual nature of crypto as both a technical protocol and a social system. Our findings suggest that maintaining balance across these tensions, rather than resolving them, is essential for meaningful participation and long-term platform sustainability. The study contributes a user-centred perspective to debates on governance and collective organisation in decentralized, attention-driven ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital technologies has created both opportunities and risks for young people. Previous research shows that their digital engagement is often driven by educational or informational needs, social interaction, and entertainment. However, many practitioners and scholars warn of youth-specific risks. Moreover, pre-existing socioeconomic advantages shape not only access but also young people’s digital motivation, mastery, and patterns of engagement. Adopting an inclusive approach that encompasses a wide range of methodologies, we conduct a scoping review to explore the impact of digital engagement on young people's life outcomes, with a particular focus on the role of socioeconomic resources. We selected relevant studies from a systematic search of the Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences. We then categorized the empirical evidence based on its relevance to our topic and analyzed each study's results, determining whether it showed benefit or harm based on the observed direction of the effect. Findings from 57 empirical studies suggest that digital activities are not inherently harmful or beneficial but depend on the specific task in focus and the domain of life outcomes considered. While digital engagement tends to have a positive impact on academic outcomes, its effects on wellbeing are mixed. Socioeconomic resources generally give young people an additional advantage in using digital devices and activities for more positive life outcomes and in balancing online opportunities and risks. However, more research is needed to analyze the channels through which this advantage is realized.",

Comparing Fuzozo (an embodied robotic companion for adult women) and Havivi (a minimally embodied plush toy with an external AI module for children), we analyze user-generated content on Rednote using topic modeling, semantic networks, and sentiment analysis. Results show that Fuzozo elicits emotionally rich, relational discourse—often framed as companionship—but also triggers disappointment when emotional expectations are unmet. In contrast, Havivi generates fragmented, utility-focused comments centered on play, familiarity, and practicality. Network analysis reveals a cohesive, affective community around Fuzozo versus scattered, functional mentions for Havivi. These findings suggest that embodiment transforms AI from a functional accessory into a perceived social entity, fundamentally influencing how users relate to and evaluate AI companions.",

          "abstract": "Benin GDP growth was respectively 2.1%, 4.0%, 5.6% and 6% from 2015 to 2018 (World Bank 2018). Despite this positive performance of the economy over the last decade, population below poverty line was 36.2% and GINI index of Benin increased from 38.6 in 2003 to 47.8 in 2015, growing at an average annual rate of 11.29%. This unequal distribution of the wealth can be resolved through a system of integrated growth, by fully exploiting high potential sectors such as agriculture and agro-industry in order to avoid a deterioration of the\nsituation of the vulnerable households. This paper examines the impact of alternative growth paths through investments in agriculture and agro-industry sectors combined. We use a micro funded DSGE Model associated with the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Benin of the year 2013 where we simulate an\nincrease of 75% of capital in the agriculture and agro-industry sectors from 2017 to 2022. The results of the model indicate an increase of the GDP by almost 6% per year during the period of investment that will continue to increase after 2021. In addition, this induce more production in agriculture (average yearly\ngrowth of 6 %) and agro industry sectors (average yearly growth of 11%) and also other sectors as fi?nancial services, transport and trade and ameliorate the wellbeing of the society as a whole.",

          "abstract": "Background: Creativity is the process of generating contextually useful new outcomes by uniquely reconfiguring existing knowledge and information. While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. \nMethods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure.\nResults: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity.\nConclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.",

We introduce spawn elasticity, a measure of how agent populations respond to efficiency gains. We derive a closed-form tipping test that determines when markets become unstable and concentrate. We formalize queue-doping, a queue-priority externality that steepens competitive slopes. We state results on elite tipping, where users with large spawn capacity can tip markets even when most users prefer dispersion, and on two-phase hysteresis, where temporary scarcity windows can lock in permanent dominance. We provide a compact portability threshold and sketch a sectoral segmentation addendum for staggered activation across different economic domains. The results provide simple policy dials -- portability requirements and behavioral governance constraints -- for stabilizing competition and reducing power-driven concentration.

          "abstract": "Where Marcuse and the authors of the Dialectic of Enlightenment decisively part company, then, is not on the negative side of materialism, in its concern with suffering, but on the positive side, in its affirmation of the demand for happiness. For Adorno and Horkheimer, after Dialectic of Enlightenment, reconciliation merely means the absence of suffering, as is evident for instance in Adorno’s claim that after Auschwitz, progress reduces to the demand “that no one should go hungry anymore, that there should be no more torture”. By contrast, Marcuse frames his entire critical activity in terms of a reactivation of the promise of equality, liberty and happiness that is enunciated by the French Enlightenment and enacted by the French Revolution. For Marcuse, the “demand for happiness” that is expressed in the artwork is to be actualised through a revolutionary politics, in a programme that redeems the promise of the bourgeois ideals whose realization capitalist society blocks, by means of participatory democracy, egalitarian redistribution, cultural tolerance and the restructuring of the instincts through non-repressive de-sublimation. “A Road Not Taken: Critical Theory after Dialectic of Enlightenment,” in Martyn Henry Lloyd and Geoff Boucher (eds), Rethinking the Enlightenment (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press), Chapter 10, 221-245. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17421680",

We assess the hypothesis that the Boycott had no measurable impact on the City of Montgomery’s public finances and find compelling evidence to the contrary. Our analysis demonstrates that the Boycott significantly contracted municipal revenue and simultaneously escalated public expenditures, particularly in policing and fire services, driven by the city's \"get tough\" policy response. Using historical financial records and time-series forecasting (ARIMA), we quantify the growing fiscal strain experienced by the city. Although Montgomery maintained budget surpluses during the Boycott period, projections indicate a rising probability of deficits had the protest continued beyond its resolution. These findings highlight the economic leverage wielded by organized civil resistance and underscore the material costs incurred by municipal governments when confronting movements for racial justice.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between flexible work policies (e.g., time-off, flextime, working from home), workplace culture, and employee work outcomes. Drawing on an original survey of 4,013 employees from a national probability sample of U.S. households, we find that “ideal worker norms,” which emphasize a single-minded commitment to work, largely persist across U.S. work organizations, including those that offer flexible work policies. However, in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented under certain conditions—namely, gender-neutral framing, transparent guidelines and granting processes, easy access, and strong managerial support—employees are less likely to associate “successful employees” with ideal worker characteristics and less likely to view using flexible work policies as a career limiting move. Employees in these conditions also report higher self-assessed job fit, promotion prospects, and job satisfaction, and lower turnover intentions compared to employees in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented in more feminized, discretionary, less accessible, and less supportive conditions. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of flexible work policies depends on their design and implementation, not merely their availability, and that when implemented effectively, these policies can improve workplace culture and employee work outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Criminologists typically invoke theoretical constructs within an implicit reflective measurement paradigm, assuming constructs represent unified entities causing observable indicators. Yet measurement model choices embed fundamental theoretical commitments rarely subjected to systematic examination. Using self-control as a paradigmatic example, we analyze an abbreviated 12-item Grasmick et al. (1993) scale across 30 countries in the ISRD-2 data through confirmatory factor analysis, network analysis, and predictive concordance assessment. Results challenge unidimensional reflective assumptions: modest model fit masks substantial item-level heterogeneity; systematic cross-cultural measurement non-invariance emerges; network structures suggest complex interdependencies rather than common-cause relationships; and substantial individual-level prediction discordance reveals a “correlation paradox” where aggregate statistical success corresponds to individual-level theoretical failure. These patterns suggest alternative structures—multidimensional reflective, formative, or fictional—merit consideration. Persistent anomalies may reflect theorists struggling to articulate complex conceptualizations within disciplines lacking appropriate measurement vocabularies. Rather than advocating specific approaches, we argue for explicit measurement choices and appropriate validation methods. The disconnect between aggregate success and individual-level validity may characterize research programs trapped in degenerating development patterns.",

          "abstract": "Many human groups employ hierarchical decision-making, in which only a few individuals hold the power to make decisions for the collective. A common explanation for the prevalence of hierarchical decision-making is that it provides group-level benefits by speeding up the decision-making process. However, groups can often do better by taking more time to explore a problem space or generate ideas. These contrasting accounts suggest that hierarchical or egalitarian decision structures may emerge under different circumstances. To more clearly distinguish between these circumstances, we studied an evolutionary model of group decision-making that includes both intra-group and inter-group dynamics. We show that the emergent social structure depends critically on the trade-off between speed and decision quality: scenarios that demand rapid decisions favor the evolution of skewed, hierarchical structures, while scenarios that reward extended deliberation favor the evolution of flat, egalitarian structures. Our results suggest that, instead of inevitably becoming centralized and hierarchical, groups and organizations are likely to evolve social structures that reflect the relationship between the speed and the quality of decisions they collectively make.",

          "abstract": "Research on migrants’ political inclusion has largely focused on candidates and legislators, leaving party leadership positions underexplored. This study addresses that gap by analysing migrants’ inclusion as party executives, concentrating on state-level executive committees of German parties, which oversee day-to-day operations and hold substantial power. Examining how accessible these positions are to minority group members is key to understanding broader political inclusion dynamics. How prevalent are migrants in party executive positions, and under what conditions do they attain them? Leveraging multiple original data sources—a unique large-N dataset covering all state-level executive committees across six parties, qualitative interviews and a survey with party executives, and party documents—this study investigates the influence of three party-level factors. First, party ideology matters. Left-leaning parties are generally more likely to have party executives of migrant origin, while surprisingly the radical right has more than expected and the radical left fewer. Second, intra-party structures play an important role. Among left-wing parties, migrant sections help empower their members to reach leadership positions. In other parties, such sections either do not exist or serve different purposes. Third, parties do not appear to strategically select migrants for the party executive to attract new members. In sum, this study highlights how left-wing parties, for ideological reasons, are especially committed to including migrants in high-level executive positions, and how organisational structures shape this process. More broadly, this study seeks to shift the focus from parliaments to the everyday inner life of party organisations, advancing our understanding of migrants’ political inclusion.",

          "abstract": "This paper describes the methodology for geocoding historical Swedish census data from 1878-1950, developed as part of the research project \"Cities and Socioeconomic Segregation in the Long Term, 1880-2017.\" While Sweden's historical demographic data is renowned for its quality and coverage, geocoding this data presents unique challenges that cannot be solved using modern geocoding APIs. The primary obstacles include temporal changes in address-coordinate relationships, street relocations, and the complete disappearance of spatial units through demolition and redevelopment. Historical Swedish census data varies in geographic precision, ranging from village-level information in rural areas to property-level detail in urban centers like Stockholm. The paper proposes a solution based on constructing a \"canonical\" historical address and property database that incorporates temporal dimensions, allowing for accurate matching at specific time points. This database is compiled from multiple sources and validated against georeferenced historical city maps. The methodology addresses the distinction between property-level (block name and number) and address-level (street name and house number) geocoding, with property coordinates proving more temporally stable. Manual data collection and quality assurance are essential components of the process, particularly for areas subject to major urban redevelopment such as Stockholm's Klara neighborhood. This approach enables accurate geocoding of historical census data while maintaining spatial precision appropriate for demographic analysis of urban segregation patterns over more than a century.",

Previous studies indicate that 40–55% of English-language TikTok videos on autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) contain scientifically inaccurate information. However, the accuracy of comparable videos in other languages remains largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the quality of information in 109 French-language TikTok videos on autism, ADHD, and dyslexia (with over 66 million cumulative views) to capture variation across disorders. The videos were identified using an ecologically valid keyword search and assessed by healthcare professionals with relevant scientific expertise. Results showed that 41% of autism videos, 56% of ADHD videos, and 41% of dyslexia videos were rated as “very poor” or “fairly poor” in terms of information quality because they contained major inaccuracies. Across all three disorders, higher-quality videos did not attract more views or interactions.",

          "abstract": "The field of app studies has been home to significant methodological creativity in its attempts to better understand the platform society and platform capitalism. Perhaps no approach has been more inspirational than the walkthrough method. However, the walkthrough method’s apparent popularity hides the fact that few studies actually use the method as presented. While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic study of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

          "abstract": "Existing research finds that differences in economic resources explain a much larger share of the spending gap between married and single parents than between married and cohabiting parents. This study focuses on extracurricular spending and considers three non-economic explanations for why children in cohabiting families receive less than those in married households: the greater prevalence of non-biological parents in cohabiting households, the relatively shorter duration of cohabiting relationships, and potentially lower levels of relational commitment. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its 2014 and 2019 Child Development Supplement (5,422 observations of 4,361 children in 2,635 households), I first reproduce established differences in parental spending by family structure. Accounting for biological parent status and relationship duration does little to further reduce the gap between married and cohabiting parents. These findings suggest that unmeasured aspects of commitment may shape family-structure differences in extracurricular investments, but they also highlight the need for continued research given the growing complexity of U.S. family living arrangements and the importance of parental financial investments for children’s development and long-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While research recognizes how the spatial and temporal organisation of science impacts its processes and products, questions remain about how dynamic spatiotemporal conditions constitute science in action. As crises can provide an avenue to understand science amidst rapidly shifting spatiotemporal conditions, we present findings from a case study on a multi-omics project during COVID-19. We draw on the concept of chronotopes to illuminate how the “spacetime” properties of individuals, collectives, and the COVID-19 pandemic co-produce COVID-19 science. We present how different actors enact and engage during the crisis spacetime, illustrating how these enactments result in chronotopic convergences that could progress the project or in divergences that could delay it. We examine how the synchronisation of convergences and divergences in the chronotopes of actors and the crisis shape the progression of the project chronotope. Our analysis illuminates key features of science during a crisis, where projects continuously adapt to rapidly shifting crisis conditions, require recursive experiments and regulatory compliance, need to navigate divergent chronotopic expectations, and necessitate convergences beyond individual and experimental spacetimes. Ultimately, chronotopes are not just static backdrops for science, they can enable and constrain actions, and their active governance defines science both in and out of a crisis.",

          "abstract": "The glass cliff phenomenon describes the tendency for women and other minority groups to be disproportionately appointed to leadership positions during times of organizational risk and instability. While prior research has documented this effect, some empirical evidence has also challenged its existence. In this paper, we design a lab-based online experiment to test whether the glass cliff phenomenon arises in a controlled environment. Moreover, little is known about whether other social categories beyond gender, such as ethnicity, are similarly affected. The experiment aims to detect both gender- and ethnic-based glass cliff effects. In the experiment, participants assumed the role of employers tasked with selecting leaders under stable and crisis conditions. Our results show no evidence of glass cliff effects based on either gender or ethnicity. These findings challenge the generalizability of the glass cliff phenomenon. We discuss the lack of a plausible economic mechanism by which it could systematically emerge in incentive-compatible environments. This suggests that future research and policy design should move away from the search for universal evidence of the glass cliff and instead focus on identifying the specific contexts and conditions under which it may occur.",

Creating and using artefacts may resolve the designer's tension, however this process will also create new tensions for the designer, and new tensions for other humans. Tension helps to conceptualise what is a problem in modern societies. At the same time, it addresses a common question in the design literature—are all humans designers?",

          "authors": "Julia Graf; Renate Renner; Thomas Klebel",
          "abstract": "Effective risk communication is a core element of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030), emphasizing the importance of early warning and public information in mitigating disaster impacts. However, existing research often treats risk communication as a uniform process, lacking systematic differentiation between short-term warnings for acute hazards and long-term adaptation strategies. This scoping review analyzes 194 peer-reviewed studies to examine how risk communication strategies vary according to the temporal dimension (short-term, long-term, or hybrid), hazard types by group (atmospheric, geophysical, hydrological, and biophysi-cal), and intended purpose. Communication goals are categorized through an inductively developed approach—Act, Prepare, and Aware—and mapped across the four major hazard groups. A focused analysis of 141 studies reveals that differences, such as atmospheric hazards, are predominantly addressed through hybrid (41%) and short-term (25%) strategies, often combining real-time alerts with awareness and preparedness. Geophysical haz-ards are strongly associated with hybrid approaches (43%), which emphasize participatory and educational for-mats. Hydrological hazards display the widest variation, combining short-term, hybrid, and complex strategies. Purely long-term formats, however, are rarely found across all hazard types (1.4%), despite their strategic im-portance for resilience. Findings suggest that the choice of communication strategy can be tied to the nature and dynamics of each hazard type. This review identifies key patterns, research gaps, and a structured basis for further evaluation and the development of risk communication. It provides an overview of current literature and guidance for developing context-sensitive, temporally integrated communication strategies.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is consistently associated with better health and longevity, often attributed to economic advantages, health monitoring by a partner, and emotional support. Conversely, spousal death increases the risk of immediate mortality, known as the “widowhood effect.” Although these patterns are well-documented in contemporary populations, less is understood about their prevalence in historical populations, where extended family households may have mitigated the adverse effects of being unmarried or widowed. We investigated the effects of marital status on survival probabilities from age 40 onward, focusing on socioeconomic variability. Access to resources and coping mechanisms likely differed by social class, influencing how marital status affected survival across age groups and socioeconomic strata. We analyzed historical church book data from Finland (1730–1910), applying discrete-time event models to estimate annual survival for men (n = 5,802) and women (n = 6,203) aged 40 to 90. Time-varying marital statuses were categorized into five groups: never married, married, recently widowed, widowed, and remarried. Survival differences by marital status were strongly mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Among high-SES individuals, never-married men and women had 15% and 21% higher survival rates, respectively, compared to their married counterparts. In contrast, among the moderate and lowest socioeconomic classes, survival probabilities for the never-married did not differ from those of the married. The survival advantage of never-married women was limited to ages below 60. Both men and women experienced sharp declines in survival during the two years following spousal loss (15–27%, depending on sex and class). Beyond this acute period, widowed men exhibited 5–10% lower survival rates across all classes compared to married men, while only high-SES widowed women faced a 6% survival disadvantage. Remarriage was associated with survival rates comparable to those of first-time marriage. This study provides insight into the survival advantages of pair-bonding in historical societies, characterized by high mortality rates, extended family structures, and the absence of modern medical resources.",

Previous research has primarily focused on the unidirectional impact of HCI on HHI, while neglecting the reverse effect of HHI on HCI and the behavioral pattern differences arising from identity differentiation. The research methods include: 1) Netnographic analysis (3-5 years of gaming experience &amp; 19,861 online comments); 2) In-depth interviews (19 players); 3) Grounded theory (inductively identifying 5 thematic categories); 4) Descriptive phenomenological approach. This study innovatively proposes the \"Dual Interactive Construction Circles\" (DICC) framework, integrating theories of social presence, symbolic interactionism, and social constructivism. It describes the influence of the inner circle (psychological mechanisms) on the outer circle (behavioral codes), where identity labels represent specific behavioral patterns. This study finds that players collaboratively construct an anthropomorphic perception of virtual characters through HCI and HHI, and that community interactions can partially and reversely shape in-game experiences. This framework breaks through the traditional unidirectional perspective in HCI research and provides a systematic analytical tool for mixed interaction scenarios.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Zongping Liu; Yanyan Xu",
          "abstract": "Method: This study explores the relationship between perfume scents and consumer imagery associations. Based on the analysis of online reviews, a four-dimensional framework was constructed to decode the patterns of imagery associations in perfume reviews. The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, including text mining, content analysis, multiple regression and fsQCA validation, as well as semantic network mapping. \n\nOpen Practice Statement: This study only involves text data analysis, poses no ethical risks, and therefore does not require pre-registration. \n\nKey Findings: 1) natural materials and cultural symbols significantly enhance product ratings (β=0.0114 and β=0.0132), yet cultural symbols negatively affect popularity (β=-0.0296); 2) fsQCA identifies two high-rating pathways, highlighting the synergistic effects between natural materials and cultural symbols; 3) semantic network analysis reveals distinctive imagery sets for twelve fragrance families and constructs a “ingredient–imagery–scene” mapping chain. \n\nSignificance: Innovatively, this study proposes a four-dimensional model to quantify the mechanisms underlying olfactory mental imagery generation, filling a theoretical gap in sensory marketing and neuroaesthetics. It also provides practical tools for fragrance brands to leverage dual-driven storytelling through culture and emotion, enabling scene-based customization in response to emerging market trends. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how generative AI can transform unstructured consumer feedback into actionable insights, opening new avenues for consumer experience research in the digital era. In summary, this work offers essential theoretical tools for understanding the core logic of the olfactory economy and provides practical guidance for perfume brands to pursue strategic differentiation.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Jinjia Gui; Yueqi Wang; Wei Xu",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of generative AI-driven digital immortality (DI) technology, focusing on two distinct user groups: Digital Legacy Giver (DLG), who plan their posthumous digital presence, and Digital Legacy Receiver (DLR), who interact with digital representations of deceased loved ones. Through a mixed-methods approach—analyzing 305 DLG and 307 DLR questionnaires supplemented by 18 in-depth interviews—the research identifies divergent adoption drivers. Key findings reveal DLG exhibit significantly higher DI adoption intent (DIA) than DLR (mean DIA: 3.46 vs. 3.21, p&lt;0.001). For DLG, Presence Extension Need (PEN) (β=0.175, p&lt;0.001) and Data Snoop Concern (DSC) (β=−0.341, p&lt;0.001) are primary motivators and barriers, reflecting desires for symbolic identity continuity and privacy fears. Conversely, DLR prioritize Ritual Substitution Need (RSN) (β=0.252, p&lt;0.001) but are deterred by Relationship Desecration Concern (RDC) (β=−0.336, p&lt;0.001), emphasizing technology’s role in sustaining daily emotional rituals while fearing relational inauthenticity. The study innovatively frames adoption through a \"Demand-Concern-Individual\" ternary model, highlighting an individual-centric logic (DLG seeking self-continuity) versus socio-centric logic (DLR preserving relational bonds). It expands the concept of \"ritual\" beyond traditional memorials to encompass technology-mediated daily interactions. Practical implications include designing personalized security features for DLG and ethically calibrated emotional interfaces for DLR.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates whether artificial intelligence can emulate human mystical experiences through algorithmic rationality, focusing specifically on the generative mechanisms of “Perceived Sacredness” within AI-assisted tarot divination. Grounded in the original “Triadic Framework for Human-AI Spiritual Interaction,” three sequential experiments systematically examine how sacredness perception is shaped by three contextual layers: “who speaks” (agent subjectivity), “how it speaks” (interaction modality), and “what is spoken” (question typology). Study 1 reveals that spiritual believers report significantly lower perceived sacredness, service quality, and trust when explicitly informed that AI is involved, whereas non-believers show no such difference—supporting the “in-group bias” hypothesis. Study 2 demonstrates that oral conversation significantly enhances perceived sacredness compared to touch-screen interaction, aligning with Media Richness and Social Presence theories. Study 3 found no significant difference between open-ended and closed-ended questions in eliciting sacred experiences. Collectively, while AI cannot intrinsically “possess” spirituality, it can effectively “evoke” subjective sacred experiences through carefully designed interaction contexts. This research provides empirical grounding for understanding the reconfiguration of spiritual experience in the technological age and offers critical implications for the ethical and experiential design of AI in spiritual service domains.",

          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "abstract": "Norms are essential for social stability but can hinder adaptability in changing environments. Yet human societies have found ways to modify existing norms or create new ones in response to novel challenges. This paper proposes a framework for understanding adaptive norm evolution. First, drawing on a theory of legal order, we posit that societies balance normative stability and adaptability through metanorms—rules that govern the process by which norms are interpreted, changed and enforced. Second, we test this idea in the context of customary dispute resolution by elders among the Turkana, a pastoralist society in Kenya. Based on vignette experiments with 369 participants, we found that community members were significantly more willing to enforce decisions when elders aligned their conduct with metanorms. Elders are constrained in their ability to alter long-standing customs, but by following metanorms can create new rules for novel situations. These findings support our proposed mechanism: in the absence of centralized authority, metanorms governing normative institutions allow for adaptive norm change while preserving cultural continuity. We conclude by suggesting that group-level selection acts on cultural variation in metanorms, shaping the evolvability of normative systems and enabling societies to sustain adaptive legal order without coercive centralized power",

          "abstract": "In the world of academic publishing, it is likely that the most prominent best practice guidelines (BPGs), encompassing ethical practices, are those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In this paper, we conducted a citation analysis of 71 Write a Scientific Paper (WASP) BPGs, which were all published in Elsevier’s Early Human Development (EHD) during 2018-2019, exclusively by University of Malta researchers. Many of those WASP BPGs were linked to and used by commercial training courses. The 71 WASP BPGs accrued 346 citations by 12 April 2023, 66 being self-citations of EHD, with most citations (75, or 22%) to a 2018 paper by Victor E. Grech and Sarah Cuschieri (DOI: 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2018.01.001). The analysis was repeated on 11 February 2025, revealing that the 71 WASP BPGs had accumulated a total of 478 citations. In April 2023, Grech and Cuschieri had gained a total of 245 and 137 citations, respectively across all of the WASP BPGs, and by February 2025, those values had risen to 309 and 157, respectively. An editorial expression of concern (EoC) was published in 2021, but is disguised as an “Editorial Note”. That EoC encompasses 48 of the WASP BPGs, an EoC “clustering” method that is not the best publishing practice. This bibliometric analysis reveals how a single COPE member journal published, on behalf of an independent group of Malta researchers, 71 BPGs, most of which have an EoC associated with them, and some of which (30 papers, 42%) have been retracted. The underlying message of this case study is that there are grave risks (reputational and otherwise) with amassing such independent BPGs in a single journal.",

          "authors": "Heba Alex",
          "abstract": "This paper describes a strategic mechanism, fuzzy boundaries, that groups use to accumulate advantage. In contrast to the dominant view that rigid, well-defined boundaries maximize group rewards, I argue that ambiguity in membership criteria can, under certain conditions, more effectively secure and promote group benefits. Fuzzy boundaries are defined by two features: an intentionally ambiguous criterion for inclusion and the selective, inconsistent application of that criterion to adjust the insider-outsider line as needed. I illustrate the operation of fuzzy boundaries through a historical analysis of occupational boundary-drawing in the nineteenth-century United States. Ultimately, the study offers a generalizable framework for understanding how strategic ambiguity in group boundaries can serve actors seeking to preserve privilege across domains such as education, hiring, and professional accreditation. Unlike well-defined qualifications, the malleability of fuzzy boundaries often insulates them from legal challenge, making them an effective mechanism for maintaining social and institutional advantage. https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751251378516",

          "abstract": "Human social networks are inherently multiplex, comprising overlapping layers of relationships. Different layers may have distinct structural properties and interpersonal dynamics, but also may interact to form complex interdependent pathways for social contagion. This poses a fundamental problem in understanding behavioral diffusion and in devising effective network‑based interventions. Here, we introduce a new conceptualization of how much each network layer contributes to critical contagion pathways and quantify it using a novel metric, “network torque.” We exploit data regarding sociocentric maps of 110 rural Honduran communities using a battery of 11 name generators and an experiment involving an exogenous intervention. Using a novel statistical framework, we assess the extent to which specific network layers alter global connectivity and support the spread of three experimentally introduced health practices. The results show that specific relationship types—such as close friendships—particularly enable non-overlapping diffusion pathways, amplifying behavioral change at the village level. For instance, non-redundant pathways enabled by closest friends can increase the adoption of correct knowledge about feeding newborns inappropriate “chupones” and enhance attitudes regarding fathers’ involvement in postpartum care. Non-overlapping multiplex social ties are relevant to social contagion and social coherence in traditionally organized social systems.",

          "authors": "Norah MacKendrick; Seungyun Lee; Hanee Choi; Marina Rivera Ramos",
          "abstract": "How environmental health problems gain social visibility is key to understanding social problem formation. In this paper we examine this process by studying American news media coverage of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, a pollutant linked to premature death and cardiovascular disease. After years of decline, in 2016 PM2.5 concentrations began rising nationally in the United States, largely due to wildfires. To understand how this change has been captured in public discourse, we use frame analysis of articles in two national U.S. newspapers—the New York Times and USA Today—to trace the evolution of the social problem framing of PM2.5 from 2013 to 2024. PM2.5 was framed as a health threat and governance problem, and while 2016 marks the reversal of the nationwide trend of declining PM2.5, 2020 is the inflection point when coverage increased, and environmental justice framing became salient. We explain these changes as the consequence of a convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, major wildfires, and regulatory rollbacks that rendered PM2.5 more salient because of heightened public interest in airborne threats and growing awareness of racial inequality. Our study elucidates how intersecting crises can increase the media visibility of environmental health risks.",

This paper identifies bots as a major influence in digital protest ecologies, and responds by updating the Discursive Opportunity Structure (DOS) theoretical framework - focusing on its core dimensions of visibility, resonance, and legitimacy. To ground this theoretical development, we apply this revised framework through computer-assisted content analysis of bot activity in two major protests: Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Extinction Rebellion (XR). Rather than treating bots as a monolithic influence, we identify competing bot strategies with distinct discursive impacts. In BLM, supportive bots enhance cultural resonance, while counter-bots target movement legitimacy. In XR, pro-protest bots work to establish legitimacy and participatory visibility, whereas counter-bots strategically manipulate issue salience. These findings show that any serious understanding of contemporary movements must recognise how bot activity shapes discourse - steering public perception, influencing movement trajectories, and impacting protest outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Purpose--Texas House Bill 5 (2013) introduced the Foundation High School Program, requiring students to select an endorsement—a curricular concentration similar to a major. Although intended to expand flexibility and align coursework with college and workforce pathways, the STEM endorsement may function as a new form of tracking. Guided by Oakes and colleagues’ work on tracking and detracking and by Domina et al.’s application of categorical inequality theory to education, this study examines which students complete a STEM endorsement and how this choice shapes college enrollment outcomes.\n\nResearch Methods--We combine a content analysis of Texas college-admissions requirements with administrative data from the Houston Independent School District. Logistic and multinomial models estimate predictors of STEM endorsement completion and college choice, and nonlinear variance decomposition analyses assess how STEM–non-STEM differences in college enrollment are explained by background characteristics.\n\nFindings--The STEM endorsement aligns closely with selective college admissions. Academic factors strongly predict STEM completion, and while the endorsement is associated with enrollment at selective colleges, this relationship is largely explained by prior academic achievement. High-achieving students are more likely to pursue the STEM endorsement, which accounts for its link to selective college enrollment.\n\nImplications--The STEM endorsement operates less as a pathway for broadening opportunity and more as a marker of academic prestige. As a surface-level policy reform, the endorsement system reconstitutes familiar tracking dynamics under a new label, reinforcing educational stratification by privileging students with stronger preparation.",

          "abstract": "The AI landscape has been changing dramatically with the growth of generative AI, and many governments, sector bodies, and individual organisations are working in parallel to stake out their own visions of ethical and responsible AI use. Statements, guidelines, and policies on responsible AI have proliferated in the last five years, yet clarity remains elusive on what ‘responsible AI’ means or how to put it into practice. Research to date has not examined how the principles and practices of responsible AI may vary across sector, an increasingly important concern as AI use grows throughout the economy and society. In this article, we empirically examine inter- and intra-sectoral variance in the principles articulated for responsible AI in organisational policies. We analysed 80 documents from organisations in 8 sectors, focusing on policies current at the time of the 2024 AI Seoul Summit. Our content analysis identified 31 distinct principles in these policies, only ten of which appeared in more than 50% of the documents. We found clear sectoral differences in the principles invoked for responsible AI, as well as the audiences who were intended to engage with putting those principles into practice. Our analysis focused on organisations shaping responsible AI in a single nation, the United Kingdom, but our findings illustrate the admixture of national and international actors affecting AI practice. Our findings show that responsible AI is increasingly fragmented, and that an understanding of sector-level variation is essential to shaping the future of responsible AI.",

The questionnaire was sent to 16 200 persons aged 18-80 living in Finland. The sample included native speakers of Finnish, Swedish and other languages. Some 3299 respondents answered the questionnaire, i.e., the response rate was 20 percent. The sample represents the target population well in relation to gender, region, and main activity. The largest challenges relate to the overrepresentation of highly educated and the underrepresentation of non-Finnish and -Swedish speakers. These patterns, however, are typical in survey research. The survey will be linked to administrative data. Taken together, the data helps to understand how resources, well-being and social attitudes change over time. This information is crucial for addressing challenges and opportunities of the Finnish society.",

          "abstract": "Purpose--Texas House Bill 5 (2013) introduced the Foundation High School Program, requiring students to select an endorsement—a curricular concentration similar to a major. Although intended to expand flexibility and align coursework with college and workforce pathways, the STEM endorsement may function as a new form of tracking. Guided by Oakes and colleagues’ work on tracking and detracking and by Domina et al.’s application of categorical inequality theory to education, this study examines which students complete a STEM endorsement and how this choice shapes college enrollment outcomes.\n\nResearch Methods--We combine a content analysis of Texas college-admissions requirements with administrative data from the Houston Independent School District. Logistic and multinomial models estimate predictors of STEM endorsement completion and college choice, and nonlinear variance decomposition analyses assess how STEM–non-STEM differences in college enrollment are explained by background characteristics.\n\nFindings--The STEM endorsement aligns closely with selective college admissions. Academic factors strongly predict STEM completion, and while the endorsement is associated with enrollment at selective colleges, this relationship is largely explained by prior academic achievement. High-achieving students are more likely to pursue the STEM endorsement, which accounts for its link to selective college enrollment.\n\nImplications--The STEM endorsement operates less as a pathway for broadening opportunity and more as a marker of academic prestige. As a surface-level policy reform, the endorsement system reconstitutes familiar tracking dynamics under a new label, reinforcing educational stratification by privileging students with stronger preparation.",
