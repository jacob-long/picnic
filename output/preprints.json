          "authors": "Martin Bulla; Peter Mikula",
          "abstract": "Research funding schemes are increasingly struggling to reliably distinguish scientific merit through traditional scoring. Using the most recent evaluations of the EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions postdoctoral fellowships as a case study, we show how the rapid institutional adoption of Large Language Models coincides with unprecedented score compression. With only ~5% of proposals now falling below the 70% quality threshold, down from ~20% in previous years. We argue that “excellence saturation” has reached a tipping point that exposes the structural limits of fine-grained peer review and alters reviewer decision-making dynamics where funding decisions resemble a lottery. This shift to AI-assisted grant writing effectively decouples a proposal’s form from its scientific substance, necessitating a transition from fine-grained ranking toward managing an abundance of excellence through alternative allocation mechanisms, such as funding lotteries.",

          "abstract": "Objective\nTo determine whether an open science checklist can be useful for predicting the reproducibility of publications resulting from these grant proposals when used by grant referees assessing them.\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis is a comparative accuracy study design using funded grant proposals obtained from online sources (i.e., Open Grants, RIO Journal, NIH, and Grantome). Two independent groups of mock referees assessed open science practices in the proposals and predicted whether the resulting publications would be reproducible, with one group using an Open Science checklist as an intervention, and the other without. Then we attempted to reproduce the primary findings of a resulting publication from the grant proposal. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and overall accuracy were calculated from 2×2 tables, comparing predicted versus actual reproducibility. The primary outcome is the level of reproducibility, measured by the predictive value, the proportion of (non)reproducible study findings that are accurately predicted. This study was conducted between April and September 2025.\n\nResults \nOf seven out of 101 publications (6.9%, 95% CI 2.8–13.8%), the primary results could be reproduced. When using the checklist, only 16.8% of the proposals were expected to be reproducible, while without the checklist 75.2% were expected to be reproducible. When using the checklist, 17 proposals were expected to be reproducible, while only 2 out of these 17 could actually be reproduced (positive predictive value (PPV) 11.8% (95% CI 3.3–34.3%)). Without using the checklist, 76 proposals were thought to be reproducible, while only six out of 76 could actually be reproduced (PPV 7.9% (95% CI 3.7−16.2%)). Sensitivity analysis by research field was not conducted because of small sample sizes in most categories.\n\nConclusion \nThe Open Science checklist has a low positive predictive value, as expected given the low reproducibility prevalence in our sample. Although the differences between the group using the checklist and the group that did not use the checklist may also have been caused by their level of knowledge of reproducibility and open science, neither group could predict which proposals would or would not be reproducible.",

          "authors": "Chi Zhang; Jeffery CH Chan; Janna Hastings; Frank Lin; Justin Presseau; Guillaume Fontaine; Susan Michie; Natalie Taylor",
          "abstract": "Background\nDespite rapid scientific advancements that generate clinical interventions to optimize disease prevention, diagnostics, and treatments, significant gaps remain between evidence and clinical adoption. Implementation science evaluates targeted strategies systematically designed to promote the adoption, integration, and sustainment of evidence-based interventions, programs, and policies in real-world settings. However, identifying and coding factors associated with implementation success reported in the literature is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate and scale this process. We aimed to evaluate the potential of LLMs to accurately extract determinants associated with implementation in oncology aligned with a well-recognized implementation framework. \nMethods\nThis validation study compared the performance of a Llama-based LLM with manual extraction of barriers and facilitators from twelve published studies, including oncology-focused implementation studies (containing structured implementation data) and published clinical intervention studies (containing unstructured implementation data). An ontology-based schema guided data structuring and three prompting strategies – zero-shot (task instructions only), few-shot (task instructions plus illustrative examples), and chain-of-thought (CoT; instructs the model to generate step-by-step reasoning) – were evaluated to assess extraction performance. Semantic similarity between LLM-generated and human-coded outputs was assessed using both human rating and automated rating with a sentence transformer model.\nResults\nA total of 144 extraction outputs were generated. For implementation science studies, zero-shot prompting achieved the highest average semantic similarity for both barriers and facilitators, outperforming few-shot and CoT prompting. In clinical intervention studies, few-shot prompting led with average similarity scores of 0.78 (barriers) and 0.76 (facilitators) via sentence transformer, and 0.68/0.67 via human rating, surpassing zero-shot and CoT. Across all prompting approaches, human ratings were slightly lower than automated ratings, reflecting a more conservative scoring pattern rather than differences in performance quality. Overall, the LLM reduced annotation time by approximately 75–95%, decreasing per article coding from several hours to under 20 minutes.\nConclusion\nLLMs can support extraction of implementation science determinants, with optimal prompting strategies varying by study type. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting showed modest but inconsistent performance differences, suggesting context-dependent utility. In contrast, CoT prompting lacked consistent benefits, highlighting the need for broader model comparisons, improved prompt design, and larger gold-standard datasets.",

          "authors": "Susan E. Brennan; Gisele Muller-Parker",
          "abstract": "This paper identifies striking selection biases based on STEM field of study in the 2025 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) competition. Since 1952, GRFP has recruited “the best and the brightest” early-career individuals into STEM careers by providing support for them to attend graduate programs and to pursue research of their choice. The fellowship was founded to support talented people rather than particular research projects, with awardees going on to win Nobel prizes and lead innovation in U.S. science and engineering. Not only did 2025 see major cuts to the number of GRFP awards, but for the first time there was a finger on the scale: rather than recognizing talent across all STEM fields of basic research, the 2025 GRFP competition prioritized a narrow set of “priority areas.” We curated the publicly available data from 2025’s unprecedented two-step release of results (only 1,000 awards in April rather than the 2,300 projected, followed by another 500 in June) in order to identify and analyze bias in the selection process. The distribution of awards among fields of study appeared to depart significantly from previous years, when numbers of awardees within fields of study were driven primarily by application pressure. We found particularly strong bias in the second release of awards, which excluded the life sciences entirely—even though the life sciences had the highest number of applications. We discuss the risks of redefining NSF’s long-standing GRFP funding policy in order to favor narrow sectors of the STEM research workforce while disadvantaging other fields. Although the favored fields, artificial intelligence and quantum science, are national priorities, it is counterproductive for GRFP to prioritize them, as merit is independent of an early-career applicant’s field of study. We discuss the potential harm of such biases for seeding innovation in science as well as for broadening participation of women and others in basic research and the U.S. STEM workforce.",

          "authors": "Na Hu; Paul - Christian Bürkner; Amalia Arvaniti",
          "abstract": "Purpose: When studying how factors influence multiple outcomes (e.g., acoustic measures in phonetics), researchers often analyze each outcome separately using a univariate approach. However, this approach ignores relationships between outcomes, which can reduce estimate accuracy and make it difficult to examine how effects are related across outcomes. A multivariate approach addresses these issues by modelling all outcomes jointly. This tutorial illustrates how to fit Bayesian multivariate linear mixed effects models using the R package brms.\nMethod: We present three example applications in phonetic research, using a corpus of Greek utterances. We focus on a rising accent, that is, a deliberate f_0 movement temporally aligned with a word’s stressed syllable and used to highlight that word in speech. Specifically, we examine whether the phonetic characteristics of the rising accent depend on two factors: (a) the presence of a preceding accent within the same utterance, and (b) the location of the stress in the accented word relative to its final syllable.\nResults: The multivariate approach reduced uncertainty in population-level effect estimates compared to univariate models and provided a convenient way to examine correlations among effects across outcomes.\nConclusions: This tutorial provides guidance on implementing Bayesian multivariate linear mixed effects models and demonstrates their potential.",

          "abstract": "Assessment and identification of language and reading disabilities among young bilingual children represents a significant challenge. Research indicates that language and reading disabilities are frequently misidentified in this population (e.g., Mancilla-Martinez et al., 2023). Misidentification of language and reading disabilities has serious consequences, as children with significant learning needs may not receive appropriate supports. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify which kindergarten early language and literacy measures have good classification accuracy for predicting first grade reading difficulty among Spanish-English bilingual children. Two hundred twenty children across South Carolina and Texas participated in this study. Children were enrolled in kindergarten, when they completed measures of oral language and early literacy skills in Spanish and English, and followed through first grade, when they completed measures of Spanish and English reading skills. Approximately 60% of the sample was enrolled in dual language instructional programs, and the remainder of the sample was enrolled in English-only programs. Results indicated that kindergarten English rapid letter naming had strong classification accuracy for distinguishing risk for dyslexia at the end of first grade among children enrolled in Spanish-English dual language instruction. However, no measures had strong classification accuracy for distinguishing children at risk for reading difficulty in English-only instructional contexts. These results have clear practical implications for screening bilingual students for risk for dyslexia and highlight the importance of considering language of instruction when evaluating risk for reading difficulty.",

          "authors": "David Ruttenberg",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems are rapidly becoming embedded in research and knowledge work, promising efficiency gains but potentially accumulating hidden cognitive costs. This paper proposes the concept of cognitive debt—the delayed cost to attention, learning, and mental health from chronic reliance on AI that reduces active cognitive engagement. Drawing on cognitive neuroscience, human factors research, and occupational mental health literature, this theoretical analysis synthesizes emerging evidence suggesting how AI-mediated work may erode sustained attention, displace effortful learning, and contribute to “silent burnout,” particularly among neurodivergent professionals operating near sensory and attentional limits. A threshold transition model formalizes the proposal that three mechanisms—attentional erosion, effort displacement, and affective depletion—operate additively until exceeding individual capacity thresholds, at which point acceleration toward burnout may become non-linear. This framework is situated within predictive processing accounts of cognitive control, where passive AI offloading is conceptualized as maladaptive precision-weighting over internal versus external models. Three patterns of AI use are distinguished—passive offloading, guided co-construction, and reflective scaffolding—that are predicted to differentially contribute to or mitigate cognitive debt. The paper concludes by reframing design principles as testable hypotheses, proposing a minimal measurement battery, and outlining a multi-site Cognitive Debt Observatory to build systematic evidence. Implications for theories of attention, methodological practices in cognitive science, and research integrity frameworks are discussed. Without deliberate intervention, unreflective AI reliance may risk systematic intellectual atrophy in research ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "With prosocial action, there are both benefits to society and personal costs to those who act. We document a “many-one effect” in how people weigh these costs and benefits when assessing others’ actions. For example, people might believe the expected air-quality benefits outweigh the personal inconvenience to 10,000 people walking to work instead of driving, but not one person. More generally, people more often judge the combined prosocial benefits to outweigh the combined personal costs when there are many actors than when there is just one (or a few). We find support for this hypothesis across 13 experiments (N = 8,402), including samples of adults and children, individualistic and collectivistic sample populations, elected policymakers, and lawyers and judges, in both between-subjects and within-subjects designs, and in both judgments of hypothetical scenarios and real decisions about how other participants should spend bonus payments. The many-one effect persists in scenarios designed to limit rational justifications, e.g., when each additional actor has a smaller marginal impact (Experiments 2A-2E). We propose that this effect arises from “differential scope sensitivity.” Compared to personal costs, the societal benefits can more easily be compared to the size of the societal problem (Experiment 2F), which will make people more scope sensitive to them.",

          "authors": "Julien Lie-Panis; Christian Hilbe",
          "abstract": "People do not just cooperate — they regularly invest in their cooperative abilities. Partners learn to resolve conflicts, colleagues train for their roles within large teams, and people adopt the shared practices of their community. \nOften, these activities do not benefit others per se. Rather they facilitate future cooperative interactions. Yet such cooperation investments are rarely captured in evolutionary game theory, which focuses on cooperative decisions instead of the preparatory efforts that enable them. Here, we develop a model that allows individuals to incur upfront costs to lower their future cooperation costs. Through mathematical analysis and evolutionary simulations, we show that cooperation investments serve a dual function. First, they allow individuals to transform into more effective partners, enabling cooperation where it would otherwise be too costly. Second, they can serve as honest signals of cooperative intent. When their costs deter would-be cheaters, investments allow observers to identify trustworthy partners, further expanding the cooperative domain. Our model helps to explain why people are attentive to others’ cooperation investments. When someone takes the time to learn more about a partner's hobbies or a community's norms, they do more than build capacity — they signal an intent to cooperate with us.",

Using snowball sampling, we recruited 58 stakeholders to complete either semi-structured individual interviews or focus groups in Arabic. Thematic analysis by bilingual coders identified key themes around participants’ definitions of digital wellbeing, perceived positive and negative impacts of digital media use, suggested strategies to regulate digital media use, and potential intervention pathways to promote digital wellbeing in Saudi society. Stakeholders emphasized a multi-level approach that integrates self-regulation, school- and family-based intervention components, community activities, and general awareness campaigns as essential for addressing problematic digital media use.

          "abstract": "Understanding the interplay of persons, situations, and behavior (the Personality Triad) is a key task of psychology. However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

          "authors": "James Downs; Anna Carnegie; Mollie Twitchell; Bella Reed; David Morris; David Viljoen; Samuel Chawner; Agnes Ayton",
          "abstract": "The concept of “Restrictive Intake Self-Harm” (“RISH”) has recently been introduced to conceptualise divergent and/or complex presentations of restrictive eating behaviours as a form of self-harm, rather than symptoms of an eating disorder. Whilst this may represent a well-intentioned response to poorly met clinical needs, it also raises significant conceptual, ethical, and clinical concerns. This paper, written by authors with clinical, academic, and lived experience, situates “RISH” within a broader history of classificatory innovation in eating disorders, whereby new terminology has been introduced with insufficient empirical support and a lack of co-production with people with lived experience. Our analysis highlights the unintended consequences of this approach and how conflating restriction with self-injurious behaviour risks conceptual ambiguity, diagnostic misclassification, and the diversion of patients away from specialist services and evidence-based treatments that may benefit them. We advocate an empirical, data-driven approach to understanding the heterogeneous nature of restrictive eating and its diverse psychological, social, and cultural drivers across diagnoses. In clinical practice, greater skill in differential diagnosis and collaborative, individualised formulation is needed, alongside reform of service design to facilitate more integrated care. Vitally, terminology and care pathways for disordered eating need to be meaningfully co-produced with the people who need them, recognising the plurality and legitimacy of experiential knowledge as central to creating more inclusive and attuned care.",

There is talk of AI providing cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s disease, solving the climate crisis, and bringing about a utopian future of unlimited abundance.

It also presents an existential threat to our species. Leaders in the field, including CEOs of major AI companies, acknowledge these risks.

First, we used one task – the AX-CPT – with different stimulus materials (letters, words, dot patterns, matrices, and pictures). In this task, a target response is required in trials where two specific stimuli occur in sequence (e.g., the letter “A” followed by the letter “X”). In all other trials, a non-target response is required. Second, we disentangled proactive control (goal maintenance) from reactive control (goal reactivation) by computing separate indices for each process. Using data from 667 young adults, we obtained good reliability for most indices. Structural equation modeling identified models with factors representing shared variance across stimulus materials. In a subsequent analysis, we bypassed the indices by modeling proactive and reactive control directly from error rates and response times. Using a bifactor modeling approach, we found shared variance across stimulus materials for error rates only. However, in both analyses, the pattern of latent correlations contradicted the expectations. For example, a positive and very high correlation was observed between indices representing proactive and reactive control. Overall, these findings question the validity of AX-CPT measures, suggesting that the task cannot resolve the measurement problem in attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Anatomical features that define facial identity also influence how a face moves during expres- sion. This overlap suggests the visual system might form expectations about facial motion based on shape. However, recent theories propose that facial shape and motion are processed in independent brain pathways. We used reverse correlation to test whether expectations about natural facial movement are shaped by facial structure, and vice versa. Participants judged syn- thetic dynamic faces with randomly varying shape or motion. We estimated expected speed of facial expression components and compared these across different identities. We also identified shape features used for face recognition and assessed whether these changed with familiar ver- sus unfamiliar motion. Our results show that expectations of natural motion during expression are influenced by face shape, but the shape features used for identification remain stable across motion contexts. We interpret these findings within the independent pathways framework, suggesting a form of motion-from-structure processing.",

In four studies using modified Dictator Games, we find that people prefer blended explanations and use these explanations in their sanctioning decisions. In Studies 1 (N = 500) and 2, (N = 470, census-matched in the U.S), we found that people were willing to change the rules for an unfair game (vs. punished individuals), when they were randomly assigned a bad system (vs. bad actor) explanation for identical unfair offers. However, people preferred to explain unfairness as the result of both a bad actor and bad system, and preferred to enact system-level change, even after they had already punished the Allocator (Study 3, N = 404), or when the outcome was uncertain (Study 4, N = 401). This research challenges the assumption that sanctioning decisions reflect single attributional preferences and that addressing one source of unfairness satiates punishment motives.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Verbal fluency requires generating items according to specific rules. While semantic fluency is often preserved in dyslexia and stuttering, phonemic fluency is typically impaired. Most research, however, focuses on total word counts rather than underlying mechanisms. \nMethod: This online study compared 62 dyslexic adults, 62 adults who stutter (AWS), and 62 neurotypical adults using typed verbal fluency and mouse-drawn design fluency tasks. Design fluency assessed whether impairments stemmed from general executive control or specific phonological deficits. \nResults: Using hierarchical regression, we observed that dyslexia and stuttering predicted lower correct output for phonemic fluency but did not predict scores on the semantic or design fluency tasks. At a finer-grained level, dyslexia and stuttering both predicted a smaller number of switches between subcategories on the phonemic fluency task, whereas stuttering also predicted the size of phonemically-related clusters of items. \nConclusion: Overall, these results indicate that the executive fluency impairment found in dyslexia is related to accessing phonological representations, whereas adults who stutter have an impairment in terms of the phonological representation. These findings suggest that despite similar phonological impairments, the phonological mechanisms in dyslexia and stuttering are distinct, necessitating specialized clinical interventions.",

          "abstract": "Resistance to artificial intelligence (AI) is widespread and persists even when known psychological barriers are removed. What explains this persistent aversion? Across four studies, we investigate whether moral reactions to AI—rooted in deeply held beliefs about right and wrong—help explain resistance beyond pragmatic concerns. In Study 1, we analyzed all news headlines in a major US media corpus (COCA, 2018–2024) and found that AI is moralized at levels comparable to GMOs and vaccines—technologies whose moral opposition has received considerable attention—and that surges in moralization followed the launch of major AI applications such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. In Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, representative samples of Americans reported their attitudes toward several AI applications and other technologies. Although few participants opposed AI outright, most opponents indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial—suggesting moral rather than pragmatic roots. Structural equation models revealed that moralization of AI was best captured by a single latent factor, indicating a generalized moral sentiment rather than domain-specific risk–benefit appraisals. Qualitative analyses further uncovered the most common justifications people invoke and how opponents and supporters differ in their reasoning. In Study 4, participants from Studies 2b and 3 completed a subsequent behavioral grading task; moralization scores measured in the earlier surveys predicted greater reluctance to use AI even when doing so would benefit participants (a one standard deviation increase in moralization corresponded to 42% decrease in AI usage). Together, these findings demonstrate that resistance to AI is partly moral in nature, suggesting that reaping the potential benefits of AI tools may require addressing moral concerns rather than relying solely on pragmatic arguments.",

          "abstract": "Defensive responses to threat are critical for survival and often involve freezing-like behavior, which has been linked to action preparation. However, it remains unclear how this preparatory mechanism is influenced by unpredictable aversive stimuli that are difficult to discriminate or anticipate. In this study, we introduce a modified paradigm to examine how freezing-like behavior is affected by action preparation under temporal threat predictability, unpredictability, and safety. Using a multimodal approach in a large sample (n = 235, 148 female), we assessed postural sway and heart rate as markers of freezing-like behavior, alongside skin conductance levels, electromyographic startle responses, behavioral performance, and subjective ratings. Behaviorally, participants responded faster but less accurately under threat compared to safety, replicating previous findings. Physiologically, threat conditions were associated with both parasympathetically mediated postural freezing and sympathetically driven increases in skin conductance. Importantly, the temporal (un)predictability of threat did not modulate freezing-like behavior or skin conductance responses. Startle responses were generally inhibited during all conditions (threat and safety) relative to the inter-trial interval. These findings indicate that action preparation under threat involves concurrent activation of both parasympathetic (postural freezing) and sympathetic systems (skin conductance), consistent with animal models of freezing. The absence of modulation by temporal threat unpredictability may be indicative of a generalized defensive mode that prioritizes readiness over specificity.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, ratings of teaching quality have been used to assess why some teachers are more effective than others. Nowadays, the focus of teaching quality research is shifting; Teachers’ adaptation of instruction to students and interactions between teacher and student behaviors are used increasingly to explain effective teaching. Uncertainty remains about the extent to which teachers adapt their instruction to students. Additionally, it is unclear which assessment scales measure stable teacher traits and which measures are affected by students. To address these questions, we conducted a quasi-experiment involving 146 German and math teachers and 3,980 of their students from various educational tracks in Germany. Teachers either taught the same group of students for two consecutive years or different groups each year. A difference-in-differences approach was employed to determine whether teaching quality ratings were more consistent when teachers taught the same group than when they taught different groups at both timepoints. Results suggest that especially student ratings of teaching quality and teacher ratings of student disruptions are affected by different student groups. Teachers’ ratings of their own instructional behaviors, however, are less affected. We discuss the causal informativeness of our findings regarding teachers’ instructional behaviors and give recommendations on how to interpret associations between different assessments of teaching quality with student outcomes.",

In this work, we provide a framework for defining, measuring, and uncovering the elements of unusualness. First, we define unusualness as the extent to which an individual’s personality deviates from that of others in the population, either through rare expression of individual variables (unusual values) or through atypical co-occurrence of multiple variables (unusual combinations), and distinguish it from related concepts in personality research. Second, we introduce and compare various methods to measure unusualness in a simulation study and demonstrate how reliability and validity of unusualness measures can be established. Third, we propose methods to uncover the elements of unusualness (i.e., unusual values, unusual combinations) and validate these methods through simulation. Fourth, we illustrate our framework using three empirical datasets (combined N = 1,834) and multiple assessment methods, showing that unusualness can be reliably measured and offering first insights into its generalizability, nomological network, incremental validity, and possible explanatory factors. Finally, we outline conceptual, methodological, and empirical directions for future research on unusualness.",

          "abstract": "Confidence, the “feeling of knowing” that accompanies every cognitive process, plays a critical role in human reinforcement learning; yet its computational bases in learning scenarios have only recently begun to be studied. Prior work has distinguished between value confidence (certainty in value estimates) and decision confidence (certainty that a choice is correct), but how these two forms of confidence are computed and interact has not been directly tested. Here we combine two experiments and previously published datasets to test competing computational hypotheses. We find that value confidence is best explained by a Bayesian computation reflecting the precision of value estimates, and that it adaptively guides behaviour by reducing exploration and promoting exploitation as certainty increases. In contrast, decision confidence departs from Bayesian predictions, especially on errors. A hybrid model integrating Bayesian probability with the precision of the decision variable better accounts for decision confidence. Moreover, the relative weights assigned to these two sources of information characterize individual differences in confidence reporting and, in addition, they are predictive of task and metacognitive performance, where the more Bayesian the subject, the higher the performance. Together, these results provide a unified computational mechanism through which distinct forms of confidence shape learning and choices in uncertain environments.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation difficulties are widely recognised as transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying emotional disorders, yet the role of beliefs about the usefulness of emotions remains underexplored. This study investigated whether beliefs that emotions are useless contribute to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders via secondary emotions (i.e. emotions about emotions, such as feeling guilty about feeling angry). A large sample of students (N = 1036) completed validated self-report measures assessing emotion beliefs (EBQ), secondary emotions (DERS), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and eating psychopathology (EDE-Q). Participants with high levels of psychological distress showed significantly stronger emotion uselessness beliefs (η² = .01) and elevated secondary emotions (η²=.16). Mediation analyses revealed secondary emotions significantly mediated relationships between uselessness beliefs and all three conditions, with complete mediation for eating psychopathology. These findings suggest that viewing emotions as harmful or pointless may lead to maladaptive emotional responses, which in turn contribute to psychological distress. The results support the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders as emotional disorders with shared underlying mechanisms and highlight the potential of transdiagnostic interventions targeting emotion beliefs and secondary emotions to improve treatment efficiency across diverse clinical presentations.",

          "abstract": "Visual dominance is a well-documented phenomenon, yet the reasons for such dominance remain unclear. We hypothesise that, specifically in visuo-haptic multisensory scenarios, part of the reason for this dominance is the ecological expectation for the perception of vision to temporally precede the perception of touch. This study investigated whether the order of presented stimuli impacts reaction times using a Virtual Reality (VR) oddball paradigm combined with ultrasound mid-air haptics. Twenty-eight participants responded to target stimuli across four conditions: touch-touch (TT), touch-vision (TV), vision-touch (VT), and vision-vision (VV). We hypothesized that, due to ecological expectation, Vision-then-Touch (VT) priming would be stronger than Touch-then-Vision (TV) due to its ecological expectancy, and that within-modality priming would generally exceed cross-modal priming. Results indicated that participants were significantly slower in VT conditions compared to TV conditions, contradicting the ecological hypothesis. We attribute this to visual dominance, where response times are faster whenever the target stimulus is visual, regardless of priming order. We also found that within-modality priming (VV and TT) elicited significantly faster responses than cross-modality conditions. Interestingly, exploratory analyses found that reaction time differences between conditions were significantly greater in trials where the participants responded to visual stimuli than in trials where participants responded to touch stimuli, suggesting that touch is perceptually more \"stable\" and less susceptible to priming effects than vision. Overall, visual dominance appears to override ecological sequential expectations in multisensory integration, though it is impacted more heavily by priming effects than touch.",

          "authors": "Maël Delem; Marine MAS; Olivier Luminet; Gaën Plancher; Perrine RUBY",
          "abstract": "Several studies have suggested a link between aphantasia (the absence or reduction of visual mental imagery) and alexithymia (the difficulty in identifying and describing one's feelings/emotions, associated with an externally oriented thinking style). However, results and interpretations differ from one study to another, and no consensus emerges from the current literature. To progress on this issue, we sought 1) to gather a large amount of data on aphantasia and alexithymia in the same participants from the most commonly used questionnaires, 2) to group participants into four categories of visual imagery ability as proposed by recent literature on aphantasia (no visual imagery, weak, typical, and excellent visual imagery), and 3) to use non-linear data analysis methods. We combined previously published (N = 1130) and new unpublished data (N = 348) from studies in which participants completed the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire - VVIQ (the higher the score the better the visual imagery ability) and the twenty-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale - TAS-20 (the higher the score the worse the emotional abilities). The total sample comprised 147 aphantasics (no imagery, VVIQ = 16), 141 hypophantasics (weak imagery, 16 &lt; VVIQ &lt; 33), 1115 typical imagers (32 &lt; VVIQ &lt; 75) and 75 hyperphantasics (high imagery, VVIQ &gt; 74). Results showed that among participants able to do visual imagery (from hypo- to hyperphantasia), a negative linear relationship existed between mental imagery and alexithymia, i.e., the higher the VVIQ score, the lower the TAS-20 score. This relation was present for all subscales, but was particularly pronounced for the two TAS-20 scales assessing difficulty in identifying and describing feelings. Importantly, participants with a total inability to produce visual mental images (complete aphantasia, VVIQ = 16) broke this linear relationship and exhibited better emotional abilities than hypophantasics, at a level similar of that of typical imagers. Overall these results support the hypothesis of Kvamme et al. (2026) and suggest that when visual imagery is unavailable, alternative psychophysiological processes develop to process emotions, which are as effective as visual imagery. Our results also suggest that these processes do not develop when imagery is possible, even to a very limited extent, which further argue for fundamental differences between aphantasics and hypophantasics.",

Although CBM-I has shown promise, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear and integration with psychophysiological and neural measures has been limited.\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, eighty-eight participants with high levels of social anxiety completed two lab sessions, an online training in between, and online follow-up. Participants filled out questionnaires, completed interpretation bias tasks, and underwent neuro-psychophysiological assessments. Active CBM-I trained positive resolutions of ambiguous social scenarios, while the sham version used neutral scenarios.\nThe primary outcome, i.e., scores on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), decreased across time in both groups, without group differences. The Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation decreased only in the active group. Interpretation bias shifted more strongly toward positive outcomes in the active group. Autonomic measures confirmed sensitivity to stress induction but did not differentiate between conditions. Electrophysiological results paralleled subjective ratings, as participants exhibited ambivalent responses to socially relevant stimuli but clearly differentiated responses toward neutral stimuli. Baseline correlations indicated strong convergence across self-report and interpretation tasks. Mediation analyses showed that reductions in negative interpretations mediated the effect of the training group on LSAS scores at follow-up.\nThese findings identify interpretation bias as a modifiable mechanism underlying social anxiety and underscore its role as a transdiagnostic marker.

The article also contributes to the production and dissemination of misinformation related to oncology. The authors conducted an analysis of the rhetorical devices and fallacious arguments contained in the article, drawing on established academic approaches, typologies, and reference works. In addition, an analysis of potential breaches of editorial and ethical standards was carried out in comparison with several sets of widely recognized guidelines.\n\nResults and discussion:\n\nThe analysis of the article reveals the use of numerous non-scientific persuasive argumentative strategies (e.g., logical distortions, emotional appeals, diversionary tactics, and discrediting of opponents), as well as several potential shortcomings on the part of both the author and the editorial process with regard to ethical and integrity standards. In particular, the similarities between the analyzed article and misinformation discourse are discussed, along with the potential harmful effects on the credibility of research and healthcare in oncology, and the resulting perspectives for research and for combating misinformation.",

Qualitative analyses suggested possible differences in Stroke and MS for manipulation of MI, while for PD the evidence was contradictory. For imagery generation and maintenance, contradictory evidence for Stroke and MS (stronger towards a difference) was found, while for PD moderate evidence for a difference was found. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing formal syntheses of the evidence. \nConclusion: Differences in specific motor imagery ability domains may be present in people with neurological conditions of different aetiologies.

          "abstract": "This participatory qualitative study explores how autistic adolescents conceptualise inclusion within mainstream secondary schools in England. Against the backdrop of ongoing reforms to Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision, nine autistic pupils co-designed a qualitative study which involved interviewing twenty autistic pupils aged 11-17yrs. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework. Three interrelated themes emerged: (1) “They think it [autism] is some weird thing”—the importance of whole school understanding; (2) “I see being autistic as part of who I am”—affirmation of difference and (3) “School is made for neurotypical pupils”— the need to belong. Collectively, these findings reveal autistic pupils define inclusion as belonging, understanding, and affirmation of difference, rather than assimilation. The study highlights the persistence of deficit-based constructions of autism in schools and calls for a shift towards neurodiversity-informed, co-designed approaches that embed autistic voices at the heart of policy, pedagogy, and practice. By reframing inclusion through the neurodiversity paradigm, the research argues for schools to move from remediation to recognition, creating educational environments where difference is both expected and valued.",

Four conceptions were differentiated: large-class STEMM teaching as presentation; as guided learning and individual reflection; as active participation in a community of learning; and as the promotion of metacognition beyond the curriculum. These conceptions were further dissected in terms of three dimensions of variation comprising interactivity, the role of students, and aims of large STEMM classes. The findings also showed that the teachers' conceptions needed to be understood in relation both to contextual factors and to the extent to which they felt different strategies were accomplishable in particular settings.",

The academic community – especially in health sciences such as psychology – must acknowledge and reduce its environmental impact, largely driven by travel. This study aims to estimate the CO₂-equivalent (CO₂eq) emissions from attendance at major international psychology conferences.\nNumber of in-person/online attendees at major international psychological conferences was determined by web search and email. Conference inclusion criteria: International, psychology/behavioural medicine, 1000+ attendees, years 2023-2025. Total and per capita CO₂eq were estimated for in-person and online attendance based on emissions estimates from 22 in-person and 10 online conference emission publications.\nThe included 21 conferences generated approx. 63,481 tonnes of CO₂eq. A senior scientist attending two such conferences in-person emits approx. 2.51 tCO₂eq annually, already exceeding the individual annual carbon budget compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C target (2.3 tCO₂eq per person/year until 2030).\nThese figures contrast the disproportionate climate impact of frequent academic travel against urgently needed emission reductions. By sharing striking emission estimates from select major conferences – excluding many smaller meetings – we aim to prompt discussion on more sustainable conference and travel choices by scientific organizations and scientists.",

The intervention was conducted across four universities with students, faculty and staff, and was evaluated using pre- and post-test evaluations. The results demonstrate improvements in perceived GRV frequency, detection capacity, preparedness, and self-efficacy, while responsibility and intersectional awareness remained stable. Instead of producing uniform change, the intervention yielded a differentiated pattern of effects that are highly relevant for promoting zero-tolerance educational environments. This pattern underscores that bystander-related outcomes do not evolve homogeneously, but through distinct and temporally differentiated pathways of change.",

Integrating data across six studies from multiple international surveys (N=63,403; 20 countries), expert-coded party systems (71 countries; 14 datasets), and longitudinal panel studies, we demonstrate that individuals with stronger authoritarian orientations are consistently more prone to conspiracism across diverse cultures, political contexts, and time. These results remain robust when controlling for populist attitudes and multiple political, psychological, and demographic variables. The link between authoritarianism and conspiracism appears to constitute a durable and generalizable psychological relationship. This may help explain why conspiratorial narratives and authoritarian politics so often co-occur, with important implications for democratic resilience in an era of rising institutional distrust, anti-scientific attitudes, misinformation, and post-truth politics.",

          "abstract": "THIS PREPRINT IS THE INITIAL SUBMISSION OF A PAPER THAT CURRENTLY UNDERGOES PEER-REVIEW FOR PUBLICATION\nSelf-report questionnaires are widely used in research and practice. In most applications, the vulnerability of these questionnaires to response biases like faking is ignored. However, especially in high-stakes situations such as personnel selection, measurement can be severely biased when test-takers engage in faking to present themselves more favorably. To separate faking-related variance from substantive trait variance, the Multidimensional Nominal Response Model (MNRM) has been used to reduce systematic bias in trait estimation by allowing for item-specific relations between response categories and social desirability. A critical but untested assumption of this approach is that perceptions of social desirability are homogeneous across test-takers. However, individuals may differ considerably in how they perceive the desirability of the item content. Here, we conducted simulation studies to investigate how violations of this assumption affect the MNRM’s ability to recover substantive trait person parameters. We implemented three distinct manipulations of heterogeneous desirability perceptions and examined their impact on person parameter recovery. Results showed that the MNRM is robust against violations of homogeneous social desirability perceptions as long as test-takers’ faking behavior is aligned with their perceived desirability of the item content. In contrast, when test-takers fake responses in ways that are inconsistent with item-wise desirability perceptions, parameter recovery seems to decline. Implications for practice and possible model extensions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "A transtheoretical framework for dissociation acknowledges emotional regulation. However, interoception—closely linked to emotional and autonomic regulation—remains underexplored, despite growing evidence connects it to dissociation and its correlates. This study applied a network analysis to examine multidirectional associations among dissociation, trauma exposure, post-traumatic symptoms, sleep quality, and interoception. A cross-sectional design was employed in a community sample of 574 adults (18–60 years) from Upper Silesia, Poland. Participants completed validated self-report measures of dissociative experiences (Dissociative Experiences Scale; Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire), interoception (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness; Body Perception Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), trauma exposure (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5), post-traumatic stress symptoms (International Trauma Questionnaire), and demographic and health variables.\nThe network was estimated using a graphical Gaussian model with the graphical LASSO algorithm. Absorption showed the highest strength and expected influence, affective dysregulation the greatest closeness and betweenness, while autonomic reactivity and emotional awareness also emerged as highly central nodes. Contrary to theoretical expectations derived from post-traumatic and sociocognitive models, neither trauma exposure nor sleep quality occupied central positions in the network.\nThese findings suggest that dissociation may be more tightly embedded in interoceptive and autonomic regulatory processes than in trauma exposure per se. Atypical interoception may represent a transdiagnostic mechanism linking posttraumatic and sociocognitive accounts of dissociation, while aligning with attachment-based perspectives emphasizing disrupted bodily and affective co-regulation. These results provide a rationale for incorporating interoceptive-focused interventions in the treatment of dissociative symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have underscored the importance of academic advisors to attend to culture for graduate student success and development, yet research examining cultural processes within the advisory relationship is limited. In contrast, the Multicultural Orientation (MCO) framework has been increasingly applied to examine and further understand cultural processes as they unfold in therapeutic relationships and clinical supervisory relationships. Given existing literature on the importance of addressing culture within the advisory relationship and the positive influence of therapist and supervisor MCO on various client and trainee outcomes, this study extends the MCO framework to examine the effect of advisor MCO on the advisory alliance. Data for this study consisted of 343 doctoral advisees and 187 advisors across 45 APA-accredited Counseling Psychology (CP) programs in the United States. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the effect of partitioned variance components of advisees’ perceptions of their advisor MCO: within-advisor MCO, between-advisor MCO, and between-faculty MCO, as well as the interaction between these components on the advisory alliance. Results indicated significant and positive MCO-alliance effects within-advisor, between-advisor, and between-faculty for cultural humility and cultural comfort. More specifically, advisees who perceived their advisor to be more culturally humble and culturally comfortable compared to the perceptions of other advisees of the same advisor, rated the advisory alliance higher. Similarly, advisors that were perceived higher in cultural humility and cultural comfort compared to other advisors were rated higher on the advisory alliance (between-advisor). Lastly, advisees’ perceptions of their faculty’s cultural humility and cultural comfort (i.e., aggregated advisee perceptions of the advisors within a CP program faculty) were positively associated with the advisory alliance, meaning that advisees who perceived their faculty-as-a-whole to be higher in cultural humility and cultural comfort compared to other groups of faculty, rated their advisory alliance higher. Regarding cultural opportunities, when advisees rated their advisor higher on cultural opportunities compared to the other advisors, they perceived the advisory alliance to be higher. These preliminary findings lay the foundation for future directions in training practices and research on the importance of cultural processes within the advisory relationship.",

          "abstract": "Chronic stress is a modern health epidemic, yet whether its impairing effects on basic cognitive capacities generalise to higher-order decision-making remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a large (n=355), pre-registered online experiment measuring perceived chronic stress (PCS), five cognitive capacities, and decision-making capacity (via the knapsack optimisation task). This paradigm provides an objective, preference-free measure of decision-making capacity, allowing us to systematically modulate the computational demands of each decision. Surprisingly, in a broadly representative US sample, higher PCS within a `normal' range had no credible relationship with decision-making capacity or cognitive performance, even on computationally demanding decisions. However, post-hoc analyses provided a more nuanced picture, tentatively suggesting that young adults, the tertiary educated, and those with lower processing speed may be more vulnerable to chronic stress's effects. These results challenge a generalised view of stress's impact, hinting at a potential reconciliation of differential effects observed across the literature.",

We conducted five studies to develop and validate the MFPQ (total N = 2,161), using two different sampling platforms to diversify sample characteristics. We showed MFPQ has adequate reliability and validity. Finally, we discussed how this emic MFPQ can be applied in cross-cultural research and argued that MFPQ can contribute to the stringent tests of the Moral Foundations Theory's key claims and support cross-cultural comparisons of its construct.",

          "abstract": "The evidence for the structure of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model relies heavily on analyses of correlations among DSM diagnoses, which entrenches some of their limitations. In this study, we deconstructed the mental disorders covered in HiTOP into individual symptoms—with personality disorders represented via item-level assessment of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders facets—and rebuilt the HiTOP model from the ground up. Participants self-selected into an online mental health study and were randomly split into primary (n = 11,762) and hold-out (n = 3,000) samples to identify a robust hierarchy of empirically derived constructs in the results, ranging from symptoms and syndromes to very broad ‘superspectra’ of psychopathology. In each sample, both hierarchical clustering and hierarchical principal components analyses were used; the final hierarchical structure was derived based on points of cross-sample and cross-method agreement. The resulting model was remarkably similar to the HiTOP model, including nearly all of the same subfactors, spectra, and superspectra—albeit with some reorganisation in the structure. The inclusion of broad hypomania/disinhibition and pathological introversion dimensions represented the most prominent differences compared to the current higher-order structure of HiTOP. The detailed lower-order constructs found here also mirrored many of the existing components and traits in HiTOP, as well as indicating some potential areas for revision. Finally, we re-mapped the disorders included in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 onto the new model. Overall, the results suggest that the structural foundations of the HiTOP model are largely sound.",

Concurrently, the impact extends to families themselves, who must navigate caregiving responsibilities while also requiring support. Understanding these experiences is key to providing more effective assistance in their caregiving roles. Aim: This mixed-methods systematic review aims to investigate the experiences, barriers, and needs of families of young people who self-harm. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted across PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases in July 2024 and April 2025. A total of 31 studies were included in the review, and quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis was employed for the quantitative data, while qualitative data were analysed using thematic synthesis. Results: The quantitative findings revealed two themes: (1) the repercussions of self-harm in the family, and (2) family support needs. Qualitative analysis identified four themes: (1) parents’ emotional and psychological impact; (2) impact on parenting and bond with young person; (3) disruption in wider family dynamics; and (4) barriers to and pathways for support. Conclusion: The review discusses the implications of these findings, offering recommendations for future research and improvements in family support services to alleviate caregiver burden and foster supportive environments for recovery.",

We expected Hispanic participants to have more trust in juries than Black participants (hypothesis 3). However, given inconsistencies in the existing literature, we did not make definitive predictions for Hispanic compared to White participants; they may have less trust in juries than White people (hypothesis 4a) or may not significantly differ from White people (hypothesis 4b).\n\nMethod: Participants were 1,220 adults (406 White, 410 Black, 404 Hispanic) recruited from Prolific Academic (M age = 39.31, 53% female) who rated their trust in juries (α = .97, Bornstein et al., 2020), trust in courts (α = .87, Tyler &amp; Sevier, 2014), and answered exploratory measures about potential mechanisms or consequences related to trust.\n\nResults: Patterns for trust in juries were distinct from those for trust in courts. White and Black participants reported higher trust in juries than Hispanic participants, but White participants reported higher trust in courts than Black and Hispanic participants. There was also an indirect effect on trust in juries through perceived representativeness in which Black and Hispanic participants perceived juries as less representative of their own racial or ethnic group and, in turn, had less trust in juries.\n\nConclusions: Results extend the existing literature on institutional trust by demonstrating unique racial and ethnic patterns on trust in juries. They also underscore the role of perceived representativeness, highlighting the importance of increasing the diversity of juries. Such efforts can increase trust in juries and have downstream effects on legal behaviors.",

          "authors": "James Downs; Anna Carnegie; Mollie Twitchell; Bella Reed; David Morris; David Viljoen; Samuel Chawner; Agnes Ayton",
          "abstract": "The concept of “Restrictive Intake Self-Harm” (“RISH”) has recently been introduced to conceptualise divergent and/or complex presentations of restrictive eating behaviours as a form of self-harm, rather than symptoms of an eating disorder. Whilst this may represent a well-intentioned response to poorly met clinical needs, it also raises significant conceptual, ethical, and clinical concerns. This paper, written by authors with clinical, academic, and lived experience, situates “RISH” within a broader history of classificatory innovation in eating disorders, whereby new terminology has been introduced with insufficient empirical support and a lack of co-production with people with lived experience. Our analysis highlights the unintended consequences of this approach and how conflating restriction with self-injurious behaviour risks conceptual ambiguity, diagnostic misclassification, and the diversion of patients away from specialist services and evidence-based treatments that may benefit them. We advocate an empirical, data-driven approach to understanding the heterogeneous nature of restrictive eating and its diverse psychological, social, and cultural drivers across diagnoses. In clinical practice, greater skill in differential diagnosis and collaborative, individualised formulation is needed, alongside reform of service design to facilitate more integrated care. Vitally, terminology and care pathways for disordered eating need to be meaningfully co-produced with the people who need them, recognising the plurality and legitimacy of experiential knowledge as central to creating more inclusive and attuned care.",

While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions).  This paper's main contributions are drawing attention to downstream effects of confusion errors, and providing an approach to measure and potentially recover from these errors. Specifically, we use a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. By fitting a joint model of speech behavior and algorithm behavior on real and simulated data, we show that classification errors can significantly distort estimates for both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and a slightly more accurate open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system). We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning methods, like decision trees and random forests, allow researchers to investigate complex non-linear and interaction effects, making them valuable tools for exploring complex psychological processes. Recently, attempts have been made to extend decision tree methods (multilevel-trees) for their application to multilevel data, e.g., with level-1 (e.g., students) and level-2 (e.g., classes) units. While these adaptations include adding random effects to address lack of independence between observations, they do not consider the influence of the levels at which predictor variables operate. We investigate how predictor level (level-1 vs. level-2) and clustering (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), number of clusters, cluster size) affect inference and prediction in six tree-based methods: rpart, ctree, REEMtree, REEMctree, MERT, and lmertree. Using simulation studies, we evaluate variable selection, predictive performance (PMSE, r2), and predictive contribution of single predictor variables. Our results show that both standard and multilevel-tree methods are seriously affected by the level of the predictor variables and clustering in the data regarding prediction and inference. In particular, the risk of falsely selecting non-informative level-2 predictors is substantial, especially when the ICC is high. Ignoring the multilevel structure of the data might lead to erroneous research conclusions even though multilevel tree methods are applied.",

Comparisons focused on: those with daily cannabis use and CHS symptoms (n = 191) vs those with daily cannabis use without CHS symptoms (n = 882), those with past year cannabis use but not daily use (less-than-daily) (n = 1288), and those without past year cannabis use (n = 4673).\nMeasurements: Survey items assessed substance use, common psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, and symptoms of CHS. Group differences were estimated using logistic and linear regression models. \nFindings: Those with CHS symptoms reported the highest rates and greatest variety of drug use compared to others who used cannabis. Those with CHS symptoms reported higher rates of other drug use than those who used cannabis daily without CHS symptoms across a variety of drug classes, including opioids (OR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.49, 5.78), hallucinogens (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.35, 3.68), and sedatives (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.06, 2.70), as well as higher rates of drug overdoses (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.71, 6.44), and greater use of all drug classes than those with less-than-daily cannabis use.

          "authors": "Marie Hennecke",
          "abstract": "High self-control is widely valued and linked to health, occupational success, and well-being. Despite its popularity as a research topic, major conceptual ambiguities remain. Such inconsistencies are not trivial: they obscure whether researchers study the same phenomenon, weaken construct validity, and produce conflicting findings. Clarifying what self-control is – and is not – is therefore essential for theoretical progress. Key issues concern whether self-control is best understood as an ability or a personality trait, and whether we should conceive of effortless habits as self-control processes.  Another key issue is that some conceptualizations of state self-control (momentary attempts to regulate behavior) show little overlap with trait self-control (being generally good at regulating behavior), although they should be conceptually aligned. Further confusion arises around what constitutes self-control conflict: some definitions include any motivational conflict between goals, others limit it to intertemporal choices where short-term and long-term benefits are opposed, and some require affective components such as desire. This article outlines these definitional problems and proposes clearer conceptual boundaries as a foundation for future theoretical and empirical work and proposes that self-control deals with “intentionally avoiding or attenuating anticipated or resolving present conflicts between two response options in favor of the response option that benefits a more important goal or standard, even though the competing response option represents a momentarily dominant, affectively charged response tendency”.",

Unfortunately, a focus on changing risk perceptions in HIV prevention persist despite limited evidence. In this viewpoint, I describe how an individual-level focus on risk perception fuels stigma while stigma obscures risk perception. I argue that efforts to bolster HIV prevention should focus first and foremost on ascertaining the various determinants of uptake for the various prevention modalities available, and acknowledge that people’s preferences for prevention strategies are neither universal nor static. We should therefore engage in ongoing monitoring of the many sociocognitive and structural determinants of the different prevention modalities over time, and make our sexual health services free from stigma, judgment, and risk eligibility criteria.",

We tested whether initial task difficulty affects children’s affective state, decision dynamics, and willingness to pursue challenging spatial tasks in over 170 children aged 6-8 years. By fitting drift-diffusion models to accuracy and response times, we found that starting with hard problems reduced girls’ processing efficiency and response caution on subsequent hard trials, whereas starting with easier problems selectively increased girls’ caution. Boys’ decision dynamics were largely unaffected by trial sequence. In a second experiment, starting with hard problems increased anxiety and reduced confidence for both genders, but only girls showed reduced willingness to choose harder, higher-reward challenges. These findings identify an early mechanism by which difficulty sequencing shapes gender patterns of cognitive engagement.",

In this work, we provide a framework for defining, measuring, and uncovering the elements of unusualness. First, we define unusualness as the extent to which an individual’s personality deviates from that of others in the population, either through rare expression of individual variables (unusual values) or through atypical co-occurrence of multiple variables (unusual combinations), and distinguish it from related concepts in personality research. Second, we introduce and compare various methods to measure unusualness in a simulation study and demonstrate how reliability and validity of unusualness measures can be established. Third, we propose methods to uncover the elements of unusualness (i.e., unusual values, unusual combinations) and validate these methods through simulation. Fourth, we illustrate our framework using three empirical datasets (combined N = 1,834) and multiple assessment methods, showing that unusualness can be reliably measured and offering first insights into its generalizability, nomological network, incremental validity, and possible explanatory factors. Finally, we outline conceptual, methodological, and empirical directions for future research on unusualness.",

While architectural rhythm is widely acknowledged as an aesthetic principle, little is known about its influence on cognition, specifically memory. This study investigated whether rhythmic spatial configurations affect episodic memory performance. Using Virtual Reality, human participants (N = 128) completed a paired-associate learning task in environments with either rhythmic or arrhythmic architectural features. Participants were tested across immediate recall, delayed recall, free recall, and recognition, with encoding and retrieval contexts systematically varied. Results revealed that rhythmic environments enhanced encoding performance in male participants and acted as contextual cues for recall across genders. Performance was consistently higher when encoding and recall occurred in the same environment, extending classic findings on context-dependent memory to fine-grained architectural features. Exploratory analyses further suggested that upbringing environment through self-reported city complexity may shape sensitivity to spatial rhythms. These findings highlight architectural rhythm as a contextual cue for memory, suggesting that the built environment can influence episodic memory processes even in the absence of movement.",

We investigated how people (N=1,156 Bay Area adults) met their different-race (versus same-race) contacts, the roles that different-race contacts occupied in their personal networks, and the content and quality of their relationships with their different-race contacts. We found that different-race contacts were, on average, “around but not close”. They were met in less intimate settings; they occupied less intimate roles; and they were felt less close to. Importantly, processes varied across people. People who formed cross-race kin relationships were the most likely to have stable cross-race contact, and people who engaged in “high effort” activities with their different-race contacts (e.g., confiding in) had closer relationships with them.

          "abstract": "Digital environments such as video games are central to contemporary life, yet progress in understanding their range of impacts has been hindered by limited data access, skewed funding, imbalanced research agendas, and inadequate coordination between academia, industry, policymakers, and community stakeholders. To address this lack of progress, we conducted a multi-stage modified Delphi study (n = 85 round one; n = 59 round two) followed by an in-person World Café workshop (n = 30) involving experts from most major game studios, international policy bodies, NGOs, research funders, and academia. Across online and in-person stages, participants identified shared priorities for future research and articulated practical steps needed to advance them. Using preferential-rank Single Transferable Vote analysis and reflexive thematic synthesis, we derived four cross-cutting conditions which had general consensus across stakeholders as necessary for coordinated progress: (i) strengthening evidence, (ii) improving communication, (iii) fostering collaboration, and (iv) building literacy. We translate these into a cross-sector roadmap outlining concrete near-, mid-, and long-term actions for researchers, industry, policymakers, funders, and civil society. Although developed in the context of video games, the structural barriers and proposed solutions generalise to behavioural science as a whole. Our findings show that while progress can often be difficult in digital behavioural science, applying the often underutilised Delphi and World Café methods allowed for the creation of both convergent priorities and a concrete path forward that stakeholders across sectors support. We see this as a foundation for building a more cumulative, transparent, and collaborative science of human behaviour in digital environments.",

          "abstract": "We constantly move between rooms, transitioning between spaces with different spatial features. When entering a high-ceilinged space through a lower one, we experience the compression-expansion effect, a well-established architectural principle long used to amplify perceived spaciousness. Despite its prominence in architectural theory and practice, the underlying perceptual psychometrics remain poorly understood. Here we identify and specify the psychometric function governing how sequential changes in ceiling height shape spatial perception. Using immersive virtual reality with freely moving participants, we manipulated room-height ratios and asked participants to adjust perceived room height following exposure to a preceding space. Perception followed a nonlinear sigmoid function rather than geometric scaling, revealing a marked asymmetry: height reductions were perceptually undershot by 33.45% (ratio 0.8), and equivalent increases were overshot by 12.11% (ratio 1.2). These dynamics align with predictive accounts of perception and parallel serial dependence effects in vision, indicating that architectural experience is temporally extended and shaped by prior spatial context. We provide the first quantitative characterization of the compression–expansion effect, transforming a long-standing design principle into an evidence-based model with implications for human experience, material efficiency, and sustainable architectural practice.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Implementation intentions are simple action plans that may help people with lower socio-economic position (SEP) to navigate their behavior in environments that undermine their healthy intentions. Implementation intentions hold potential in being a relatively simple, but remarkedly effective behavior change technique. However, it remains unclear whether such a micro-intervention fits the daily realities, needs and skills of lower SEP groups. We aimed to explore how adults with lower SEP 1) perceive (generating) implementation intentions for changing their health behavior, and 2) independently generate implementation intentions. Methods. Adults living in lower SEP neighborhoods (n = 15) participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants were instructed to think aloud while independently generating an implementation intention following written instructions. Interview data were thematically analyzed, and the plans were evaluated. Results. Participants perceived health as a central value in life, which translated into high readiness for health behavior change. Implementation intentions were perceived as helpful and motivating, because they provide structure, support small, doable steps and stimulate conscious decisions and reflections. Participants expressed strong motivation to use implementation intentions in daily life. However, although participants expressed that generating their plan was pleasant and easy, guidance was frequently requested and provided during plan formation. Besides, generated plans often lacked the essential if-then structure and concreteness. Conclusions. Implementation intentions appear acceptable and appealing as a behavior change strategy for adults with lower SEP. However, independent formation of well-structured, actionable plans is challenging. Guided support is needed to ensure successful use of implementation intentions in lower SEP populations.",

          "abstract": "Theory-driven computational psychiatry attempts to use cognitive models of computation to understand how mental health problems might relate to (or be caused by) changes in cognitive processes such as learning and decision-making. However, the potential applications and relevance of this approach are contingent on several (often implicit) assumptions, including that computational parameters 1) are recoverable, 2) are reliable over time, 3) reflect conceptually similar processes across different tasks, and 4) relate to symptoms. To illustrate and test these assumptions for a selection of commonly used tasks, we recruited a large online sample of participants (n=548), who completed seven mental health questionnaires and five tasks. A subset of n=115 was re-invited to complete the five tasks 14 days later. For each task, five models (including a null model, or model of no interest) were fit and the winning model was selected through Bayesian model comparison. The parameters from the winning models showed good recovery (mean r=0.853, sd=0.135), and good to excellent levels of test-retest reliability (mean ICC=0.635, sd=0.30). Parameters that were theoretically or mathematically similar to each other were, however, generally not related, with relationships only found within the class of ‘inverse temperature’-like parameters (significant r values ranged from 0.11 to 0.23): indicating that in general, parameters do not generalise across task contexts. Finally, only parameters from two of the five tasks (four-armed bandit and cognitive effort) related to symptoms, and these relationships were weak (maximum absolute r values ~0.10). To conclude, it seems that at least some of the implicit assumptions when advocating for the use of computational models in psychiatry are not met for these popular tasks and computational models. This limits the clinical and translational utility of this approach. Computational psychiatry researchers should carefully assess the assumptions and psychometric properties of their tasks and models as part of their early-phase development to ensure robustness of the field going forward.",

We provide AI-generated proof-of-concept examples for each aspect, such as a podcast version of our commentary. While using AI carries risks and ethical challenges, we believe these examples highlight the potential of AI to enhance the inclusivity and reach of academic publishing, which should be considered both within PoPS and beyond.",

To test this, we assigned participants to one of five types of commonly studied norms—conventional, fairness, harm, purity, and generosity—and presented them with eight behaviors, four prescriptive and four proscriptive. To capture differences in belief internalization, participants answered a series of measures for each behavior assessing intrinsic motivation to follow the behaviors, beliefs about the importance of norm adherence (or avoidance), and sensitivity to reputational concerns in their intentions to engage in the behaviors. We had two main findings: First, our measures of internalization varied across behavioral domains, such that harm was generally perceived as the most internalized and conventional behaviors the least. Second, harm perceptions partially mediated differences in intrinsic motivation between harm and several behavioral domains, suggesting that harm perceptions may underlie differences in internalization between social and moral norms. Together, our results reveal important differences in how people perceive social and moral norms, informing our understanding of norm cognition and internalization.",

Using data from the WVS and adopting a multilevel approach (57 countries, N = 73,838), we found that greater personal experience of economic precarity and crime witnessing predicted stronger justification of violence. These relationships were moderated by the country-level socio-ecological roots of honour, defined in terms of national-level low income, unequal distribution of resources, and low adherence to the rule of law, used as proxies of resource scarcity and inadequate law enforcement. In countries with weak socio-ecological roots of honour, personal experiences of precarity and crime were associated with stronger justification of violence, whereas in countries with strong socio-ecological roots of honour, the effect sizes of these associations were negligible. We discuss the social comparison, cultural fit, and cultural backlash hypotheses as potential explanations of the interaction effect observed between nation- and personal-level factors.",

          "authors": "Gina Katharina Goebel; Nicole Krämer",
          "abstract": "Technological innovations repeatedly spark public controversy and often encounter societal resistance, especially regarding perceived risks and benefits. In early phases, when no broad public discourse exists, people are required to engage with new technologies before reliable knowledge or regulatory frameworks are available. Public acceptance thus plays a central role in the successful implementation of emerging technologies. Intuitive perceptions and informational needs are particularly influential in these phases yet remain insufficiently studied. Societal perception thereby becomes a key factor in the success or failure of technological development. This study examines how individuals respond to an emerging, explanation-intensive technology they have never encountered before. Terahertz (THz) serves as an exemplary case: it is largely unknown outside expert circles, yet holds significant potential in areas such as medicine, security, and communication. The analysis is based on 17 semi-structured individual interviews with members of the public without prior technical knowledge. Participants were asked about their general perceptions and attitudes toward emerging technologies, drawing on examples they were familiar with before being introduced to potential applications of THz. The interviews revealed a general openness paired with a strong demand for information about risks, use cases, and societal relevance. Trust in institutions, perceived controllability, data privacy concerns, and emotional reactions to uncertainty emerged as key influencing factors. The findings offer insights into early meaning-making processes in relation to unfamiliar technologies and provide a basis for anticipatory, audience-sensitive strategies in science and technology communication.",

This preregistered controlled design allowed us to compare demographic-similarity with a theoretically grounded alternative: motivational alignment, defined as the match between a protagonist’s current motivation and the observer’s own motivational priorities. Motivational alignment reliably predicted narrative interest and remained a significant predictor even when demographic-similarity was included in the same model. We also found no evidence that demographic-similarity predicts interest, even when specific information about the protagonist’s motivation was absent. These findings identify motivational alignment as a central determinant of narrative interest.",

This scoping review mapped digital media interventions for young people and/or their caregivers that have been empirically evaluated, and described what has been tested, for whom, where and with which methods. We identified 120 peer-reviewed publications reporting 131 intervention evaluations (2006-2024) from 38 countries. Overall, 68.7% (n = 90) reported at least one statistically significant improvement on an intended outcome. Quasi-experimental designs predominated (72.5%; n = 95); experimental designs were less common (27.5%; n = 36). Interventions more often focused exclusively on risk reduction (45.8%; n = 60) than exclusively on opportunities (25.2%; n = 33); 29.0% (n = 38) did both. Across 34 target domains, literacy-related aims dominated – particularly media literacy (n = 37) – followed by cyberbullying (n = 23) and online safety behaviour (n = 9). Coverage across populations was uneven: among interventions with determinable sample ages (n = 97), most targeted adolescents (70.1%; n = 68), with limited early-childhood evidence (4.1%; n = 4). Few interventions targeted special educational needs (3.8%; n = 5) and ethnicity/race was rarely reported (13.7%; n = 18). Schools were the most common implementation context (74.8%; n = 98); structured pre-intervention training was reported for teachers in 22.9% (n = 30) and for parents in 4.6% (n = 6).

          "abstract": "Attachment ruptures, when children struggle to trust in parental availability and support, are linked to increased risk of psychopathology. Preventing or repairing these ruptures is important for fostering secure attachment and promoting family mental health. FamilieLink is a blended intervention that provides attachment-focused knowledge and parenting skills based on the dynamic model of the insecure cycle, with minimal professional involvement. This case study illustrates its application with Emma, a mother seeking support for her 10-year-old son’s anger outbursts and sibling conflicts. Using psychoeducation, reflective exercises, and emotion-coaching skills, Emma developed greater insight into her son’s emotional needs. She found the platform effective in raising awareness and offering practical guidance, though she noted a desire for more content on neurobiological underpinnings of attachment. Nevertheless, Emma recommended FamilieLink as a valuable resource for parents facing similar challenges. This case study highlights the potential of low-intensity, blended interventions to foster secure attachment within families.",

          "authors": "Jakab Pilaszanovich; Max Schulz; Lukas Lange; Natalie Dörmann; Isabel Stephan; Carsten Olthoff; Marc Schönwiesner",
          "abstract": "Everyday listening often requires the auditory system to move beyond the perception of individual sound sources towards a more global representation of acoustic scenes. While auditory behaviour has been well characterised for one or a few sources, it remains unclear how listeners perceive scenes containing many simultaneous sounds. One way to address this question is through auditory numerosity judgement, the ability to estimate how many distinct sound sources are present in an acoustic scene. Because numerosity perception is known to saturate at higher source counts, it provides a useful window into how representations shift from discrete sources towards more scene-level percepts. Here, we measured numerosity judgements separately along the three dimensions of auditory space: azimuth, elevation, and distance, allowing each spatial axis to be examined in isolation. As these dimensions rely on markedly different spatial cues and differ strongly in spatial acuity, this design enabled the dissociation of spatial and non-spatial contributions to numerosity perception. Across dimensions, numerosity judgements showed no systematic relationship with individual spatial hearing performance. Speech intelligibility likewise exerted only a weak influence, suggesting a limited role for higher-level or linguistic processing. In contrast, perceived numerosity was significantly modulated by the spectrotemporal coverage of the acoustic mixture, a low-level property independent of spatial cues. Together, these findings suggest that auditory numerosity judgement is largely insensitive to spatial hearing precision and instead reflects more general constraints on how complex sound mixtures are represented at the scene level.",

In a preregistered experiment (N = 226), mental health professionals evaluated a therapist who either completed tasks personally, outsourced them to an LLM or a human colleague across six core clinical (diagnosis, psychoeducation, treatment) and peripheral (documentation, insurance application, feedback) tasks. Therapists who outsourced tasks, whether to an LLM or a human colleague, were generally evaluated more negatively than those who completed tasks themselves. Overall, human and LLM outsourcing were viewed similarly, but evaluations varied by task type. LLM outsourcing was seen as particularly inappropriate for core clinical tasks, yet more acceptable for peripheral tasks. These findings highlight the importance of task-sensitive, ethically grounded integration of LLMs into psychotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Recently, several authors have argued that the current impasse in consciousness science supports a pluralistic interpretation: the view that seemingly contradictory findings may both be valid because consciousness can be brought about in different ways, each sufficient to generate conscious experience. We analyze different versions of pluralism to determine under what conditions it offers a viable interpretation of consciousness science. We argue that viable pluralism requires a two-factor framework distinguishing general consciousness factors (mechanisms rendering contents conscious) from content encoding itself. Moreover, NCC kinds must be finite in number and systematically ordered to enable a unified scientific model. While pluralism enables testable hypotheses, significant ontological tensions arise: how can consciousness constitute a unified natural kind if realized by fundamentally distinct NCC kinds? Drawing on philosophy of science, we propose an alternative interpretation in terms of scientific rather than natural kinds. Our goal is not to advocate for pluralism, but rather, to critically examine its viability and implications. Based on this, we urge the field to engage more explicitly with the foundational assumptions that shape consciousness research.",

          "abstract": "Communication difficulties are common among youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, traits associated with ASD and ADHD are continuously distributed in the general population, raising the question of whether communication differences are better explained by diagnostic categories or by dimensional trait variation. This study included 493 Italian children and adolescents aged 7-16 years old (M = 11.35; SD = 2.64): 147 (126 boys) with ASD without intellectual disability, 105 (88 boys) with ADHD, and 241 (203 boys) non-diagnosed peers. Parents completed standardized measures assessing communication skills, ASD and ADHD traits. Both clinical groups showed significant communication difficulties compared to non-diagnosed peers, with large effect sizes (ASD-ND: d=1.66; ADHD-ND: d=-1.00). Importantly, results supported a dimensional model: individual differences in communication were more effectively explained by variation in ASD and ADHD traits across the entire sample (BIC = 4151.39) than by diagnostic group membership alone (BIC = 4324.75). Both trait dimensions independently predicted communication challenges across clinical and non-clinical population, though ADHD traits had a slightly weaker effect. This perspective provides a more nuanced understanding of how ASD and ADHD traits may relate to communication challenges across the general population, extending beyond the boundaries of clinical diagnosis.",

          "authors": "Andrea Piovesan; Stergios Makris",
          "abstract": "Prospective timing, the ability to judge the duration of ongoing events, is critical for everyday functioning, such as coordinating actions, interpreting communication, and anticipating outcomes. While influential theories, including Scalar Expectancy Theory and the Striatal Beat Frequency model, have shaped our understanding of timing, they leave unresolved how the timing process is first triggered. This article proposes the Sensory-Origin Timing (SOT) model, a novel mechanism whereby prospective timing is initiated by sensory organs, with their activity providing the source for duration estimation. Specifically, we suggest that the total activity generated by the sensory organ during the transduction of a stimulus is directly related to its duration and is monitored by the striatum to form a neural representation of elapsed time. Two electroretinography studies tested this proposal in the visual modality. In Study 1, retinal activity predicted subjective duration judgments even when objective stimulus duration was held constant. In Study 2, retinal activity conformed to two fundamental scalar principles of prospective timing: mean accuracy and Weber’s law. These findings are consistent with the SOT model, providing direct support for its validity. By grounding the origin of duration perception in sensory activity, SOT addresses key limitations of existing cognitive and neurobiological theories, provides a bridge between them, and delivers a unified framework that can explain established temporal distortions and cross-modal differences. More broadly, by clarifying how timing is initiated, SOT strengthens the theoretical foundations of time perception and advances our understanding of its role in cognition and behaviour.",

          "authors": "Eva janssen; Bernd Figner; Zhang Chen",
          "abstract": "Background and aims: Online gambling has given rise to game designs that may pose unique risks of harm. One novel format of online gambling is crash gambling, a fast-paced game in which players must cash out before a randomly determined crash (aka “bust”) point. A distinctive feature of this design is that even when winning, players often miss out on a larger potential win, a feature we term missed-opportunity wins. This study examined the effects of such missed-opportunity wins on subsequent risk-taking behaviour. Methods: We analysed behavioural tracking data from a crypto crash gambling game. First, an exploratory analysis was conducted on 2,000 players, followed by a pre-registered confirmatory analysis on 15,000 new players. Using Bayesian mixed-effects models, we tested whether the size of a missed-opportunity win in one round predicted changes in wager size and/or the likelihood of being busted in the next round, as indicators of risk-taking. Results: Larger missed-opportunity wins were associated with a greater likelihood of changing one’s wager in the next round. When players adjusted their wager, larger missed-opportunity wins increased the likelihood of raising rather than lowering the wager. Additionally, larger missed-opportunity wins predicted a higher likelihood of being busted in the following round, all indicating different forms of increased risk-taking. Discussion and Conclusions: Missing out on a larger potential win encourages subsequent risk-taking. By demonstrating how counterfactual elements in crash gambling designs shape behaviour, this study highlights behavioural shifts associated with novel online gambling mechanics and can inform policy discussions on their regulation.",

          "abstract": "Stress is an umbrella term that lacks a universally agreed upon definition. The construct ambiguity of stress undermines theoretical integration, construct validity, and cumulative knowledge development. In our critical review, we trace the historical evolution of the stress construct, delineate sources of conceptual ambiguity, and evaluate whether the term stress itself is necessary for scientific exploration. We show that we do not need the term stress to describe the phenomena studied in stress research. However, the term ‘stress’ may still be useful to refer to a field of research and to integrate research findings. We demonstrate that phenomena related to stress can be described using more precise constructs: stressors, stress responses, and health outcomes. To facilitate conceptual clarity, we synthesize umbrella definitions for these constructs. Because such umbrella definitions remain necessarily broad, we emphasize that specifying the conceptualization and operationalization of the stressor, stress response, and health outcomes is indispensable for empirical rigor. To this end, we introduce the Stress Conceptualization Checklist for Empirical Studies (SuCCES), a structured reporting framework that guides researchers to describe the theory and conceptualization, specify which type of stressor, stress response and health outcome is studied, describe how they have arrived at their operationalization and differentiation  between the stressor, stress response and health outcomes, and specify the context, time scale, life period, and assessment window of their stress measurement. This reporting standard aims to strengthen construct validity, improve measurement coherence, and promote cumulative progress in research on stress-related processes.",

          "abstract": "Climate anxiety – negative emotional reactions to climate change – has been linked to poorer psychological wellbeing and has shown to have mixed associations with pro-environmental behaviour. Although a growing number of studies have examined the correlates of climate anxiety, few have investigated its prevalence in national samples. Addressing this gap, we used the Hogg Climate Anxiety Scale to measure levels of climate anxiety in New Zealand. Using a representative sample by age, ethnicity, gender, and region (N = 429), our goals were threefold: (1) measure the prevalence of climate anxiety in the New Zealand population and across the 16 regions; (2) examine the associations between climate anxiety and both sociodemographic variables and psychological wellbeing; and (3) clarify whether the correlation with pro-environmental behaviour fits linear versus non-linear models. Overall, 5.2% (95% CI [3.4; 7.8]) of participants reported experiencing climate anxiety, and .5% (95% CI [.0; 1.8]) reported nearly daily climate anxiety, with the highest prevalence observed in the Bay of Plenty region, and highest severity in Southland. People who experienced climate impacts, those working in environment-related jobs, those who felt less prepared for climate change, and younger people reported higher climate anxiety. Those with higher climate anxiety also reported greater psychological distress, reduced wellbeing, and more engagement in pro-environmental behaviours. We discuss potential strategies for supporting at-risk groups, and ways to capitalize on the benefits of climate anxiety while preventing its maladaptive consequences in New Zealand.",

We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the ‘Linton Stereo Illusion’ appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.",

          "abstract": "Tractography is a key component of efforts to map brain connectivity. As a rapidly-evolving field of neuroscience, current tractography methods are diverse, often varying across research laboratories and different software pipelines. Therefore, it suffers from a lack of standardization leading to inconsistencies in results, which can limit reproducibility, and affect the robustness needed for research and clinical applications of these methods. Variability in data acquisition procedures, inconsistencies in spatial referencing schemes and implementations, and anatomical heterogeneity —at the individual level, across the lifespan, and across species— hinders comparative analyses. Additionally, the lack of consensus on best practices complicates the development of robust automated quality control pipelines and limits the clinical translation of tractography-based procedures. Establishing standardized protocols for acquisition, preprocessing, and tractography reconstruction are critical towards enabling reliable tract-specific analyses, facilitating cross-study harmonization, and supporting replicable large-scale population studies. The present article provides an overview of the current challenges in tractography standardization and identifies the key aspects that require standardization for reliable, reproducible, and robust tractography.",

          "abstract": "The AI revolution has produced synthetic faces that often appear more human than photos of real people. We tested whether individual differences in human face recognition ability explain variation in discriminating AI from real faces. Super-recognizers – people with exceptional ability to recognize human faces (N = 36) – outperformed a typical sample by 15% and by 7% compared to a group of higher performing, motivated control participants (Cohen's d = 0.55; N = 89). Individual difference analysis revealed that this pattern reflected a positive association between human face recognition and AI face discrimination abilities. AI discrimination ability was also associated with individuals' sensitivity to the ‘hyper-average’ appearance of AI faces. Deep neural networks optimized for face identity processing confirmed a more central distribution of AI faces in face-space. Moreover, centrality was associated with a higher probability of super-recognizers judging the faces as AI, but this pattern was not observed for controls. Super-recognizers' correct interpretation of hyper-averageness as a cue to artificiality constitutes the first mechanistic link between evolved expertise in face processing and AI face detection and addresses a common misconception regarding the structure of human face space.",

Across two main-text experiments and one supplemental replication (N = 2,710, U.S.), we tested whether hostility is greatest when cultural outgroups are portrayed as consuming meat that elicits both visceral (purity-related) disgust and moral concern. A pretest confirmed that dog meat evoked the highest moral concern, rat the highest contamination-related appraisals, and cow was neutral, while Study 2 substituted monkey to test generalization. Prejudice and punitive intent were strongest for morally protected animals (dog, monkey), moderate for rat, and lowest for cow. Visceral disgust showed more consistent association with bias, whereas compassion played a more limited role.

Here we demonstrate, through 11 studies, that interventions designed to increase awareness of manipulative messaging, such as the use of emotionally-charged language, can reduce the impact of derogatory accusations on impressions of novel mock political candidates. Individuals who viewed video or gamified inoculations showed a reduced impact of accusations on subjective ratings for all candidates about whom accusations of misconduct were made, relative to those who did not receive the inoculation. These effects were strongest when the truth status was ambiguous, but there is also some beneficial impact even when an accusation is clearly refuted, i.e., a reduction in Continued Influence Effects. Overall, these findings indicate that inoculation interventions that train citizens to be aware of manipulative techniques can effectively reduce the impact of unproven derogatory accusations against politicians.",

Despite participants’ general skepticism that AIs can suffer, they harmed the AI in only 1.4 of 3 rounds on average, with willingness to harm declining in later interactions. Women and older participants were more reluctant to harm the AI, while participants higher on measures of selfishness and psychopathy were more willing.

          "abstract": "Despite converging evidence on the relationship between positive affect (PA) and subjective wellbeing (SWB), PA is operationalized differently across studies. This leaves an open question of whether different kinds of PA operationalization relate to SWB similarly over time. The present study tested this assumption by examining whether pleasant versus energized feelings show comparable longitudinal associations with life satisfaction (LS). Although classic SWB theory views PA and LS as SWB components, which raises concerns about circularity (i.e., testing how SWB components relate to SWB components), empirical findings suggest that their association may reflect processes beyond only shared variance from a latent factor. Therefore, we treated PA and LS as two separate constructs. We used random-intercept cross-lagged panel models across nine waves from two national longitudinal datasets, PAIRFAM (N = 12,520) and LISS (N = 17,532), and compared different types of PAs in their associations with LS and personality traits. Both pleasant and energized feelings showed consistent bidirectional associations with LS overtime. However, these relationships were stronger for pleasant feelings. Both cross-lagged effects and time-specific residual correlations were approximately twice as large for pleasant as those for energized feelings, and correlations between random intercepts of pleasant feelings and LS were even stronger than that of energized feelings. They also differed in their associations with extraversion and neuroticism. Together, these findings suggest that pleasant feeling is more tightly and persistently coupled with LS than energized feelings, suggesting that they have unique contributions to SWB over time.",

          "abstract": "This research examines whether competence cues can reduce gender bias in evaluations of AI managers and whether these effects depend on how the AI is represented. Across two preregistered experiments (N = 2,505), each employing a 2 × 2 × 3 design manipulating AI gender, competence, and decision outcome, we compared text-based descriptions of AI managers with visually generated AI faces created using a reverse-correlation paradigm. In the text condition, evaluations were driven by competence rather than gender. When participants received unfavourable decisions, high-competence AI managers were judged as fairer, more competent, and better leaders than low-competence managers, regardless of AI gender. In contrast, when the AI manager was visually represented, competence cues had attenuated influence once facial information was present. Instead, participants showed systematic gender-differentiated responses to AI faces, with feminine-appearing managers evaluated as more competent and more trustworthy than masculine-appearing managers, particularly when delivering favourable outcomes. These gender effects were largely absent when outcomes were unfavourable, suggesting that negative feedback attenuates the influence of both competence information and facial cues. Taken together, these findings show that competence information can mitigate negative reactions to AI managers in text-based interactions, whereas facial anthropomorphism elicits gendered perceptual biases not observed in text-only settings. The results highlight that representational modality plays a critical role in determining when gender stereotypes are activated in evaluations of AI systems and underscore that design choices are consequential for AI governance in evaluative contexts.",

          "abstract": "Much feminist social epistemology shares the basic assumption that ignorance generated by silencing (and related phenomena) is undesirable (Dotson 2011, 2012, 2014; Dotson &amp; Gilbert, 2014; Fricker, 2007; Medina, 2011, 2012, 2023; Pohlhaus, 2012). While true in the contexts those theorists consider, I depart from that consensus, introducing and offering a philosophical account of a social epistemic practice that I term ‘hushing-up.’ This practice has emerged organically in response and in resistance to sectarian bigotry in Northern Ireland (NI), and contributes to post-conflict transitions away from social and political polarisation and its derivative harms to individuals and collectives. In spaces where hushing-up is deployed, ignorance of peoples’ community background is intentionally cultivated as a strategy in opposition to bigotry, while bigoted or sectarian displays incur social costs. Positioning hushing-up against existing accounts of political ignorance, including those by Williams (2021), Brennan (2016), and Somin (2013, 2015), and contributing to Mills’ (1997) idea of an epistemology of ignorance, I distinguish between performative partisanship (involving ignorance driven by social rewards for showing group allegiance) and pressured partisanship (involving ignorance driven by the avoidance of social sanctions for displaying indicators of disloyalty to a group). On the account I defend, shifts in social norms are central to addressing some forms of harmful ignorance. I argue that hushing-up succeeds in doing this in two ways: first, by reducing the rationality of pressured partisanship by providing alternative social support to that provided in polarised social spaces such that the cost of dissent is lowered; and secondly, by disincentivising performative partisanship through increasing the difficulty of identifying targets and ensuring that bigoted displays are met with disapproval in spaces where that norm is in force.",

          "abstract": "Aim. This scoping review of daily momentary stress measurement studies synthesizes a booming but fragmented field of stress research and introduces the stress MEasurement StrategieS (StressMess) database.\nMethods. Systematic searches in Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO identified studies of (a) stress and psychopathology (e.g., anxiety/depression) using (b) time series or ambulatory assessment designs where (c) stress was measured at least daily on two consecutive days. \nResults. We identified 12,846 articles and included 721 studies into the StressMess database, of which half in the past five years, typically with larger samples and more frequent measurements than older studies. Most participants were young adults (aged 18-24, M=67% women), from general populations in the US (55%), Germany (7%), and the Netherlands (5%). Stress was often operationalized as a stressor (27%) or stress response to adverse events (33%), and measured as characteristics of events (e.g., type, frequency, predictability, stressfulness, unpleasantness), or general momentaneous or daily stress score (27%), or as stress response via emotions (5%), or physiology (&lt;1%). Some studies (13%) used multiple stress operationalizations. \nConclusion. Stress is currently not a useful scientific concept because of the large heterogeneity in definitions, terminology, measurement strategies (instruments), and study design. We provide directions to improve conceptualizations and design for future studies focusing on measuring stress. The StressMess database is open source (www.stressmess.nl) to improve the understanding, prevention, and treatment of adverse (mental) health effects of stress. Stress measurement influences what stress research can identify and thereby clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Do individuals possess introspective access to their implicit evaluations? Although recent research shows that people can often predict their scores on indirect measures, it remains unclear whether this effect reflects genuine introspection or inferential reasoning. We tested an anchoring-and-adjustment account, proposing that individuals predict implicit evaluations by anchoring on accessible explicit evaluations and then adjusting based on available information, such as cultural knowledge. Across three experiments (N = 3,182), we used a relational evaluative conditioning paradigm with novel nonwords to isolate explicit evaluations as the primary source for inference. Manipulating the align-ment between explicit and implicit evaluations, between or within participants, yielded consistent support for the anchoring-and-adjustment hypothesis. Predictions were accurate only when explicit evaluations provided a valid cue; when the two dissociated, accuracy fell systematically below chance. These findings suggest that knowledge of one’s implicit evaluations is dominantly derived from explicit cues rather than discovered through direct introspection.",

Qualitative interviews on informed consent best practices and recommendations were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. \n\nResults: Participants (N = 36; 71% white; 56% heterosexual; 53% female) reported facilitating psilocybin services (64%) for a mean of 15.2 (SD = 13.1) years in clinical trial, licensed service center, underground, or ceremonial settings. Participants viewed informed consent as a process (Theme 1), necessitating a strong therapeutic relationship, centering client empowerment, and occurring as an ongoing process. Potential risks and benefits should be comprehensively conveyed (Theme 2), including potential long-term psychological and social changes, and the potential for disappointing experiences. Participants recommended detailed consent processes around touch and boundaries (Theme 3), including explicitly establishing boundaries prior to psychedelic administration, maintaining those boundaries throughout, and recognizing subtle non-verbal cues that may indicate lack of true consent. Within facilitator trainings (Theme 4), participants emphasized cultivating a deep respect for client agency, and experientially learning relational and boundary setting skills. \n\nConclusions: Findings may inform practitioner training, consent practices in varied settings, and policy development for state-regulated psychedelic services.",

          "authors": "Jeremy Cooper",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical discussion between the results of a phenomenological study inquiring on metaphor use in psychotherapy with literature from the enactive cognition framework. The possibility for conceptualizing language use has greatly developed in recent years. Now, enactive cognition and embodied approaches offer a way to understand the intricate relationship between a person and their world. This intricate relationship describes the reciprocal relationship between being influenced and influencing one’s world. Metaphor use, as a therapeutic tool, can be one way to clearly see and repair this relationship, especially for those in which other phenomenological works have already identified as having a core disruption in their ability to relate to how they previously understood their life. The results of the previous study will be contrasted with literature from phenomenology and enactive cognition in order to broaden academic, transdisciplinary dialogue and assist in broadening scope of clinical understanding. Conceptualizations of cognitive life, language use, and philosophical notions for selfhood are considered beforehand. The primary results of the phenomenological study are then presented to illustrate the way individuals with PTSD approach and use metaphor. The theoretical discourse highlights the connection between “power” and epistemic mistrust, mutuality as shown in metacognitive abilities, and the experiential quality of sense-making. Suggestions for future research and limitations are then offered. A phenomenological understanding can increase empathy and regard for the subjective lifeworld of the patient. This study is intended to help psychotherapists and researchers alike to better grasp the application of the enactive cognition framework.",

We fitted alternative models to data simulated to resemble the data used by Swingler et al. and found discrepant increasing, decreasing, and null effects of violence exposure on subsequent change in conduct problems depending on the analyzed model. A meta-analytic pooling of these discrepant effects did not differ significantly from zero. Hence, the findings by Swingler et al. may have been spurious and their conclusion premature. It is important for researchers to bear in mind that associations, including cross-lagged regression effects, in observational (i.e., non-experimental) data may be spurious in order not to overinterpret findings.

          "authors": "Wouter Wolf",
          "abstract": "Humans are highly skilled at establishing mental state alignment through communication during collaborative interactions. Yet there is still much debate about how they do this effectively. Recently, scholars have argued that the capacity to understand others’ communicative intent facilitates mental state alignment by constraining the meaning of communicative expressions to a domain of mutual relevance. Although this constraint is likely an important facilitator of human communication, it is unlikely to completely resolve the interpretative indeterminacy inherent to humans’ open-ended communication systems (i.e., inferring the intended meaning of arbitrary signals amid quasi-infinite interpretive possibilities). Here, I argue that understanding communicative intent facilitates mental state alignment in a crucial, previously underappreciated way. Understanding the cooperative intention underlying ostension solves the problem of ‘ambiguous affective reference’ inherent to emotional expressions in response to communicative acts. Specifically, it constrains the interpretation of these expressions to be about the communicative act’s content (i.e., ostensive feedback). Consequently, ostensive negative feedback facilitates the negotiation of mental states during perceived mental misalignment (disagreement) until both individuals use positive ostensive feedback (affirmation) to indicate that they deem their mental states sufficiently aligned for the purposes of their interaction (agreement). I argue that this capacity facilitates much of humans’ sociality.",

While Neurodiversity-Affirming Principles (NAPs) offer an ethical foundation for inclusion, they remain difficult to operationalise in the design and evaluation of educational technologies. We introduce a holistic, child-centred, neurodiversity-affirming evaluation framework that integrates NAPs with empirically grounded Child–Computer Interaction (CCI) design theory. Through theory-informed clustering and iterative refinement, the framework translates abstract principles into assessable evaluation themes and criteria, supported by an asymmetric scoring scheme designed to surface deficit-oriented risks. We demonstrate its use on a virtual reality learning environment and a social robot, revealing misalignments between inclusive design intentions and real-world use, and showing how affirming practices can emerge through situated adoption. Our approach contributes a structured, value-sensitive framework for designing and evaluating educational technologies that foster autonomy, strengths-based engagement, and communication diversity.",

However, experience with proactive interference can diminish its effects. We\nexamined whether this diminishment occurs because participants learn to sustain their attention\nto detect and later remember changes. Participants (n = 445) completed two cycles of an A-B, AD\ntask, each with unique items. The study phases included word pairs with cues that repeated (A)\nand responses that changed (B → D) from the first to the second half of the lists, along with\ncontrol items (A-D) that only appeared in the second half of the study lists.

The test phases included a cued recall test that assessed memory\nfor recent responses (D), intrusions of first responses (B), memory for changes, and memory for\nfirst responses (B). Across cycles, proactive interference diminished, and on-task reports\nindicating attentive encoding increased selectively for A-D pairs. Within participants, on-task\nreports to A-B and A-D pairs were associated with higher rates of recent-response recalls,\nmemory for changes, and first-response recalls. Between participants, total on-task reports\nindicating trait-level sustained attention predicted more accurate memory; this association\nincreased across cycles and was driven by people with better sustained attention.

          "abstract": "According to current recognition memory theories, a major source of confusion when people judge which stimuli they remember is the contextual similarity of those stimuli to those from the studied list. However, these theories overlook the potential for confusions to arise from item-specific memorability properties not explained by list properties – namely, the likelihood that a stimulus will be correctly recognized if studied (“hittability”) or falsely recognized if not (“false-alarmability”) – independent of contextual similarity. Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. In a forced-choice experiment testing memory for real-world object images, the model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries. Using deep convolutional neural networks validated on human similarity judgments, we showed that memory-list context explains only a small fraction of variance in false-alarmability but not hittability. We also show that, while inter-item similarity explains a small percentage of variance in their forced-choice discriminability, ignoring their differential memorability properties as targets and foils fails to predict the asymmetries. Our results highlight the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

          "authors": "Felipe Vilanova; Flavio Azevedo",
          "abstract": "This piece critiques the dominant assumption in social and political psychology, as well as in political science and other disciplines, that polarization is inherently undesirable and should therefore be reduced under all circumstances. We argue that this premise reflects a neutrality bias (or depoliticizing bias) that obscures the asymmetrical nature of contemporary political conflict. We distinguish democratic polarization—agonistic contestation among actors who accept multicultural pluralism, democratic institutions and election outcomes, civil and human rights, and epistemic accountability—from anti-democratic polarization, in which conflict is strategically mobilized to delegitimize opponents, erode institutional constraints, and normalize dehumanization, scapegoating, misinformation, anti-scientific, and conspiratorial narratives as a route to political power. In a global context marked by the growing strength of extremist anti-democratic and authoritarian movements, such distinctions are essential for understanding the normative implications of political conflict for democratic societies. These anti-democratic movements frequently rely on coordinated campaigns that undermine public trust in science and factual reasoning. Under such conditions, polarization cannot be assumed to reflect good-faith disagreement among citizens who share commitments to fair allocation of resources, empirical truth, and evidence-based governance. Treating polarization in these contexts as ordinary democratic conflict risks misdiagnosing authoritarian mobilization as symmetric disagreement rather than recognizing it as a strategic assault on the epistemic and institutional foundations of democracy. Accordingly, when conflict itself is treated as undesirable, research risks inadvertently reinforcing authoritarian dynamics by discouraging legitimate dissent and critical engagement. We call for a reorientation of polarization research toward examining how the suppression of conflict and appeals to consensus and civility may obfuscate meaningful asymmetry and facilitate authoritarian consolidation.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\t\nWhy do some civilians support war despite its moral cost? Although threat perception seems to be a key psychological driver of this support, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. This narrative review integrates psychological and neuroscientific evidence to clarify how distinct threat types and temporal profiles shape war-supporting attitudes through specific brain circuits.\nMETHODS\nA two-phase narrative review was conducted. Phase I systematically screened psychological literature on threat perception and war support across major databases. Phase II targeted neurobiological studies on threat perception using operationalizations consistent with the psychological research identified in the first phase. Eligible publications included empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses involving human participants. \nRESULTS\nBy typology, realistic threats may activate amygdala–periaqueductal gray (PAG)–insula circuits linked to defensive reflexes; symbolic threats recruit self-referential and moral appraisal networks that may foster justification of violence; and existential threats engage anterior cingulate cortex–insula–bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) dynamics that may amplify worldview defense and group cohesion. By temporal profile, immediate threats elicit rapid amygdala–PAG responses that may bias punitive reactions, while prolonged threats sustain BNST–insula vigilance and weaken prefrontal regulation, fostering hypervigilance and ideological rigidity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWar support may emerge from dynamic coalitions of salience, valuation, and control networks that reconfigure with threat type, duration, and context. This synthesis outlines a neurocognitive framework for the political neuroscience of threat, which highlights how threat manipulation can mobilize conflict, entrench group hostility, and mirror dysregulated anxiety circuitry, suggesting translational opportunities for prevention and intervention.",

          "authors": "Michael P. Grosz",
          "abstract": "The Big Five personality traits are often treated as common causes of the Big Five items in reflective measurement models such as factor analysis models and item response theory models. For example, extraversion items are modeled as reflective indicators influenced by the latent variable extraversion (i.e., the common cause). However, the Big Five do not correspond to five biological, environmental, or mental entities that could serve as common causes. The notion that the Big Five are common causes is furthermore challenged by direct causal effects, semantic overlap, and logical connections among the Big Five items. Despite these concerns, researchers continue to use methods and theories that implicitly or explicitly assume that the Big Five are common causes. I argue for three shifts: (a) Ontological shift: The Big Five are best understood as composites of personality items—not as real entities that cause item responses. (b) Methodological shift: For descriptive and predictive research, the composite-formative measurement model offers a more appropriate modeling approach than the reflective measurement model, with item retest reliabilities replacing Cronbach's alpha or McDonald's omega for reliability estimation. (c) Conceptual shift: For researchers interested in causal inference—which is essential for building theories and designing interventions—I recommend moving beyond the Big Five toward narrower personality traits grounded in clear theoretical conceptualizations and assessed multi-modally (e.g., self-reports, other-reports, physiological indicators, behavioral measures).",

          "abstract": "Recently, several authors have argued that the current impasse in consciousness science supports a pluralistic interpretation: the view that seemingly contradictory findings may both be valid because consciousness can be brought about in different ways, each sufficient to generate conscious experience. We analyze different versions of pluralism to determine under what conditions it offers a viable interpretation of consciousness science. We argue that viable pluralism requires a two-factor framework distinguishing general consciousness factors (mechanisms rendering contents conscious) from content encoding itself. Moreover, NCC kinds must be finite in number and systematically ordered to enable a unified scientific model. While pluralism enables testable hypotheses, significant ontological tensions arise: how can consciousness constitute a unified natural kind if realized by fundamentally distinct NCC kinds? Drawing on philosophy of science, we propose an alternative interpretation in terms of scientific rather than natural kinds. Our goal is not to advocate for pluralism, but rather, to critically examine its viability and implications. Based on this, we urge the field to engage more explicitly with the foundational assumptions that shape consciousness research.",

However, the exact phenomenology and underlying mechanisms of dissociation in adolescence have yet to be clarified. The current study explores the presentation of, and possible psychological factors underlying, dissociation in this population.\n\nMethod\n\nTwo online self-report surveys captured data from 3076 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. Participants completed the Černis Felt Sense of Anomaly (ČEFSA) scale of felt sense of anomaly-type dissociation, alongside measures of mechanisms implicated in a cognitive-behavioural model of dissociation in adults (cognitive appraisals, alexithymia, and affect intolerance). N=409 completed the ČEFSA scale at a second timepoint, one month later.\n\nResults\n\nMost (91.87%) adolescents endorsed at least one ČEFSA item. The mean number of endorsed items was 13.00 (SD = 9.67). The most endorsed factors of the ČEFSA were Altered Sense of Agency (82.96%), Anomalous experience of the Self (76.76%), and Altered Sense of Connection (73.76%).\n\nMediation analysis indicated that emotion regulation (expressive suppression) mediated the relationship between Time One and Time Two dissociation scores: greater suppression was associated with greater dissociation one month later. No other tested variables showed statistically significant mediation.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdolescents are likely to experience dissociation as detachment and disconnection, particularly relating to their selfhood and external world (i.e., depersonalisation and derealisation). \nThis study suggests that the key element of a recent cognitive-behavioural model of dissociative experiences in adults – that affect intolerance perpetuates dissociation – may also be applicable in adolescence.",

          "abstract": "The striking constraints of some human cognitive processes stand in stark contrast to the near\nlimitless capability of others. While we can acquire and flexibly use vast amounts of\ninformation, the amount we can process at any one time is often stiflingly limited: for example\nthe number of items we can hold in working memory or the number of tasks that can be\nperformed at once. Here, we integrate ideas from information-theory, cognitive science, and\nneuroscience to offer a unified account of why processing is often so limited. We argue that\nthis reflects a fundamental tradeoff between generalization —how effectively existing\nrepresentations can be used in novel settings— and how many distinct representations can be\nprocessed in parallel. Representations that best promote strong forms of generalization — a\ncharacteristically human cognitive strength — come at the expense of surprisingly strict limits\nin the number of items that can be processed at once, an equally characteristic human\nweakness. We refer to this as the “curse of generalization.” We formulate this first in\ninformation-theoretic terms, and then in process models, including a neural network model\nof classic tasks used to demonstrate strict limits in human processing capacity. This tension\noffers a potential explanation for a range of phenomena — from performance on the tasks on\nwhich we focus, to representational learning and skill acquisition more broadly — as well as the\nperformance of modern machine learning architectures that exhibit generalization capabilities\ncomparable to humans.",

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "authors": "Blazej M. Baczkowski; Michiko Sakaki; Felix Kalbe; Kou Murayama; Lars Schwabe",
          "abstract": "Episodic memory organizes continuous experience into discrete events, often limiting integration across temporal gaps. Emotionally salient experiences, such as learning about threats, may nevertheless enhance memory for motivationally relevant information across nominal event boundaries. Yet evidence for such cross-boundary modulation is mixed, suggesting that emotional learning may not exert a uniform effect on episodic memory across individuals. Here, we examined whether this heterogeneity reflects a mixture of divergent tendencies in how individuals structure their experience in memory – by temporal boundaries or by emotional relevance. Young adults (N = 285) incidentally encoded neutral images from two categories (animals, tools) across three temporally separated phases: pre-conditioning, conditioning, and post-conditioning. During conditioning, one category was partially reinforced with mild electric shocks to establish a category-level threat association. Memory was tested 24 hours later using a surprise old-new recognition task. Although no reliable cross-phase enhancement was evident at the group level, data-driven individual-level analyses revealed two distinct patterns of episodic memory modulation. One pattern showed declining memory across phases, with emotional effects confined to shock-predictive items encoded during conditioning. The other showed memory structured around the emotional learning episode, with category-selective prioritization extending into the post-conditioning phase. These findings suggest that enhanced memory for subsequent threat-relevant information emerges specifically in individuals for whom the emotional learning episode, rather than nominal temporal structure, becomes the primary anchor of memory organization.",

          "abstract": "Speech is quasi-rhythmic, with key acoustic events, such as syllables, occurring at semi-regular intervals (about 4.5 syllables/second) across languages. Adults’ ability to align their speech motor productions to this rate, known as sensorimotor synchronization to speech, is linked to the auditory-motor coupling of the brain, as well as their performance on cognitive tasks. When does the ability emerge and does it play a role during early language development? This question was addressed by measuring infants’ non-nutritive sucking (NNS) while presented with syllable streams at two relevant rates (3 Hz and 4.5 Hz) at 2 - 4 months of age (N = 24; 9 females). NNS is an innate oromotor response produced by infants in the absence of receiving nutrition, which typically consists of periods of rhythmic behavior (bursts) and pauses. We evaluated whether infants showed tempo-flexibility, i.e., whether they adjusted NNS from their spontaneous frequency to better align with the frequency of the presented stimuli. We also explored phase synchronization, i.e., the degree of synchronization in time between NNS and the stimuli. Further, we assessed the correlation between these synchronization measures and communicative development at 12 months of age. NNS bursts became significantly more organized around 3 Hz when exposed to the 4.5 Hz speech stimuli compared to baseline, where NNS averaged around 1-2 Hz. Interestingly, infants also showed some phase synchronization to the 4.5 Hz, but not the 3 Hz stimulus. Although, phase synchronization to the 4.5 Hz stimulus was still relatively low and did not follow the same bimodal distribution, i.e. of “high” and “low” auditory-motor synchronizers to speech, that has previously been observed for adults (Assaneo et al., 2019). Neither of our measures of sensorimotor synchronization was significantly correlated with language outcomes at 12 months of age. Infants display some flexibility and sensorimotor synchronization in their NNS response towards the speech stimuli, which suggests that the auditory-motor coupling is operational in a rudimentary form from as early as 2 to 4 months of age.",

          "abstract": "Statistics anxiety is widely recognised as a barrier to student learning, and the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS) is its most widely used self-report measure. However, it remains unclear whether the STARS captures a construct distinct from mathematics anxiety or reflects a jangle fallacy. Using a large international sample of undergraduate students (N = 6,885) from 83 universities across 33 countries, we examined the empirical distinctiveness of the STARS relative to the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (R-MARS). Across four criteria, the evidence indicated substantial overlap. First, correlations between the STARS and R-MARS were consistently strong. Second, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that items clustered primarily by type of educational experience (e.g., tests, help-seeking, interpretation) rather than by domain, with limited and unstable domain-specific factors. Third, both scales demonstrated statistically equivalent associations with 11 theoretically related anxiety and education variables. Fourth, the R-MARS explained negligible incremental variance beyond the STARS across these outcomes. Together, the findings suggest that the STARS and R-MARS largely measure the same underlying construct. Their continued separate use risks redundancy, conceptual fragmentation, and statistical artefacts, underscoring the need for clearer construct definition and more precise measurement tools.",

          "abstract": "Event-related potential (ERP) research exhibits a critical methodological blind spot: inter-condition correlations (ρXY), the parameter that mathematically determines difference wave reliability via the Lord–Novick formula, are systematically unmeasured. Classical Test Theory demonstrates that difference wave reliability is inversely related to ρXY, with high correlations suppressing reliability even when constituent waveforms are psychometrically sound. Systematic examination of four foundational ERP studies in bilingual language switching (2001–2016, Ncitations ≈ 1,575) confirms that none report difference wave reliability or inter-condition correlations, despite difference waves being the primary dependent variables isolating language control processes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this vulnerability extends across the entire plausible parameter space: even moderate inter-condition correlations (ρXY = .50–.60) require constituent reliabilities approaching methodological ceilings (ρ = .85–.88) to achieve adequate difference wave reliability (ρDD′ ≥ .70). When experimental control produces high correlations (ρXY ≥ .70), degradation becomes catastrophic, with constituent reliabilities of .85 yielding difference wave reliabilities near zero. The absence of empirical ρXY measurements means the field cannot determine whether two decades of N2 debate reflect genuine neurocognitive complexity, measurement instability, or both. Three reforms can address this gap: mandatory reporting of difference wave reliability and inter-condition correlations, adoption of Generalizability Theory frameworks, and single-trial analytical methods that avoid categorical subtraction. These principles extend beyond bilingual research to all ERP domains using difference waves. Systematic psychometric verification should precede theoretical elaboration.",

          "abstract": "Teachers’ motivational behaviours play a critical role in shaping student outcomes, but commonly used measurement approaches rely on self-report or observation. These are vulnerable to bias and practical constraints, limiting rigorous theory testing and intervention research. To overcome these limitations, and building on advances in language-based behavioural analysis, we developed a phrase-based coding framework for classifying teachers’ motivational language based on Self-Determination Theory. We first compiled a pool of candidate phrases. Experts reviewed this pool to ensure face validity and refinement, resulting in the full, unfiltered dictionary. In the training set, transcripts from the most and least need-supportive teachers—as determined by observers—were compared using weighted log odds ratios to identify phrases more characteristic of each group. We then filtered the dictionary using these odds ratios, resulting in the filtered dictionary. The expert-derived dictionary consisted of 227 words (149 need-supportive and 82 need-thwarting). Correlations between dictionary-based and observer ratings were moderate and significant for the unfiltered dictionary (r = .34), comparable to inter-observer agreement, rating the same lesson (r = .32). Filtering the dictionary improved accuracy on the training set (r = .49) but decreased accuracy on the test set compared to the unfiltered dictionary (r = .64 vs. .73). This phrase-based framework provides a cost-efficient and reliable method for analysing teachers’ motivational language. It appears to perform comparably to human observers in predicting need-supportive teaching and offers a practical tool for teacher education, as well as a theoretically grounded basis for training more advanced models.",

This study examined early positive contextual factors that support positive affect, a central indicator of well-being, focusing on school and peer relationships as key adolescent social contexts. Using a large U.S.-based sample (N = 7,879, 47% female) and bivariate latent change score models, we examined longitudinal associations between self-reported school/peer support and MRI-based measures of cortical thickness of social brain regions (medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), banks of the superior temporal sulcus (banks of STS), and temporal pole (TP)) from age ~12 to ~14; and how these associations related to positive affect at age ~15. School and peer support were differentially associated with cortical thickness changes and demonstrated sex-specific patterns. We observed correlated change between school support and thickness of the SMG (β = 0.04, p = .01) and TP (β = 0.04, p = .02), as well as female-specific correlated change between peer support and TP thickness (β = 0.05, p &lt; .01), with less steep declines in support associated with less cortical thinning. Although school support at age ~12 was not associated with subsequent cortical thickness change, greater peer support at this age was associated with greater cortical thinning in the SMG (β = -0.05, p &lt; .01) and with a female- specific effect in the mOFC (β = -0.05, p = .02). Additionally, less steep declines in school and peer support were associated with greater positive affect at age ~15 (school: βs = 0.20, ps &lt; .001; peer: βs = 0.07, ps &lt; .001), and less cortical thinning in the SMG was related to greater positive affect (βs = 0.05-0.06, ps &lt; .01). These findings highlight nuanced links between social support, structural cortical development, and positive affect, and underscore the importance of supportive peer relationships and school environments in promoting adolescent socio-emotional development.",

Results document significant STI effects in all groups, with no systematic differences between German and Chinese-German participants. Surprisingly, STI effects were stronger in Chinese-language conditions for Chinese-German participants, suggesting a cultural contrast rather than assimilation effect. We observed no significant relationships of STI effects with measures of participants’ independent and interdependent self-construal nor person vs. situation attributions. These findings further challenge prior assumptions about the influence of individualism-collectivism on STIs. We discuss whether the relative robustness of STIs across cultural groups implies that they may function as a cognitive universal underscoring the need for future research into specific cultural and contextual factors shaping STIs in impression formation.",

In a nationally diverse sample of 584 adults who utilize GenAI tools, 29.3% of users reported turning to these models for emotional support or coping advice, with prevalence rising to 47.0% among those experiencing severe distress. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that psychological distress was the primary predictor of use. While attachment anxiety was initially associated with AI-mediated support seeking, this association was largely accounted for by distress levels, suggesting that anxiously attached individuals may turn to AI primarily due to heightened emotional need. Conversely, attachment avoidance emerged as a robust negative predictor after adjusting for distress, indicating a reluctance to engage with AI support even under conditions of need. Overall, findings position general-purpose GenAI as an accessible, low-barrier resource that is disproportionately utilized by distressed individuals, underscoring the need for research on the safety and efficacy of this emerging digital behavior.",

The analysis shows that, in trade-off choices where attributes are negatively correlated, information avoidance can emerge as an optimal information policy, as seeking less information can improve preference alignment. Consumers choose which attributes to seek or avoid, while attention acts as the mechanism transforming processed information into decision weights. When multiple attributes are jointly processed, diminishing returns to attention compress their relative influence, reducing differentiation in effective decision weights. In environments characterized by negatively correlated attributes, selectively avoiding a less important attribute can yield choices more closely aligned with underlying preferences than broad information seeking. By contrast, seeking information across multiple conflicting attributes amplifies weight compression and increases expected utility loss. The model further identifies conditions under which information avoidance should diminish, showing how changes in attribute variance, search costs, or beliefs about attribute trade-offs restore the benefits of broader information seeking. These results have implications for information design and consumer welfare.",

          "abstract": "Speakers are typically assumed to adhere to Gricean communicative principles, which allows comprehenders to make inferences about the intended meaning. However, such inferences depend on the speaker being a pragmatic communicator, and overestimating the speaker's pragmatic competence may result in incorrect interpretations. We investigate whether comprehenders track speakers' pragmatic competence during interaction and adjust their interpretations accordingly. Across two paradigms, we find strong evidence of such an adaptation effect, whereby comprehenders lower their confidence in the pragmatic interpretation when interacting with a speaker who behaves less optimally. We propose a Bayesian belief updating model of this adaptation process. Our modeling results suggest that in some situations listeners may learn not through direct observation of speaker behavior, but by reasoning about their own interpretations: adaptation occurs on trials that are ambiguous from the listener’s perspective, even when they are unambiguous from the speaker’s perspective. Additionally, we observe evidence for different adaptation strategies, which may be explained by different prior beliefs about the speaker and tendency to generalize across interlocutors.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this prevailing view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary neurogenetic origins (explaining developmental multifinality and fanning) but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes (explaining developmental equifinality). While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

However, evidence also suggests deficits in more basic cognitive functions, including lower-order face processing (e.g., detection of non-emotional facial features) and indicators of general intelligence (e.g., crystallized intelligence). We examined associations of facial emotion recognition, lower-order face processing, and crystallized intelligence with personality pathology, considering both categorical and dimensional PD models and distinguishing general personality pathology (personality functioning) from specific personality pathology (pathological personality traits and specific PDs). We further tested whether associations between personality functioning and facial emotion recognition were accounted for by lower-order face processing or crystallized intelligence. In a clinical sample (n = 219), cognitive abilities were assessed using performance-based measures, and personality pathology was assessed using interviews and self-reports. Structural equation modeling, including correlated factor and bifactor-(S-1) models, was applied to separate general from specific personality pathology variance. General personality pathology showed strong negative associations with facial emotion recognition and small-to-moderate negative associations with lower-order face processing and crystallized intelligence. Associations with specific personality pathology were substantially attenuated when controlling for general personality pathology. The link between personality functioning and facial emotion recognition was only minimally accounted for by lower-order face processing or crystallized intelligence. These findings indicate that cognitive deficits in PD primarily reflect severity rather than disorder-specific variance, while also pointing to partially independent cognitive domains linked to general personality dysfunction. Our study suggests that dimensional models provide a more nuanced framework for understanding cognitive impairment in personality pathology.",

          "abstract": "Reward-predictive cues shape behavior through Pavlovian conditioning, yet individuals vary in the value they assign to these cues. Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models are widely used to model choices and reaction times in\ncognitive tasks. Despite their success in binary and multi-alternative decision-making, their\napplication to sequential multi-response tasks, such as free recall and verbal fluency, has\nremained limited. The primary challenge in modeling multiple responses within a single\ntrial lies in the absence of tractable likelihood functions. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce simulation-based inference into the evidence accumulation framework and\ndevelop an R package that integrates simulation engines for five representative models (the\ndiffusion decision model, leaky competing accumulator model, linear ballistic accumulator\nmodel, racing diffusion model, and Lévy flight model), extending them to the\nmulti-response contexts. Across three simulation studies, the package demonstrated robust\nparameter recovery across representative models, their multi-response extensions, and\ncovariate-dependent variants. An empirical application to an aging-related free recall\ndataset further demonstrated the package’s ability to uncover computational mechanisms\nunderlying age-related differences in memory retrieval. Taken together, this package\nprovides a foundation for building customized evidence accumulation models and expands\nthe range of cognitive processes that can be studied within the evidence accumulation\nframework.",

          "authors": "Raunak M Pillai; Jay Joseph Van Bavel",
          "abstract": "Classic social psychological accounts of belief formation propose that beliefs can be influenced by directional motives to reach specific conclusions. Such theories have been particularly influential in recent accounts of the spread of political misinformation. However, the assumption of directionally-motivated belief formation has been challenged by theories reexplaining motivational effects in terms of purely cognitive factors like prior beliefs or information exposure. The goal of the present manuscript is to provide a direct test of the assumption that social-identity-based motives can shape what people believe. We report three experiments (N = 1,459) causally isolating the effects of identity-based directional motives on belief formation using minimal groups. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to trust, and thus believe statements endorsed by, arbitrarily assigned in-group versus out-group members. Experiment 2 replicates these findings and experimentally demonstrates that this in- group bias in belief can be affected by social motivations to affiliate with groups: exposing participants to social exclusion selectively reduced belief in statements endorsed by out-group members. Experiment 3 suggests that these effects arise because social motivations moderate people's relative trust in novel in-group over out-group members. Together, these results address longstanding debates about the possible role of social motivations in epistemic processes by demonstrating that social identities, unconfounded from other explanatory factors, can shape who people trust and what they believe.",

This study sought to generate context-specific evidence on factors influencing the uptake of reproductive self-care services.\n\nMethods\nIn total, 19 professionals, comprising health providers, program managers, digital referral agents, and community facilitators, and 29 end-users from Accra, Tamale, Cape Coast, and Sunyani, participated in qualitative interviews spanning six (6) reproductive health domains - namely, family planning, abortion, HIV/STI, maternal and child health, general SRHR, and cervical cancer. Instrument design and data extraction were underscored by Levesque’s framework of health care access. Data was organised and coded in Dedoose and analysed using thematic analysis.\n\nResults\nKey facilitators identified include: Access to trusted, culturally attuned knowledge systems (Approachability); Open, vocal support for services by community and religious leaders (Acceptability); Convenience of technology-enabled remote support (Availability and Accommodation); Service affordability, aided by waivers and discounts (Affordability); Remote pathway reduces end-users’ experience of stigma (Appropriateness). \nKey barriers identified include: Public awareness done in fewer languages (Approachability); Myths and misconceptions, reinforced by religious and socio-cultural norms (Acceptability); Poor end-user experience resulting from immature facility systems (Availability and Accommodation); Additional costs with remote access, notably including courier services (Affordability); Inequitable treatment of end-users due to administrative and socio-cultural constraints (Appropriateness).\n\nConclusion\nReproductive-health self-care is a viable alternative to conventional models, but stakeholders must recognise its unique enablers and constraints, and design context-specific solutions to facilitate its scale.",

          "abstract": "Australia implemented the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024 (Cth; SMMA) on December 10, 2025. This policy represents a world-first social media age-restriction, which requires age-restricted social media platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account. Preliminary estimates suggest that approximately 1,194,000 young people will be affected by the deactivation of accounts. As the SMMA is enacted, we are collecting data to examine the outcomes for young people, parents, and families. This study protocol paper serves as a summary of the methodological design for the evaluation of the implementation and outcomes of the SMMA, including a) young people’s adherence, and the SMMA’s impact on b) their digital practices, c) their physical, psychological, and social wellbeing, d) their families, and e) community attitudes and dynamics. To evaluate the impact of the SMMA implementation, a mixed-methods approach is being undertaken involving 4,121 young people aged 10 to 16 years and their parents or caregivers. Data collection involves longitudinal parent-child surveys, opt-in passive smartphone tracking, administrative data, qualitative interviews, focus groups and diary studies. Findings from this evaluation will inform national policy oversight and implementation in Australia;  contribute empirical evidence to international debates; and inform other countries considering similar age-based regulation of social media. Results will be disseminated through public-facing reports, peer-reviewed publications, and stakeholder engagement activities to support evidence-informed decision-making in digital safety regulation in Australia and internationally.",

          "abstract": "Human social life is filled with coordination problems: passing each other in a hallway, taking turns talking and listening, differentiating the meanings of \"hook up with\" and \"meet up with,\" gathering at the same time and place, etc. But what happens when we suffer a mix-up—for instance, we get stuck dancing back and forth in the hallway, or I casually mention that I “hooked up” with your mother last night? Here, I argue that such mix-ups posed a significant adaptive problem for our ancestors, disrupting cooperation, damaging reputations, fomenting needless conflict, and destroying valuable relationships. Natural selection favored three solutions to this adaptive problem: 1) a sense of humor (i.e., the ability to detect, anticipate, and avoid mix-ups), 2) mutual laughter in response to humor  (which creates common knowledge of the mix-up and defuses its costs), and 3) joking as a hard-to-fake signal of one’s ability to detect and avoid mix-ups (and thus one’s value as a coordination partner). I present a formal model of these phenomena suggesting that agents with a sense of humor, the ability to laugh at (or mutually signal) the humor they’ve sensed, and a preference for partners with a ‘good sense of humor,’ would have been favored by natural selection under conditions that were plausibly characteristic of human evolution. I use the model to shed light on the nature of wordplay, comic timing, practical jokes, awkwardness, embarrassment, mockery, absurdity, mirth, seriousness, impersonations, slapstick, satire, creepy clowns, and cringe comedy.",

          "abstract": "Impairments in speech production occur at a high rate after surgical resection of primary brain tumours. Due to their spatial heterogeneity, tumours can be problematic for voxel-wise lesion-symptom mapping. In addition, lesion maps of resection cavities may not capture displaced/deformed tracts, limiting the accuracy of white matter disconnection approaches based on population average atlas templates. Here we explore whether shape features extracted from individualised diffusion MRI tractography such as volume, curvature, surface area, irregularity, and span of six language-related white matter tracts are able to predict long-term speech production outcomes in survivors of left hemisphere primary brain tumours: The arcuate (AF), uncinate (UF), inferior longitudinal (ILF), inferior frontal occipital (IFOF), ventral component of the superior longitudinal (SLF III) fasciculi, and frontal aslant tract (FAT). Best fit regression models selected via cross-validation and both univariate and multivariate lesion-symptom mapping analyses including clinical and demographic variables were used to compare the predictive capability of tract shape features, atlas disconnection estimates, and lesion location. Lesion-symptom mapping failed to reveal any significant relationships with speech production outcomes. A model comprising atlas-based disconnection estimates from the UF, SLF III, and FAT was able to significantly predict long-term speech production outcomes (R2 = 0.14). However, a model comprising shape features of the FAT, SLF III, and IFOF explained considerably more variance (R2 = 0.37). Finally, we show that, in this dataset, shape features uniquely predict 26% variance that is not accounted for by disconnection estimates, demonstrating their relevance for predicting speech production outcomes in post-surgical patients.",

This method is successful at identifying the most effective theoretical process such as social norms, or efficacy beliefs at influencing socially beneficial outcomes, ranging from vaccination behaviors to climate actions. However, less is known about the influence that underlying structural, modal, or conceptual intervention features have on their effectiveness, which limits both the theoretical interpretation of the effects, as well as the practical construction of theories in their most effective implementation. Here, we empirically examine the impact of 19 intervention features ranging from attentional ease or outcome-specificity, to delivery modality (e.g., text, video, image, open-ended questions), or conceptual construction (e.g., risk, moralization, emotions), on the effectiveness of 274 psychological interventions extracted from 15 megastudies that included N=4.13 million participants. We find that only one feature - the interventions’ specificity to the outcomes measured - significantly and consistently predicts effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to outcomes of interest. This finding provides empirically guided insights into the interpretation and successful implementation of behavioural interventions in policy-relevant contexts.",

          "abstract": "Demoralization syndrome (DS) - a distinct clinical entity characterized by helplessness, hopelessness, and a persistent loss of meaning - affects approximately one in five Canadians with advanced cancer and is associated with increased desire for hastened death, negative clinical outcomes, and higher economic burden, yet recognition and treatment of DS remains suboptimal in modern oncology.  While current pharmacological treatments fail to address demoralization's existential dimensions, and despite the potential effectiveness of a number of psychosocial interventions, not everyone responds to behavioral therapies and they remain chronically underfunded in mainstream oncology. Mindfulness-Based Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy (MB-PAT) offers enhanced therapeutic potential by synergistically integrating evidence-based mindfulness training with psilocybin's neuroplastic effects; however, the traditional dyadic delivery model limits scalability within healthcare s settings. This viewpoint opines that MB-PAT delivered in a group format represents a potentially optimal solution to this evidence-implementation gap. Our contention is that MB-PAT may harness synergistic biopsychosocial mechanisms that directly counter the isolation of demoralization through an integrative approach. We finish by highlighting the Canadian Network for Psychedelic-Assisted Cancer Therapy (CAN-PACT) as a pioneering initiative poised to generate critical evidence, infrastructure and capacity through its planned multi-phase initiatives and projects. By leveraging existing group-therapy infrastructure and therapist familiarity with mindfulness-based interventions as the basis for multi-site national clinical trials, and developing a scalable, equity-focused delivery model, MB-PAT offers a pragmatic pathway to integrate potentially transformative existential care into publicly funded Canadian oncology practice.",

Confirming the first assumption, residents of more unequal areas reported stronger and more frequent upward and downward economic comparisons. These associations were mediated by perceived competitiveness. Challenging the second assumption, income inequality was associated with a mix of emotional responses to comparison: Inequality consistently predicted resentment when comparing with better-off others and compassion when comparing with worse-off others. Inequality also predicted shame, hope, relief, contempt, and anxiety in one study but not the other. Finally, inequality predicted support for redistribution, an association mediated by resentment and compassion. Together, the findings confirm that income inequality fuels social comparison but reveal that its emotional and attitudinal consequences are more nuanced than commonly assumed.",

Participants received either anodal stimulation, which increases the excitability of neurons, or sham stimulation, and subsequently rated metaphorical (e.g., Passion is a storm), literal (e.g., A gorilla is an ape), or nonsensical (e.g., Depression is a party) sentences on comprehensibility. Participants who received anodal stimulation rated metaphors to be less comprehensible than participants who received sham stimulation. No effects were observed for literal or nonsensical sentences. In addition, word-level semantic characteristics affected metaphor comprehensibility ratings but not literal or nonsensical sentences.

          "abstract": "Objectives: Our study examines how individuals perceive responses to mental health–related questions when these are generated either by an automated system or by a licensed psychologist. Specifically, we compare evaluations across three dimensions: empathy, utility, and expectation, and explore whether digital health literacy shapes these perceptions. Methods: Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, 36 participants evaluated a response to a question they had personally submitted, attributed either to an automated system or to a psychologist. In Study 2, 126 participants assessed a standardized set of question–answer pairs, evenly divided between the two response sources. Across both studies, participants completed the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) to examine whether digital health literacy was associated with response evaluations. Results: In personalized contexts (Study 1), psychologist-generated responses were generally preferred across empathy, utility, and expectation, although differences did not reach statistical significance. In depersonalized contexts (Study 2), automated responses received higher ratings on all three dimensions, with large effect sizes. No significant associations emerged between eHealth literacy and participants’ evaluations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that automated mental health responses can be perceived as empathetic and useful, particularly in standardized or less personally involving situations. However, they may not fully reproduce the relational qualities typically associated with human interaction. The results support approaches that integrate automated systems with professional expertise in mental health communication.",

New approaches for increasing vaccination rates are needed. We tested whether brief text conversations with the artificial intelligence large language model (LLM) GPT-4 Turbo could significantly increase intentions to vaccinate children against HPV.\nMethods\nWe conducted a pre-registered randomized clinical trial in which participants were assigned to a text conversation with GPT-4 Turbo in which the LLM (with no specific training) tried to persuade them to vaccinate against HPV, a CDC informational brochure, or a control conversation with the LLM about an unrelated topic. In October 2025, we recruited 7368 Americans via Cint Exchange who had unvaccinated eligible children or did not yet have children, and whose intentions to vaccinate their children against HPV was under 75 on a 0-100 scale. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention measures of HPV vaccination intentions for sons and daughters. Randomization was via Qualtrics, with no masking possible. Our primary outcome was change in HPV vaccination intentions.\nFindings\nThe AI-dialogue significantly increased vaccination intentions relative to the control (sons: 9.73 points, 95% CI [6.89, 12.56], p &lt; .001; daughters: 7.72 points, 95% CI [4.98, 10.46], p &lt; .001); as did the brochure (sons: 8.04 points, 95% CI [4.83, 11.25], p &lt; .001; daughters: 5.51 points, 95% CI [2.52, 8.50], p &lt; .001). The differences between the AI-dialogue and the brochure were not statistically significant (sons, p = .268; daughters, p = .120). Post-assignment attrition rates did not significantly differ between treatment arms (AI-dialgue, 11.9pp; brochure, 14.2pp), although both arms had significantly more attrition than the control (5.1pp); our results were robust to baseline-carried-forward imputation. Post-hoc analysis found that the AI-dialogue was significantly more likely than the CDC brochure to produce large increases in vaccination intentions (e.g. &gt;30 points).

We tested two scalable interventions: a brief persuasive prompt encouraging students to try again, and a visual default nudge that highlighted the retry option. Both interventions increased persistence after failure, and when combined, their effects were additive—suggesting they operate through distinct psychological mechanisms. The nudge had a much larger immediate effect, but the prompt showed proportionally greater spillover to untreated problems. These findings advance theories of persuasive design, demonstrating that implicit, interface-level nudges and explicit motivational prompts can be combined to avoid redundancy while amplifying impact.",

          "authors": "Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "I propose that imagery's origins lie in interoceptive processing, the phylogenetically ancient system linking internal bodily states to valence, emotion, and motivational salience (Craig, 2009; Barrett, 2017). Interoceptive signals inherently specify survival-relevant goals: hunger with approach, threat-arousal with avoidance, sexual arousal with pursuit. This makes interoception the necessary foundation for any planning system because planning requires knowing what you are planning for: which bodily states and emotions to pursue or avoid. Motor imagery emerged first, extending forward models to enable offline action planning. Because survival-relevant motor actions already involved interoceptive states, motor imagery inherited interoceptive integration from these forward models. Motor imagery worked well for first- person action planning directly coupled to immediate motor execution. However, as social complexity increased, organisms needed to simulate scenarios involving others; tracking rival alliances, predicting dominance conflicts, monitoring mating competitors. Here, organisms faced a discriminability problem rooted in the low-dimensional nature of autonomic arousal (Barrett, 2017). The same autonomic pattern can occur across different social situations (dominance encounters, rival conflicts, mating opportunities) that demand distinct behavioral responses. Visual imagery evolved to solve this discriminability problem by binding distinctive sensory features with interoceptive states. This binding makes simulations goal-directed: imagining a dominant rival automatically activates the associated arousal pattern and avoidance tendency, while imagining a mating opportunity activates approach motivation. Mental simulations therefore evolved as multimodal representations where sensory and interoceptive components are bound during construction itself, creating images that inherently possess valence and motivation, not as subsequent responses to neutral sensory simulations but as constitutive features of mental images themselves (cf Silvanto &amp; Nagai, 2025).",

This study presents the psychometric validation of the Perceived Deterritorialization Scale (PDS), a 15-item instrument capturing three dimensions: spatial identity loss, environmental instability, and territorial intrusion. Across two studies involving French employees in individual, open-plan, and flex-office settings (N = 340; N = 225), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a robust three-factor correlated structure. The PDS demonstrates strong internal consistency (α = .81–.83) and excellent model fit (CFI = .96; RMSEA = .058), explaining 45.7% of the variance. These results establish the PDS as a reliable tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate the psychological costs of spatial reorganizations and guide evidence-based workplace interventions.",

          "abstract": "This study utilized data from a large-scale multi-ethnic cohort study on thousands of English children aged between 7 and 10 years from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, enabling novel, detailed exploration of age, difficulty, serial order effects, and error patterns in children’s working memory. Children completed three tasks that are routinely used in cognitive testing and the developmental literature to assess working memory, covering verbal and visuospatial domains and different levels of executive control. Children’s working memory performance increased with age for all tasks, and were particularly pronounced when more executive control was required. There was a linear and steep decline in performance with increasing difficulty (i.e., memory load) across all tasks. In contrast to previous literature, the serial order curves for the verbal and visuospatial tasks showed distinct patterns. Further, the task requiring the most executive control (backward digit recall) indicated a strategic saturation effect where children’s performance did not scale as memory load increased. Transpositions were the most common error across all tasks, and typically involved items being recalled one position away from their true location, suggesting a locality constraint. However, with increasing task difficulty there was an increase in items displaced beyond the adjacent locality, and these patterns appeared more pronounced for the younger age groups, which suggests children may have less precise or less stable positional bindings. These findings offer novel insights into children’s performance on routinely used working memory tasks and provide a foundation for refining both theoretical models and practical assessments in developmental research.",

          "abstract": "Doomscrolling, defined as the compulsive consumption of negative online information, has been increasingly linked to poorer mental health and heightened anxiety in contexts of societal threat. The present research had two main aims: (1) to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of the Doomscrolling Scale (DSS) and (2) to examine the mediating role of doomscrolling in the relationship between social media addiction and war-related anxiety and persistent thinking about war. Two cross-sectional studies were conducted among Polish adults (Study 1: N = 530; Study 2: N = 529). In Study 1, confirmatory factor analysis supported the one factor structure of both the full 15-item DSS and its short 4-item version. The scales demonstrated high internal consistency and satisfactory convergent validity through positive associations with social media addiction, fear of missing out, escapism, and psychological distress, as well as discriminant validity through weaker relations with well-being and life satisfaction. In Study 2, structural equation modeling indicated that doomscrolling fully mediated the relationships between social media addiction and both anxiety of war and persistent thinking about war. Overall, the findings confirm that doomscrolling is a coherent and measurable construct linked to maladaptive patterns of media use and emotional responses to threat-related content. The validated Polish versions of the DSS may be used in research and applied settings to assess risk associated with excessive exposure to negative information and to inform preventive and psychoeducational interventions aimed at promoting healthier media consumption.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Assessing the validity of testimony is critical in sexual abuse cases, particularly in case of recovered memories, whose authenticity has been considered controversial. The current study examined whether different types of memories (i.e., continuous, spontaneously recovered, recovered following an active search) could be reliably distinguished and whether they differed in the extent to which they are supported by evidence. Hypotheses: We predicted that three types of memories could be reliably differentiated: Continuous memories, spontaneously recovered memories, and recovered memories following an active search. We further predicted that continuous memories and spontaneously recovered memories would be more frequently corroborated by evidence than recovered memories following an active search. Method: We analyzed 140 police files on complex cases of sexual abuse in the distant past in which the prosecutor requested advice from an expert committee of behavioral experts. One pair of coders identified memory type based on continuity and retrieval, and another set of coders scored the degree of supporting evidence. Results: Memory types could be differentiated reliably. Statements from (alleged) victims in the continuous memory group were corroborated more often than those in the recovered memory-following-search group, which were rarely supported by strong evidence. The data were inconclusive regarding whether recovered memories following an active search and spontaneously recovered memories differ in the extent to which they were corroborated by evidence. Exploratory analyses showed that spontaneously recovered memories were more often related to single incidents, whereas recovered memories following an active search frequently involved sexual abuse over an extended period, including reports of multiple perpetrators. Conclusions: Reports of sexual abuse in the distant past can be reliably categorized into three types that help shed light on the likelihood of finding corroborating evidence in a criminal context. Recovered memories should not be treated as a homogeneous phenomenon because their phenomenology varies.",

          "abstract": "Selective attention is central to long-term memory retrieval, yet how attention selects and prioritizes relevant memory contents remains underexplored. Still needed is a well-controlled experimental framework to isolate and systematically manipulate attention orienting in long-term memory. The current study addresses this gap. Building on retrocue designs from working-memory research, we introduce procedures to investigate how selective attention operates within contextual long-term memory. Across three experiments (n = 235), participants learned associations between scenes and the identities and locations of two objects. In a subsequent Selective Retrieval task, participants viewed the studied scenes and later identified scene-associated objects from an array. Spatial cues directed internal attention to the learned location of the relevant object to be probed or neutral cues offered no spatial information. Informative cues yielded significant benefits and costs relative to neutral cues. Benefits emerged regardless of whether cues appeared before or after scene presentation and were equivalent across short and long retrieval intervals, suggesting attention may operate directly during long-term retrieval memory without requiring working-memory mediation. This approach offers a flexible method for isolating and manipulating attention functions in long-term memory, enabling future investigation of the psychological and neural mechanisms governing selective memory access.",

We then show how to do it, by proposing different wellbeing measures suitable as outcomes in lab and field experiments, by illustrating how to integrate them into randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and by alerting the reader what to pay attention to. As a direct measure of overall welfare, wellbeing data are not only a useful screening tool to detect unintended consequences but also allow analysts to appraise the \"full\" impacts of behavioural public policies.

Yet, the mechanisms through which these components contribute to global program outcomes are largely unclear. Potential mechanisms are the translation of immediate, session-level effects, amount of attended sessions, and social support. Ecological momentary assessment might reveal these mechanisms at the session-level and determine their link with program-level outcomes.\nWe investigated an 8-week, naturalistic, health-insurance-provided group-based secondary prevention program comprising weekly outdoor PA with weekly PsycEd in individuals experiencing mild mood disturbances. To assess session-level mechanisms, 80 participants reported their current mood and stress (time pressure and burden) before (3 pm) and after (9 pm) session times and further rated each session on helpfulness, group atmosphere, and social support. In addition, session attendance was recorded. Concerning pre-post program effects, affective well-being (WHO-5) was assessed. Regarding potential links, we examined moderation of pre-post program effects by the assessed mechanisms. \nRegarding session-level mechanisms, results revealed that sessions improved both mood and stress burden compared to non-session days, while only PA sessions improved time pressure. PA sessions were also rated higher on helpfulness, group atmosphere, and social support. Concerning program-level outcomes, WHO-5 scores improved from pre- to post-program with small effect size. Regarding links, participants attending more sessions had higher WHO-5 improvements, but no other mechanism variable moderated the improvement. \nThese findings illustrate immediate improvements on the session level in mood and stress. Yet, these effects did not translate into more global outcomes such as affective well-being across the program, but attendance did. Potential program effectiveness might be boosted by targeting continued attendance. Outdoor PA might be slightly superior to PsycEd in activating group benefits and could potentially be expanded.",

Using theory-driven variable selection and data-driven network modelling, we identified the shortest pathways linking personal identity factors to other-race recognition. Participants (N = 515) completed face recognition tasks and personality, contact, ethnic-racial identity, and emotions measures. Network analysis revealed a hierarchical face recognition model: hostility is the central mediator through which personal identity variables influence other-race recognition. Intergroup emotions and ethnic-racial identity further play dual roles in recognition. While hostility and negative own-race attitudes impair other-race recognition, multiculturalist identity, empathy, and affection reduce hostility to improve performance. This study redefines other-race recognition as rooted in intergroup emotions and ethnic-racial identity, rather than merely perceptual or socio-cognitive processes. Interventions should focus on reducing hostility and promoting empathetic and multicultural identities.",

          "abstract": "Cultural experiences can strongly shape human cognition. Prior research has yielded mixed evidence on whether literacy—a culturally acquired skill—affects spoken language processing. Using an individual differences approach, we examined whether literacy predicts the speed of spoken word recognition. Using a large dataset (Hintz et al., 2025) that is unprecedented in size (number of participants) and depth (number of skills assessed), 655 typically developed native Dutch adults between 18 and 30 years carried out a lexical decision task: Participants listened to Dutch words and nonwords and judged their lexical status as quickly as possible. Drift diffusion modelling of response times provided drift rate estimates indexing the speed of auditory evidence accumulation. To clarify which aspects of literacy matter, we distinguished between representational literacy (vocabulary, orthographic knowledge, author recognition) and procedural literacy (self-paced reading fluency, rapid automatized naming). Psychometric network analysis and structural equation modelling showed that spoken word recognition was reliably predicted by representational literacy, whereas procedural literacy contributed little once shared variance was controlled. Domain-general skills (processing speed, working memory, nonverbal reasoning) explained additional variance but did not mediate literacy effects. Our findings indicate that extensive written language experience enhances spoken word recognition primarily by sharpening and enriching linguistic representations, rather than by improving reading-related procedures. Literacy’s beneficial influence on spoken word processing thus resides primarily at the representational level.",

We conducted a 2-week AA study with four prompts per day, yielding 8,474 measurement occasions from 205 participants. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to predict momentary compliance using psychological, contextual, temporal, and prior compliance variables. Compliance was most likely when participants experienced “typical” levels of stress, time pressure, and mood. Participants were more compliant when at home (vs. elsewhere) and when alone (vs. with others). Compliance was also higher on work days (vs. nonwork days).

This study presents the Children’s Voices on School Well-Being (CV-SWB), a mixed-methods instrument designed for children aged 3 to 12 years. The CV-SWB includes 21 items rated on a three-point Likert scale with visual support, complemented by open-ended questions eliciting children’s justifications. The instrument was individually administered to 548 children from preschool and elementary education in 12 schools in Spain. Exploratory factor analyses supported a five-factor structure: Belonging and Fairness, School Liking, Daily Relationships, Adult Care, and Conflict and Victimization, with evidence of measurement invariance across age and gender. Qualitative analyses revealed coherent thematic domains in children’s explanations, converging on personal relationships, school atmosphere, self-perception, and academic aspects, supporting the interpretability of children’s responses. Practice or Policy: The CV-SWB provides researchers and practitioners with an appropriate tool to assess school well-being from children’s perspectives from early schooling. By integrating quantitative ratings with children’s verbal explanations, the instrument facilitates a comprehensive and child-centered understanding of school experiences, informing early educational practices and policies promoting well-being and participation in preschool and elementary settings.",

Schools accredited with the Association for Character Education’s Quality Mark (QM) or Quality Mark Plus (QM+) consistently achieved higher Progress 8 scores, with QM+ schools in several years gaining more than half a grade per pupil averaged across GCSE subjects. Study 2 complements these findings through a national survey of QM and QM+ schools, illuminating perceived mechanisms linking character education to learning, wellbeing, and school climate. Together, the findings provide robust and policy-relevant evidence that character education may meaningfully enhance school climate while supporting, rather than compromising, academic development.",

          "abstract": "Voice hearing has been linked to an externalising bias, i.e. the tendency to misattribute internally generated experiences to external sources. In signal detection terms, this manifests as a more liberal response criterion (greater willingness to report detecting signals). While cultural factors shape voice-hearing experiences, whether religious affiliation influences this perceptual bias remains unclear. We tested whether dialogic and positive inner speech - patterns relevant to prayer and religious cognition - modulate differences in response criterion between Christians (*N* = 27) and non-religious individuals (*N* = 49). Bayesian mixed-effects models found no main effect of religious group, suggesting Christian affiliation alone does not increase externalising bias. However, dialogic inner speech showed a decisive interaction: among Christians, more frequent dialogic inner speech predicted more liberal responding; consistent with religious frameworks that normalise conversation with a divine presence, rich internal dialogue may be more readily attributed to an external source; no such effect was found among non-religious participants. Positive inner speech showed moderate interactions. Among Christians, more frequent positive inner speech predicted more conservative responding, particularly for negative stimuli. Among non-religious participants, more frequent positive inner speech predicted more conservative responding for positive stimuli but trended towards more liberal responding for negative stimuli, consistent with thematic congruence between inner speech content and stimulus valence shaping source discrimination. These findings suggest externalising bias emerges from interactions between inner speech patterns and cultural framework rather than religious affiliation alone.",

To address this lack of progress, we conducted a multi-stage modified Delphi study (n = 85 round one; n = 59 round two) followed by an in-person World Café workshop (n = 30) involving experts from most major game studios, international policy bodies, NGOs, research funders, and academia. Across online and in-person stages, participants identified shared priorities for future research and articulated practical steps needed to advance them. Using preferential-rank Single Transferable Vote analysis and reflexive thematic synthesis, we derived four cross-cutting conditions which had general consensus across stakeholders as necessary for coordinated progress: (i) strengthening evidence, (ii) improving communication, (iii) fostering collaboration, and (iv) building literacy. We translate these into a cross-sector roadmap outlining concrete near-, mid-, and long-term actions for researchers, industry, policymakers, funders, and civil society. Although developed in the context of video games, the structural barriers and proposed solutions generalise to behavioural science as a whole. Our findings show that while progress can often be difficult in digital behavioural science, applying the often underutilised Delphi and World Café methods allowed for the creation of both convergent priorities and a concrete path forward that stakeholders across sectors support. We see this as a foundation for building a more cumulative, transparent, and collaborative science of human behaviour in digital environments.",

RD — the perception of being unfairly disadvantaged— elicits negative emotions such as anger and disgust, which may in turn foster conspiratorial interpretations. \nMethods: Across eight preregistered studies (N = 3,306), we experimentally induced direct, individual-level RD using a validated unfair-outcome paradigm and assessed anger, disgust, and (exploratorily) anxiety. All studies measured conspiracy mentality and specific conspiracy beliefs. \nResults: We synthesized study-wise effects in a random-effects mini–meta-analysis. Experimentally induced RD reliably increased negative emotional responses (i.e., anger and disgust across all studies. Anger and disgust, but not anxiety were associated with both conspiracy mentality and specific conspiracy beliefs. Mini–meta-analytic mediation analyses showed consistent indirect effects of RD on both conspiracy outcomes through negative emotions. Total effects of RD on conspiracy beliefs, however, were small and inconsistent, underscoring the importance of emotional mechanisms. \nConclusions: The findings indicate that direct experiences of RD can promote conspiracy beliefs through heightened anger and disgust. This work highlights the importance of momentary emotional responses in the emergence of conspiracy beliefs and advances understanding of the affective mechanisms linking RD to conspiratorial thinking.",

          "abstract": "Difficulties in figurative language understanding are largely documented as part of a broader pragmatic impairment, especially in psychosis. Among figurative domains, metaphor stands out as a significant predictor of functioning, in addition to exhibiting meaningful associations with psychopathological and cognitive features. Yet, the assessment of metaphor comprehension remains a niche area, also due to the lack of reliable and valid tools. Here, we examined the psychometric properties of a rapid test of metaphor comprehension, the Physical and Mental Metaphors (PMM) task, involving a sample of 143 patients with schizophrenia and 57 controls. \nFindings provide robust support for the PMM reliability and validity. First, internal consistency was satisfactory, and the factorial structure aligned with theoretical assumptions. Second, the PMM demonstrated good validity, being strongly correlated with the pragmatic profile of patients as measured with a standard tool such as the Assessment of Pragmatics and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) test, showing also relevant associations with symptomatology, in particular abstract thinking and the broader domains of disorganization and negative symptoms, as well as weakly with Theory of Mind and global cognition. Third, the PMM task proved highly effective both in discriminating between individuals with and without pragmatic deficit, as detected via APACS, and in distinguishing patients from healthy controls.\nTaken together, these results indicate that the PMM task captures a specific impairment in figurative language and the general pragmatic vulnerability characteristic of schizophrenia, at the interface between symptoms. As such, it represents a valuable tool for detecting communicative disorders, characterizing symptoms and complementing the diagnostic process.",

          "authors": "Prasetia Putra; Jeanine Grütter; Bernadette Denk; Stephanie Farah; Fumihiro Kano; Jens C Pruessner",
          "abstract": "Positive peer interactions are fundamental to children's social and academic development, yet the dynamic behaviors that support these interactions remain poorly understood. Smiling is one of the most frequent and socially functional behaviors, and when children respond to each other's smiles (smile synchrony) it provides a window into their engagement and connectedness. Although previous work has examined smile synchrony in dyadic settings, little is known about how it shapes perception of group activity or how individual backgrounds and relationships contribute to these dynamics. Here we show that smile synchrony serves as a behavioral marker of group interaction quality in children's collaborative activities. We analyzed facial expressions of 187 children in 34 groups during two everyday educational activities: listening to a story and discussing it together. Using automated smile detection and event-based analysis to quantify directional smile synchrony, we found that children with higher and more evenly distributed synchrony perceived more positive group climates, characterized by greater safety, contentment, inclusion, collaboration, and cohesion. Individual and dyadic factors further modulated these dynamics in activity-specific ways. During listening, synchrony increased with gender and national identity similarity and with perceived closeness to the smile emitter. During discussion, synchrony was heightened among extraverted children, those reporting greater group closeness, and friendship pairs. These findings reveal that smile synchrony captures meaningful variation in children's social engagement during real-world group interactions and reflects the interplay of personality, interpersonal relationships, and social identity. Our results suggest that smile synchrony represents an accessible behavioral marker for assessing peer interaction quality in collaborative learning environments.",

          "abstract": "Meat consumption negatively affects planetary health in addition to human health and animal welfare, and choices to eat meat are often driven by motives that are encouraged or muted by contextual factors within the lived environment. Romantic relationships are among the most influential contextual factors, yet little is known about how relationships shape meat eating motives and behavior. We examined between- and within-person actor and partner effects of dietary motives on meat consumption in general and across 28 shared meals (7,203 ratings in total) in 272 romantic partners. We found that the most important motives for higher personal meat consumption were the beliefs that meat tastes good, is necessary for health, and is natural, whereas concerns about ethical impacts for the environment and animals were the most important factors for lower consumption. People ate more meat if their partners viewed meat as necessary and tasty. Only high meat eating partners ate more meat when they or their partners believed it was normal, or their partners believed it was natural, but ate less when their partners were concerned about the environment. They further felt less capable of preparing plant-based meat alternatives during meals in which their partners ate less meat. Only low meat eating partners ate more meat when they felt pressured or when their partner valued health or felt incapable of preparing alternatives. These results demonstrate how interpersonal processes shape sustainability related behaviors that involve conflicting motives and preferences between romantic partners, such as meat consumption. Understanding these processes offers insights for encouraging dietary shifts towards meat reduction.",

          "abstract": "The accumulation of resources by elites has increased global economic inequality, which is linked to deteriorated population health and wellbeing. A primary mechanism explaining this relationship is status anxiety (SA)—a chronic concern about one's socioeconomic status. This article reviews the literature on SA, outlining how it could be a causal chain from perceived EI to negative health and well-being outcomes. We summarize empirical evidence on SA differentiating it from related constructs like status seeking and envy, and explore its antecedents and consequences. Using the economic inequality as normative information model (EINIM) and the competitiveness-based framework, we explain how perceived inequality fosters a competitive climate, enhances materialistic values, and increases SES relevance for self-worth and social esteem. This competitive and materialistic climate becomes threatening when the gap between aspirations and expectations widens, triggering SA and chronic stress. Finally, we suggest future research directions to investigate mediators and moderators of the relationship between EI and SA, advocating for a more unified theoretical framework in this critical area of study.",

          "abstract": "Virtual agents are becoming increasingly common in various areas of daily life. A key area of application is their use as pedagogical agents in educational contexts. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and immersive media technologies have enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated agent-centered learning in immersive media environments (ACLIME), which are attracting expanding attention in academic research and educational practice. Despite this growing interest, the existing body of literature still lacks an integrated analysis of the key factors and their relationships that together define the interaction with pedagogical agents in immersive media environments. To address this gap, the present review conceptualizes and characterizes human-agent interaction in the context of learning in immersive media environments. It proposes a conceptual framework that structures the key technical and psychological factors involved and analyzes their characteristics and relationships. Additionally, it considers the role of temporal dynamics as an important but so far inadequately studied aspect of immersive human-agent interaction. By synthesizing these theoretical insights, the review provides an overview of the potentials and risks associated with agent-centered learning in immersive media environments. Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive foundation for future empirical research and application in the emerging field of immersive learning with pedagogical agents.",

          "abstract": "Metaphorical abstraction is the process wherein concrete concepts (e.g., key) develop lexicalized abstract meanings (e.g., important) as a result of frequent figurative contexts (e.g., communication is a key). In this study, we examine the semantic properties associated with metaphorical abstraction. Participants interpreted a series of low-familiar metaphors (e.g., religion is a raft), and generated their own related metaphors (e.g., spirituality is a raft). After this familiarization procedure, participants were presented with familiarized metaphors (e.g., faith is a raft) and non-familiarized metaphors (e.g., highways are snakes) and listed semantic properties associated with both the familiarized and non-familiarized metaphorical concepts (e.g., raft, snakes). The results showed that familiarized metaphorical concepts evoked semantic properties that were more semantically distant and more abstract than those evoked by non-familiarized metaphors or literal sentences. These results demonstrate how metaphorical abstraction results in the growth of novel and abstract semantic connections.",

A factor analysis identified four transdiagnostic dimensions: ‘Uncontrollable Thinking Patterns’, ‘Re-experiencing Difficult Events’, ‘Rigid High Standards’, and ‘Emotional Agency’. A multi-target Lasso regression was used to reduce the measure to 34 items. This measure, co-designed with a Lived Experience Advisory Group, was named the Youth Mental Health Map.

          "abstract": "Color plays a critical role in signaling important information for both approaching and avoiding items in the environment, which may result in animals having preferences for certain colors. Free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) in India have been shown to strongly prefer the color yellow over blue and grey (Roy et al. (2025). Animal Cognition, 28(1), 1–9). However, it is not clear if this finding is specific to free-ranging dogs in India or whether it generalizes to other dog populations. We conducted a replication of the Roy et al. study to assess whether pet dogs in the United States show similar preferences by measuring whether they approached yellow, blue, or grey bowls first. We conducted two experiments and found that pet dogs younger than seven years old first approached yellow bowls most often, replicating Roy et al.'s findings. To test if brightness rather than color accounted for this preference, we conducted a third preference experiment with light, medium, and dark grey bowls. The dogs did not prefer the light grey bowl, indicating that there was not an overall preference for brighter colors. Therefore, a preference for the color yellow could be a characteristic of dogs in general. Understanding dog color preferences is important for guiding the design of dog products and environments but also is critical for canine behavioral scientists who must make decisions about colors for experimental stimuli.",

Despite their natural complementarity, these approaches are not always studied in an integrated manner. Historically, both approaches developed within two largely independent communities: one focusing predominantly on basic research with connections to computational neuroscience, and the other on applied research with connections to experimental psychology and movement sciences. The division between these two communities is evident in citation patterns, conference attendance, and journal preferences. Here, we scrutinize this divide, review emerging efforts toward better integration and identify future opportunities.

          "authors": "Andrei Preda; Andrei Razvan Costea; Adrian Opre; Răzvan Juchiș",
          "abstract": "Humans often appear to possess knowledge they cannot fully articulate. For instance, in the landmark artificial grammar learning (AGL) task, participants acquire a complex regularity (grammar) that generates letter sequences, while typically claiming to have little or no subjective access to the regularity, thus suggesting that learning has been largely unconscious. A highly influential argument against this conclusion comes from studies showing that participants can identify simple letter pairs (bigrams) that the grammar is composed of, when asked to do so. Consequently, the unconscious status of learning in AGL has remained highly controversial. Crucially, however, these latter studies have never measured participants’ subjective states when performing the bigram identifications but assumed that bigram identification necessarily reveals conscious knowledge. In this paper, we put to test this critical assumption, by employing novel bigram-based artificial grammars and, simultaneously, by measuring participants’ subjective states when operating with bigram knowledge. For generalization, we employed both typical letter stimuli and face stimuli. Participants (N = 188) memorized strings (of faces or letters), constructed from the grammars; subsequently, they classified novel strings (half grammatical, half nongrammatical), reporting subjective awareness trial-by-trial. We found that letter strings were classified above chance based both on unconscious and on conscious knowledge (all ps &lt; .001, Bayes factors &gt; 106), while data were insensitive for the faces condition (Bayes factors between 0.33 and 3, all ps &gt; .05). Our findings demonstrate unconscious learning of bigrams for letter strings, challenging the influential idea that accurate bigram knowledge necessarily reveals conscious knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and eating disorders frequently co-occur and share disturbances across the gut-brain axis. Growing evidence suggests that aversive reactivity to physical sensations, particularly gastric discomfort intolerance, may be a key mechanism underlying both conditions. Gastric discomfort intolerance refers to the inability or unwillingness to experience aversive gastric sensations. Despite its theoretical importance, no validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance exists. This study aims to develop and provide initial validation of the Gastric Discomfort Intolerance Scale (GDIS). Adults (n = 219) completed the GDIS and measures of convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a unidimensional 17-item measure with excellent internal consistency (α = 0.93) and acceptable-to-excellent model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.10, 90% CI [0.08, 0.12]; CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96). The GDIS demonstrated convergent validity through significant positive correlations with anxiety sensitivity, depression, anxiety, stress, and some measures of interoception (Trusting). Additionally, discriminant validity was supported by non-significant associations with self-esteem and other measures of interoception (Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening). Participants reporting current eating disorders had significantly higher GDIS scores than those with previous or no eating disorder history (p = 0.02). The GDIS is the first validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance and shows excellent psychometric properties. This tool may facilitate research of gastric discomfort intolerance in eating disorders, DGBI, and other psychiatric conditions, potentially informing treatment approaches.",

Here, we describe the workflow manager 'Snakemake' and provide a working example of its potential usefulness for neuroimaging data processing. Snakemake allows researchers to use a Python-based markup language to describe how input files are transformed into output files. Snakemake then uses these rules to schedule and execute the computational jobs that are required to generate the output files, without unnecessary recreation of existing output files. This allows the complete processing workflow to be executed with a single command and creates workflows that are interpretable, efficient, and reproducible.",

          "abstract": "Hallucinations are percepts that occur in the absence of corresponding sensory input, reflecting internally generated activity within sensory systems. Among visual hallucinations, geometric formations are common, yet their phenomenological structure remains poorly characterised. They occur across contexts ranging from psychedelic experiences to psychiatric and neurological disorders, likely involving related mechanisms within the early sensory cortices. Despite their relevance across disciplines, existing measures rely primarily on verbal reports or coarse rating scales, which do not capture geometric structure.\n\nTo address this limitation, we developed and validated image recreation methods in which healthy participants were trained to recreate images of their hallucinations induced by stroboscopic light at frequencies known to elicit visual hallucinations under laboratory conditions. In Experiment 1 (N = 55), participants used a freehand drawing interface; in Experiment 2 (N = 54), a generative image recreation interface was employed. Training procedures mitigated individual differences in expressive ability. Validation trials demonstrated that geometric features were recoverable at the population level when image stimuli were used in place of hallucination-inducing stimuli. Across experiments, visual qualities of induced hallucinations varied systematically with stimulation frequency, consistent with prior reports.\n\nThe data revealed a broader repertoire of geometric forms than typically described in the literature, including structures not predicted by current computational models of simple hallucinations. Applying these methods to other contexts could clarify the range of geometric hallucinations the visual system tends to produce under controlled perturbation across psychedelic, pathological, and laboratory settings. More precise characterisation of hallucination phenomenology may refine constraints on theoretical models of how visual experience is constructed in normal and altered states.",

          "authors": "Maria Krajuškina; Andero Uusberg; Kaitlyn M. Werner; James Gross; Helen Uusberg",
          "abstract": "People appraise situations in different ways, giving rise to affective responses that can be modified through reappraisal. It is not clear, however, whether effective reappraisal involves tailoring appraisals to situational demands—thereby expanding the number of appraisal profiles—or reusing particularly helpful appraisals across situations, thereby reducing the number of appraisal profiles. To address this question, we examined whether successful reappraisal relates to an expansion or a reduction in appraisal variability. In an online experiment (Sample A, N = 158) and a laboratory replication with facial electromyographic measurement (Sample B, N = 70), participants viewed and reappraised affective pictures and rated their subjective affect and appraisals along the dimensions of relevance, congruence, accountability, certainty, and controllability. We found that appraisal variability decreased during reappraisal, as indicated by a higher Gini index, and that the greater this reduction, the greater the reappraisal success, reflected in increased positive affect and decreased negative affect. Together, these results suggest that successful reappraisal involves a narrowing of appraisal profiles. This challenges the assumption that greater variability is always advantageous and highlights the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying this effect. Moreover, the findings underscore the value of examining discrete appraisal profiles and their variability for better understanding the cognitive mechanisms of reappraisal.",

          "title": "Why Intelligence Models Must Include Motivation: A Recursive Framework",
          "authors": "Matthias Gruber",
          "abstract": "Intelligence research has produced a paradox: the field widely acknowledges that motivation influences cognitive development, yet virtually every major model of intelligence formally excludes it. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) taxonomy, the dominant psychometric framework, contains no motivational component. Cattell's own investment theory treats motivation as an external condition rather than a constitutive element. Sternberg's triarchic theory incorporates practical intelligence but not the drive to acquire it. This paper argues that this exclusion is not merely an oversight but a systematic blind spot that distorts our understanding of intelligence in three specific ways. First, it mischaracterizes intelligence as a static trait rather than a recursive, self-reinforcing system in which knowledge, cognitive performance, and motivation form a closed amplification loop. Second, it renders invisible the role of operational knowledge—learning strategies, logical tools, and strategic thinking—which functions as the primary multiplier within this loop. Third, it leaves the field unable to explain why current artificial intelligence systems, which possess vast knowledge and computational performance but no intrinsic motivation, fail to exhibit the self-directed development that characterizes human intelligence. This paper proposes a three-component recursive model (Knowledge × Performance × Motivation) and argues that intelligence is best understood not as a capacity but as a learning ability—one whose trajectory is determined by the dynamics of this recursive loop rather than by any single component measured in isolation.",

          "abstract": "The current study investigated whether the generation effect, a memory advantage for self-generated verbal information, is enhanced in multisensory conditions. Such a finding would be consistent with the multisensory facilitation effect, a phenomenon wherein multiple sensory inputs may reduce the cognitive load required to process and respond to co-occurring stimuli from multiple senses. Although extensive research has explored the generation effect, the multisensory aspect of this task has been overlooked. In the current study, we aimed to determine if the generation effect is modulated by the multisensory facilitation effect. Multisensory facilitation involves the brain’s ability to efficiently process information from diverse sensory sources simultaneously, enhancing cognitive performance. We employed a 2 (Task Type: generate, read) X 3 (Sensory Modality: auditory, visual, multisensory) factorial design, utilizing word pair lists and a cued recall test. A generation effect emerged for the auditory and audiovisual condition, but not for the visual condition. The hypothesis that the magnitude of the generation effect would be greater for the multisensory encoding condition was not supported. Overall, the hypothesis that generation effect will be enhanced for multisensory learning was not supported. The current study addresses a gap in existing literature by examining the multisensory component of generation tasks and extends the current understanding of multisensory learning by incorporating verbal stimuli as the visual component.",

But what are the public’s beliefs about human extinction? And how much do people prioritize preventing extinction over other societal issues? Across five empirical studies (N = 2,147; U.S. and China), we find that people consider extinction prevention a societal priority and deserving of greatly increased societal resources. However, despite estimating the likelihood of human extinction to be 5% this century, people believe that the chances would need to be around 30% for it to be the very highest priority (U.S. medians). In line with this, people consider extinction prevention to be only one among several important societal issues. We also find that people’s judgments about the relative importance of extinction prevention appear relatively fixed and hard to change by reason-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the influence of incidental emotions on risk-taking propensity and investigate its relationship with Emotional Intelligence (EI) abilities. For this purpose, we developed a variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in which balloons included a face with a specific emotional expression: happiness, fear, or neutral. Thus, although the emotional content was incidental, it was presented concurrently with the task, embedded within the balloon. To assess EI, we employed the MSCEIT, an assessment instrument based on the performance-based ability model of EI. The study consisted of a sample of 120 participants (Mage = 21.52; 80% women). The results revealed a higher risk-taking propensity in conditions displaying happy faces compared to the fear and neutral conditions. Moreover, participants who reported higher levels of EI were less risk prone across all conditions, but this relationship was particularly strong in the fear face condition. These findings confirm the effect of incidental emotions on risk-taking propensity and suggest the role of EI as a potential protective factor for risk engagement. Further research is needed to clarify the influence of EI on incidental emotions in risk contexts. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a CIT paradigm based on the attentional blink (AB) phenomenon and to verify its applicability using target detection accuracy as an index. AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants in the encoding group who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant. In contrast, no such difference was observed for participants in the non-encoding group who had not encoded crime-related items. The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT. These findings provide empirical support for the feasibility of using an attentional blink-based CIT.",

We propose a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmatory inference shapes reward learning when outcomes have ambiguous valence. In these cases, interpretation involves integrating prior beliefs with incomplete evidence, reflecting an inductive bias analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is sometimes withheld, allowing for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than alternative reinforcement learning models. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings demonstrate how confirmatory reward learning can emerge from inference under ambiguity, and may be individually linked to broader dispositional traits.",

          "abstract": "Human listeners are remarkably skilled at identifying voices, yet the mental representations that support voice identity processing remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that reveals core dimensions of the voice identity space. We compiled a large-scale voice corpus including 337 male speakers producing each a unique sentence (VocDat). Using a Sparse Positive Similarity Embedding (SPoSE) model trained on voice similarity judgments from 389 participants, we identified a five-dimensional voice identity space capturing human between-speaker similarity judgments. Regression analyses showed that these model dimensions were characterised by distinct combinations of acoustic voice properties, with pitch, spectral slope, and syllable rate emerging as the most consistent and informative features. These acoustic labels closely aligned with perceptual voice attributes provided by trained phoneticians (e.g. low pitch, old age, fast speech), demonstrating that these dimensions can be interpreted in a perceptually meaningful way. By combining a data-driven modelling approach with a large and acoustically diverse speaker sample, and by characterising voice identity space dimensions in both acoustic and perceptual terms, our findings provide perceptually grounded insights into the structure of voice identity representations.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, human reasoning research has identified a variety of effects and processes, of which several have been compiled into comprehensive theories. Based on such theories, cognitive models were developed that made the theoretical findings applicable and testable. However, the models often consist of a variety on sub-processes and effects internally, but are not built in a modular way, hindering the transfer of findings between different models and their comparability.\nWe approach this problem by proposing a different perspective: By treating the generation of cognitive process models as a search problem, process models can be derived from cognitive operations automatically in an objective way. Our method is illustrated on the domain of syllogistic reasoning, where we show that it generates a process model that outperforms state-of-the-art models while preserving their explanatory meaning.

This study investigates the motivations for initiating large-team papers and the potential benefits of these projects in psychology. By qualitatively analyzing 500 papers, we find that large-team collaborations are most often instigated to deal with the practical challenges  inherent to complex research questions, but can also be motivated by broader social and or strategic factors. The results from quantitatively analyzing 1,699,513 papers published between 1975 and 2024 indicate that large-team collaborations are more likely to be cited and to appear in higher-ranked journals. Furthermore, their immediate impact on the field, as measured by citation counts within the first 2 years after publication, is on average higher than individually-authored papers. This suggests that contributing to collaborative projects in psychology will likely increase the number of high-rank journal publications to the resume of researchers. Overall, our findings indicate that large-team collaborations can be rewarding for individual researchers both by enabling early scientific impact and by contributing to stronger publication records.",

          "abstract": "Background: The mental well-being benefits and challenges of pet ownership have been explored in many populations, including clinical populations such as individuals with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Critically, there are currently no published studies focusing specifically on pet ownership for individuals with eating disorders. The present work aimed to explore pet ownership experiences of adults experiencing eating disorders.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 cat- and dog-owning British adults (eight cat owners, six dog owners, three participants with both cats and dogs) with diagnosed or suspected eating disorders. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilized to identify two overarching themes and seven subthemes relating to the role of the human-pet bond in eating disorder symptoms and treatment.\n\nResults: Data-driven themes include recovery experiences, the dual role of pets in eating behaviors, exercise experiences, pets’ influence on cognitions, body image perceptions, and self-identity, as well as pets’ roles in recovery motivations. Furthermore, pets were found to impact treatment experiences, represented by themes that discuss pets as catalysts for change and partners during treatment, while also creating challenges around separation during treatment. \n\nConclusions: The present study found that pets can be largely beneficial for individuals with eating disorders, especially for those in later stages of recovery; however, pets can also create challenges, especially for individuals in earlier stages of recovery. The present work also provides a foundation for future work related to pet ownership for individuals with eating disorders, such as further exploration on incorporating pets into eating disorder treatment, how to utilize the human-pet relationship to support symptom reduction, and how to mitigate challenges posed by pets related to treatment, with the results having key relevance for the development of clinical interventions for this population.",

The search yielded 1120 records, with 33 records meeting eligibility \ncriteria for inclusion. Most studies feature small, predominantly female, white, clinical, and \nwestern samples, often with mood or anxiety disorders.

          "abstract": "Purpose: A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythm abilities play an important role in reading development. However, how rhythm supports reading and how its role changes across acquisition remain to be fully specified. In this study, we tested whether rhythm perception contributes to reading fluency via phonological decoding and/or lexical access, and whether this pathway varies as a function of reading proficiency. \nMethod: Three-hundred and five Portuguese-speaking primary school children (167 girls; age: M = 8.49 ± 1.17 years, range 6.35–11.20) completed measures of rhythm perception, pseudoword reading (phonological decoding), word reading (lexical access), and text reading fluency. Serial mediation and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. \nResults: Rhythm perception was positively associated with all reading measures. The relation between rhythm perception and reading fluency was fully mediated by pseudoword reading, both directly and sequentially through word reading. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that these indirect effects were present only among children with lower reading proficiency and diminished as proficiency increased. No direct effect of rhythm perception on reading fluency remained once phonological skills were accounted for. \nConclusion: Together, these findings suggest that rhythm perception acts as an early functional constraint on reading fluency, supporting reading primarily through phonological decoding during early stages of acquisition. Accordingly, rhythm-based mechanisms scaffold phonological learning rather than sustain proficient reading, highlighting rhythm perception as a developmentally specific contributor and a potential target for early support.",

A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO.

Seminar leaders introduced open science principles and practices in a 20-minute presentation and a week later students delivered a group presentation including critical reflection on the implementation of open science practices within the health psychology literature. The change in scores between before and after the teaching intervention was measured using a questionnaire evaluating students’ open science knowledge and attitudes.\n\nResults: There were baseline differences in most of the open science knowledge and attitude items between students enrolled in a psychology degree program compared to students enrolled in other programs. Following the teaching intervention, students demonstrated improved knowledge about code sharing and user participation. However, study program was better predictor of changes in attitude item scores than the intervention. \n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that a teaching intervention as short as 20 minutes can impact students’ knowledge about and attitude toward open science practices. Moreover, students’ prior knowledge and attitudes had some influence on the results of the intervention. \n\nTeaching Implications: A short introduction to open science practices combined with student activity can enhance students’ knowledge and impact their attitudes towards open science. For the development of teaching materials, students’ pre-existing open science knowledge and attitude should be considered.

          "abstract": "In various cultures, across history and at many different spatial scales, humans produce a rich variety of geometric shapes. Recent work has put forward a concrete proposition for a Language of Thought (LoT) underlying the mental representation of geometric shapes in contemporary humans. Initial experiments, based on a comparison of baboon and human performance in an intruder task, suggested that this ability could be unique to humans. Here, to deepen our understanding of the evolutionary origins of geometric representations, we compared humans and baboons (Papio Papio) in a delayed geometric match-to-sample task with a broad array of shapes. Crucially, the presentation speed was manipulated so that, on slow-paced trials, animals were given more time to reflect on the shapes. The shapes were sampled from our proposed LoT and spanned a range of predicted geometric complexity under that model. Although the overall pattern of behavior was still strikingly different in humans and baboons, when presentations were slower, we did find a small contribution of the LoT representations in baboons, although weaker than in humans. In both species, longer looking time increased the effect of the LoT-based predictor. While humans used the ability to self-pace to modulate their looking time, thus benefitting from longer exposure times for more complex shapes and rendering this geometric complexity effect visible, baboons did not.",

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Perception and action form a feedback loop through which organisms gather information to guide behavior. Yet many theories still treat perception as relatively passive, disconnected from the movements that shape sensory input and from the bodily rhythms that sustain life. We advance a framework that integrates active sensing, the voluntary control of sensing through movement, with interoceptive physiology in an active-inference framework. We propose that cardiac and respiratory cycles rhythmically tune the reliability of sensory evidence and readiness to move, creating recurring windows that favor sampling or action. Accordingly, cardiorespiratory rhythms shape action–perception coupling primarily by biasing when organisms sample information, for how long, and when they initiate action. Organisms can exploit permissive periods of the cardiorespiratory cycle and compensate during suppressive periods by delaying commitment, extending sampling, or adjusting decision criteria. Because respiration is partly under voluntary control, organisms can adjust their breathing to shift or extend these periods, thereby shaping this coupling. We further formalize how interoceptive and exteroceptive streams may interact under limited processing capacity to bias the weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, yielding testable predictions in both constrained laboratory designs and self-paced, naturalistic tasks. Treating bodily rhythms as internal control variables may unify accounts of moment-to-moment variability in perception and action, support more ecologically valid experimental designs, and motivate body-based interventions to enhance sensorimotor performance.",

          "authors": "Takumi Tanaka; Felice Tavera; Hilde Haider; Kanji Tanaka",
          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of intentional action is the ability to generalize learned response-effect (R-E) associations to novel situations. However, the mechanisms underlying such category-based generalization, particularly in the context of voluntary action selection, remain contested. Across four free-choice experiments, we systematically investigated this issue. Participants learned associations between keypresses and pictorial effects, where the learning experience was manipulated from a single, repeated exemplar to numerous unique exemplars presented only once. The categories ranged from basic-level (e.g., dogs vs. cars) to abstract superordinate levels (e.g., animals vs. machines). Results consistently demonstrated a significant generalization effect: participants preferentially selected actions congruent with the category of novel test stimuli, even when exemplar-specific learning was minimized. This provides evidence for a direct response-category binding mechanism. However, this group-level effect was consistently driven by a subset of participants exhibiting near-deterministic choice patterns, and the statistical evidence for this effect was substantially weakened after excluding them. These findings suggest that R-E generalization in voluntary action is not a uniform, automatic process but relies on the acquisition and strategic application of explicit, propositional knowledge regarding action-effect contingencies. This highlights the critical role of conscious reasoning in goal-directed behavior, refining current theories of action control.",

Cross-sectional research has hinted at enhanced statistical learning in children up to 11-13 years, followed by a decline into adulthood, yet definitive insights require a longitudinal approach. Our study addresses this critical gap by assessing statistical learning in the same participants at ages 7, 8, 11, and 14. Utilizing linear mixed models and latent class analyses, we observed a decline in statistical learning with age, and found that higher executive functions were associated with this decline.

We conducted a 2-week AA study with four prompts per day, yielding 8,474 measurement occasions from 205 participants. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to predict momentary compliance using psychological, contextual, temporal, and prior compliance variables. Compliance was most likely when participants experienced “typical” levels of stress, time pressure, and mood. Participants were more compliant when at home (vs. elsewhere) and when alone (vs. with others). Compliance was also higher on work days (vs. nonwork days).

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly diffuses and concerns about job displacement intensify, the psychological mechanisms underlying AI job replacement anxiety remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Integrated Fear Acquisition Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model, the present research investigates whether AI job replacement anxiety can be elicited through vicarious exposure to narratives emphasizing AI-over-human control, and whether perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of AI moderate this response. Across two studies, we examine AI job replacement anxiety as a response that emerges through vicarious exposure to narratives emphasizing AI agency and human control loss, rather than through direct personal experience of job displacement. Study 1 employed a randomized experiment (N = 314), demonstrating that such exposure increased AI job replacement anxiety. This effect was moderated by perceived usefulness of AI, but not by perceived ease of use, and remained robust after controlling for core self-evaluations. Study 2 (N = 1,189) replicated the association between perceived AI-over-human control and job replacement anxiety in an observational design and provided convergent evidence for the moderating role of perceived usefulness, supporting the external validity of the findings. Together, the results provide the first causal evidence that perceptual and vicarious processes can trigger AI job replacement anxiety. By shifting attention from structural labor-market conditions to how AI agency is perceived and communicated, this work offers a mechanism-based account of when and why AI-related job fears arise.",

While olfactory decline is a promising non-invasive marker of aMCI, research in underrepresented populations is limited. We evaluated the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test (NIHTB-OIT) in older African Americans.\n\nMETHODS: Participants included 93 healthy agers (81.7% female; Mage=73.85, SDage=5.06) and 52 individuals with aMCI (69.2% female; Mage=74.37, SDage=5.26). NIHTB-OIT scores were analyzed using two-way ANCOVAs, adjusting for age and education. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis assessed diagnostic utility. APOE ε4 status was examined in a subset (64.8%).\n\nRESULTS: Healthy agers scored significantly higher than the aMCI group (p =.019), and females outperformed males (p =.031). ROC analysis showed significant but modest discrimination (AUC=.626, p =.010). An optimal cut-off score of 5.5 yielded 76.3% specificity and 40.4% sensitivity in differentiating aMCI from healthy agers. No significant differences were found by APOE ε4 status or diagnosis-by-sex interactions.\n\nDISCUSSION: The NIHTB-OIT differentiates aMCI from healthy aging in African American older adults. Its brevity, standardized scoring, and high specificity support its clinical utility as a rapid, non-invasive screening tool for community-based cognitive health assessments.",

          "abstract": "We examined how recent visual working memory (VWM) models for continuous-outcome tasks quantify memory capacity limitations through model parameters, and whether these quantifications conform to the inverse square-root scaling predictions derived from the sample-size model. We simulated response errors under varying memory load using a Poisson neural population coding framework, in which load was manipulated by decreasing neural population size to represent increases in memory set size. We applied multiple models that differed in noise distributions and decision rules. For each model, we compared alternative parameterization schemes, including variants constrained by the sample-size model, that allowed different parameters to vary with load. Across models, the parameter expressing capacity-related change depended systematically on the decoding strategy used in the decision rule. When response errors were generated under a maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, the dispersion parameter σ scaled with decreasing population size. In contrast, under maximum-output, or MAX, decoding, the signal amplitude parameter γ scaled with decreasing population size. These results demonstrate that the apparent locus of capacity limitation in continuous VWM depends systematically on how population-level neural activity is decoded in memory retrieval and provide evidence that the form of decoding used in making decisions is identifiable from the parameter invariance in the VWM model.",

Using structured literature retrieval\nand full-text processing, we apply this approach at scale with the aid of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) used as an annotation support tool, while anchoring all\nclassifications in expert-defined stance categories. As a case study, we analyze 472\narticles engaging with memory-decay theory published between 1958 and 2023.

          "abstract": "Background. Smartphones/social media have been hailed as offering educational benefits, but widespread concerns highlight multiple negative effects, including for learning and wellbeing. \nSome countries enforce school phone bans, while others (e.g., England), have guidance  promoting “phone-free environments” but no legal mandate at present. There is limited evidence on the benefits of such policies, including whether they promote safeguarding. Methods. We used Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to investigate the relationship  between mobile phone policies and digital safeguarding incidents in 114 schools in England  (&gt;90,000 pupils). We examined the prevalence and content of policies during the 2023/24 academic year and digital incident reporting.  \nResults. 60 of 114 (52.63%) schools had a mobile phone policy. Policy type and content varied significantly, with inconsistent use of “ban” terminology. Digital safeguarding incidents made up only 4.9% (4183/85,540) of all incidents but varied substantially (&gt;10% in 36/114 schools; &gt;25% in 9), suggesting inconsistent reporting. Schools with policies, regardless of restrictiveness, reported more digital incidents. Schools with restrictive policies were more likely to refer incidents and reported more school-based incidents, although most still occurred outside school. Conclusions. Safeguarding incidents involving smartphones or social media are occurring in schools throughout England. Schools with mobile phone policies were more likely to report digital safeguarding incidents, suggesting an association between policy presence and reporting. Vast variation in policy content and inconsistent “ban” rhetoric undermine the potential for effective safeguarding. These findings underscore the need for standardised definitions of digital risks, and consistent policy approaches.",

Contemporary research shows that a six-category typology is overly simplistic, but no alternatives have reached broad acceptance. This paper takes a data-driven solution to this problem. Using data from the release of Kinbank, a global database of 1,156 kinship terminology, I quantitatively review the global diversity of kinship terminology to derive a more granular typology of kinship terminology. In a two-part analysis, I show that kinship terminology structure is more diverse than is often assumed across three metrics. Firstly, more than six types are needed to represent the global diversity of kinship terminology. Secondly, typological categories are not equally variable. Some categories may contain identically structured terminology. Others may contain languages that only share a single feature. Finally, different subsets of kin (e.g. cousins vs grandparents) show different levels of variability. In the second part of the analysis, I explore the global distribution of the new typological categories, identifying globally and locally recurring structures. My analysis demonstrates how data can carve this semantic domain at its joints to identify observed clusters of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Learning rational numbers poses significant challenges on mathematics education. Recently, it was suggested to facilitate learning rational numbers by introducing them starting with the easiest format (i.e., fractions, decimals, or percentages). However, difficulty may not only be influenced by the format itself but also by other factors which drive difficulty within formats, such as responses types (e.g., multiple-choice vs. open responses) and problem types (e.g., visualization, mere calculations, or word problems). Yet, conclusive evidence on how responses types and problem types drive the difficulty within each of the three different rational number formats is largely missing. To address this gap, we analyzed a large-scale dataset (around 38{,}000 students completing more than 7,000,000 problems) from an intelligent tutoring system. We found large and significant differences in error rates within each rational number format, ranging from about 26\\% for problems including visualizations and up to 77\\% for word problems. We did not observe significant differences between multiple-choice vs. open responses. These findings suggest that problem types, i.e. the way rational numbers are included in mathematical problems, drive the difficulty of rational number formats considerably and more than rational number format itself. Therefore, curriculum design may consider the arrangement of problem types more compared to arrangements based on format. This means starting with problem using visualizations first, before gradually progressing to more difficult problem types such as word problems.",

Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had uncertain implications for aggression.

Type S errors are a response to the criticism of testing against a point null of exactly zero in contexts where true zero effects are implausible. Testing against a minimum-effect, while controlling the Type 1 error rate, provides a more coherent and practically useful alternative. Type M errors warn against effect size inflation after selectively reporting significant results, but we argue that statistical indices such as the critical effect size or bias adjusted effect size are preferable approaches. We do believe that Type S and M errors can be valuable in statistics education where the principles of error control are explained, and in the discussion section of studies that fail to follow good research practices.

Confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory factor analyses with target rotation supported the hypothesized six-factor structure across both samples, although observed cross-loadings suggested scope for item refinement. Scalar measurement invariance was established between the clinical and non-clinical sample. Scale scores showed acceptable to good reliability (ω = .77–.88). Convergent and discriminant validity were examined via correlations with established measures of symptoms, maladaptive personality traits, and impairments in personality functioning. As hypothesized, the HiTOP-BR spectra showed the expected associations with corresponding constructs. HiTOP-BR scales further predicted sickness-related work absence beyond established measures, with incremental validity analyses demonstrating additional explained variance in sick days beyond the Patient Health Questionnaire scales. Overall, the HiTOP-BR represents a reliable and valid screening tool, offering a time-efficient way for dimensional psychopathology assessment.

The treatment group was then informed that most in-party members felt the opposite emotion. Compared to control, treated participants showed greater emotional shifts toward the in-group emotion.

          "abstract": "Recent debates about psychology’s credibility have renewed attention to validity threats that are often difficult to evaluate from standard research reports. We argue that pilot studies can function as methodological due diligence by improving early decisions about design, measurement, manipulation, sampling, and analysis prior to a main study. We examine four types of validity: construct, internal, external, and statistical-conclusion validity. Across these domains, we show how piloting can help researchers assess whether materials and procedures function as intended, identify potential validity threats, and provide key design parameters for planning and model choice. However, we also caution that piloting can reduce validity when treated as a consequence-free space for undocumented tinkering, or when small, noisy pilots are used to justify overconfident inferences. Drawing on recent methodological debates, we distinguish two problematic uses of piloting: fragile use and opportunistic use. We discuss how hidden selection and analytic flexibility can distort the evidential value of confirmatory tests. We, then, conclude with practical recommendations for transparent pilot reporting. Greater transparency would enable readers to evaluate how pilot evidence shaped the final design of a study and consequently, how to interpret a study’s findings.",

          "authors": "Jan Urban; Tomasz Grzyb; Dariusz Dolinski; Markéta Braun Kohlová; Kamil Izydorczak",
          "abstract": "There are two competing accounts explaining how increased worry about one issue affects people’s worry about unrelated issues. According to one account, it decreases worries about other issues (i.e., a negative cross-effect such as one predicted by the finite pool of worry hypothesis). In the second account, it increases worry (i.e., a positive cross-effects such as one predicted by the generalized affect hypothesis and availability heuristics). We conducted a web-based experiment on representative samples of adults in the Czech Republic and Poland (total N = 7,051). We manipulated worry about one of three societal issues and measured the effect of this manipulation on the degree of worry about 12 unrelated issues. We also examined the underlying mechanism by looking at whether the effect was mediated by affect (a mechanism related to generalized affect) and moderated by issue similarity (a mechanism related to availability heuristics). The study provides strong evidence for a positive but negligible cross-effect of worry on non-target worries (i.e., target worries increase non-target worries) that becomes somewhat larger, yet still small, for some target worries and when examined in each of the two countries separately. Further, there is strong evidence that this effect is mediated by generalized affect (specifically its valence; small effect size) and positively moderated by issue similarity (negligible effect size). These results support both hypothesized mechanisms of positive cross effects, namely that these are driven by generalized affect and availability heuristics. Our result contributes to a better understanding of how increased worry affects worries about other issues.",

          "abstract": "Training interventions have been proposed as a countermeasure against greenwashing. However, there is no clear consensus on their effectiveness. In an effort to contribute to a better understanding, we examined the impact of greenwashing training on consumers’ ability to discern greenwashing using an online survey experiment designed to resolve ecological and internal validity issues of past work (N = 518). Additionally, we extended the scope by exploring whether greenwashing training also affects healthwashing detection. Our study revealed that greenwashing training can make consumers more likely to perceive advertisements featuring deceptive environmental claims correctly as greenwashing but can also make them more likely to misperceive advertisements without such claims as greenwashing. Furthermore, it showed that although healthwashing is not the subject of greenwashing training, the triggered skepticism can transfer to healthwashing perceptions, too. Overall, these findings suggest that greenwashing training does not enhance greenwashing detection proficiency but rather promotes excessive suspicion.",

          "abstract": "Bullying is a risk factor for internalising problems in adolescence. However, few studies have examined how distinct bullying experiences are associated with individual symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although prior research suggests that parent-child relationships may buffer the negative impact of bullying on mental health, moderation effects at the symptom-level remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the associations between multiple bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and whether these associations were moderated by parent-child relationship. We used data from adolescents participating in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The total sample included 21,308 adolescents (mean age = 14.42 years, SD = 0.51; 53% girls), with networks estimated using data from 18,671-18,870 participants. Adolescents reported on bullying victimization (including experiences of teasing, exclusion/isolation, physical aggression, and cyberbullying), anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent-child relationship quality. We estimated a Gaussian Graphical Model to identify associations between bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression. We subsequently examined if associations between bullying and symptoms of anxiety and depression were moderated by parent-child relationship quality using a Moderated Network Model. All bullying experiences, except for physical bullying, were linked to at least one symptom of anxiety and depression. Feeling blue was the symptom most strongly related to bullying. Specific patterns emerged: cyberbullying was linked to feeling tense and suddenly scared; exclusion to fearfulness and hopelessness; and being teased to feeling tense and suddenly scared. One edge linking bullying and symptoms was moderated by parent-child relationship quality: the association between bullying and feeling scared was weaker at higher levels of parent-child relationship quality. These findings highlight symptom-specific associations between bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescence and suggest that supportive parent-child relationships may influence the strength of these connections.",

Nevertheless, traditional Indian practices and the modern Heart-\nfulness method emphasize an additional aspect, Transmission (Pranahuti).

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, demonstrate that numerical magnitude is represented along a left-right continuum. Theories of shared magnitude processing (ATOM) and polarity correspondence suggest that emotional dimensions might be spatialized in a similar way. Across two experiments, we tested whether emotional valence and intensity elicit spatial-emotional associations and whether exposure to emotional stimuli modulates numerical SNAs. In Experiment 1, participants completed a number parity judgment task (NT) and a gender judgment task with emotional faces (FT) that varied in both valence (happy/sad) and intensity (0%, 20%, 80%, 100%). Experiment 2 removed direct valence contrasts by presenting either happy or fearful faces per participant, isolating intensity effects. Across both experiments, the NT revealed a reliable reverse SNARC effect. Crucially, this effect disappeared when the FT preceded the NT, indicating that emotionally salient stimuli disrupted subsequent SNAs. By contrast, emotional intensity produced no consistent spatial mapping in the FT, regardless of valence. These findings challenge the view that emotional magnitude is spatialized like numerical magnitude and instead suggest that emotional stimuli indirectly influence SNAs by taxing attentional or control processes. Emotional salience thus modulates, but does not itself constitute, spatial-magnitude representations.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation influences cognition—shaping memory, beliefs, attitudes, reasoning, and decision making—but its function within the information ecosystem has shifted from persuasion to being strategically employed to generate epistemic uncertainty. Such strategic manipulation by incentivised actors serves to construct “alternative realities” that undermine shared truth and institutional trust. This paper reviews recent evidence on the direct cognitive and behavioural impacts of misinformation, examines the transformative roles of social media and generative artificial intelligence, and considers broader epistemological consequences, including the erosion of truth norms and implications for democratic discourse. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated individual and systemic interventions that integrate psychological, technological, educational, and regulatory approaches to strengthen epistemic resilience and safeguard evidence-informed public reasoning and decision-making.",

However, empirical evidence on the role of sound in educational video games remains limited, particularly in narrative-driven educational adventure games such as digital history games.\n\nMethods: In a laboratory experiment, university students (N = 111) either played an educational history video game with sound (ambient audio, character voices, and narrated codex entries providing additional historical information) or without sound. Post-test measures assessed factual knowledge, triggered and maintained situational interest, and academic emotions (enjoyment and boredom). Engagement with optional supplemental historical information provided through in-game codex entries was measured using behavioural log data. Group differences were analysed using one-way analyses of covariance, controlling for relevant pre-test variables.\n\nResults: Participants in the sound condition did not score significantly higher on the knowledge test than those in the no-sound condition. Likewise, no statistically significant differences emerged in situational interest, enjoyment, boredom, or codex engagement between conditions. Additional analyses indicated that participants’ interactions with codex entries positively predicted knowledge test performance, indicating that voluntary engagement with supplemental content contributed to learning.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the presence of sound alone may not enhance academic outcomes in a narrative-driven educational video game. Additionally, our findings indicate that learning outcomes depended strongly on learners’ engagement with in-game codex entries. Overall, our results on the inclusion of sound highlight the importance of examining specific design features within educational history video games.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Despite 2 million adolescents (aged 12-17) in the United States having a substance use disorder (SUD), little is known regarding where they seek behavioral healthcare (e.g., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, or both). Adolescents have higher rates of co-occurring major depressive episodes (MDEs) than adults with SUDs, which may increase their use of mental health services. Understanding where adolescents with SUDs enter behavioral treatment is crucial to ensure adequate workforce preparedness to care for them where they seek help.\nObjective: To determine where adolescents with SUDs, with or without co-occurring MDE, present to behavioral health treatment. \nDesign: This was a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional nationally representative survey.\nSetting: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health for adolescents (2022-2023). Data were analyzed between October 2025 and December 2025.\nParticipants: A sample of 24,541 adolescents between the ages of 12-17 from the United States of America. \nExposures: Treatment setting, SUD diagnosis, past year substance use, MDE diagnosis, adolescent age, biological sex, race and ethnicity, insurance status, household income, and study year. \nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Behavioral health treatment setting (i.e., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, both, or none) among adolescents with a SUD. \nResults: Adolescents with a SUD were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (34.7% [95% CI: 30.9-38.8%]) than SU treatment (18.6% [95% CI: 15.8-21.8%], F1,50=62.2, p&lt;.001). Similarly, adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (70.7% [95% CI: 65.6-75.3%]) than SU treatment (21.2% [95% CI: 17.5-25.5%], F1,50=43.7, p&lt;.001). Minoritized adolescents with a SUD (aPR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.71-0.94], p = .007) were less likely, while female respondents with a SUD (aPR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.07-1.40], p=.006) were more likely to receive any treatment. \nConclusions and Relevance: This study found that adolescents with a SUD were twice as likely, and adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE over three times more likely, to engage in mental health compared to substance use treatment. Clinically, these results suggest mental health treatment may serve as a critically important touchpoint to treat adolescents with SUDs.",

In a three-wave longitudinal study, 469 diverse undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution repeatedly forecasted how pleasant they expected aggression to feel, perpetrated an aggressive act, and then reported how pleasant it felt. Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had uncertain implications for aggression. These results highlight the complex ways that forecasted and felt positive affect reinforce aggression over time.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary theory and historical evidence suggest humans possess distinct psychological tendencies for defensive and offensive violence, which have insufficiently been considered in research. In a large-scale pre-registered study across 58 countries (N = 18,128), we demonstrate that violent extremist intentions manifest along two distinct psychological phenomena: defensive extremism, motivated by protecting one’s group from (perceived) threats, and offensive extremism, driven by establishing group dominance. We show that these dimensions can (a) be reliably differentiated across diverse cultural contexts, (b) are distinctively associated with psychological dispositions, and (c) systematically differentiate countries varying in macro-level sociopolitical functioning and violence. Across nations, a two-factorial structure was observed that was invariant at the scalar level. Defensive extremist intentions were consistently higher than offensive extremism in 56 out of 58 countries, suggesting greater moral acceptance of protective violence. While psychopathy was positively related to both types of violent extremist intentions, those high in Machiavellianism and narcissism demonstrated particularly higher levels of defensive extremist intentions. By contrast, those scoring high on religious fundamentalism and social dominance orientation demonstrated particularly higher levels of offensive extremist intentions. Unexpectedly, liberal political group identification was associated with higher offensive but lower defensive extremist intentions. Crucially, offensive (but not defensive) intentions were associated with macro-level societal function, including political terror and internal conflict. These findings establish that defensive and offensive violent extremist intentions represent two conceptually different forms of extremism across a large and diverse range of countries, with consequences for research and practice.",

In two studies with American samples (Study 1: n = 196; Study 2: n = 250, preregistered), participants rated faces on multiple traits and completed comprehensive well-being assessments. Principal component analysis revealed two factors: Affective Well-Being (AWB; emotions, vitality, arousal) and Relational Well-Being (RWB; community, self-worth, belonging). Across analytical approaches, RWB consistently predicted more positive impressions of others with superior predictive power, whereas AWB showed weak to null effects. The pattern of results replicated using validated affective versus relational subscales from the Comprehensive Inventory of Thriving. Despite the correlational design, our consistent findings highlight RWB as a key predictor of person perception, suggesting the classic “feel good, judge favourably” effect may reflect stable relational schemas shaping perceptions of others.",

          "abstract": "Meditation has long been studied for its ability to enhance mental, social and emotional well-being and reshape brain networks. Meditation studies have largely focused on neural and cognitive correlates, overlooking the impact on fundamental biological scales. Here, we bring in an integrated perspective that meditation is not only a mental training but also a phenomenon that can optimize the physiological and molecular processes that entrain the brain-body systems toward metabolic, genomic and epigenomic coherence. \nWe first synthesize current evidence linking meditative practice to changes in brain network dynamics, metabolic changes and epigenetic alterations. Emerging findings reveal that meditation modulates stress induced markers, cerebral metabolic changes, hormonal rhythms and transcriptional alterations in the genes involved in cellular pathways, suggesting a coordinated cellular recalibration. Parallel evidence indicates that regular contemplative routines may stabilize circadian oscillations of cortisol and melatonin. At the molecular level, meditation-associated epigenetic signatures, including alterations in DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and noncoding RNAs, also point towards the role of biological processes in practice-induced enduring traits.\nWe propose an integrative multiscale model in which meditation operates as a holistic intervention, synchronizing neural activity with peripheral, molecular rhythms to promote adaptive homeostasis. Finally, we outline methodological pathways for future work, advocating for multimodal designs that unite neuroimaging, metabolomics, chronobiology, and epigenomic profiling. Understanding meditation through this multi-scale lens can transform it from a behavioral phenomenon into a biologically grounded framework for brain-body synchronization, offering new insights for preventive and translational neuroscience.",

However, necessity effects in NCA do not prove necessity as they may be due to zero-order correlations between the analyzed variables. Here, we scrutinized the findings and conclusions by Andrés-Sánchez et al. by estimating “ranges of spuriousness” of effects that can be expected due to correlations between variables. Necessity effects reported by Andrés-Sánchez et al. did not fall above these ranges of spuriousness, meaning that their findings may have been spurious and their conclusions may be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that necessity effects in NCA do not prove necessity in order not to overinterpret findings. We recommend researchers to estimate ranges of spuriousness and to require that necessity effects are above this range before claiming that X is necessary for Y. Otherwise, the necessity effect can, as in the present case, be fully accounted for by the correlation between X and Y.",

          "abstract": "Sensory differences and discomfort are significant on-campus barriers for many autistic postsecondary students, but we know relatively little about what makes sensory environments accessible or inaccessible for autistic students.  In this study, 19 autistic university students in Australia responded to experience sampling questions several times a day for two weeks.  Quantitative sensory comfort ratings were significantly poorer when participants reported states of greater anxiety, irritability or emotional reactivity, and exhaustion.  Participants also reported more quantitative sensory discomfort when open-ended answers described feeling tired/exhausted, anxious, or stressed/overwhelmed, rather than feeling relaxed/good. However, our study cannot resolve whether sensory discomfort causes experiences such as anxiety and exhaustion, whether those states exacerbate sensory discomfort, or both.  Qualitative-quantitative triangulation also suggested that participants experienced less sensory comfort: in open-access spaces (notably, on campus, travelling, and shopping) compared to closed-access spaces (notably, at home); to high-intensity (e.g., loud) than low-intensity (e.g., quiet) or non-notable stimulation; to most sounds over visual, feel, and taste stimuli; to people-related sounds than touch sensations; and to crowds over environments with fewer people. These findings suggest sensory environments systematically shape many autistic people’s everyday experiences and thus that we should modify these environments to be more accessible and inclusive.",

          "authors": "Yavor Dragostinov; Sam Henry; John-Paul Martindale; Tom Booth; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "The Dark Triad/Tetrad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) is commonly argued to be a set of distinct but related traits. However, researchers have argued that these traits may reflect a single underlying factor. In the present study, we evaluated whether a triad or a tetrad structure could be recreated from a comprehensive, reliable, and non-redundant personality item pool. Using the 100 Nuances of Personality (100NP), we adopted a bottom-up approach that combined expert-derived trait definitions, layperson item-interpretability ratings, multi-times and multi-rater data, and a conservative psychometric selection criterion for the selection of items. Across multiple structural analyses, we were unable to recover separate factors corresponding to narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, or sadism. Instead, retained items consistently converged on a broad single factor, which we refer to as Antagonism Core (AC). The resulting 15-item AC scale demonstrates high test–retest reliability (r = 0.90), self–other agreement (r = 0.54), and convergent validity with established Dark Triad measures (Short Dark Triad and Dirty Dozen; 0.79 and 0.83, respectively) as well as the Honesty-Humility domain of the HEXACO (-0.77). These findings provide little empirical support for a distinct triad/tetrad structure, and instead suggest that antagonism is the primary construct assessed by “Dark” personality measures.",

          "title": "Generalizable Negativity: Classifying Negative Campaigning across German Elections",
          "authors": "Marius Sältzer; Corinna Oschatz; Sebastian Stier",
          "abstract": "Negative campaigning (NC) has become a prevalent campaign strategy in recent years, especially in interactive media such as Facebook, Twitter/X or Instagram where politicians can communicate without any mediation by gatekeepers like journalists. Even though the identification of NC is a crucial precondition for understanding modern election campaigns, the automated identification of NC is still in its infancy, even with state-of-the-art text analysis methods. Especially when researchers want to identify NC across elections and different levels of a polity, they need to develop and validate specific classifiers. As actor constellations and topics vary considerably across different elections, applying automated measures to lower-level elections requires a thorough validation of how well trained models generalize across contexts. Using several federal and state level elections as a test case, this paper investigates the generalizability of transformer models for text classification in the complex German multilevel and multiparty system. Based on over 40,000 social media posts of candidates in eight state and federal elections between 2013 and 2021 that were annotated by human coders, the classifier can identify negative campaigning across space and time. A leave-one-out classification shows that the model can accurately predict data even for unknown elections with moderately sized training data. We demonstrate how a classifier for a demanding theoretical concept can be trained and validated in multidimensional contexts and provide orientation for similar projects.",

          "abstract": "Accessibility measures are widely used to diagnose and address transport-related social exclusion (TRSE), yet there is limited agreement on what constitutes an appropriate indicator and little transparency about the normative and methodological commitments embedded in commonly used measures. This paper develops an integrative analytical framework to support the evaluation and selection of accessibility measures for TRSE. Rather than conducting an empirical comparison of metrics, the paper consolidates dispersed debates across the accessibility, transport equity and justice, and TRSE literatures into a structured set of thirteen criteria, ten theoretical and three practical, to clarify the assumptions, biases, and trade-offs embedded in accessibility measures used to assess TRSE. The framework was developed through a structured literature review and refined through consultation with academic experts. We next discuss trade-offs between the criteria, theoretical robustness, and usability, and how selection depends on analytical objectives, data, institutional capacity, and the policy instruments under control. The paper concludes with a step-by-step strategy for applying the framework in practice, making trade-offs explicit and helping analysts choose measures that are both conceptually robust and usable for decision-making in TRSE contexts.",

          "abstract": "Climate change mitigation technologies (CCMTs) play a key role in decarbonisation efforts, but may also create new opportunities for crime and security risks that have remained under-explored. This study presents an expert-informed assessment of crime threats and countermeasures associated with CCMTs, involving 28 experts from government, law enforcement, industry, academia, and civil society. Through structured idea generation, thematic analysis, and forecasting surveys, the participants evaluated 35 distinct crime threats and 36 countermeasures, of which 13 threats and 18 countermeasures were uniquely identified by them. The identified risks were found to be concentrated in CCMT supply chains and resource extraction, with high-priority threats relating to environmental harms, illegal mining, and human rights abuse, alongside cyber-enabled and financial crimes. Promising countermeasures include CCMT-specific regulation, risk assessment, data sharing, physical security, and targeted education. The findings show that the green transition reshapes rather than removes crime risks, underscoring the need for proactive governance to ensure a secure and sustainable low-carbon transition.",

          "abstract": "Anger is provoked by frustrated expectations and triggers a punishment response. When expectations reflect social identities, punishment may vary accordingly. We design an online experiment on an Italian sample (N=597 trustor-dictators) where subjects play a trust game followed by an allocation game with punishment options, a sequence designed to elicit genuine emotional reactions upon learning whether their counterpart defected. We elicit beliefs under incentive compatibility and measure emotional responses using the\nPANAS scale. We apply the belief-dependent model of anger by Battigalli et al. (2019b) to derive our predictions.\nIn our data, defection triggers a strongly negative emotional reaction, with anger being the dominant response. Anger correlates with elicited beliefs about trustworthiness among subjects who best respond to their expectations, and anger in turn predicts punishment. Female trustors hold higher trustworthiness expectations toward female trustees than toward male ones, while no analogous pattern emerges for male trustors. Defection by a female trustee triggers a stronger anger response in female trustors, in line with the larger expectation gap. Punishment follows a cross-gender pattern, consistent with in-group bias. Overall, our results suggest that gender bias in punitive behavior emerges both from expectation-driven frustration and from residual preference-based differences.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing the capabilities of social robots. Positioned as one key solution to issues related to ageing societies, these socially interactive, physically moving robots will likely be used in many public and private contexts. Emerging technologies like these are known to be prone to criminal exploitation before regulatory and governance frameworks adapt. To support anticipatory governance, this study uses expert elicitation to identify and assess plausible future crime and security risks associated with large-scale social robot deployment, alongside potential countermeasures. Over two days, 21 expert stakeholders identified and prioritised 21 distinct crime threats and 17 countermeasures according to anticipated risk severity and implementation potential. The highest-risk threats concerned the exploitation of social robots’ social features for fraud and social engineering, using them to spread hate, extremism, or disinformation, and their facilitation of harassment, stalking, or coercive control. The most promising countermeasures included robot registration or identity markers, anticipatory risk assessment practices, and cybersecurity measures. The findings contribute to futures-oriented debates on human–robot relations and inform research and policy agendas aimed at pre-empting harmful social robot–enabled outcomes.",

          "authors": "Helder Ferreira do Vale",
          "abstract": "Brazil’s rapid digital transition promised broader civic participation but instead deepened polarization, disinformation, and democratic erosion. This article examines how these dynamics produced a distinctive model of digital regulation, shaped not by legislatures or bureaucracies but by judicial activism. Interpreted through the framework of digital constitutionalism, Brazil’s regulatory trajectory reveals an attempt to reassert rights, trust, and institutional balance in the face of platform power and algorithmic manipulation. By analyzing the Marco Civil da Internet, the General Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD), the failed “Fake News Bill” (PL 2630), the “AI Bill,” the interventions of the Superior Electoral Court, and ongoing debates on AI legislation, the article shows how crisis-driven governance reshaped the country’s digital governance. The analysis is based on a five-pillar framework that is used to explain the Brazilian digital regulatory model. This model indicates that Brazil has developed its own traits of “digital constitutionalism” provided that the country’s regulations are reliant on a strong judicial activism that not only guarantees rights, but help to preserve democratic values, and maintain national sovereignty in the face of Big Techs. However, this experience illustrates both the risks of judicial overreach and the potential of constitutional principles to guide democratic resilience in the digital age. The article contributes to comparative debates by positioning Brazil as a Global South test case for rights-based digital governance.",

          "abstract": "Climate institutions, including climate laws and advisory bodies, have proliferated globally. But do they matter? Existing work either analyses quantitatively how these institutions correlate with policy outcomes, like stringency or emissions reductions, or qualitatively examines a single type of institution. Neither strand provides tools to systematically analyse the effects of these institutions on the policymaking process itself. We therefore propose the Climate Institutions Analysis Framework (CIAF), which traces how institutions' formal functions interact with country-specific contextual variables to address 'strategic challenges'. Comparing climate institutions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Australia, we show that they support agenda-setting, increase transparency, signal commitment, and hold governments accountable. Notably, similarly designed institutions can produce divergent effects across countries due to variation in context. By conceptualising a new class of effects and their mechanisms, our framework contributes to debates about policy sequencing amid climate backlash and to comparative analysis of meso-level institutions.",

Ensuring that their deployment happens in a safe and secure way requires a firm understanding of the broad scope of crime and security threats that social robots may facilitate. Methods: We conducted a scoping literature review to provide an overview of the crime and security threats related to social robots, and potential countermeasures. Results: We identified 18 distinct crime threats and 17 possible countermeasures described across 388 academic and non-academic articles from any discipline. The crime threats ranged from fraud and trespassing, to espionage and abuse towards robots. Countermeasure themes included establishing social robot rights and many technological adaptations.

          "abstract": "Humans are a social species, relying on a complex network of long-term relationships and cooperation to tackle ecological problems such as obtaining resources, safety and procreation. This rich sociality is as demanding as it is rewarding; while affiliation and status are intrinsically valuable, securing these benefits requires significant cognitive effort, material investment, compromise, and vigilance. Common views of cultural evolution and innovations often frame social interactions either as a vehicle to transmit knowledge across generations, or as a cooperation problem to be solved. I propose that culture evolves to directly address the challenges and costs inherent in social relationships. Cultural innovations help facilitate social interactions by making them more predictable and regular, and promoting independence and flexibility. Predictability can be achieved through centralized social events and experiences, such as rituals and stories, and through institutions and norms. Independence is promoted by technologies that enable individuals to carry out tasks on their own, and by substituting some of the benefits associated with social relationships. In all cases cultural innovations success can be evaluated by the way they meet the needs and offset the costs of social interactions. This view can explain the adaptive interactions between cultural innovations and social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Understanding causal relations for sustainability scientists means studying phenomena that involve complex causality, e.g. multiple and heterogeneous relations and entities, context-sensitivity, and multi-scalar phenomena. To cope with this, sustainability scientists have borrowed concepts from neighboring disciplines, used causal expressions that have confusing meaning, or abstained from using causal language altogether. We argue for using causal language as it is useful for prediction, manipulation, explanatory understanding and responsibility attribution. However, traditional views on causality have limitations dealing with causal complexity. We spell out the challenge of formulating useful concepts. We argue that it is important to recognize the role of everyday causal cognition and its limitations, to distinguish the different ways in which sustainability scholars talk about complexity and to clarify the causal meaning of complexity concepts, like non-linearity, adaptive capacity,  and feedback. Finally, we propose the concept of causal configuration to make explicit the causal meaning of complexity-related concepts.",

          "abstract": "Childfreeness has often been examined through the lens of decision-making in early adulthood or as a potential source of regret in later life. Less attention has been paid to how childfreeness is experienced and lived in midlife, particularly among women who often remain biologically fertile but increasingly encounter social assumptions of finality. This qualitative study explores how women over forty make sense of childfreeness as a lived identity. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with twelve childfree women aged 40-55 years old. Three group experiential themes were constructed that captured a development shift in which childfreeness becomes settled and no longer subject to internal negotiation. Participants described childfreeness as grounded in values of freedom, responsibility and ethical self-knowledge, alongside a conscious refusal of motherhood understood as irreversible responsibility. Rather than rejecting care or generativity, women articulated alternative forms of care and future-oriented planning that challenged pronatalist assumptions equating womanhood, care and generativity with motherhood. The findings highlight midlife as a critical yet under-researched period in life trajectories of childfree adults, offering important insights into gendered ageing, moral responsibility and the plurality of meaningful adult life trajectories beyond parenthood.",

We find that the Labour Party has consistently expressed more positive sentiment towards immigration compared to the Conservative party since the early 1960s, and that these positions further diverged in the early 1980s. The last 15 years have seen more negative rhetoric across all major parties, with immigration discussed among Conservative and Reform UK MPs in the most negative terms since 1923. We discuss possible future research avenues, supported by suggestive findings on the increasing moralization of the immigration debate and growing negativity towards asylum.",

A custom‐built trading simulator was used (N = 88; 1,320 incentivized trials),\nand behavior was analyzed using linear mixed‐effects models.\nThe results reveal a robust self‐serving bias expressed through two distinct processes.\nResponsibility attribution was high for gains but declined sharply after losses, while\nperceived algorithm influence increased following failures, indicating retrospective\ninflation of the algorithm’s role. Regret exhibited a structural asymmetry: loss‐related\nregret was strongly dispositional, whereas gain‐related regret was situational. These\npatterns suggest that negative outcomes activate stable self‐evaluative tendencies,\nwhile positive outcomes elicit more context‐dependent responses.\nCrucially, restoring decision autonomy significantly reduced emotional distress after\nlosses. Participants who chose to ignore the algorithm experienced lower regret,\nindicating that agency serves as a psychological buffer that protects self‐image more\neffectively than compliance with external advice. The findings imply that financial\ninterfaces should avoid full automation and instead prioritize meaningful user\nengagement to preserve psychological ownership of decisions.",

The survey examines economic perceptions, political attitudes, views on the war in Ukraine, experiences with crime, social networks, and media consumption.\nKey findings\n• Economic perceptions remain stable but pessimistic. Across waves, respondents’ self-assessments of their personal economic situation show little change, and average satisfaction remains low. Concern about rising prices remains consistently high across social groups.\n• Attitudes toward the war in Ukraine remain polarized, and support coexists with negotiation preferences.Nearly half of respondents express support for the war, while a comparable share favors initiating peace negotiations. Notably, a substantial minority of those who declare support for the war also support starting negotiations.\n• Personal exposure to the war is widespread and politically consequential. Many respondents report personal connections to the war through participation or losses among close contacts. Such exposure is strongly associated with both support for continued military action and expectations about the war’s duration.\n• Fraud is the most common crime reported, trust in law enforcement remains moderate. Most respondents report no direct experience of crime in recent years. Among those who have, fraud is the most common form of crime. However, reporting varies by age, gender, region. Willingness to seek police assistance depends strongly on prior experience with law enforcement.\n• Media consumption continues to shift toward Telegram amid declining trust in news. Reliance on several traditional and online news sources has declined, while Telegram has continued to grow as a key source of political information. Across platforms, respondents report declining trust in news and political information.\nTaken together, the results of Wave 5 portray a society characterized by persistent economic anxiety, polarized war-related attitudes, evolving information habits, and complex patterns of vulnerability and social interaction.",

          "abstract": "While a growing body of research documents that women with high socio-economic status (SES) are more likely to give birth following medically assisted reproduction (MAR), fewer studies have investigated the processes that lead to this overrepresentation. In this study, we contribute to the literature on socio-economic gradients in MAR by providing a multi-stage analysis of social gradients across almost two decades. Specifically, we depict trends in annual education and income gradients in the take-up of MAR treatment, the probability of a MAR treatment leading to a live birth, and the prevalence of MAR involvement in births. We use Danish administrative data covering all births and MAR treatments among women aged 25–45 residing in Denmark from 2006–2023. We employ linear probability models adjusted for age groups, partnership status, and relationship duration, and stratify them by parity, treatment type, and clinic type. We document persistent social gradients in all three stages of the MAR process across parity and treatment type. Gradients in treatment take-up were substantially larger at private than at publicly funded clinics, indicating that financial barriers play a substantial role in access. However, the educational gradient in treatment success persisted at similar levels across both public and private clinics and over time, suggesting that nonpecuniary resources also contribute to SES differences in MAR outcomes. The results were robust across alternative specifications: using income as the SES measure, pooling treatments across types, excluding migrants, and estimating unadjusted models. These gradients persisted in the high-income, low-inequality, and heavily subsidized context of Denmark.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. The proposed approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples, including an empirical human journey into web hacking as a proof-of-concept.",

          "abstract": "Organization redesign often raises a central question: Where are managers needed? A potential substitute for formal supervision by managers is interpersonal cultural alignment, which can ease coordination between colleagues. Yet prior research suggests cultural alignment may also complement formal structure. We theorize that the balance depends on coordinative complexity: Whether culturally aligned individuals benefit from common supervision hinges on how broadly they depend on others to get work done. Cultural alignment can function as a substitute for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and as a complement when coordinative complexity is high. Focusing on one of the most tangible and consequential forms of cultural alignment – the degree to which individuals are linguistically aligned with their peers in everyday communications – we make predictions about which pairs of colleagues organizational designers will tend to bring together under, versus separate from, a shared supervisor. Using archival data from a design firm, we find support for our theory, with especially strong effects when colleagues are highly visible to their senior managers.",

However, this work does not account for the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: many parties participate in multiple governments and governments often comprise multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure creates dependencies among observations both across and within governments. If ignored, these dependencies produce downward-biased uncertainty estimates that cluster-robust standard errors fail to fully correct. To address this issue, I then introduce a model that extends the Multiple Membership Multilevel Model to represent the multilevel structure of coalition government data. The model accounts for party-level dependencies across governments through party-specific effects in each coalition they join, and for dependencies within governments by representing the total party effect on a government as a weighted sum of its members’ contributions. By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes. I validate the model through simulation and an empirical application to coalition government survival, showing that ignoring party-level dependencies can produce misleading conclusions at all levels of analysis. The model is estimated via Bayesian MCMC and implemented in the accompanying R package ‘bml’.",

The distribution of time and social effort amongst their peers can be indicative for the inclusivity of the group. \nIn this appraisal paper, we explore  a recently introduced measure to estimate social mixing in groups, called social fluidity. We estimate social fluidity for 27 data sets of children's face-to-face interaction networks collected during playtime breaks and discuss how this measure can be used by field experts to characterize group behavior as well as individual behavior. We therefore draft a step-by-step plan to analyze proximity data based on the behavioral model and the social fluidity measure introduced by Colman et al.",

This has resulted in a sprawling scholarly \nliterature, reflecting equally diverging practical implementations across jurisdictions. This article \nseeks out greater conceptual clarity through a systematic literature review of 117 academic journal \narticles covering a broad span of academic disciplines. In doing so, we approach credibility as a \n“fuzzy concept,” characterised by vague definitional boundaries, and highly context dependent. On \nthis basis, we firstly develop a guiding taxonomy to unpack this fuzziness. Second, our analysis \nreveals a fundamental conceptual fragmentation between those who focus on credibility as a feature \nof the claimant’s testimony, and those approaching credibility as a more personal trait. We show how \nthis rift can be seen to form along three dominating clusters, each pointing to reliance on different \nindicators. Finally, we draw together insights from across disciplines showing how continued reliance \non specific indicators is not only scientifically and legally flawed, but also casts doubt on whether \nnational asylum systems are capable of producing fair and coherent outcomes.",

Despite decades of research, this central question in political economy remains\nunsettled. We advance this debate in two ways: by examining the effects of both positive and negative\nmacroeconomic environments simultaneously, and by focusing on their cumulative impact over\nindividuals’ lifetimes. We address this question by examining how lifetime exposure to periods of\nunusually high and low economic growth shapes political and economic attitudes in Latin America.\nWe combine annual GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project (1896–2022) with nearly 700,000\nindividual responses from Latinobarómetro and LAPOP (1995–2021) to construct life-course measures\nof positive and negative periods for respondents in 18 countries. Our identification strategy compares\ncohorts within country–year using models with country, survey-year, age, cohort, and survey fixed effects.\nRepeated positive macroeconomic periods systematically shift individuals toward the right on a\nleft–right scale and improve subjective economic evaluations. In contrast, repeated negative periods\ndo not produce a consistent leftward shift; instead, they increase economic insecurity, dissatisfaction\nwith democratic performance, and anti-elite sentiment. Support for democracy as a principle remains\nstable. We confirm the generalizability of our main findings by replicating our analyses in 104 countries\nusing the Integrated Values Survey (1980-2022).",

          "abstract": "Background\nPuberty is a time of profound change for all. Autistic children may find pubertal changes harder to navigate, due to sensitives surrounding sensory experiences, and difficulty with change. Our prospectively registered mixed methods systematic review (Registration: PROSPERO2023 CRD42023446750) aimed to synthesise research on Autism and puberty.\nMethods\nIncluded studies focused on puberty in Autistic people (including self-identifying) and those supporting them. Searches were limited to English language sources from 2013 - July 2023. We searched: Medline, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL (all via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (via Clarivate). Studies were subjected to Convergent Integrated synthesis (Joanna Briggs Institute). Quality assessments were undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute tools.\nResults\n3,546 unique records were identified, and 61 items were included in the review. Most papers were high quality. We identified five themes. First, many studies compared Autistic and non-Autistic people, but few differences were identified, with puberty characterised as a universal experience. Second, parents felt unprepared for their child’s puberty, and uncertain of their future. Third, additional education in areas of puberty and sex were identified as needed for Autistic people, and those caring for them. Fourth, breaking norms was explored at length; with many parents worrying their child was not normal in behaviour and development. Finally described were physical changes of puberty and challenges these bring, specifically difficulties around menarche and menstruation. Limitations of studies included a lack of diversity (ethnicity; few fathers) and restricted consideration of confounding factors and author impact on research. \nDiscussion \nCo-developed interventions are required, to facilitate understanding consent, navigating pubertal changes, and learning skills. The synthesised research did not focus on comfort and wellbeing, but more so on normality, or perceived lack of, of Autistic young people. Future research should prioritise topics of importance to Autistic people, and should seek consent from Autistic participants.",

          "authors": "Lucas Paulo da Silva",
          "abstract": "Measuring media ideology is essential for researching media bias, media effects, and various important topics in political science, communication, and other social sciences. However, given journalistic norms of objectivity and the complexity of ideology, measuring media ideology accurately is uniquely challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have become valuable tools in this endeavor. Based on media communication theories, I argue that media ideology is expressed via different cues -- the topic, argument, framing, criticism, and sources of the media content -- and that LLMs often miss these. Standard methods of LLM classification also offer little control, flexibility, and data granularity to researchers. Drawing on insights about computational and quantitative measurement methodologies, I introduce the \"Multi-Cue Classification\" (MQ-Class) approach. With MQ-Class, an LLM classifies the different ideological cues separately and researchers then apply pre-specified weights and thresholds to combine them into one label per text. I compare standard LLM and MQ-Class methods using two example tasks -- classifying the economic and cultural ideologies of a novel sample of online media articles. Across multiple tests, MQ-Class is more accurate and puts researchers \"back in the driver's seat.\" I conclude by discussing how MQ-Class could be implemented for other classification tasks and data.",

          "abstract": "Stress process theories, which are foundational in sociology, posit that subjective stress causes emotional and behavioral problems. Though the link between stress and mental health is well-established, claims that stress causes criminal behavior remain contentious despite widespread acceptance in criminology. We test both pathways using two-wave panel data from Bangladesh (n=978 observations; 489 participants) and between-person and within-person estimation. Between-person analysis confirms established patterns: those reporting more stress also report more negative emotions and criminal intentions. However, within-person analysis, which adjusts for time-invariant confounding by design, reveals a striking asymmetry. Changes in stress reliably predict changes in negative emotions but not criminal intentions. Although residents of disadvantaged urban communities report more stress, within-person effects on crime remain near-zero. These findings validate sociological stress process theories for mental health outcomes while raising questions about criminological claims that stress causes crime. The between/within divergence suggests that stress-crime correlations in prior research may largely reflect selection into stressful circumstances rather than causal effects of stress on criminal intentions. Methodologically, results demonstrate how between-person correlations can systematically mislead about causal processes.",

This article presents Social-RAG, a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture designed to support scalable qualitative inquiry over large text corpora while preserving evidence traceability, auditability, and researcher control. Our empirical basis consists of messages from public Telegram groups and channels, organized into two thematic subsets: vaccine-related discourse and debates surrounding Brazil’s Lei Rouanet cultural funding policy. We detail key design decisions, including a “one post = one chunk” indexing strategy, semantic retrieval over vector embeddings with efficient ANN search, an Adaptive-K dynamic cutoff for context selection, MMR re-ranking for diversity, and structured analytical instructions that constrain generation to retrieved evidence. We evaluate system behavior using two complementary question blocks, hermeneutic (narrative) and factual, and compare outputs across three language models with distinct deployment profiles (a local open-weight model, a cloud open-weight model, and a commercial closed model), using an LLM-as-judge protocol with explicit qualitative criteria. Results show consistent behavior across both thematic corpora and highlight a key trade-off: the two larger/closed models perform similarly and robustly in both narrative and factual tasks when evidential discipline is maintained, whereas the smaller local model remains useful for exploratory narrative synthesis but is less reliable for strict factual extraction and attribution. We conclude by discussing methodological implications, limitations, and future directions, with a focus on scalability and extensibility to new data types and analytical problems.",

          "abstract": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is widely promoted as a catalyst for agricultural transformation in developing countries, yet empirical evidence on its efficiency effects remains limited and mixed. This study examines the association between foreign direct investment and coffee production efficiency in Uganda, with particular attention to regional heterogeneity and policy context. Using a panel of five coffee-producing regions over the period 1995–2024, we estimate technical efficiency scores through stochastic frontier analysis and subsequently analyze their relationship with FDI exposure using fixed-effects panel regressions.\nThe results indicate that foreign direct investment is positively and significantly associated with coffee production efficiency, reflecting improvements in the use of existing inputs rather than expansion of cultivated area. On average, a one percent increase in FDI inflows is associated with an approximately 0.07–0.09 percent increase in production efficiency. However, these efficiency gains are unevenly distributed across regions, with stronger effects observed in relatively mature coffee-producing areas. Complementary factors including technology adoption, infrastructure, capital formation, and governance quality are also positively associated with efficiency, conditioning the magnitude of investment-related gains. In addition, the relationship between FDI and efficiency strengthens following the implementation of Uganda’s National Coffee Policy, highlighting the role of institutional reforms.\nThe findings suggest that while foreign investment can support efficiency-enhancing growth in smallholder-based agricultural systems, its benefits are neither automatic nor uniformly distributed. Effective investment strategies therefore require complementary public investments and institutional frameworks to promote inclusive and regionally balanced agricultural development.",

Indigenous religious and spiritual traditions, in particular, have had significant impacts on popular belief in the paranormal and supernatural.  For example, Indigenous phenomena such as skinwalkers and wendigos have become objects of paranormal research and investigation by non-Indigenous people in recent years. While it is common practice for non-Indigenous people to group these and similar phenomena under the banners of cryptids or mythical beings, in many Indigenous communities, such phenomena are seen as spirit beings who are able to move between the natural and supernatural worlds, realms, and/or dimensions, often at will and with purpose or reason. \n\tPennsylvania has a long and rich Indigenous presence and history, in particular with communities connected to the Lenape (Delaware), Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), and Saawanooki (Shawnee) nations.  Paranormal and supernatural phenomena connected to these and other Indigenous peoples are still thriving today throughout the Commonwealth.  In particular, there are four Indigenous phenomena of religious and spiritual significance – Bigfoot, Little People, Thunderbirds, and the Machtando.  \n\tIn this paper, we discuss the Indigenous origins and histories of these four phenomena, as well as the roles they play in contemporary paranormal and supernatural traditions in Pennsylvania.  Additionally, while detailing these specific phenomena associated with Pennsylvania, we hope to provide non-Indigenous researchers of the paranormal and supernatural the tools to respectfully and accurately incorporate Indigenous oral traditions into their interpretations of anomalous phenomena.",

I investigate SWF effects on GDP per capita ($ US 2024) and domestic savings share of GDP in Norway and Singapore, the two open economies with the largest SWFs, and Australia, a negative control unit with a much smaller SWF. The analysis estimates that Norway’s Government Pension Fund SWF added $816,089 per capita over the analysis period ($28,141/Year) to resource-rent pruned GDP per capita and 9.69% to domestic saving share of GDP (1995-2023). Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes. The findings indicate that robust mandatory SWF-steered savings in open economies can accelerate economic growth beyond standard Solow model steady state equilibrium by adding a non-depreciating compound growth function to domestic investment.",

As a key source of revenue in some communities, paranormal tourism’s success often requires reformation of community identities and paranormal mythologies. Atchison, Kansas provides an example of this phenomenon by basing much of its economic development on paranormal tourism. Drawing on five years of experiences leading paranormal investigations at the Sallie House, Atchison’s primary haunted attraction, we argue that community folklore contributes greatly to paranormal belief and engagement with such attractions. Synthesizing participant observation and survey responses, we examined changes in beliefs based on visitor’s time in the Sallie House. Changes in perceptions of paranormal phenomena bordered on significance with participants more likely to believe in ghosts after the investigation, while prior understandings of the paranormal were stronger drivers of belief and engagement.  Atchison’s success as a paranormal tourism destination is tied to their identity as a popular location to experience paranormal phenomena at several intensities and costs, thus allowing people of all levels of interest and budgets to participate. The Sallie House represents a microcosm of Atchison’s paranormal tourist environment with options for engagement at multiple levels, all drawing upon a rich, and ever-growing folklore.",

Rather than treating polarisation as mere attitudinal divergence, we frame it as the symbolic organization of political antagonism. Our model identifies three interrelated symbolic dimensions: divergence on contested issues conceptualized as signifiers; the consistency of these divergent issues, enabling chains of signification held together by “linking signifiers” that mark group identity; and the mutual constitution of opposing semiotic chains and identities. We add a fourth, social dimension by distinguishing symbolic from social boundaries and outline the various ways in which they interact. This framework offers a sociological theory of polarisation attentive to meaning-making, affect, boundary formation, co-constitution, and the conditional relationship between cultural and social differentiation.",

Despite various proposed solutions, including climate services and co-production, this gap remains unbridged. \nHere, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory, exploring where and how climate information could support decision-making. Drawing on the COM-B framework for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary for climate information to inform decision-making, focusing on two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany---agriculture and forestry---and on decadal predictions as an example.\nThrough expert focus groups (N = 24 participants), we identify key adaptation decisions for the coming decade and analyze current decision strategies and contexts. Our findings reveal that the demand for decadal predictions is negatively impacted by knowledge gaps, lack of opportunity, and limited motivation. Instead, decision-makers often rely on strategies such as past experience and heuristics like worst-case planning that do not require precise information, but may represent smart strategies for uncertain environments.\nThe true demand for future climate information remains masked, blocked, or unexpressed when decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it; when current decision strategies suffice, there simply is no demand. By using the COM-B framework as a behavioral lens to systematically understand the demand side, our approach offers generalizable insights that may help bridge the gap between supply and demand, design effective interventions, and guide the allocation of resources in climate research and policy.",

          "abstract": "Purpose - With worldwide consideration towards in succeeding business sustainability, the necessity of prioritizing the concept of CSR was emerged. Since the phenomenon of CSR captures broader scope organizations frequently strive to gain more understandability of this concept while providing benefits of CSR to their stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to examine how Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) awareness and perceived CSR value affect customer loyalty of two dominant supermarket players in a high-density urban commercial hub in Sri Lanka. Social exchange theory is implemented as the theoretical framework of this study. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach – Adopting an explanatory research design, cross-sectional data from 108 respondents were collected in 2019 using multi-stage non-probability sampling method incorporating purposive sampling followed by quota sampling. Responses were gathered using a self-administered survey questionnaire. To test the formulated hypotheses based on independent and dependent variables, multiple linear regression analysis was performed with the aid of SPSS 25.0 version. \n\nFindings – The findings reveal that the level of CSR awareness has a positive, yet modest and significant impact on supermarket customer loyalty. Whereas, perceived value of CSR indicates a positive, stronger and significant effect on customer loyalty in the supermarket sector. Consequently, perceived value of CSR exerts a stronger positive influence on supermarket customer loyalty rather than CSR awareness.\n\nImplications - This study contributes to the literature by deconstructing the CSR-loyalty nexus. Consequently, the conclusions made from the results will be helpful to managers and employees in modern retail stores to determine the effectiveness of currently implemented CSR projects towards customers and what components should be prioritized in their CSR efforts to make customers loyal. Further it will provide useful insights to the managers in supermarkets in developing effective CSR strategy as enhancing customer loyalty.\n\nKeywords: Corporate social responsibility (CSR), CSR awareness, Customer loyalty, Perceived value, Supermarkets",

          "abstract": "When is environmental activism most dangerous? We argue that elections create windows of strategic restraint driven by international reputational concerns. Environmental defenders threaten agricultural rents, making them targets for violence by landowners, firms, and criminal networks operating with political protection. However, elections concentrate foreign media attention. Political elites respond by temporarily withdrawing protection from violent actors, particularly in countries dependent on agricultural exports to demanding markets like the European Union. Analyzing global patterns of environmental defender killings, we demonstrate that violence systematically decreases during election periods, with effects concentrated in countries with high agricultural export dependence. We also show that this pattern is strongest for regular, scheduled elections, and that international media attention spikes during elections. Our findings reveal how international economic integration creates cyclical rather than sustained protection for vulnerable activists, which highlights both the power and limits of transnational accountability mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The definition of health behaviours and the activities they encompass continues to evolve. While behaviours such as alcohol use, smoking and physical activity are widely recognised in public health research, newer forms of behaviour, including social media use, have increasingly entered health discourse. Arts engagement has more recently emerged in public health discourse as a potential health-relevant behaviour with implications for health and wellbeing, yet little is known about how it co-occurs with other health behaviours across populations and contexts. This study examined how arts engagement as a health behaviour clusters with other health behaviours, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social media use, and across countries. We analysed data from the Global Flourishing Study, comprising 123,847 adults from 22 countries and territories, using latent profile analysis. Four health behaviour profiles were identified: Low risk, At risk, Mixed, and Disengaged, with arts engagement tending to co-occur with other health-promoting behaviours. These clusters were also observed (broadly) in the country-specific sample. Some country differences in the distribution of health behaviours within clusters were found and the proportion of the clusters also varied across country. Exploring predictors of the identified clusters revealed clear social inequalities in health behaviour patterns, with the strength of the gradients differing by country income level. These findings suggest that arts engagement is a behaviour distinct from other health behaviours, yet one that frequently co-occurs alongside other low-risk behaviours. Moreover, the observed social disparities in health behaviour clusters within and across countries highlight the importance of adopting a social-ecological perspective in health research and intervention.",

          "abstract": "Two fatal disasters and several near misses experienced by Boeing manufactured airplanes in recent\ntimes have undermined public trust in the manufacturer as well as the regulator (Federal Aviation\nAuthority; henceforth FAA). In response, the FAA has promised stricter oversight to improve\nsafety. This study maintains that stricter FAA oversight alone is unlikely to address safety concerns\nas the regulatory governance structure is flawed. The current structure focuses on the bounded\nrationality problem of effective oversight stemming from concerns such as the lack of FAA’s\nexpertise while glossing over opportunism problems. In other words, the regulatory governance\nstructure puts too much trust in Boeing. To address this flaw, this study offers five design\nprinciples that consider both the bounded rationality and the opportunism problems.

          "abstract": "The so-called AI boom is part of an infrastructure-led industrial strategy, converting speculative computing demand into bankable fossil generation, transmission expansion, and water- and land-intensive industrial sites. This article bridges digital infrastructure studies and the new state capitalism literature by theorizing compute as a socially produced resource whose availability depends on territorial governance. I argue that the buildout is being assembled through a fossil–AI nexus, a fossil–finance–platform coalition that produces powered land: an emergent asset form whose value derives from positionality in a constrained energy system that secures deliverable 'firm' power through revenue guarantees, deliverability rights, and cost-allocation arrangements. Drawing on a review of major gas-to-data centre co-location projects and a comparative analysis of PJM and ERCOT, I identify three recurring de-risking channels that convert uncertain load forecasts into durable, carbon-intensive infrastructure: revenue certainty, delivery certainty, and cost shifting. I show how 'reliability,' alongside security and competitiveness framings, compresses timelines, translates engineering criteria into bankability, and narrows public contestation. I also show how opacity, or 'blackboxing,' stabilizes powered land by restricting access to contractual and cost-allocation terms, while relocating politics to transparency disputes and siting conflicts over where data centres go and who pays for the buildout.",

          "abstract": "This paper reports on pilot data from online surveys among 97 passengers of taxi and rideshare services in Victoria, Australia about their experiences of sexual harassment and interpersonal violence. Survey findings reveal that 58% of the sample had experienced harassment or interpersonal violence in either a taxi or rideshare service; 47% reported that they had at least one harmful experience in a taxi and 30% in a rideshare service. The most common behaviours reportedly experienced were a driver or other passenger staring or leering, unwanted attempts to flirt, unwanted comments about their physical appearance, offensive sexual comments, unwanted attempts to establish a romantic or sexual relationship, offensive or degrading comments about gender, and unwanted sexual requests. Overall, women were more likely than men to report harmful experiences. Engagement in reporting mechanisms was low, but participant’s likelihood of reporting to taxi and rideshare companies and to the police in future remained high. This is the first study of its kind in Australia and provides important insights into the nature and impacts of these experiences. The authors call for further research to better understand safety and interpersonal violence in the taxi and rideshare industry at the national and international level.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the effect of credit risk management practices on the financial performance of registered Deposit-Taking SACCOs in the Coastal Region of Kenya. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of credit appraisal methods, credit risk identification, credit risk mitigation practices, and credit risk monitoring on SACCO financial performance. The study focused on SACCOs operating in the Coastal Region, including those headquartered elsewhere but with branches in the region. The theoretical framework was guided by Asymmetric Information Theory, Transaction Costs Theory, the 5 C’s Model for Client Assessment, and Credit Liquidity Theory. A non-experimental correlational research design was adopted, targeting 30 participants from 10 SACCOs using a census sampling approach. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaires, with validity and reliability ensured through expert review and a pilot study. Data were analyzed using SPSS, and inferential statistics were performed using a multiple linear regression model. The findings revealed that credit risk identification (ρ &lt; 0.001, β= 0.312) and credit risk mitigation practices (ρ &lt; 0.001, β = 0.511) had a statistically significant positive effect on financial performance, while client appraisal methods (ρ = 0.084, β = 0.142) and credit risk monitoring (ρ = 0.221, β = 0.119) were not statistically significant. Based on these results, the study recommends that SACCOs strengthen credit risk identification and mitigation strategies, adopt effective client appraisal methods, and enhance monitoring practices to the extent feasible. The study contributes valuable insights for SACCO managers, policymakers, investors, and researchers seeking to improve financial performance through effective credit risk management.",

          "abstract": "In the era of the Quantified Self, continuous self-measurement has become routine, enabling individuals to track genetic data, metabolism, sleep, and circadian rhythms with unprecedented precision. Yet the structure and quality of people's social connections, the Exogenous Social Connectome, remain largely ignored, despite decades of evidence showing that social integration predicts mortality as reliably as smoking, and often more strongly than hypertension or obesity. Social health is still assessed primarily through surveys and self-report rather than objective measurement. To fill this gap, we introduce the Social Connectivity Value (SCV), a composite digital biomarker that quantifies how social network structure biologically influences mental health, physiological regulation, and longevity. SCV builds on sociometric mapping, network topology, evolutionary weighting of relationships, and complex-systems dynamics to capture how social structure affects stress biology, immune function, and aging. Within this framework, social structure is treated not as passive exposure but as a modifiable biological system that can be measured, tracked, and deliberately designed. Despite extensive evidence linking social ties to health, existing approaches fail to specify which structural features matter, which configurations are fragile, and where change has leverage. SCV provides this framework through a standardized protocol for mapping social connections over time, from first dates to lifelong partnerships. In a Social Geroscience framework, SCV metrics operate alongside and shape established longevity biomarkers such as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and metabolic control. By making social structure visible and quantifiable, SCV enables the deliberate design of personal social networks that reshape dating trajectories, pair-bonding outcomes, and long-term healthspan.",

We develop a theoretical framework explaining why wealth's spatial distribution differs from income's and how local advantages create self-reinforcing dynamics. Using novel data tracking household net worth across 722 U.S. commuting zones from 1960-2020, we establish five stylized facts. Wealth is 60-70% more spatially concentrated than income, with patterns distinct from income and housing values. Post-1980 increases in between-place inequality reflect places changing positions rather than divergence. Within places, bottom 50% wealth shares declined nationwide. These patterns reveal feedback mechanisms compounding spatial advantages, highlighting welfare disparities exceeding income-focused research.",

          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile reduces domestic conflict, recent research finds that forcing political challengers abroad correlates with subsequent political instability. However, the mechanisms linking exile and contentious politics remain unexplored. This paper investigates how exile exacerbates domestic contention with original data on exile participation in revolutions, and argues that under certain conditions exile bestows benefits on challengers relative to being based domestically. First, we show that revolutionary challenges are more likely to occur in countries with former leaders in exile, and that revolutionary challenges led by exiles are longer and more violent than those led by domestically based actors. Additional analyses reveal important linking mechanisms; exile’s escalating effects are strongest when exiles are geographically proximate, maintain a sustained presence abroad, provide direct leadership, secure international support, or establish governments-in-exile. Finally, exile is most escalating for revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our study highlights an important but neglected feature of revolutionary contention and advances a broader research agenda on exile and contentious politics.",

Drawing on experimental evidence, an original dataset of 105 elections since 1990 in which autocratizing incumbents sought reelection, hand-coded measures of autocratization scope and visibility in recent electoral contests, and comparative analyses of Poland and Zambia, we find that visibility, but not scope, is systematically linked to incumbent defeat.

Drawing on survey data from 408 Latine juniors majoring in STEM across seven Hispanic Serving and emerging Hispanic Serving Institutions in the University of Texas System, the study integrates egocentric social network analysis with validated measures of STEM identity and belonging. Students listed an average of five key discussion partners, most of whom were Latine, and networks were centered on friends, family members, and fellow college students. Correlational analyses show that stronger ties are associated with multiple forms of support, while family members are especially linked to material aid, aspirational support, and community role modeling. Regression results indicate that greater tie strength and access to community role models are positively associated with STEM identity, whereas denser, more close-knit networks are negatively associated with STEM identity. Network size, tie strength, and having alters who help navigate college life are positively related to students’ sense of belonging. Together, the findings highlight the importance of relational context and culturally grounded assets in shaping Latine students’ persistence and identity development in STEM.",

Drawing on comparative evidence from two studies of Latine college students, one using TNGI and the other using MGRI, the analysis demonstrates that MGRI captures larger and less kin-centered networks, yields lower network density estimates, and better reflects the diversity of students’ academic and career support ties. The findings suggest that MGRI provides a more accurate portrait of undergraduate support networks and enables researchers to examine multiple types of relational contexts within a single survey.

          "abstract": "Modern work and support systems often assume that effort translates into action in a steady and predictable way through routine, reinforcement, and private self-management, embedding this expectation in institutional infrastructure. For many people with ADHD, this expectation does not hold. Traction can be discontinuous and highly context-dependent, and sustained functioning is often achieved through compensatory pathways such as urgency and acute pressure rather than stable routines. While these strategies can enable short-term performance, they can also be costly when chronic stress becomes the main route to action. When institutions treat their motivational expectations as universal, differences in regulation are frequently moralised as laziness, unreliability, or defiance, and people are praised for crisis performance but blamed for later collapse. Drawing on disability studies, this paper frames these dynamics as institutional misfit rather than individual pathology. It introduces “assumed motivational gradient” as a descriptive metaphor for institutional design bias and outlines implications for disability-informed practice.",

          "abstract": "Global capital income inequality has declined in the 21st century, with the Gini coefficient falling from 97% to 94%. Over the same period, the share of the world population with annual capital income above $100 increased from 12% to 27%. This implies more than a doubling of the number of individuals earning positive income from interest, dividends, rents, and privately-funded pensions. Most Western nations have lost positions in the global capital income ranking, in contrast to several developing countries, particularly China and Russia. When adjusting for missing capital income in surveys using national accounts, while the levels of inequality slightly vary across adjustment methods, the results consistently confirm a decreasing inequality trend. This is also confirmed when the capitalized wealth of billionaires is included in the analysis using Forbes lists. Overall, this paper provides new global evidence on the evolution, distribution, and measurement of capital income, and highlights its implications for inequality analysis in contemporary capitalism.

While some scholars laud PSMFs for enhancing nonprofit productivity and strategic effectiveness, others contend they are ill-suited for a social mission context. This study addresses a pragmatic route forward, exploring how nonprofit leaders of organisations in the UK and US adapt PSMFs to befit their nonprofit context. Through in-depth interviews and document analysis we explore PSMF translation in six cases, revealing three distinct “PSMF translation” approaches: Responsive, Proactive and Mediative. These categories demonstrate senior leaders are intentional actors who rework private sector logic to fit functional nonprofit needs, bridging the dual demands for commercial efficiency and social impact. We conclude by addressing the currently ad hoc and atomised state of PSMF usage, calling for scholars, policymakers and field leaders to support informed PSMF translation across the social sector.",

Drawing on experimental evidence, an original dataset of 105 elections since 1990 in which autocratizing incumbents sought reelection, hand-coded measures of autocratization scope and visibility in recent electoral contests, and comparative analyses of Poland and Zambia, we find that visibility, but not scope, is systematically linked to incumbent defeat. Our findings have implications for the conditions under which citizens can disrupt episodes of autocratization through electoral channels.",

          "abstract": "Kinship networks are a key informal infrastructure of support, yet demographic change is reshaping how many and which relatives people can rely on. Some people may lack kin completely or in part. Thus, we also consider friendship ties as potential compensatory sources of support. Using nationally representative surveys from 1998 and 2016, we describe age-specific configurations of close kin and friends among Italian adults. We measure the availability of close kin (partner, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren), kinlessness, kinship size and diversity, and generational positioning. In 2016, complete kinlessness remains rare (about 1%) but is concentrated at older ages, whereas small, vertically “thinned” networks are more common. Kin availability peaks in midlife and declines at older ages. Between 1998 and 2016, the average number and diversity of kin decreased and generational profiles increasingly feature ascendants without descendants and a group of “generational solos.” Friendship ties are widespread and more prevalent among those with fewer kin, but they do not fully offset emerging inequalities in kinship resources. These findings show how the changes occurred in longevity, low fertility, and partnership reconfigured informal support bases in an ageing, strong-family context.",

          "abstract": "Rap music, often scrutinized for its portrayal of violence, misogyny, materialism, and drug use, can serve as a compelling case study for empirically exploring how art reflects its time. While existing literature has documented a purported increasing trend of these themes, investigations that consider the social conditions during song production remain scarce. By analyzing 26,438 rap singles released in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we find that the prevalence of these lyrical themes does not show a consistent upward trajectory. Instead, they exhibit significant temporal fluctuations, with each following a distinct pattern. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong contemporaneous correlation between these lyrical fluctuations and their corresponding national social indicators, including rates for crime, sexual assault, poverty, and DEA arrests. Crucially, this correlation becomes significantly stronger when using social statistics specific to Black Americans. These findings provide large-scale empirical evidence that art is a sensitive reflection of the social and economic realities of the time, offering insights into how deep-seated social problems are depicted through artistic expression.",

And what do their perspectives mean for the normative question of how we ought to think about the interface of science and public good? While STS has much to contribute here, we have seen little sustained engagement with these questions in the field, a gap we seek to address. We revisit Michel Callon’s 1994 article ‘Is Science a Public Good?’, putting his contribution in conversation with more recent STS insights and empirical findings on narratives around stem cell research in Australia. Based on this analysis, we identify three narratives of science and public good: two that are prominent in contemporary discussions (essentialist, market-oriented) and another that speaks to possible alternatives (ambivalent).  Seeking to expand upon the ambivalent narrative in order to point towards more normative possibilities, we argue that today the challenge is to transform how scientific research is configured in this world in order to allow diverse publics, priorities, and pathways to be built in pursuit of public good.",

The EU LIFE Multi Peat project introduces the European Peatland Policy Portal as a novel policy corpus and toolkit to support analysis and evidence-based policy development in this disjointed landscape of peatland policy. The portal presents the first comprehensive European Peatland Policy Corpus, with over 400 peatland-affecting policies catalogued across 27 countries and 22 languages, spanning United Nations, European Union, national, and sub-national levels. Alongside the unified, multilingual policy catalogue, the portal introduces an interactive mapping tool to support spatial policy analysis, as well as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based question-answering tool that allows users to query the full policy corpus with the power of machine learning. With multilingual comprehension, the RAG tool enables users to interface with policies which would otherwise sit behind a language barrier. By enabling systematic policy examination and analysis across countries, governance levels, domains, and languages, the portal assists the coordination and efficiency gaps of European peatland governance. While this portal demonstrates the efficacy of these tools for peatland policy specifically, its framework is transferable to other land use policy domains that face complex regulatory environments.",

We find that both grievances are positively associated with anti-feminist sentiment. Exploring effect heterogeneity, we find that the associations are slightly stronger for men, but these differences are minimal in substantive terms. However, using a three-way interaction model, we find that financial dissatisfaction can compensate for some of the negative associations between marginalization as well as loneliness with anti-feminist attitudes for men; the opposite is the case for women. Arguing from an identity threat theory perspective, the study shows how gender plays an incremental role in how the perceived personal situation exerts an influence on gender related attitudes. Therefore, our study contributes to our understanding of how perceived grievances interact with socio-demographic characteristics and how this interplay potentially increases anti-feminist attitudes.",

          "abstract": "From the smart urbanism of the 2010s to platform and AI urbanism(s) of the present-future, the ‘data-driven city’ has been imagined as a functional and controlled whole, impulsed and regulated by autonomous (humans off-the-loop) systems, and fed through powerful data infrastructure. AI urbanism, in particular, manifests the current climax of the long-standing desire to control digital technology in the city yet to come. An excessive focus on technology, however, risks de-contextualising it from the wider economic and political landscapes. \nWhile digital platforms have been structuring the fabric of daily urban life colonising almost any field of interest through their ecosystems and mobile apps, AI technologies start making their way into cities with: autonomous vehicles, city brains, Digital Twins and robotics. Advocates suggest these novel technologies have changed the geographies of their deployment – not confined to cities any more, rather on regional or global scales – and of their partnerships with city management – cities no longer having exclusive and central stage, rather participating to consortia with limited or secondary roles. Both these configurations have been framed as the ‘post-smart city’. \nBut, is there a paradigm shift between these versions of urbanism? Has the ‘smart city’ framework – the neoliberal project of linking private investment from technology firms into the management and governance of city living – substantially changed? And, finally, what role is expected for cities to take in this uncertain and evolving scenario? \nThe ‘data-driven city’ ought to be understood in pair with the development of data capitalism and the enormous expansion of its data infrastructure, markets and services. Thus, I invite to re-position this debate as an intensification of neoliberal (‘smart’ or ‘data-driven’) urbanism and its ideological assumptions: technological solutionism and smart mentality, and data extractivism, surveillance and control.",

          "abstract": "How first-time parents arrange childcare has critical implications for their careers and the child's development. Previous research shows that childcare choices are shaped by family care availability, understood as an additive function of a small set of parental and grandparental characteristics. However, research on family networks suggests that care availability is rather a non-linear, non-additive function of large family networks. We compare the predictive ability of these two perspectives using a machine learning framework and register-based family network data. We find that considering how the child’s great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins shape care availability, and modelling their influence using more flexible models, improves the prediction of childcare choices, particularly among more disadvantaged parents. Consistent with prior work, predictions are driven by parents’ and grandparents’ socioeconomic characteristics, but cousins’ age and daycare use are important yet understudied predictors. Other important predictors include parents’ self-employment, healthcare spending, and timing of daycare uptake.",

          "abstract": "The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces, for the first time, a legal framework granting researchers access to data from very large online platforms and search engines. This represents a profound shift in how platform data can be obtained: access becomes a regulated right rather than a technical workaround. Yet the DSA’s promise of transparency depends on the ability of researchers to meet stringent legal and technical requirements for security, confidentiality, and data protection. Few researchers can do so individually.\nThis commentary argues that the emerging DSA regime makes research infrastructure a precondition for meaningful and lawful data access. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and other institutional arrangements can mediate between three actors — researchers, platforms, and Digital Services Coordinators — ensuring trust, compliance, and accountability. In this role, infrastructures become not just technical means but governance interfaces that translate regulatory obligations into practical research conditions.\nThe shift from ad hoc data collection to regulated access requires more than new rules; it demands a reorientation of the research community itself. Building and sustaining infrastructures is now integral to enabling independent, transparent, and reproducible platform research. The DSA, we suggest, inaugurates a new phase in the politics of data access — one in which infrastructures mediate the relationship between science, regulation, and the digital platforms that shape public life.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how editorial processes in leading International Relations (IR) journals reproduce global epistemic inequalities. It focuses on International Security (IS) and International Studies Quarterly (ISQ) to identify two interrelated dynamics: editorial bias, which privileges scholars affiliated with Western institutions, and editorial blindness, which narrows thematic scope despite broad declared aims. Using original empirical data and a novel formal framework—the Probabilistic Article Acceptance Model (PAAM) and Editorial Blindness Index (EBI)—the study finds that 95.5% of IS and 92.3% of ISQ primary authors affiliate with Western institutions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that IS narrows its thematic focus toward traditional and U.S.-centric security concerns, while ISQ maintains thematic plurality. These findings align with Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic capital and Kuhn’s paradigm theory, indicating that editorial decisions reflect social and institutional structures more than epistemic merit. The article introduces Epistemic Gatekeeping Dynamics (EGD) as a new theoretical framework, arguing that editorial processes act as selective mechanisms of epistemic legitimacy. It concludes by recommending structural reforms and editorial diversification to promote pluralism and inclusivity in IR publishing.",

Both fixed effects and instrumental variables analyses show that Chinese graduates' exposure to this organization significantly increases their likelihood of return. Further analyses reveal that ACSW's mobilization was more effective when channeled through scientists' own professional networks, and it influenced their aspiration to return more than ability. These findings unveil important political drivers behind one of the largest episodes of talent repatriations in history, with significant implications for global knowledge transfer and U.S.--China relations today.",

This paper proposes that resilience is best understood as hierarchical precision flexibility—the capacity of a predictive system to dynamically recalibrate confidence in prediction errors across embodied, affective, and meaning-related levels of inference.\nDrawing on predictive processing and the Free Energy Principle, we argue that resilience does not consist in reduced stress reactivity, but in context-sensitive modulation of precision within hierarchical inference. Defensive rigidity and adaptive flexibility are reframed as alternative configurations of precision dynamics rather than distinct psychological capacities. Dysregulation arises when prediction errors are weighted inflexibly, whereas resilience emerges from coordinated recalibration across hierarchical levels.\nThis account integrates developmental, neurobiological, and computational perspectives within a unified explanatory framework. By specifying resilience as a property of precision dynamics, it shifts the construct from descriptive classification toward formal mechanistic explanation and yields empirically testable predictions for computational psychiatry and clinical intervention research.",

This study aims to deepen understanding of the roles that diverse HWFP activities play within the broader set of strategies food-insecure households use to keep food on the table. We conducted interviews with 25 participants in two rural states in the northeastern United States, Maine and Vermont. On average, the study  participants reported having engaged in 19 of a list of 41 coping behaviors, not including HWFP activities, in the last year. Overall, they described HWFP activities as socially legitimate food sources that provide multifaceted benefits beyond food. For these interviewees, HWFP can be an effective coping strategy for alleviating household food insecurity because it diversifies their food sources and allows for stockpiling non-market abundances. Yet, HWFP should not be mistaken for a coping strategy in the sense of an activity that households undertake only in response to hardship, because participants associated these activities with diverse, positive meanings such as joy, connection, and autonomy. The only negative aspects of HWFP that participants identified were challenges stemming from limited access to key resources needed for successful harvests, such as equipment, skills, and land access. We recommend policies and programs that ensure access to these prerequisites for HWFP success; people experiencing food insecurity should guide these efforts.",

          "abstract": "Reproducibility is central to research credibility, yet large-scale reanalysis of empricial data remains costly because replication packages vary widely in structure, software environment, and documentation. We develop and evaluate an agentic AI workflow that addresses this execution bottleneck while preserving scientific rigor. The system separates scientific reasoning from computational execution: researchers design fixed diagnostic templates, and the workflow automates the acquisition, harmonization, and execution of replication materials using pre-specified, version-controlled code. A structured knowledge layer records resolved failure patterns, enabling adaptation across heterogeneous studies while keeping each pipeline version transparent and stable. We evaluate this workflow on 92 instrumental variable (IV) studies, including 67 with manually verified reproducible 2SLS estimates and 25 newly published IV studies under identical criteria. For each paper, we analyze up to three two-stage least squares (2SLS) specifications, totaling 215. Across the 92 papers, the system achieves 87% end-to-end success overall. Conditional on accessible data and code, reproducibility is 100% at both the paper and specification levels. The framework substantially lowers the cost of executing established empirical protocols and can be adapted in empirical settings where analytic templates and norms of transparency are well established.",

Drawing on survey data (n = 129) and interviews (n = 20), the study applies Yosso’s (2005) Community Cultural Wealth framework alongside social network analysis to document the strengths students bring to college and the ways these assets relate to career attitudes and service use. Findings indicate that participants demonstrate high levels of Aspirational, Navigational, Familial, and Resistant capital, with family-centered networks playing a central role in sustaining hope, coping, and community commitment. Students report a moderate sense of belonging and relatively strong work volition. The report also shows that students' engagement with formal career services varies by year in school, sense of belonging, network characteristics, and career values. Cluster analyses reveal meaningful within-group differences in both career orientations and forms of cultural wealth, underscoring the heterogeneity of Hispanic/Latino students’ experiences. The report concludes with asset-based recommendations for faculty, advisors, and student services professionals to strengthen institutional practices, better connect campus resources to students’ existing networks and values, and support equitable college-to-career pathways.",

From a sustainable wellbeing perspective that emphasises intergenerational equity, we examine how wellbeing was reallocated across age groups in 28 OECD countries between 2008 and 2024. \nMethod: We analyse life evaluation (0–10 scale) data from the Gallup World Poll at four anchor years (2008, 2011, 2019, 2024), using country-specific models and two classification approaches (quadratic and confidence-interval-based). We assess cross-national heterogeneity, methodological sensitivity, and sustainable wellbeing implications through age-group reallocation patterns.\nResults: Age-wellbeing profiles varied greatly across countries, with classifications sensitive to functional form, age boundaries, and temporal pooling. We identified five patterns: (1) sustainable (8 countries including Eastern Europe, East Asia, Chile: broad-based gains across all age groups), (2) unsustainable (14 countries across North, Western and Southern Europe, North America, and New Zealand, characterised by early-adulthood decline alongside substantially better outcomes in late adulthood; Spain exemplified the starkest contrast (-1.34 point-change for ages 18-29, and +0.83 for ages 70-79)), (3) no significant age-based reallocation (Turkey, Israel), (4) reverse patterns (United Kingdom, Ireland: late adulthood fared worse than early adulthood), (5) mixed/unique patterns (Australia, Denmark).\nConclusion: Age-wellbeing profile classifications are sensitive to methodological choices, though reallocation patterns provide robust evidence about distributional dynamics. Half the sample showed unsustainable trajectories, raising profound intergenerational equity concerns. Eight countries achieved sustainable, broad-based gains, all starting from low baselines, which suggests that equitable trajectories may be more easily achievable when aggregate wellbeing is improving rather than declining. Addressing unsustainable patterns requires comprehensive policy attention and routine age-disaggregated monitoring.",

          "authors": "Philipp Riederle",
          "abstract": "Users of centralised digital platforms (e.g., X, Instagram, TikTok) have little choice but to accept incumbent providers’ conduct or forgo participation. Digital platform interoperability is widely proposed as a remedy to reduce the economic and political power of centralised digital platforms by enabling user choice without sacrificing network connectivity. Despite its prominence in policy debates (e.g., EU’s Digital Markets Act, Art. 7), theoretical claims on its effects remain largely untested. This paper evaluates three theoretical expectations on platform interoperability: that it neutralises proprietary network effects; it facilitates individual user choice and switching; and that technical standardisation risks homogeneous services. To operationalise these concepts, this study analyses user switches within the interoperable social platform Mastodon. It draws on an unobtrusive, qualitative analysis of user posts documenting why individuals switched their interoperable providers. My findings qualify the theoretical promises and concerns: I find that interoperability is necessary but, on its own, insuﬀicient to achieve the intentions associated with policy proposals. I identify practical obstacles such as incomplete implementation, information costs, and persistent switching costs that preserve proprietary network effects and that hinder individual choice and switching. Further, I challenge the concern of anticipated service homogenisation. I identify avenues of vertical (e.g., quality) and horizontal (e.g., governance values) provider differentiation. These avenues form an emerging research agenda on new dynamics between differentiated but interoperable platform providers. Overall, this study contributes the first empirical evaluation of digital platform interoperability, identifies obstacles, and formulates recommendations, speaking directly to policy.",

          "authors": "Onur Yamaner; MUNIBA ALI",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the specifics of the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan from the perspective of the intersection of theories of recognition, justice, and the transition from realist to constructivist paradigms. The Baloch insurgency in Pakistan has always been explained through security and economic-aid policies by the Pakistan government. However, by exploring the intersection of structural, cultural, and psychological forms of exclusion, it is claimed that the conflict is fueled by these intersections of identity. This paper combines the theories of misrecognition and maldistribution from the work of Nancy Fraser in 2003 and the moral injury construct of Axel Honneth from 1995 and asserts that structural policies of the Pakistan government are denying the Baloch people recognition as complete citizens with recognized identity. The proposed study makes use of a qualitative research approach in which descriptive and explanatory content analysis has been used to examine the socio-political reality of Balochistan. The study is limited by the fact that the research has no prime field accessibility due to the constraints imposed by security considerations, which may pose challenges of bias arising from state or secondary histories. To address the implication, triangulation is used in the study by referencing official statistics and other international human rights reports to provide a balanced view. The study has been conducted by using a purposive sample of secondary sources ranging from peer-reviewed academic literature to policy reports related to the 18th Amendment and CPEC projects, along with human rights statistics obtained from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). The sources were considered as per their respective relevance to the twin paradigms of \"struggle for recognition\" and \"maldistribution.\" The period of investigation has been from accession in 1948 to modern development schemes. This paper derives its findings from a content analysis of already existing literature from 1948-2024 on the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan and includes the history of violence between the Baloch leaders and the central government of Pakistan and the \"moral injuries\" that are spurred by the exploitative use of Baloch Gas and Minerals by the Pakistani government. Through this change in focus, or paradigm shift, from simply addressing resource struggles to addressing struggles for dignity, this study shows that issues of economic and political justice are being used as primary wounds of invisibility and disrespect. Therefore, this study concludes that in order to pursue a justice-oriented path for eternal peace, there must be an understanding of the connected concepts of respect and recognition. \nKeywords: Conflict, Grievances, Misrecognition, Misrepresentation, Recognition and Redistribution.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical model explaining why evaluators may deliberately avoid\nrelying on observable performance metrics in selection contexts characterized by long-term\ndevelopmental horizons. While conventional frameworks treat measurable credentials—such as\ndegrees or certifications—as monotonic indicators of ability, real-world selection often displays\na paradox: highly credentialed candidates may be systematically discounted.\nThe model distinguishes between observable qualifications and latent foundational capacity,\ndefined as the underlying potential for adaptation and long-term learning. Under developmental\nuncertainty, evaluators interpret credentials not only as signals of past performance but also as\nindirect indicators of how individuals have allocated finite developmental resources. Extensive\ninvestment in measurable achievements may therefore signal a relative neglect of unstructured\ncapacity essential for long-term adaptability.\nWe formalize this mechanism as horizon-dependent metric avoidance, showing how a\nnon-monotonic relationship emerges between observable qualifications and evaluation outcomes.\nThe resulting Reverse Credential Effect provides a structural explanation for overqualification\npenalties and the strategic discounting of metrics in high-uncertainty, long-horizon selection\nenvironments. More broadly, the model highlights how the temporal structure of evaluation\nfundamentally shapes the informational value of performance signals. By introducing evaluation\nhorizon as a structural parameter, the model extends standard signaling frameworks to\nlong-term developmental selection contexts.",

          "abstract": "An agent-based model with symmetric agents (N = 350; no pre-assigned enforcement roles; 3,246 runs) shows that enforcement concentration emerges endogenously from the structural geometry of codified moral systems. Five measurable institutional properties (legibility, substitutability, enforcement reward, institutional delegation, and exit cost) jointly determine which of four regimes a system enters: quiet, mixed enforcement, collapse, or capture. Institutional delegation and capital compounding reliably select a small minority into enforcement roles: the top 5 agents issue 67 to 92 percent of all punishment; endogenously appointed cadre members execute 92 to 98 percent. Two theoretically motivated retention mechanisms (sanctified suffering, membership reward) are inert across their full parameter ranges. Only degradation of the outside option converts concentration into capture: 466 of 1,080 drift-enabled runs transition to capture from conditions that otherwise yield mixed dynamics. The decisive falsifiable prediction: holding enforcement intensity constant, lowering outside-option quality increases the probability of capture. Cross-national analysis (36 countries) is consistent with this prediction: outside-option quality explains 4.4 times more variance in religious retention than enforcement intensity.",

Yet this expansion risks creating a verification gap, in which the volume of scientific claims outpaces the community's capacity to check their reproducibility. We argue that the same LLM capabilities driving scientific output can be redirected toward scalable verification. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how an autonomous LLM-based agent can reproduce the core statistical results of a classic sociology paper, while identifying underspecified methodological details. This means that automated replication does not adjudicate scientific truth, but it localizes discrepancies and documentation gaps, lowering the cost of computational reproducibility checks. Thereby, we propose embedding LLM-assisted replication across the research lifecycle, such as pre-submission quality check, journal-integrated verification, post-publication audits, and forensic reconstruction of legacy studies. To prevent misuse and preserve trust, we call for transparent standards and community governance. If institutionalized responsibly, AI can serve not only to generate science, but to scale its self-correction.",

While influential in monitoring performance, engagement, and compliance, these approaches provide limited insight into how responsibility for learning is structurally distributed through pedagogical design, as accountability is inferred primarily from learner behaviour rather than institutional design decisions. This study examines institutional design responsibility as a distinct evaluand within educational evaluation by developing and applying the 5C Rubric, an artefact-based framework for analysing how responsibility for learning is embedded in course design. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and Self-Regulated Learning, the rubric operationalises five interrelated design principles: Coherence, Cognitive Load, Competence, Completion, and Connection. Applied to a semester-long corpus of educator-generated course artefacts, the analysis identifies a recurring structural pattern in which alignment and mastery progression are consistently embedded, while accountability, reflective integration, and load-sensitive scaffolding remain unevenly institutionalised. The study contributes an artefact-based and ethically proportionate approach to evaluation and accountability in technology-enhanced higher education.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Espinosa-Uquillas; Matthew Kling; Meredith Niles",
          "abstract": "The heterogeneity of different farmland sizes has been overlooked in the climate adaptation literature, yet it is crucial for identifying effective policy interventions to achieve national-scale climate resilience. Using U.S. Agricultural Census data from 2012, 2017, and 2022 aggregated by farm size groupings within states, we compare the temporal changes in adoption of three water-related climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage, and irrigation) across small, medium and large farms, individually. Specifically, we provide estimates of the role of multiple government programs and climate changes in shaping heterogeneous climate adaptation behaviors across farm sizes. Applying multilevel models within a Bayesian framework, we show that temporal changes of government programs and climate conditions correlate with temporal changes in adoption differently across farm sizes. For small and medium farms, insurance participation associates positively with adoption of cover crops and irrigation. Among large farms, federal programs correlate negatively with irrigation, while state programs and insurance are positively associated with cover crops. These results suggest the opportunity to enhance cover crops among small and medium operations by improving the distribution of insurance and state programs, where small farms often have low participation. Alternatively, crop insurance, and not climate, might be the major driver of irrigation expansion among smaller farms as a way to increase productivity and reduce premium subsidies. Finally, small farms’ adoption of irrigation and tile drainage shows uncertain or negative correlations with changing and uncertain climate, implying that diseconomies of scale might be limiting their adoption; meanwhile, uncertainty of returns under climate changes is preventing farms of all sizes from growing cover crops, specifically in the West for large and medium farms, and the Eastern regions for small farms. We conclude that encouraging the adoption of water-related climate adaptation practices may require adjusting current federal and local programs toward individualized farm-size policies.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Espinosa-Uquillas; Roderick M. Rejesus; Meredith Niles",
          "abstract": "Despite cover crops been widely promoted for their on and off-farm benefits, their adoption is both low nationally and diminishing in some areas. Existing research has examined a suite of factors affecting the adoption of cover crops in the United States, yet understanding the role of multiple government programs and climate changes has not been fully investigated over time, especially across a national sample. Furthermore, the factors associated with cover crop disadoption have not yet been explored nationally. To fill these gaps in the literature, we combine multiple publicly available data sources to estimate the role of multiple government programs (i.e., crop insurance, state, conservation and working-lands programs) and weather and climate change conditions on county cover crop adoption and disadoption. First, we find that increasing crop insurance participation is associated with increasing cover crop adoption nationally and in the Midwest and Northeast, while increasing insurance premium subsidies are correlated with reduced cover crop adoption in the Midwest and increasing in the Southwest. Second, working-lands payments (including EQIP, CSP and commodity) are highly correlated with cover crop adoption in every region except the Northwest, although exclusively during the 2012-2017 period, when EQIP aggressively expanded cost-sharing cover crops. Third, cover crops might have been implemented as a climate-resilience strategy although constrained by a region’s particular agricultural system. For instance, increasing temperature variability is correlated with higher cover crop adoption in the Western regions, while water deficits are associated with more cover crops in the Midwest but lower cover crops in the Southeast. Finally, we quantify that 31% and 41% of counties had decreasing level of cover crops in 2017 and 2022, respectively, implying potential adoption saturation and concentration in fewer counties. Regionally, the probability of cover crop disadoption increases with land-retirement payments in the Northwest, insurance participation in the Southeast, and insurance subsidies in the Midwest, while it decreases with working-lands payments in the Midwest. We conclude that production risks from cover crop adoption could be potentially alleviated with the expansion of federal cost-sharing programs and crop insurance participation; yet the amount of premium subsidies should be assessed as possibly disincentivizing cover crops in the Midwest due to moral hazard triggers and risk-management redundancies under both practices.",

Standard accounts predict that minority officeholders should transmit constituent preferences, which favor housing development, into policy. Using city-council election data for large U.S. cities (2010--2021) and a regression discontinuity design in close elections, I find that electing a minority councilmember increases total residential permitting by 21-33%, but almost entirely through single-family construction; multifamily permitting does not increase commensurately. Evidence from 60 semi-structured interviews identifies the mechanisms: minority officials prioritize homeownership as an equity strategy to close racial wealth gaps while expressing skepticism toward developer-led multifamily projects associated with displacement. Institutional norms of district deference give individual members near-unilateral authority over development, providing a pathway to policy influence that does not require a critical mass. The findings demonstrate that descriptive representation has substantive consequences for land-use policy, but that minority officeholders act on priorities rooted in their communities' experiences with exclusion rather than simply channeling the housing preferences expressed by minority voters in surveys.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of social interactions are reflected in the archaeological record, specifically analyzing the extent to which artifacts can serve as proxies for past human interactions. Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using graph correlation and the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP), the effects of model parameters on correlation strength were analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs), and underlying network structures were compared using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

In this study, we contribute to the literature on disparities in MAR by providing a multi-stage analysis of social gradients in MAR across a period of almost two decades. Specifically, we depict trends in annual education and income gradients in the take-up of MAR treatment, the probability of a MAR treatment leading to a live birth, and prevalence of MAR involvement in births. We use Danish administrative data covering all births and MAR treatments among women aged 25–45 residing in Denmark from 2006–2023. We employ linear probability models (LPM), which are adjusted for age groups, partnership status and duration, and stratify them by parity, treatment type, and clinic type. We document persistent social gradients in all three stages of the MAR process across parity and treatment type, apart from ART treatment take-up, where the educational gradient was evident only for second and higher-order parities. Moreover, we show that the educational gradient in treatment success persists across clinic type.  The results were robust across alternative specifications: Using income as the SES measure, pooling treatments across types, excluding migrants, and estimating unadjusted models. Furthermore, the gradients persisted in the high income-low inequality and heavily subsidized context of Denmark.",

          "abstract": "En esta disertación nos proponemos examinar críticamente la evolución reciente de la medición de la práctica deportiva en España a partir del análisis comparado de las encuestas oficiales de hábitos deportivos desde 1975 hasta 2025. A tal efecto, se hallan e interpretan los escenarios y las disquisiciones acaecidas a partir de la de 2015, identificando la ruptura metodológica introducida en 2015, que trajo consigo una discontinuidad en la serie histórica que compromete la comparabilidad longitudinal y puede estar produciendo una sobreestimación de los niveles reales de práctica deportiva. A partir de la revisión de los instrumentos de medición, las categorías de frecuencia empleadas y la forma de presentar los resultados —especialmente en términos de minutos acumulados de actividad—, planteamos que parte del aumento informado en la práctica responde a cambios en la definición y operacionalización del fenómeno más que a las transformaciones sociales y económicas equivalentes. Para demostrar la hipótesis, comparamos estos resultados con otros indicadores estructurales del sistema deportivo español —empleo, gasto público, gasto de los hogares, tejido empresarial y licencias federativas— que no muestran expansiones acordes con el supuesto incremento abrupto de la práctica desde 2015. Asimismo, apoyándonos en la discusión con otros estudios secundarios, comparamos los resultados sobre esta variable en la Encuesta de Hábitos Deportivos con los de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud, evidenciando con ello las divergencias en la estimación del cumplimiento de las recomendaciones de actividad física de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Estas diferencias las identificamos como una disfunción que da cuenta del resultado de marcos conceptuales y metodológicos distintos más que como reflejo de una mejora homogénea del comportamiento deportivo de la población española en los periodos observados. Finalmente, subrayamos la necesidad de reforzar la dirección científico-técnica de estas operaciones estadísticas mediante la participación de los profesionales de las Ciencias de la Actividad Física y del Deporte, así como de orientar las políticas públicas en función de las cifras agregadas, así como de un análisis riguroso de la demanda de actividad física y de las barreras de acceso en los distintos grupos sociales, amén de la realización estudios ulteriores basados en la comparación de casos y el rastreo de procesos que pongan el acento en la combinación de los factores que explican la práctica deportiva. El trabajo concluye con la premisa de que medir mejor esta variable es una condición imprescindible para diseñar políticas deportivas y de salud pública más eficaces.",

          "authors": "Jianzhou Xu; WangJunshan",
          "abstract": "Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals in China navigate a distinctive socio-cultural stress ecosystem shaped by collectivist values and conservative public discourse. While minority stress theory is well-established, the specific processes of identity negotiation under Chinese familial, institutional, and societal pressures remain underexplored. This qualitative study conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten TGD individuals in China. Data was analyzed using grounded theory, progressing through open, axial, and selective coding, informed by social role theory and labeling theory. Analysis revealed four dynamically interconnected social roles: the “Mentally Ill Patient” (characterized by pathologization and internalized stigma), the “Marginal Person” (experiencing systemic and familial exclusion), the “Pretender” (employing concealment as a survival strategy), and the “Helper” (fostering community mutual aid and resilience). These roles are not static but fluid, illustrating how external labeling and role expectations are internalized, negotiated, or resisted. Mental health challenges among TGD individuals in China must be understood as a dynamic process of negotiating identity and stigma within a collectivist structural context. The findings extend minority stress theory beyond Western paradigms, highlighting the urgent need for affirming, community-informed support systems that move beyond pathologization to empower resilience and agency. This manuscript is currently under review at Sex Roles (Springer Nature).",

          "abstract": "The paper aims to investigate the determinants of the Perceived Risk of Crime (PRC) in Italian regions for the period 2004-2022, with data provided by the ISTAT-BES framework. The analysis relies on a regional panel dataset, which is somewhat unbalanced, with an extensive set of socio-institutional, crime, and subjective well-being variables, such as social participation, trust in people, trust in the judiciary, pickpocketing, fear of crime, life satisfaction, pessimism about the future, and dissatisfaction with the regional landscape. The analysis combines classical panel data methodologies with machine learning techniques to check the robustness of the results and to detect regional latent patterns. In all models, namely, fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel, and weighted least squares, it is confirmed that objective crime variables, as well as subjective ones, play a crucial role in determining PRC. In particular, it is confirmed that, among the variables, pickpocketing and fear of crime are the most important positive determinants of PRC, while trust in people and trust in the judiciary have a significant mitigating effect on PRC. Variables concerning pessimism about the future and environmental dissatisfaction are also confirmed to have a positive effect on PRC. Among several machine learning alternatives, the regularized linear regression model is selected as the best-performing predictive model, which provides an interpretable and accurate representation of the relationships between the variables. In addition, model-based clustering allows us to detect different regional profiles characterized by different combinations of crime, trust, well-being, and security perceptions. In conclusion, the results confirm that PRC in Italian regions depends on the complex interaction between actual crime, emotional reactions, trust, and quality of life, suggesting that effective policies to address PRC should be based on the integrated action of crime control strategies, trust-building, social cohesion, and quality of the regional landscape.",

          "abstract": "While research examining trade-offs between farm animal welfare (FAW) and environmental sustainability in agricultural systems is increasing, there is limited understanding of consumer responses to these explicit trade-offs. The central aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of farm animal welfare (FAW) and environmental sustainability in U.S. consumer purchasing decisions. We conducted a survey of 1,200 U.S. residents that combined attitudinal questions with a series of choice experiments involving egg purchasing scenarios. Participants chose between products with varying FAW, sustainability, and price attributes. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square, ANOVA, and ordinal logistic regression modelling, were used to evaluate preferences, associations, and willingness to pay. The findings consistently reveal that while consumers value both attributes, they prioritize FAW over sustainability in direct trade-offs, with a majority selecting higher-welfare eggs over more environmentally sustainable options. Moreover, our analysis revealed consistent attitudes across key demographic groups, finding no significant difference in the preference for FAW over sustainability across income groups, political parties, or regions of the country. While willingness to pay for these attributes showed no significant difference across income or region, it did vary significantly by political party, with right-wing respondents being less willing than left-wing respondents to pay a premium for higher FAW. However, a majority of even the most right-wing respondents chose to pay more for higher FAW. Despite some consumer ambivalence, our primary finding is that a majority of consumers are not willing to compromise on FAW for sustainability benefits.",

          "authors": "Saul Alamilla; Sammie L. Haskin; Sherry C. Wang",
          "abstract": "Educational attainment is a critical social determinant of health, yet relatively little research has examined how long-run academic patterns at the school level evolve through periods of macro socioeconomic disruptions or shocks. This study investigates longitudinal academic trajectories among public high schools in Georgia across 17 years (2004-2020), spanning the Great Recession (GR), using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify patterns in ACT performance and college scholarship eligibility. We also estimated the joint evolution of these outcomes. Differences in trajectory shape indicated academic pathways diverged in heterogeneous ways during the GR era, rather than exhibiting a uniform response across schools and communities. These distinct sets of trajectories were strongly patterned by socioeconomic and racial school and neighborhood composition—with schools serving higher-income and majority-White populations more likely to sustain higher academic achievement and access to merit-based aid, while schools serving more economically disadvantaged and racially minoritized populations were more likely to experience persistently lower or declining trajectories. Dual-trajectory analyses further show strong conditional associations between academic performance and scholarship eligibility, such that schools with more favorable achievement trajectories also had substantially higher probabilities of sustained access to merit-based financial aid. These findings indicate that long-run academic trajectories are patterned by existing social and institutional inequalities, with disparities remaining evident during periods of macro socioeconomic disruption. By highlighting heterogeneity in schools’ academic pathways before, during, and after a major economic downturn, this study underscores the importance of approaches that capture such heterogeneity for appropriate educational equity and community health planning.\nKeywords: academic trajectories; social determinants of health; structural inequality; educational inequality; Great Recession; group-based trajectory modeling; public high schools",

          "abstract": "Selectivity is a key explanation for immigrant health advantage, yet evidence is often inferred from comparisons that bundle selection with post-migration processes and leave unspecified what is being selected. This study isolates educational selectivity by quantifying how predicted immigrant–native differences change when contextual attainment—immigrants’ education percentile within origin-country cohort-by-gender distributions—is introduced. Using pooled 2002–2018 National Health Interview Survey data linked to mortality follow-up through 2019, we examine mortality, smoking, and activity limitation among first-generation Asian and Latino adults from China, India, the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. We benchmark immigrants against both native-born non-Hispanic Whites and U.S.-born coethnics and estimate gap compression on the outcome scale. Accounting for contextual attainment attenuates immigrant advantages across outcomes and origins, with larger and more consistent compression under coethnic than White benchmarks; attenuation also persists across duration-of-residence strata. In origin-specific analyses, contextual attainment eliminates the coethnic mortality gap for Chinese immigrants and shifts the coethnic gap toward an immigrant disadvantage for Cuban mortality and Dominican activity limitation. These findings show that origin-relative educational rank captures a measurable component of selectivity and that reference-group choice is consequential for interpreting immigrant–native disparities.",

          "abstract": "Half of the United States’ foreign-born population are renters, yet rental affordability is an understudied dimension of immigrant integration compared to homeownership and other housing outcomes. This is particularly important as immigrants enter an increasingly unaffordable rental market. This study presents the most comprehensive national profile of immigrant rental outcomes in the twenty-first century. By analyzing rental costs and rent burdens, while considering transitions into homeownership over time, this study directly examines the rental housing outcomes of immigrant renters. Overall, immigrants pay higher rents and have higher rent burdens compared to native-born households after controlling for location, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics. The immigrant-native gaps in rent, rent burden, and homeownership reduce over time spent in the U.S., suggesting adjustment to the housing market. New arrivals are most likely to be renters and have higher rents and rent burdens. Supplemental analyses further show the new immigrant housing disadvantage is driven in part by higher housing costs that all recent movers face. As a result, recent immigrants are doubly disadvantaged as a recent mover and as a new arrival to the country.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on collective memory shows that war commemoration shapes political legitimacy, national identity, and moral authority. Yet most research analyzes commemorative narratives while paying limited attention to the events through which memory is enacted. We shift the focus to public war commemoration as an event-based practice that overlaps with contentious politics and social movements: commemorative gatherings are organized, recurrent, symbolically charged, and can function as state-led movements when used to advance government agendas. We ask: Why do autocratic states hold war commemoration events at higher rates in some localities than others? Drawing on scholarship on state-led movements and research on the political consequences of war, we develop two mechanisms. First, similar to other state-mobilized activities, commemorations depend on a regime’s social bases and organizational infrastructures and should be more frequent where such networks are stronger. Second, war studies show that war-affected communities—including veterans, martyrs’ families, and districts with high fatalities—remain politically consequential long after conflict, creating incentives for concentrated commemorative activity. We analyze Iran’s postwar mobilization following the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), a paradigmatic case of prolonged conflict and sustained state-led activism. Using original subnational data on commemoration events, mosque membership, wartime fatalities, and measures of veterans' and martyrs’ families, we test these mechanisms. Negative binomial models show that commemoration is significantly more frequent in districts with stronger conservative support, denser mosque networks, larger student populations, and higher concentrations of war-affected constituencies. These findings show how postwar states transform the residues of war into patterned, state-led mobilization across space.",

Through a comparative analysis of three revolutionary episodes in Iran (2017–2022), each with a distinct trigger, we demonstrate how different triggers shape patterns of contention. Using event-history and spatial regression analysis of subnational protest data alongside socioeconomic and political variables, we show that a fuel price hike activated grievances in oil-producing areas, while a repressive event targeting a woman from an ethnic and religious minority mobilized protests in minority-populated districts. Our findings illustrate how triggers structure revolutionary mobilization, offering broader insights into the interaction between structural conditions and contingent events in contentious politics.",

          "abstract": "Travel time prediction is central to transport geography and planning's accessibility analyses, sustainable transportation infrastructure provision, and active transportation interventions. However, calculating accurate travel times, especially for driving, requires either extensive technical capacity and bespoke data, or resources like the Google Maps API that quickly become prohibitively expensive to analyze thousands or millions of trips necessary for metropolitan-scale analyses. Such obstacles particularly challenge less-resourced researchers, practitioners, and community advocates. This article argues that a middle-ground is needed to provide reasonably accurate travel time predictions without extensive data or computing requirements. It introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naïve travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naïve times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.",

Grounded in a life-course and developmental perspective, this study explores the heterogeneity within a group of Portuguese NEETs with three main objectives: (i) to characterise the psychological functioning of NEETs; (ii) to identify distinct psychological profiles; and (iii) to examine how these profiles relate to other variables with well-being and mental health.\nMethod: A sample of 241 NEETs (18-29 years) from the Porto Metropolitan Area completed standardised measures of stress, quality of life, perceived social support, resilience, and behavioural problems. \nResults: A cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Psychologically Adaptive (34.0%), Moderately Vulnerable (46.5%), and Psychosocially Vulnerable (19.5%). These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors. \nConclusion: Findings support the view that NEETs are not a psychologically homogeneous group, highlighting the cumulative effects of disadvantage and the protective role of psychosocial resources. Unpacking this heterogeneity provides new insights for research and strengthens the design of more tailored, developmentally sensitive interventions and policies.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Abu Sayed Toyon",
          "abstract": "This research aims to determine how universities can better meet the expectations of working students and enhance their persistence. Specifically, it examines which socio-demographic characteristics affect dropout intentions, how perceptions of university social capital relate to these intentions, and which support services students consider most important when integrating academic, professional, and personal responsibilities. The quantitative analysis is based on Eurostudent VII survey data (2018–2021) comprising 1,902 working students in Estonia.",

          "title": "The Hidden Decline of Trust in Science",
          "authors": "Joseph Bulbulia; John R Kerr; Carla Houkamau; Danny Osborne; Marc Wilson; Kumar Yogeeswaran; Chris G Sibley",
          "abstract": "Surveys of trust in science are conducted by scientists, creating a structural selection problem: those who distrust science participate at lower rates. In cross-sectional designs this bias is invisible; in panel studies it appears as differential attrition that inflates apparent trust over time. Using five waves (2019–2024) from a national probability panel in New Zealand (N = 42,681) and multiple imputation to correct attrition bias, we find distributional divergence in trust: after correction, low trust in scientists grows and high trust contracts from 2019 to 2024, a pattern uncorrected data conceal. These findings imply that survey-based estimates of public trust in science are systematically too high, and that the true extent of scientific scepticism in modern democracies is underestimated.",
