          "authors": "Lukas Röseler",
          "abstract": "Preregistrations have been suggested as a tool to prevent p-hacking. Most researchers have used semi-structured preregistration templates to deprive themselves of researchers’ degrees of freedom. I show how such “narrative preregistrations” do not fully prevent p-hacking for even very simple statistical techniques (e.g., correlations) unless the analysis code is part of the preregistration.",

          "abstract": "Background: Data fragmentation and limited interoperability severely challenge the strategic use of public health information, particularly for HIV/AIDS care in Brazil, hindering the comprehensive analysis of the care continuum. Aligning these heterogeneous national datasets with the FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is crucial but faces practical implementation gaps. This study outlines the methodological foundation for developing the Repository of Access to HIV Treatment (ReAcT). Methods: ReAcT was developed using a FAIR-aligned approach to data curation and harmonization. The methodology involved the integration of secondary data from multiple, independent national health information systems, specifically SINAN, SICLOM, SISCEL, SIA, and SIM. The core process consisted of data standardization, quality control, and deterministic or probabilistic record linkage to reconstruct patient trajectories. The entire data pipeline was operationalized using a reproducible, open-source R-language function to ensure analytical precision and consistency. Results: The ReAcT repository successfully consolidated approximately 1.3 million records from these disparate systems, creating a structured, research-ready database. This methodology enabled the structured cross-referencing of information (e.g., linking case notifications with ART initiation and monitoring) at the municipal level, allowing for the identification of patterns suggesting real gaps in care continuity. Conclusion: The ReAcT framework demonstrates the feasibility of building a FAIR-aligned data repository by overcoming data fragmentation, providing a reliable foundation to identify care gaps and support strategic decision-making in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). The proposed methodology is highly scalable to other chronic diseases (such as tuberculosis or diabetes) and is adaptable to similar public health challenges in low- and middle-income country contexts.",

          "title": "AI Cannot Be Reproduced: Medical AI Needs a Culture of Logging, Not Reruns",
          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), including generative AI, are rapidly being adopted for tasks ranging from manuscript drafting to clinical decision support. Yet the evaluation and governance of these systems still rely heavily on a traditional notion of “reproducibility”: if one runs the same procedure under the same conditions, one should obtain the same result. For probabilistic and highly environment-dependent LLMs, bit-identical reruns are neither realistic nor especially useful.\nDrawing on OpenAI’s work on weight-sparse transformers and recent proposals such as MedLog for event-level clinical AI logging, this article argues that medical AI—particularly AI-assisted writing and explanation—should shift its primary evaluative target from strict reproducibility to auditability. In practice, this means designing layered “log cultures” that record how systems were used, with appropriate granularity for different levels of risk. Even if future models achieve substantially higher technical reproducibility, meaningful verification of individual outputs will still depend on access to their provenance: what model, in which version, was run with what inputs and settings, under whose oversight. Journals such as NEJM AI are well positioned to move from merely asking, “Was AI used?” to setting concrete expectations about what must be logged, retained, and, where appropriate, shared. Such standards would guide clinicians, institutions, vendors, and payers in building log practices that make AI use contestable rather than opaque.",

          "title": "Bounded rationality and human development",
          "authors": "Samuel David Jones",
          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

          "authors": "Aidan J Horner; James A. Ainge; Alexander Easton; Simon J James; Jeremy Kendal; John Sutton; Jan Wiener",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation is the ability to purposefully move from one location to another. Central to many theories of navigation is the proposal that we build a ‘cognitive map’ of our external environment. We identify three conceptions of cognitive maps, with a modal view that these maps are mental representations coding for the spatial relations between locations and landmarks in a coherent, long-term, stable manner. Reviewing the literature, we show that many navigation behaviours thought to require a coherent cognitive map can be supported by the interaction of specific navigation strategies with minimal, fragmentary knowledge of the environment. Further, we argue that the range of navigation behaviours, strategies, individual differences, and navigational aids and systems used during navigation point toward representations that are more flexible than the conception of a coherent cognitive map allows. We propose that navigation should be studied as a situated and embodied process where representations are (re)constructed dynamically. The form and complexity of these constructed representations are tightly connected to the dynamic interaction between the navigator, including the strategies and aids they are using, and the environment. We link this proposal to the literature on spatially tuned neurons in the medial temporal lobes, emphasising that the heterogeneity of these functional neurons and their adaptation to changes in environmental structure and navigational goals supports our proposal that cognitive maps are dynamically (re)constructed representations. Therefore, cognitive maps are not relatively coherent, stable representations of spatial environments, but instead are dynamically and flexibly (re)constructed representations of the given navigational moment.",

          "abstract": "Sharp disagreements about social issues have raised concerns about increasing societal polarization in democracies worldwide. While diversity of opinion is vital for democratic engagement and can promote innovative solutions, social science research shows that such disagreements can undermine social cohesion and erode social trust if they turn into identity-based conflicts. The present research examines the potential importance of social norms that promote equality-based respect, dialogue, and unity (inclusivity norms) in mitigating these negative outcomes. In a pre-registered representative survey of 12,041 individuals in twelve European countries, we find that perceived inclusivity norms are associated with increased tolerance, greater willingness to collaborate, and lower tendencies to avoid people who hold opposing opinions. In most countries studied, this pattern holds among respondents who strongly disapprove of the opposing viewpoint, endorse anti-pluralist opinions, hold anti-egalitarian preferences, and identify more strongly with their opinion-based group relative to society. These findings support the potential of inclusivity norms to preserve social trust and cohesion amid opinion diversity.",

          "abstract": "Humans typically move and vocalize in a time-synchronized fashion, aligning prominence-lending hand movements to acoustically emphasized syllables. This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

In the current study, we examined psychometric properties of a German version of the eight-item Commitment to Exercise Scale (CES) with a four-point scale response format.\nMethod: Data of N = 2424 persons with AN and BN who completed the CES among other measures as part of the routine diagnostic assessment at admission to and discharge from inpatient treatment were analyzed based on a preregistered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z2RYW).\nResults: The CES had high internal consistency and a one-factor structure with measurement invariance across age and diagnostic groups. Large correlations with other measures of compulsive exercise supported convergent validity and small-to-moderate correlations with other measures supported divergent validity. Scores on the CES were sensitive to change as they moderately decreased during inpatient treatment, with changes in compulsive exercise being larger in males and persons with AN that in females and persons with BN.\nConclusions: The CES has sound psychometric properties in persons with AN and BN. Given its brevity, it may be favored over lengthier instruments for assessing compulsive exercise in research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic thematic maps impactfully visualize how relevant issues develop over time and space. Yet these information-rich displays require structuring by the viewer for efficient understanding. Drawing on Event Segmentation Theory, two preregistered online experiments (N = 278) examined how animation style (stepwise vs. continuous) and event boundaries influence order and recognition memory for insect-population maps. Across animation styles, temporal order memory showed an asymmetric boundary effect: frame pairs occurring before a global turning point were remembered less accurately than pairs spanning or following the boundary. More frequent segmentation predicted poorer order and recognition memory. Aligning boundaries with the group norm, however, reduced this cost and improved recognition. Continuous animations elicited fewer and less synchronized boundaries but yielded higher recognition accuracy than stepwise animations. \n\nThese findings demonstrate that animation design, through its event structure, influences memory for dynamic maps, with smoother animations tending to better support memory than stepwise displays.",

          "abstract": "Background\nMenopause can be a challenging time for health and wellbeing. Research suggests that autistic people may experience menopause differently to non-autistic people, although no explanatory mechanisms for this have been examined. Using a longitudinal approach, we examined whether menopause representations (i.e. thoughts, beliefs and feelings about menopause) are associated with the severity of menopause symptoms, poorer mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and quality of life over time in autistic and non-autistic people.\n\nMethods\nWe measured menopause representations, menopause symptom severity, quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms using self-report standardised scales in 476 autistic and 425 non-autistic participants aged 40-60 years. We collected data over five consecutive weeks. Using mediation analyses, we examined associations between menopause representations and health and wellbeing outcomes (perceived menopause symptom severity, anxiety, depression and quality of life) across all timepoints. \n\nResults\nAutistic participants reported more severe menopause symptoms, greater anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life, across all timepoints. Sense of control and sense of coherence in relation to menopause, two aspects of menopause representations, were significant predictors of health outcomes over time. Feeling less in control and having a less coherent understanding of menopause mediated relationships between being autistic and increased menopause symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and reduced quality of life, across all timepoints.\n\nConclusion\nFindings suggest that menopause representations partially explain poorer health outcomes in autistic people who are peri- or postmenopausal, and acknowledge that other mechanisms exist through which aspects of being autistic are associated with these poorer outcomes. While further investigation is needed to identify the mechanisms of health inequalities during and after menopause, our findings suggest that feelings of control and coherence are important for wellbeing during menopause, highlighting the importance of appropriate information and support to help autistic individuals navigate this life stage confidently.",

Given cultural differences in self-construal, does culture influence which “foot” individuals put forward in self-presentation? Applicants to a private university in the U.S. wrote essays about themselves as part of their applications. Dictionary-based text analysis was applied to these essays to examine cultural differences in self-presentation. Controlling for gender, intended academic programs, science degree status, and standardized test scores, Asian American applicants (n = 18,001) were more behavioral (e.g., “I do”) and less mentalistic (e.g., “I think/feel”) in their self-framing, used fewer agentic traits (e.g., confidence), and referenced more moral and familial processes than their Euro-American counterparts (n = 30,402); this interdependent model of self-presentation was associated with a higher likelihood of admission. This work calls attention to the cultural shaping of self-presentation in high-stakes evaluative contexts.",

          "abstract": "The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care recommends cognitive and social activities as protective against dementia risk in middle-aged and older adults. However, a lack of conceptual clarity makes it challenging to adequately assess these concepts in research and practice. Currently, a wide variety of measures are used, which complicates cross-study comparison and leads to fragmented evidence about protective effects. Using an integrative review, we analysed definitions across 43 academic and 37 grey records to formulate provisional definitions. We observed substantial heterogeneity in terminology to describe concepts and their attributes. Nine higher-order attributes were identified: interacting with others, cognitive functions, information processing, cognitive demand, novelty, personal control, purpose, quantitative aspects, and context. A main finding was the overlap between cognitive and social activities, as both inherently involve information processing and cognitive functions. Despite the overlap, they also had distinct attributes. Specifically, cognitive activities often involve novelty, while social activities involve interaction with others and often a sense of purpose. The findings indicate that currently available measurements over-rely on assessment of quantitative aspects such as frequency and duration, while neglecting the more subjective attributes such as perceived novelty, autonomy, and purpose. These provisional concepts support the development of measurement instructions and more comprehensive measurement instruments. Better measures allow for pinpointing what makes cognitive and social activities protective and may be useful to determine which participants could improve their activity engagement. This is essential for developing tailored interventions that effectively promote engagement in activities that foster healthy brain aging.",

          "abstract": "As a need state, hunger alters how we evaluate the rewarding perceptual properties of food. Whether this modulation targets specific components of food reward and to what extent it depends on the sensory modality through which food cues are presented remains understudied. This study examined whether hunger selectively modulates wanting versus liking for food, across visual and olfactory cues. Participants (N = 43) rated food, non-food, and disgusting stimuli during fasted and sated sessions, across the dimensions of liking and wanting. Our results show that hunger resulted in stronger increases in wanting for food cues than in liking. Contrary to expectations, this hunger-induced increase in wanting was more pronounced for food pictures than for food odors. Liking and wanting ratings for non-food cues remained unaffected regardless of state, though exploratory analyses suggested heightened wanting for aversive odors during hunger. Overall, our findings demonstrate that hunger selectively modulates motivational rather than hedonic components of reward in a content- and modality-specific manner. Taken together, our study highlights the need to consider both reward components and sensory modality when examining food reward. Systematic manipulation of these factors could enhance our understanding of multisensory reward integration in relation to food intake and provide insights that could inform interventions for maladaptive eating behaviors.",

The FESRS demonstrated strong internal consistency and a confirmed three-factor structure consisting of Sexual Desire, Orgasmic Capacity, and Altered States of Consciousness with significant positive associations between mindfulness and expanded sexual response. The exploratory analysis also showed significant higher scores for the older age groups in the Orgasmic Capacity subscale compared to the younger age group, possibly due to increased body awareness, or reduced performance anxiety.

          "abstract": "Recent studies using the variable choice paradigm for word-association learning task suggest that reward prediction errors (RPEs) enhance one-shot declarative learning. However, these studies may confound true associative learning with an “RPE bias,” where high-RPE items become more salient or fluent and are therefore chosen during recognition. This study tested whether such a bias exists and whether RPEs genuinely strengthen word-pair learning. Across three sessions, participants (N = 48) completed a modified version of the variable choice paradigm in which English-Swahili word pairs were learned under either high-RPE or no-RPE conditions. Results provided moderate evidence against an RPE bias: high-RPE words were not more likely to be selected when incorrect. In contrast, correctness strongly predicted choice, and correct translations associated with high RPEs were moderately more likely to be chosen than correct translations without RPEs, indicating a true learning benefit. Confidence analyses mirrored this pattern, showing clear effects of correctness but inconclusive effects of RPE. Together, these findings demonstrate that RPEs improve associative memory without producing choice biases. Our results validate previous conclusions about RPE-driven declarative learning benefits.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ communication with friends increasingly occurs online. Research on online communication with friends in adolescence has primarily focused on the quantity rather than the quality of interactions, such as feelings of support or rejection. Since offline friend support and rejection affect adolescents’ well- and ill-being, it is essential to understand how these dynamics unfold in online contexts, particularly for adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms, who may be especially sensitive to these experiences. In this preregistered 100 day diary study, 479 adolescents (Mage = 15.98, 54.9% girls; 96.9% Dutch) reported daily on their experiences of online friend support and rejection (cyberostracism), time spent communicating online with friends, and their well- and ill-being. Results showed that time spent communicating online with friends did not relate to adolescents’ well- and ill-being. Online friend support resulted in higher well-being and lower ill-being, while cyberostracism was related to lower well-being and higher ill-being. Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms experienced intensified effects, both positive and negative, suggesting more vulnerability to everyday online social experiences but also increased benefit from online support. Altogether, this underscores the importance for parents and clinicians to foster open conversations to help adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms navigate their digital social world.",

          "authors": "Ong George Ngieng; Lucy Albertella; Ty Hayes; Antonio Verdejo-Garcia; Lukasz Walasek; Elliot Andrew Ludvig; Daniel Bennett",
          "abstract": "A common feature of contemporary sports-betting apps is ‘instant cash-out’, which allows users to settle a bet early in exchange for a discounted immediate payout. Despite high prevalence and links with gambling-related harm, relatively little is known about how personality traits associated with gambling, such as impulsivity, predict instant cash-out usage. To address this question, we recruited 145 general-population adult participants (69 men, 66 women, 10 non-binary or undisclosed; Mage = 36.3, SD = 10.7; participants resided in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, or the USA) to complete five self-report questionnaires related to impulsivity, as well as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and a validated cognitive task measuring individual differences in cash-out frequency. We then assessed how cash-out frequency in the behavioral task was associated with both self-reported impulsivity and PGSI. We found that cash-out frequency was negatively correlated both with PGSI scores and with a number of impulsivity-related traits including Dysfunctional Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, Positive Urgency, Sensation Seeking, and Fun Seeking. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that higher scores on a latent ‘Dysfunctional Impulsivity’ factor were negatively associated with cash-out frequency overall, whereas higher scores on an ‘Inhibition and Inflexibility’ factor predicted higher cash-out frequency specifically for bets with a low win probability. Taken together, results suggest that instant cash-out may primarily appeal to less impulsive people and those with lower PGSI scores. This raises the possibility that instant cash-out may specifically facilitate increased gambling behaviors among people with less prior experience of gambling.",

          "abstract": "Significant advances in the scientific investigation of the neurobiology of consciousness have been slow to be translated into clinical settings, limited by factors of conceptual (e.g., what is consciousness?), methodological (e.g., how to identify reliable indicators of consciousness?), and technical (e.g., how to improve sensitivity and specificity of the technological identification of consciousness?) nature. In the present paper we aim at reducing the gap between research, clinical practice, patients’ and their caregivers’ needs regarding disorders of consciousness. \nBy implementing a multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach, the paper focuses on disorders of consciousness: it starts from the review of some of the most promising measures of consciousness from brain activity (i.e., spectral measures, measures of functional connectivity, complexity-based measures). Next the paper introduces brain responses to illusions as a new indicator of consciousness (i.e., a feature that facilitates the attribution of consciousness), and illustrates the clinical operationalization of the indicators of consciousness through the case of virtual reality. Finally, the paper analyzes a set of urgent ethical issues and describes a model for assessing and dealing with those issues, concluding by elaborating key recommendations for improving the clinical treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness through a better translation of research into clinics.",

          "abstract": "Blue spaces such as coastlines and beaches are linked to psychological well-being, yet regular access to these spaces is often limited. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a way to simulate these environments, and multisensory presentations may enhance their restorative effects. Prior research in a virtual forest setting found evidence for supra-additive effects – where the combined influence of multiple modalities exceeds the sum of their individual effects. This study examined whether a similar effect occurs in a VR coastal scene. Seventy-nine participants experienced one of three five-minute conditions via a head-mounted display: visual-only (360° coastal video), auditory-only (ocean sounds in a neutral room), or combined visual-auditory presentation. Measures of positive and negative affect, affective valence and arousal, and nature connectedness were collected before and after exposure, whereas presence and immersion were assessed only post-intervention. The results reveal that exposure to visual input led to improvements in affective valence and nature connectedness, as well as a reduction in negative affect. The visual-auditory condition outperformed auditory-only exposure but showed no advantage over visual-only, indicating no supra-additive effect. Subjective ratings of beauty, pleasantness, restoration and presence were higher for visual and visual-auditory conditions compared to auditory-only. These findings suggest that in visually rich VR coastal settings, visual cues might dominate restorative outcomes, with limited incremental benefits from matching ocean sounds. The results inform VR nature intervention design, highlighting a potential context-dependent role of multisensory integration.",

This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004 to develop a machine learning (ML)-based predictive model for PD. Our integrated approach revealed that PD risk is influenced by an association of physiological, socioeconomic, and behavioural factors. Key predictive variables included cardiovascular measures (blood pressure patterns, cardiovascular fitness status), weight-related factors (weight at age 25, weight history), pain indicators (low back pain), and socioeconomic determinants (poverty-to-income ratio, education level). The model achieved a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.81, demonstrating robust performance in distinguishing individuals at risk for PD. Our findings revealed associations between basic cardiovascular measures (blood pressure patterns, cardiovascular fitness) and PD risk, alongside socioeconomic and behavioural factors.

          "abstract": "This final chapter takes a broader look at the role of internal and external factors in the statistical analysis of natural language data. The distinction, it will be argued, helps us handle issues that are bound to arise when dealing with observational data. The focus will be on two problems that can arise in corpus-based variationist research: (i) representativeness, that is, the question of whether the sample mirrors the target population on relevant characteristics, and (ii) (multi-)collinearity, that is, a non-negligible level of association between predictor variables. This chapter demonstrates that the internal–external dichotomy allows us to approach these issues in a linguistically informed way. We start by arguing that the two types of factors differ fundamentally as regards questions of representativeness. Then we describe how the dichotomy allows us to deal with collinearity issues in a principled manner, using a model of the causal relations between predictor variables. As we will see, the non-trivial task of outlining such a model is facilitated by the distinction between internal and external predictor variables. The aim of this chapter is to submit a number of broader heuristics that may provide orientation for corpus-based research on language variation and change.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the Researcher-As-Obstacle (RAO) framework, a methodology enabling the study of the creative process as it unfolds. Traditional research in creativity psychology minimizes researcher interference to maintain authenticity, primarily using post-factum interviews. In contrast, the RAO approach situates researchers as “obstacles” within the artist’s creative environment, providing close access to the artist’s “creative engine”, the underlying creative dynamic. Researchers intervene in real-time to capture shifts in pre-reflexive gestures and emerging meaning before they become conscious or verbalized. Drawing from anthropology and psychology, this framework emphasizes the value of researcher presence as a structured obstacle. This approach offers researchers a powerful tool for capturing creative processes in real-time, rarely accessible through traditional methods, by granting artists a finer awareness of their creative dynamics. This awareness can also serve as a valuable resource in art-based contexts.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism is inherently beneficial for communication, yet its extensive benefit on Executive Functions (EFs) has been greatly debated in various studies. It is theorised that mixed contentions of bilingual advantage are brought about by an overgeneralised classification of bilinguals. Thus, the present study will adopt Green and Abutalebi (2013) Adaptive Control Hypothesis in evaluating bilingual advantage across different language contexts; single-language, dual-language, and monolinguals. Participants were 366 undergraduate psychology students who completed a combined Go or no-go arrow Flanker task to measure interference control and selective response inhibition. Then, participants were asked to complete a language questionnaire to determine which language group they belong to. We found no significant difference between language groups in flanker effect (p = .014) and no-go accuracy (p = .007) which signifies no difference in inhibitory control among single-language-context, dual-language-context, and monolinguals. Therefore, the present study rejects the notion of bilingual advantage on EFs. Nevertheless, study results might have been confounded by potential error in language classification and types of scale used to operationalise inhibition. Future research is required to generate further findings.",

Pretenders accurately mimicked broad aspects of genuine play, including the number of guesses required to reach a solution, as well as subtle patterns, such as effects of decision uncertainty on decision time. While peers were unable to detect pretense, statistical analysis and computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in pretenders’ decisions, suggesting a schematic simulation of their minds.

          "abstract": "Everyday navigation requires people to use landmark information online while forming longer-term spatial representations. The present study asked whether attribute amnesia (AA) – a failure to report recently attended, task-relevant features – also occurs during landmark-guided navigation, and how it affects spatial memory. In two experiments (N = 80), participants navigated virtual mazes by following colored arrows at intersections, either on a desktop display (Experiment 1) or in immersive VR (Experiment 2). In an Identity-Test group, surprise identity probes asked for the color of the landmark at critical intersections; a Navigation-Only group performed the same navigation without probes. Across both display formats, navigation accuracy was perfect, yet identity reports on the first surprise trial were at chance and recovered only once testing was anticipated, demonstrating robust AA in a continuous, ecologically embedded navigation task. A second maze without identity tests assessed whether landmark identity was incorporated into longer-term spatial representations via color recall and route reconstruction. Landmark colors were remembered poorly overall, indicating that behaviorally critical identity information was largely excluded from durable spatial representations. Probing landmark identity impaired the consolidation of a complete route scaffold on the desktop but not in VR, where route memory remained intact. These findings show that AA generalizes to navigation and that embodied cues in immersive VR can buffer its costs for route knowledge.",

I call this new interdisciplinary approach ‘autistic linguistic justice’, and introduce five concepts to help initiate research and advocacy on this topic. The concepts I introduce are: the sociolinguistics of securitization, language revitalization, linguistic human rights, language policy and planning, and language ethics. Each concept is briefly introduced, and examples are given of how they can be applied to accommodating autistic communication. In the conclusion, I provide recommendations for how families, practitioners (such as teachers, doctors, etc), autism researchers, and autistic people use these concepts to help build autistic linguistic justice together. Given that many of the concepts I draw on have been developed by other minoritized communities, I emphasize the need for building respectful and mutually beneficial solidarity with these communities.",

Although suicide research and clinical practice often rely on self-report ratings (e.g., “On a scale from 0–10, how strong is your urge to kill yourself right now?”), little is known about how individuals translate internal experiences into numbers. In two longitudinal studies, we used large language models (LLMs) to examine the content and consistency of self-reported suicide urges across numeric severity ratings, between people, and within people over time. Study 1 included adolescents with past-year STBs (N = 158; 1,209 responses) who completed open-ended prompts at baseline and one-month follow-up. Study 2 included young adults with a past-year STBS (Study 2; N = 202; 3,168 responses) who completed parallel prompts at baseline and one-week follow-up. We developed a two-stage topic-modeling pipeline with BERTopic and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct to extract and optimize clinically meaningful themes from participants’ qualitative descriptions of suicidal urges. We identified 13 (Study 1) and 15 (Study 2) topics reflecting the content of suicidal thoughts (e.g., Active Suicidal Ideation, Family/Friends Reactions, Depressed/Exhausted), which varied across severity ratings. Within- and between-person consistency followed a U-shaped pattern, with the highest agreement at endpoints and greater variability and ambiguity in the middle of the scale. Together, our findings revealed remarkable heterogeneity in the interpretation of suicidal urge severity, and highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable method for advancing our understanding of how people interpret and respond to self-report rating scales.",

          "authors": "Jay Joseph",
          "abstract": "The mainstream psychiatry literature contains the ubiquitous and mostly unchallenged claim that schizophrenia is roughly 80% heritable. A 2003 twin study meta-analysis by genetic researchers Patrick F. Sullivan, Kenneth S. Kendler, and Michael C. Neale is often cited in support of this claim. The author argues that the 81% heritability estimate Sullivan and colleagues produced is invalid because (1) schizophrenia twin studies should not be interpreted genetically because they are based on the unsupported assumption that reared-together MZ (identical) and same-sex DZ (fraternal) twin pairs grow up experiencing “equal environments”; (2) especially in the older studies, schizophrenia was not reliably identified (diagnosed) for research purposes; and (3) among other problems, heritability estimates do not indicate the “strength” or “magnitude” of supposed genetic influences. The author then discusses how Sullivan and colleagues performed their meta-analysis and their decisions on which twin studies to include or exclude. They failed to mention three schizophrenia twin studies, two of which were known to at least one of the co-authors. They decided to “relax” their original meta-analysis inclusion criteria because only four studies qualified. This decision led to their inclusion of mid-20th-century studies conducted by researchers with strong genetic confirmation biases, who did not define schizophrenia or make blindfolded diagnoses. The author concludes that Sullivan and colleagues’ 81% schizophrenia heritability estimate should be disregarded in the context of a proposed replication crisis era re-evaluation of behavioral twin studies and their underlying assumptions. More than six decades of failed DNA-based attempts to identify genes that cause schizophrenia support this conclusion.",

The PM decision control (PMDC) model quantifies the dual mechanisms of cognitive control (proactive and reactive, Braver, 2012) that support PM. Here, we test a key prediction of the dual-mechanisms theory: that cognitive control will shift from proactive to reactive as the need for control lessens due to PM targets being infrequent. Participants made lexical decisions (ongoing task) and were presented blocks of trials which either contained no PM targets, a high PM target frequency (19% of trials), or a low PM target frequency (5%). We fit the behavioural data with an extended version of PMDC that was augmented to specify the ongoing-task habituation and PM learning dynamics required to account for the way in which participants adapted their behaviour as a function of task practice and expected PM target frequency. PM costs (ongoing task response slowing in PM conditions relative to no PM target condition) were observed only in the high frequency condition, explained by PMDC by an increase in proactive control. PM accuracy was similar across high and low frequency conditions early in the experiment, but later an advantage emerged for the lower frequency PM task. PMDC accounted for this with stronger reactive control in low frequency condition that increased over practice. Our results confirm the prediction that control shifts from proactive to reactive with lower target event frequency, respond to recent calls from the PM literature for theory to account for across-trial dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has emerged as a promising technology for non-invasive, spatiotemporally precise modulation of human brain activity, offering access to deep structures beyond the reach of electromagnetic methods. Yet, its parameter-effect relationships remain poorly understood, particularly across different anatomical targets. Here, we systematically synthesize human LIFU studies to compare how acoustic parameters—especially pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and duty cycle (DC)—shape neuronal and behavioral neuromodulatory outcomes in cortical versus subcortical regions. Cortical stimulation shows a nonlinear parameter landscape, with facilitation emerging in low-PRF/low-DC and high-PRF/high-DC regimes, and suppression predominating in the intermediate PRF-DC combinations. By contrast, subcortical stimulation exhibits a more monotonic trend along the DC axis: suppression dominates at lower DC across a wide PRF range, while facilitation is largely confined to higher DC regimes. These divergent landscapes delineate clearer parameter boundaries between cortical and subcortical targets. We interpret these target-dependent differences through cellular, cytoarchitectural, network-level, and acoustic mechanisms. Together, these findings sketch emerging principles for a mechanistically grounded parameter framework for human LIFU neuromodulation",

This study compares classical prediction models—probit regression and latent‐variable structural equation models (SEM)—with instrumental‐variable (IV) extensions to examine both prediction and causal inference in the context of a validated risk protocol (RisCanvi) used in Catalonia. Guided by a large automated meta-analysis of over 300,000 publications on violence and recidivism, we selected four core criminogenic domains—antisocial traits, antisocial history and peers, work/social instability, and substance use—and modelled 3-year recidivism in a cohort of individuals assessed with RisCanvi between 2015 and 2023. Classical SEM achieved the highest discrimination (AUC ≈ .74) but poor calibration, whereas probit models were well calibrated but had very low sensitivity. IV-SEM preserved discrimination while substantially increasing the estimated effects of criminogenic needs and achieving the highest sensitivity, at the cost of worse calibration. IV-probit produced calibrated probabilities and modest gains in discrimination over classical probit. These findings illustrate a methodological “division of labour”: classical models provide transparent, well-calibrated risk estimates for routine decisions, while IV-based models offer stronger evidence on which criminogenic needs are true levers for change, informing the design and targeting of interventions and policy in recidivism reduction.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism is known to affect lexical retrieval speed, particularly in second language (L2) production, but its impact on native language (L1) naming remains unclear. We investigated how word-level properties (lexical frequency and cognate status) and individual experience with L2 (AoA, proficiency, use, and immersion history) shape L1 naming. English–French bilinguals were overall slower than English monolinguals, with the largest L1 naming costs being observed for low-frequency non-cognates, consistent with frequency-driven weakening of lexical representations. Exploratory individual-difference analyses revealed that current L2 use (but not L2 AoA, proficiency, or immersion history) predicted L1 slowing. Further, greater L2 use was associated with disproportionate slowing for high-frequency non-cognates. Together, the findings support two complementary mechanisms of bilingual lexical regulation: (a) long-term representational weakening that affects low-frequency, L1-unique words, and (b) short-term inhibition associated with active L2 use that slows highly accessible L1-unique words. These findings indicate that L1 naming costs are not global but emerge from the interplay of lexical characteristics and bilingual language experience.",

Additionally, participants completed several questionnaires capturing theoretically relevant constructs such as motivation, affect, and dispositional factors. We used confirmatory factor analysis to assess correlations between our predictors and mind wandering at the construct level. We found that some factors (e.g., task-based motivation) were significantly correlated in both age groups, while other factors were significant correlates in one age group but not the other. Despite these apparent differences, many of the correlations did not statistically differ across the groups. We did find, however, that the association between behavioral attention lapses and mind wandering was significantly stronger in younger adults compared to older adults. A secondary aim of the current study was to replicate and extend prior work examining the mediating factors in the age-mind wandering relationship. Consistent with prior findings, we showed that motivational and affective factors only partially mediated the relationship between age and mind wandering. Our findings can help inform and refine theories of mind wandering by showing that key predictors of mind wandering are largely consistent across younger and older adults.",

          "abstract": "Humans frequently pursue moving objects that temporarily disappear from view, yet the control strategies underlying successful interception remain debated. While some theories emphasize on-line guidance via optic flow, others propose that interception is maintained through internal models of target motion. We tested a two-stage hybrid control hypothesis in which individuals initially rely on optic flow to guide movement but switch to model-based prediction when visual input is withdrawn. In two immersive virtual reality experiments, participants intercepted a moving target (a bunny or hare) that disappeared partway through its trajectory. In Experiment 1 (N = 18), participants walked to intercept a cartoon bunny under varying path (linear or zigzag) and visibility conditions (fully visible, disappear-reappear, or disappear). Interception performance decreased following disappearance but remained above chance, and curved walking trajectories only emerged when participants began moving before the target appeared, challenging classic optic-flow–based models. In Experiment 2 (N = 41), participants attempted to “shoot” a hare after it disappeared, with visible time and distance factorially manipulated. Capture success increased linearly with visible time but plateaued with visible distance, suggesting that temporal exposure, not spatial extent, determines the quality of predictive control. Together, the findings support a two-stage, effector-invariant interception strategy in which brief visual exposure (~1–1.5 s) seeds a predictive controller that allows action to continue when visual information is lost.",

          "abstract": "Antisemitism, a persistent form of cultural prejudice, is increasingly manifesting in subtle and modernized forms within contemporary society. This study examined how cultural representations of Jews are encoded in large language models (LLMs), which absorb societal discourse through training on vast corpora of human-generated text. To investigate these representations, we developed an indirect methodology: generating character biographies using Jewish and non-Jewish names, removing overt identity markers, and prompting the LLM to evaluate a range of psychological and sociocultural traits. Characters associated with Jewish (vs. non-Jewish) names were consistently rated as more competent, privileged, dominant, self-controlled, future-oriented, hierarchical, and obsessive—and as less likable and less collectivistic. When these trait profiles were mapped onto fictional characters, they aligned with archetypes historically associated with antisemitic tropes. These findings demonstrate how latent stereotypes can persist in AI systems despite explicit bias mitigation, highlighting the adaptability of prejudice and the structural embedding of cultural archetypes in contemporary technologies.",

The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

The theory posits that Asian Americans, more than any other racial group in the United States, are uniquely juxtaposed against Black people both historically and social-cognitively. The racial contrast between Asian and Black Americans serves two interrelated functions: to maintain White supremacy (i.e., the ideology that centers White people and Whiteness as the ideal and unspoken default) and to justify anti-Black racism (i.e., the ideology that Black people and Blackness are inferior). This paper reviews the unique juxtaposing role that Asian Americans play in perpetuating these two ideologies, and it describes how racial contrast theory can synthesize and organize seemingly disparate social psychological theories. By moving beyond the traditional Black-White framework to emphasize the contrasting roles of Asian Americans in perpetuating White supremacy and anti-Black racism, racial contrast theory challenges traditional approaches to intergroup dynamics.",

This chapter explores two frameworks to address these issues: creativity augmentation (CA) and a cyclical ethical framework of AI use. CA emphasizes collaboration between AI's computational strengths and humans' ethical reasoning and contextual understanding to achieve superior creative outcomes. The ethical framework addresses access, representation, algorithmic bias, interpretation, and citizenship divides and advocates for inclusive and equitable AI practices. Two case studies illustrate these frameworks in action: WIse, an AI assistant in architecture, supports innovative designs while addressing ethical challenges and a high school classroom demonstrates how generative AI fosters creativity and ethical awareness among students.

(2022) demonstrated that participants preferred speech samples exhibiting a pronunciation pattern that was associated with a “teacher” over that of a “student” in a simulated language classroom context, indicating that language learners differentially weigh their input based on characteristics of the speaker. We extend this work by investigating whether preferences for the teacher’s pronunciation could be modulated by attributing “favorable” versus “unfavorable” social characteristics to the teacher regarding their teaching experience, teaching effectiveness, and linguistic background. We found that participants still tended to prefer the teacher’s pronunciation, but that this preference was reduced when the teacher had been characterized unfavorably. We thus provide evidence that preferences for speech input from teachers are modulated by beliefs about the social characteristics of the teacher, contributing to our understanding of linguistic stereotyping and its impact on language teaching and learning.",

          "abstract": "Does visuospatial attention influence temporal cognition? In Study 1, we investigated whether gaze direction can modulate different aspects of temporal processing. Participants performed a Mental Time Travel (MTT) task judging the likelihood of past and future life events while their visuospatial attention was oriented by facial gaze cues directed leftward, rightward, or centrally (Experiment 1). To test whether visuospatial attention modulates representation of temporal duration (e.g., age estimation), participants completed an Age Judgment task estimating the age of face stimuli under the same gaze manipulations (Experiment 2). Results showed direction-specific effects in the MTT task: leftward gaze enhanced probability judgments for past events, while rightward gaze enhanced judgments for future events. In the Age Judgment task, gaze systematically biased perceived age, with leftward cues yielding younger estimates and rightward cues yielding older estimates. In Study 2, we tested whether these gaze-related effects require a lateralized bodily stimulus (a face) or reflect a general modulation of visuospatial attention. We used optokinetic stimulation (OKS) to shift visuospatial attention without lateralized bodily cues. OKS produced weaker direction-specific effects on the MTT task compared to gaze, but generated similar biases in the Age Judgment task. These findings indicate that visuospatial attention shapes temporal cognition through partially distinct neurocognitive routes: embodied cues like gaze facilitate self-projection during MTT, whereas body-unrelated manipulations such as OKS are sufficient to modulate temporal estimation along a Mental Time Line. Overall, these results reinforce the view that time is processed within a visuomotor architecture linking space, time, and the body.",

          "abstract": "Striving for social status is a fundamental human motive, yet individuals vary considerably in their status-seeking tendencies. Drawing on attachment literature and life history theory, we propose that attachment anxiety drives status pursuit through heightened intrasexual competition. Across six preregistered studies (N = 4,456) spanning five countries, we found that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicts stronger status strivings. This relationship is mediated by intrasexual competition—competing with same-sex rivals—rather than, as previously documented, by materialism or general competitiveness. Experimental evidence confirmed causality: inducing attachment anxiety (vs. avoidance) increased desire for high-status cars and houses through heightened intrasexual competition. A moderation-of-process design demonstrated that experimentally manipulating intrasexual competition correspondingly enhanced or reduced the effect of attachment anxiety on status strivings, but only for high-status possessions. These effects held for both men and women. Our findings show that anxiously attached individuals pursue status to compensate for relational insecurities, and they do so by competing with same-sex rivals. This research extends attachment theory to status pursuit and clarifies whether, when, and why individual differences in attachment patterns predict people’s status strivings.",

This study aimed to examine the effects of chronic and acute stress and racial discrimination on daily alcohol craving and compare these associations between Black and White young adults. \nDesign. Participants completed baseline assessments followed by a 17-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol.\nSetting. Non-treatment seeking, community sample from Western Pennsylvania, United States\nParticipants. Young adults aged 21-30 (n = 166), who reported at least weekly alcohol use and at least three occasions of consuming 4+/5+ drinks for female/male participants in the past three months. 41.57% of participants identified as Black/African American and 58.43% of participants identified as White; 68.64% were assigned female at birth. \nMeasurements. Baseline assessments included sociodemographic characteristics and measures of chronic stress and racial discrimination. EMA protocol captured acute stress, discrimination, and craving. Linear multilevel models tested main and interactive effects of chronic and acute forms of stress and discrimination on daily craving. \nFindings. Between-person acute stress predicted higher craving (B = 1.25, SE = 0.27, p &lt; .001). Craving also increased within person on high-stress days, particularly among those with greater chronic stress (B = 0.33, SE = 0.15, p = .025). Chronic (B = 0.55, SE = 0.17, p = .001). Within-person acute discrimination (B = 2.21, SE = 0.90, p = .014) predicted higher craving among Black, but not White, participants. This was qualified by a significant three-way interaction showing that for Black participants, higher chronic discrimination weakened the association between within-person acute discrimination and alcohol craving (B = –0.64, SE = 0.28, p = .024).\nConclusion: Chronic stress may enhance the impact of acute stress increasing craving and ultimately alcohol use. Additionally, both chronic and acute discrimination experiences were related to elevated craving. Further research examining domains of chronic and acute stressors beyond general and discrimination is needed given the differential findings and treatment implications.",

We first established that people have graded, systematic judgments about the likelihood of inconceivable events (Experiment 1). We then examined three hypotheses as to how people make such judgments: the likelihood of the event description string (Experiment 2); the ease of a metaphorical interpretation (Experiment 3); and the difficulty of transforming a nonsense statement into a sensible one, as measured by distance in a type hierarchy (Experiment 4). We found that graded judgments of inconceivability are not captured by string likelihood, nor by metaphorizability, but do correspond to a measure of distance in a type hierarchy. Our results suggest that inconceivability is graded, and the perceived likelihood of an inconceivable event may be a product of one's ontology of the world.",

However, the concern (and even support) for deportation is not universally shared among the two largest immigrant groups in the United States. This research examined the extent to which meritocratic ideology predicts stronger support for deportation policies and alleviates deportation fears for oneself and close others among Latino and Asian Americans. Using data from the 2020 and 2024 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Surveys, we found that stauncher meritocratic ideology among both Latino and Asian Americans predicted greater support for deportation policies and less concern about deportation.

          "abstract": "In many real-life situations learning is an active process of engaging with new information, experimenting and integrating new experiences to build meaningful understanding. However, learning can have either a more active or more passive form and several factors may influence how effectively individuals learn  new information in both cases. One such factor is the sense of agency, which refers to the subjective feeling of control over one’s actions, and it distinguishes active experience from passive observation. The present study aims to investigate whether differences in the sense of agency affect learning, as evaluated using the artificial grammar learning task. Participants were assigned to either an active condition, where they had full control over responses, or a passive condition, where they mostly passively observed the computer performing the task and were learning through observation. At the end of the experiment, they rated their perceived control. Results showed that participants in the active condition reported a stronger sense of agency and demonstrated higher accuracy from the very beginning of the task compared to those in the passive condition. Although both groups improved with repeated trials at a similar rate, the initial advantage for the active group persisted throughout the experiment. Overall, our study suggests that sense of agency can influence learning, and that learning is more effective when individuals feel in control of their actions.",

          "abstract": "Extensive research has demonstrated that testing enhances long-term memory by strengthening retrieval processes for the tested memory traces. Such memory models explain why learners benefit from repeated testing but do not account for how learners construct understanding across multiple ideas. In contrast, theories of discourse comprehension emphasize the construction of inferences, whereby learners actively connect ideas into a coherent mental representation. These two perspectives—memory-based retrieval versus inference-based integration—make distinct predictions about what learners retain and understand. The present study tested these predictions by comparing self-testing, self-explanation, and reading strategies on both fact memory and inference performance. In Experiment 1 (n = 254), despite superior retention of individual facts, self-testing produced lower inference performance than self-explanation. Experiment 2 (n = 68), a preregistered replication with a minimum 24-hour delay, confirmed and extended these findings: repeated retrieval improved recall of facts but did not facilitate the assembly of coherent knowledge structures. A mixed-methods analysis revealed that generating inferences during learning specifically predicted inference performance, whereas noting facts predicted fact recall, providing converging evidence that these strategies produce qualitatively different mental representations. Furthermore, participants generated fewer inferences when self-explaining science texts compared with narratives, highlighting domain differences in the ease of knowledge integration. Together, these results demonstrate that while self-testing strengthens memory for discrete information, it fails to foster the integrative processing necessary for comprehension. Effective learning requires more than strengthening retrieval processes—it depends on the active generation of inferences that bind ideas into coherent mental models.",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether behavioural differences are likely the result of preterm birth specifically impacting neural ToM development, as evidenced by differences in brain regions recruited for ToM reasoning (“ToM network”). \n \nMethods \nUsing fMRI and behavioural ToM tasks with five-year-old children born at 24-42 weeks’ GA, we tested for an effect of gestational age (GA) on behavioural ToM performance, functional maturation of the ToM network, response magnitude to ToM movie scenes, and inter-region correlations. Additionally, we leveraged an open dataset and intersubject correlation analyses to measure similarity of neural ToM responses within and across preterm- and term-born children; including younger (3–4-year-old) children via the open dataset enabled testing for evidence of developmental delays among children born preterm. \n\nResults \nBehaviourally, preterm-born children scored lower on our primary behavioural ToM task, and on a measure of receptive language, compared to term-born children. Neurally, ToM network responses during a short movie were similar across preterm- and term-born children. There was no effect of GA on functional maturation or on the response magnitude in ToM regions to two of three ToM scenes. Response magnitude in ToM regions to a third scene was lower among preterm-born children relative to term-born children, but responses to this scene were also low among adults. Both term- and preterm-born children showed functionally distinct ToM network responses. While ToM network responses were more heterogenous among preterm-born children, responses in individual preterm-born children were most similar to (correlated with) same-age term-born children, relative to other preterm-born children or younger (3–4-year-old) term-born children. \n\nConclusions \nPreterm birth does not preclude broadly similar functional development in ToM brain regions by age five years.",

          "abstract": "The internet has become a transformative space for marginalized and stigmatized populations, providing anonymity and a platform for community building. Zoophilic communities, often hidden from mainstream discourse, use online forums to connect, share resources, and seek emotional support. This study examines the so-called hidden population of individuals with zoophile interests, aiming to analyze the psychological needs within these digital environments. Using a mixed-methods design that employed grounded theory in collaboration with an active zoophile forum, 30 narrative interviews were conducted with community members, and 2234 respondents were surveyed online (a subgroup from a larger research project), focusing on their reasons for participating in zoophilia forums. The interview analysis resulted in a code system that was applied to the survey data set using MAXQDA software. The results reveal three main psychological needs that drive participation in zoophilic forums: autonomy (freedom to express one's identity), competence (sharing information and activism), and relatedness (emotional support and community). These needs align with the Self-Determination Theory, which emphasizes how online communities provide a safe space for individuals to satisfy psychological needs that are often unfulfilled offline. The findings reveal that online forums serve as crucial spaces for zoophiles to satisfy fundamental psychological needs, particularly in the face of societal stigma and marginalization. Understanding these dynamics can inform more nuanced approaches to mental health support for this specific group and potentially hidden populations in general.",

In this study, we used a lifeline drawing method, inspired by complex systems theory, to map the life histories and broader developmental contexts of young people with residential living experience. Lifelines of wellbeing were analyzed for distinct dynamic patterns to arrive at a process explanation of how person-environment interactions shape the onset and maintenance of psychological suffering and recovery. Lifeline interviews were conducted with seven adolescents with residential living experience. Each lifeline was segmented and coded for the functioning of the person and their environment. We then sought for dynamic patterns that were repeated within and across cases. The overall line shape showed that youth experienced the majority of their lives as hardship and that their psychological problems worsened over time. While idiosyncratic in content, we found general dynamics (patterns of stability, fluctuations, and diverse change patterns) that could be linked to distinct developmental mechanisms. Fluctuating patterns pointed towards periods of instability (or crisis), during which youth appeared more sensitive to external stressors, and which typically marked the start of recovery. Whereas the worsening of youths’ problems typically occurred fast, recovery was a much slower process which required an autonomy-supported living environment, psychological interventions, and/or changes in youths’ school or living environment. We call for an interaction-based approach to diagnosis and care, in which psychological suffering is understood in the light of a person’s history and developmental context.",

While these methods—such as brain stimulation, pharmaceutical interventions, and gamified brain training—have yet to consistently demonstrate their effectiveness in improving broader cognitive abilities, they are the subject of increasing exploration and application. Understanding who would be willing to enhance their cognitive abilities and why is crucial as these technologies become more popular and accessible in society.\nThus, in two preregistered lab studies, we investigated individuals’ acceptance (i.e. willingness to make use) of various cognitive enhancement methods, tested predictors thereof, and explored individuals’ motives to utilize enhancement methods or be reluctant to do so. \nIn Study 1 (N = 203), we found considerably higher acceptance for more active (i.e. more involved) than passive enhancement methods. Lower age, greater interest in science fiction, and stronger investigative interests (partially) predicted participants’ acceptance of cognitive enhancement, while personality traits, self-assessed and measured intelligence did not.\nIn Study 2 (N = 197), we aimed to (conceptually) replicate key findings from Study 1, and in addition qualitatively assess the motives for the acceptance and rejection of enhancement. Our findings confirmed the higher acceptance of active than passive methods. Additionally, we found that greater interest in science fiction and (partially) higher psychometric intelligence predicted participants’ acceptance of cognitive enhancement, while personality traits and self-assessed intelligence did not. Qualitative analyses provided exploratory insights into the motives for accepting or rejecting active and passive enhancement methods.\nAcross these two studies, our findings indicate that attitudes toward cognitive enhancement are complex and influenced by multiple factors. We emphasize the importance of studying situational factors, such as person-environment fit, to better understand the willingness to make use of cognitive enhancement.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative study explores why adolescent girls prefer confiding in strangers rather than their parents when experiencing mental-health difficulties. Using semi-structured interviews with 20 girls aged 13–21, the study examined how family dynamics and parental neglect shape help-seeking behavior. Participants described experiences of anxiety, emotional distress, trauma-related symptoms, and reliance on maladaptive coping strategies. A dominant theme was the intergenerational pattern of emotional avoidance within families, where mental-health conversations are discouraged or dismissed. Contributing factors included conservative norms, fear of judgment, limited parent–child communication, and low awareness of mental-health resources. The findings indicate that emotional unavailability at home restricts adolescents’ willingness to disclose distress, leading them to seek support from peers, online communities, or strangers. These results highlight the need for family-centered mental-health literacy initiatives and early interventions that promote open dialogue within households.",

          "abstract": "Prejudice and stereotypes are central constructs in social psychology; however, the instruments used to measure them vary in terms of their quality and conceptual clarity. This preregistered systematic review presents the first comprehensive, cross-method synthesis of the psychometric properties and theoretical foundations of measures assessing racial and ethnic prejudice and stereotypes. Following PRISMA and COSMIN guidelines, we screened 13,363 records and included 263 studies published between 1951 and 2024. We evaluated, among other things, reliability, validity, factor structure, measurement invariance, and conceptual alignment across explicit, implicit, and behavioral instruments. Our findings reveal a field that is methodologically diverse but psychometrically fragile. Most measures were developed with U.S. samples, rarely assessed temporal stability, discriminant or predictive validity, and often lack theoretical–empirical coherence. The GRADE synthesis indicated that only 4% of methods achieved high-quality evidence, while the majority showed serious inconsistency and risk of bias. Conceptually, only one-third of studies clearly defined prejudice, and most operationalized it narrowly at the cognitive, individual level, neglecting affective and behavioral dimensions. The review highlights how conceptual ambiguity and inadequate validation threaten the interpretability of decades of prejudice and stereotype research. We recommend greater construct clarity, multimethod integration of explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures, and stronger adoption of transparent research practices. Taken together, these findings call for a new generation of measurement tools that are psychometrically rigorous, theoretically coherent, and culturally sensitive—capable of capturing prejudice as a dynamic, multidimensional phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "Background: Adolescents in Kenya face an escalating mental health burden amid intersecting global and local crises, including political instability, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, previous research has been limited in geographic scope and often overlooks how broader societal stressors beyond school influence adolescent wellbeing. \n\nObjectives: This study examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Kenyan adolescents and investigated associations with exposure to political violence, climate change anxiety, and COVID-19-related stress.\n\nMethods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 5,592 students aged 12–23 years from 42 secondary schools across four Kenyan counties. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Separate cohorts completed measures of climate change anxiety and COVID-19 stress (n=2,856) or exposure to ethnic-political violence (n=2,727). Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and multivariate regression models controlling for age, gender, co-curricular activities, and parental education.\n\nResults: Overall prevalence of clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms (cutoff ≥10) was 27.7% and 23.8%, respectively. Female participants reported higher rates in moderate to severe depression (25.2% vs 20.0%) and anxiety (24.0% vs 19.1%) categories; however, gender differences in reporting may reflect both differential symptom manifestation and greater help-seeking or emotional literacy among girls. Climate change anxiety and COVID-19 stress demonstrated the significant associations (p&lt;.001) with both depression (r=0.31, r=0.19, respectively) and anxiety (r=0.40, r=0.26, respectively). Political violence exposure was widespread, with 52.5% reporting exposure to violent media content and 25% reporting discrimination; however, individual political violence items showed small to moderate correlations with mental health outcomes (r=0.12-0.22). Indirect or second-hand experiences of political violence—such as having a friend or family member affected—were strong predictors of depressive symptoms. Older adolescents and girls consistently reported higher distress across all stressors. Father's education showed protective associations with anxiety, while mother's education demonstrated mixed or positive associations. \n\nConclusions: Kenyan adolescents are contending with multiple, overlapping stressors that compound mental health risks, with climate change and COVID-19 stress appearing as particularly salient contributors. Girls and younger adolescents appear particularly vulnerable. Addressing these challenges requires gender-responsive, school- and community-based interventions that integrate trauma-informed care, climate education, and media literacy, alongside longitudinal research to track the evolving impact of global crises on youth mental health.",

          "abstract": "Vicarious forms of social touch perception include the experience of touch as a third-party observer. Touch observation plays a pivotal role in social cognition, as tactile interactions convey emotional and social information essential for interpersonal understanding. However, research in this domain is hindered by the scarcity of standardised databases and the heterogeneity of experimental controls. To address these limitations, we developed the Socio-Tactile Picture database, which includes positive tactile gestures (Social Touch), along with two control conditions: a Social No-Touch condition (to isolate social interaction effects) and a Non-Social Touch condition (to control for human tactile specificity). The novelty in the database resides in the inclusion of stimuli from the three aforementioned conditions, combined with gender balance achieved through three actor dyads.\nThe database was validated via an online experiment, where participants rated stimuli on valence, arousal, and naturalness across two sessions. Results showed that the database presented good intra-subject and inter-actor consistency. Moreover, social touch pictures were consistently rated as positive in valence, as hypothesised. \nThe database is publicly available to support future research on the perception of observed touch, offering a robust tool for experimental investigations.",

          "abstract": "The psychology of conspiracy theories is built on convenience samples of individuals who mostly reject conspiracy theories. Inference about strong conspiracy believers – who are largely absent from research samples – rests on two generalisability assumptions. The first, interpretation generalisability, assumes a sample’s average level of conspiracy (dis)belief does not significantly alter the theoretical interpretation of relationships. The second, range generalisability, holds that statistical relationships observed among low-to-moderate conspiracy believers are generalisable to stronger believers. Recent work on contradictory conspiracy beliefs shows that these assumptions can be misleading, highlighting the need to reflect on the conditions of generalisations. In the case of interpretation generalisability, we propose that relationships observed among low-to-moderate believers might be better interpreted as capturing differences in plausibility perceptions – because what differentiates people who “neither agree nor disagree” with a conspiracy theory from people who reject it is arguably the fact that they are open to the possibility that it could be true. Such relationships are informative, yet the differences between perceptions of plausibility and factuality (i.e., the sense that a conspiracy is true) should be considered before generalising conclusions to strong believers. As for range generalisability, we argue for a case-by-case evaluation for the possibility that relationships might be non-linear across the full range of agreement scores.",

          "abstract": "Does visuospatial attention influence temporal cognition? In Study 1, we investigated whether gaze direction can modulate different aspects of temporal processing. Participants performed a Mental Time Travel (MTT) task judging the likelihood of past and future life events while their visuospatial attention was oriented by facial gaze cues directed leftward, rightward, or centrally (Experiment 1). To test whether visuospatial attention modulates representation of temporal duration (e.g., age estimation), participants completed an Age Judgment task estimating the age of face stimuli under the same gaze manipulations (Experiment 2). Results showed direction-specific effects in the MTT task: leftward gaze enhanced probability judgments for past events, while rightward gaze enhanced judgments for future events. In the Age Judgment task, gaze systematically biased perceived age, with leftward cues yielding younger estimates and rightward cues yielding older estimates. In Study 2, we tested whether these gaze-related effects require a lateralized bodily stimulus (a face) or reflect a general modulation of visuospatial attention. We used optokinetic stimulation (OKS) to shift visuospatial attention without lateralized bodily cues. OKS produced weaker direction-specific effects on the MTT task compared to gaze, but generated similar biases in the Age Judgment task. These findings indicate that visuospatial attention shapes temporal cognition through partially distinct neurocognitive routes: embodied cues like gaze facilitate self-projection during MTT, whereas body-unrelated manipulations such as OKS are sufficient to modulate temporal estimation along a Mental Time Line. Overall, these results reinforce the view that time is processed within a visuomotor architecture linking space, time, and the body.",

In this context, variations in the contribution of general intelligence (g) to specific cognitive performances have attracted significant interest, yet have not been investigated meta-analytically. The present study provides an examination of moderated g-factor loadings through a two-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of 29 samples from 20 German test standardizations in children and adolescents (N = 42,207). Standardization samples ensured population representativeness, sufficient sample size, and representation of different cognitive tests. Using nonlinear factor analysis, we examined the moderation of g-loadings by age, ability, and their interaction. Subsequent multi-level meta-regressions revealed decreasing g-loadings with increasing ability levels (meta-analytic λ2 = –.046 [95% CI -.064, -.028]). Age moderation effects were inconsistent and nonsignificant (meta-analytic λ3 = .003 [95% CI -.024, .030]). A negative age × ability interaction was present in some samples but not significant meta-analytically (meta-analytic λ4 = –.005 [95% CI -.012, .002]). Moderator analyses indicated that effects differed between test families but rarely between CHC abilities. The results highlight ability level as a key source of differences in the contribution of general intelligence to specific cognitive performances, underscoring the need for conditional reliability estimates in cognitive assessment and for cognitive theories on the nature and development of general intelligence to account for this effect. Age differences in g-factor loadings were less consequential, suggesting limited relevance. The study was funded by the German Research Foundation.

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models. However, existing tutorials often assume prior knowledge and/or experience, often overlooking foundational concepts. To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered.

Yet, this assumption lacks solid empirical support, as research has rarely measured the identity-protective potential of historical events considered important to remember. Theoretically, this support is essential because group members may engage with history for reasons other than benefiting their ingroup. We complement existing literature by systematically testing the identity-protective tenet using a bottom-up approach. After sampling of a broad set of historical events, we assessed the identity-relevant characteristics attributed to the events and examined how these characteristics relate to group members’ willingness to remember them. Across a preregistered study conducted in seven different national contexts (N = 2,045 participants; N = 7,665 ratings of 360 unique events), we found that events viewed as involving the ingroup in an agentic manner were considered important to remember in most countries. At the same time, we observed notable cross-national variation in the willingness to preserve events in which the ingroup caused positive consequences, behaved morally, or experienced threats, with a stronger tendency to remember ingroup-favoring history in less individualistic or less globally connected countries. We discuss how these findings bridge a crucial empirical gap by demonstrating that identity protection likely represents only one component of collective remembrance, whose importance appears to vary considerably across countries.",

Recognizing the lack of instruments that are culturally and linguistically adequate to assess Lebanese children with hearing impairments, the current study aimed at adapting and validating the EARS test battery to the Lebanese Arabic. Design: The adaptation process entailed the necessary linguistic, cultural, and psychometric changes to make the tool relevant for the target population. This was performed through the selection of stimuli representative of Lebanese vocabulary and syntax, consultation with experts in the field, and pilot testing of the adapted tests on a normal-hearing cohort of 2 to 11-year-olds. Then, a cohort of 88 Lebanese-speaking children with prelingual bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and unilateral cochlear implants were assessed using the adapted battery called LEARS. The LEARS includes measures of auditory development, word recognition, sentence understanding and functional auditory integration. Results:  Our results revealed that LEARS reliably evaluates auditory skills and tracks progress in CI recipients, respecting the cultural and linguistic nuances of Lebanese Arabic. Conclusions: The LEARS test battery constitutes a culturally valid and scientifically robust instrument for the assessment of auditory abilities in Lebanese children with cochlear implants, providing clinicians and policymakers with essential insights into auditory development and facilitating informed decisions in clinical, educational, and research contexts. \nKeywords: cochlear implant, audiology, children, auditory perception, LEARS assessment tool, Lebanese Arabic",

We build on data from an online experiment in which participants have to play a word-matching game using nonwords with an artificial co-player. These data show that participants pick up lexical, as opposed to word-level, patterns from training with the co-player and apply these patterns to previously unseen nonwords in subsequent testing. We show that the Minimal Generalisation Learner can capture this shift in participant behaviour if, instead of building new generalisations on the nonwords in the training data, we use these words to update existing generalisations, built on real language data. This result breaks new ground in the use of the Minimal Generalisation Learner in modelling elicitation and learning tasks that go beyond Wug tasks and corpus studies.",

In the experimental study, we replicated the finding of a significant positive correlation between anti‑realism and moral leniency and again observed no significant correlation between relativism and leniency. Our meta‑ethical framing manipulation provided no evidence of a causal link between anti‑realism and moral leniency. Another finding was that CRT scores were unrelated to moral leniency in both studies. Exploratory analyses revealed a moderate negative correlation between free will beliefs and moral leniency in both studies; this finding might help to explore the nature of moral leniency.",

It argues that people (dis)like targets with (dis)similar political views (i.e., value), especially if these views are rare (i.e., expectancy). By reanalyzing data from the American National Election Studies (N = 38,868), the British Election Study (N = 24,522), and nine studies on ratings of societal groups that vary in political views (N = 6,587), we find support for EVIL-P. Expectancy and value interacted to predict people’s attitudes. Moreover, targets with moderate political views were liked most on average, and targets with more extreme political views had more extreme fans and haters. We discuss how EVIL-P contributes to research on affective polarization and helps testing related phenomena.",

We address mathematical inconsistencies in Piaget's structuralism by reconceptualizing groupings as specific groupoids where objects form partial join-semilattices, with reversibility represented as morphism invertibility and compositional operations as lattice operations.  Then, we propose a new line of research program about children’s subjective experience using category theory. Specifically, we propose a line of empirical research comparing children's and adults' subjective experiences through a structure analysis. Our first step of this program has already revealed a counterintuitive discrepancy between children’s color naming abilities and color similarity structures, suggesting fundamental importance in distinguishing subjective experience and reports about it in cognitive developmental research. This category theory based structural approach opens possibilities for unified theories as interconnected categorical domains, potentially enabling prediction of developmental trajectories and identification of critical intervention periods through precise mathematical relationships governing cognitive architecture.",

          "abstract": "The prenatal period is a critical window for the emergence of sensorimotor coordination and early relational processes. Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed stronger temporal structure in true mother–fetus dyads than in bootstrap-shuffled pairings, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

          "authors": "Björn Erik Hommel; Annika Iris Külpmann; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Every month, scores of new measures and constructs enter the behavioral science literature. Researchers struggle to keep an overview of their subfields, let alone the wider field, with an estimated number of allegedly different constructs now exceeding 30,000. Proposing constructs is easy, finding redundancies and overlaps is not. The effort of finding redundancies using participant responses grows quadratically with the number of measures. This cost motivates the use of language models, which can simplify and speed up the process without requiring new data collection. Earlier work employed latent semantic analysis (LSA) to make use of the textual nature of questionnaires in the social and behavioral sciences. LSA's reliance on word co-occurrences, however, can produce misleading similarity estimates that fall short of accuracy and may even reproduce the very jingle-jangle fallacies it aims to detect. Recent advances demonstrate that transformer-based sentence embedding models offer a more viable solution for predicting empirical relatedness between survey items. In the presented work, we use a fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, to introduce the Synthetic Nomological Net, an open-access web application for systematic detection of conceptual overlap. The application indexes over 470,000 items across 74,000 scales from approximately 31,500 instruments in the APA PsycTests database.",

          "abstract": "Background. Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising solution to deliver portable, engaging rehabilitation services, particularly for rural populations with limited access to care. However, its adoption among older adults may be hindered by key barriers, including technological unfamiliarity or concerns about visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Overcoming these initial acceptance barriers is a critical step for implementing this gerontechnology which could deliver physical and mental health support directly to the homes of older adults. \n\nResearch aim. We aimed to determine the feasibility of using brief, low-resource interventions, either an informational handout or a short immersive VR experience, to improve attitudes toward VR in rural older adults. \n\nMethods. In this comparative feasibility study, sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities using hand tracking on a consumer headset. Attitudes toward VR and VIMS symptoms were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys.\n\nResults. The immersive VR experience did not result in a significant increase in VIMS symptoms, demonstrating high tolerability. Both the informational handout group and the VR experience group showed significant positive improvements in attitudes toward VR.\n\nConclusions. Brief, low-resource interventions can increase technology acceptance for VR among rural older adults. The finding that a simple informational handout can be as effective as a hands-on immersive experience has significant, practical implications for the scalable and cost-effective deployment of VR-based technologies in clinical and home-based gerontological settings.",

However, it is unclear whether similar interference effects occur for manual responses. Thirty-two healthy adults (18 – 52 years, 22 female) completed two Stroop variants: Task A measured manual left or right button presses, and Task B measured vocal “left” or “right” responses. Each Task included Pure (100% congruent, or incongruent trials), Mixed (70% congruent/30% incongruent trials), and Baseline (100% arrow-only or 100% word-only trials) blocks. Manual responses were faster to arrows than words, and incongruent arrows further slowed responses to words. Yet, the presence of any word slowed manual responses to arrows. Vocal responses showed a different pattern – faster to words than arrows, and incongruent words slowed responses to arrows, but arrows did not affect word responses. For both tasks, interference effects were stronger when congruent and incongruent trials were interleaved in Mixed blocks. The manual Stroop task is a robust measure of inhibitory control, demonstrating the interaction of two sources of interference: automatic word processing and cross-domain translation between spatial and language representations.",

We completely agree with perspectives that additional within-person research is needed to inform evidence-based treatment planning, and we applaud related efforts focused on understanding personality structure and associations using intensive longitudinal methods. However, we believe that additional within-person research is also needed for social-cognitive measures, in addition to personality measures based on trait models, as most psychometric research on these measures has been cross-sectional and/or at the between-person level. We also hope that research can continue to advance understanding of the significant overlap across personality and social-cognitive models and measures. In addition to highlighting important areas of overlap, we also describe how general assessments of personality and related constructs can provide helpful information, in initial treatment planning phases, especially for screening; strengthening diagnostic formulations; and collaboratively establishing general profiles of client strengths, functioning, and areas of need in a structured manner.",

          "abstract": "Background: Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) provide digital health support that is timely and adaptive: intervention delivery is tailored to rapid changes in internal and external biological and behavioral variables (i.e., “tailoring variables”). JITAIs make decisions on how to tailor support using “decision rules.” Decision rules specify which intervention option should be selected (e.g., whether to send a text-based intervention) based on tailoring variables. JITAI decision rules are typically designed via expert opinion – informed by domain knowledge and statistical analyses of past data – and then kept the same throughout a JITAI’s deployment. \n\nPurpose: A challenge for JITAIs is that decision rules can become stale or outdated due to differences in the recipients of a JITAI from one deployment to the next or due to broader societal shifts (e.g., post-pandemic alterations in behavior). As a result, JITAIs may suffer from reduced effectiveness in deployment. In this paper, we describe how online learning and decision-making algorithms create “personalizing JITAIs” (pJITAIs) to address this gap, enabling within-deployment optimization of decision rules based on streaming data collected during deployment. This streaming data provides up-to-date insights on how relationships between tailoring variables, intervention options, and outcomes may differ.\n \nMethods: We detail key concepts for online learning and decision-making algorithms, unifying two dominant perspectives in JITAI literature: reinforcement learning (RL) and control engineering. \n\nConclusions: Although RL and control engineering approaches have progressed parallelly in the literature, we elucidate the substantial overlap and unify lexicon to streamline the collaborative design of online learning and decision-making algorithms for pJITAIs.",

          "abstract": "Research on static scene perception using simulated scotoma paradigms suggests both central and peripheral vision are sufficient for scene gist perception (Larson &amp; Loschky, 2009), but it is unknown whether this applies to dynamic scenes. This study investigated whether peripheral vision and foveal vision can independently support road hazard detection in dynamic real-world road scenes. Two types of gaze-contingent scotomas were simulated in separate blocks: a peripheral scotoma, where the video was only visible through a central circular aperture, or a central scotoma, in which a gray circle occluded the central visual field. Within a block, the size of the scotoma varied based on a 3-up/1-down staircase to estimate the maximum tolerable scotoma size while maintaining 80% hazard detection accuracy. Echoing the static scene literature, both peripheral and foveal vision are independently sufficient for this dynamic hazard detection task, demonstrating the utility of peripheral vision. Again, in line with data from static scenes, the central scotoma condition required larger visible area than the peripheral scotoma condition. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was found between the two conditions, suggesting individuals’ hazard detection capabilities are generalized across the visual field. Our work broadens current accounts of peripheral vision to time-limited dynamic scenes, demonstrating that drivers can obtain sufficient information from non-foveal input. These results suggest that accounts centered only on where drivers fixate miss key components of the information acquisitive process.",

The aim is to argue that tackling the nature of conscious experiences from the priviledged standpoint of adult (mostly) visual perception is misleading. Instead, I claim, the realy interesting question is : how do we open the doors of bodily sensory experiences at the dawn of our conscious life? How self, body and world perception gets off the ground? Humans rely on high level cognitive abilities to investigate sensory perception, yet bodily sensory perception is present and functional in developing individuals way before we are able to build scientific models of it as adults. Hence we must start with the body, and specifically with the developing body. I then introduce two notions of experience and suggest that this distinction may help us dissipate some of the foggy mystery around the “hard problem” of consciousness.",

Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels. Both perceived moral similarity and PSSA tasks increased IWAH within community, with smaller but similar effects on global IWAH. These findings provide novel insight into causal mechanisms underlying IWAH, with implications for interventions fostering global human identification.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence-driven social chatbots has generated intense debate about their psychological and social implications, particularly for younger generations who are most likely to adopt these technologies. This study presents findings from a comprehensive survey of 534 Italian adults examining attitudes toward and experiences with social chatbots, with a specific focus on the 18-34 age cohort. Results reveal that young adults represent the primary adopter group (51.2% usage rate versus 40.4% for adults 35+), yet their engagement remains predominantly instrumental rather than relational. The majority use chatbots for study assistance (57.6%) and exploration (55.8%), deriving measurable practical benefits in mood improvement and self-confidence without developing significant emotional attachments. Notably, young adults exhibit a distinctive paradox: they are simultaneously more open to emotional communication with AI (mean score 2.39/5 versus 1.95/5 for older adults) yet more concerned about social stigma (3.30/5 versus 2.59/5). These findings challenge dystopian narratives about AI replacing human relationships while highlighting the importance of understanding generational differences in human-AI interaction. The study contributes to the growing literature on social AI by providing empirical evidence from a European context and demonstrating that young adults are adopting these technologies strategically as tools rather than substitutes for human connection.",

          "abstract": "Peripersonal space (PPS) is defined as a sector of space surrounding the body, serving as a sensory-motor system for hand-object interaction. This portion of space, delimited by our skin and the reach of our limbs, is mapped through the integration of multisensory stimuli arising from the body. Although touch is crucial for the multisensory integration processes within PPS, only a few studies have explored the distinct contributions of the sensory system’s dual pathways. These are represented by large myelinated Aβ nerves enabling fast discriminative touch and C-Tactile unmyelinated fibers involved in the low-pressure, slow, caress-like tactile stimulation. To overcome these lacks, we carried out three experiments in which participants underwent audio-tactile tasks, each designed to assess PPS processing under different tactile conditions. In Experiment 1 (Classic Task), we estimated PPS through the traditional task in which participants responded to discriminative tactile stimuli at different temporal delays while ignoring looming sounds. In Experiments 2 (Discriminative Task), we adapted the Classic Task by using an auditory cue as a target stimulus, while administering the discriminative tactile stimulation. This allowed us to assess PPS boundaries by reversing the sensory modality of the target stimulus, with no difference found between Classic and Discriminative Tasks. In Experiment 3 (Affective Task), we used the same protocol as in Experiment 2 applying affective touch. Results showed that PPS boundaries in the Affective Task were significantly larger than both Classic and Discriminative Tasks, suggesting the unique role of caress-like touch in shaping body-space representation.",

          "abstract": "The decoy effect is a classic example of irrational decision making, where adding an inferior third option (the decoy) shifts preference toward a similar, superior option (the target) over an otherwise equally attractive competitor. Although robust, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain debated. Evidence from decision science suggests people make multi-option choices through pairwise comparisons: they first compare two options, then pit the winner against the remaining option. However, theories disagree on which comparison sequence produces the decoy effect. One account argues the effect only emerges when people first compare the competitor and decoy, because the target then needs to win only one comparison instead of two. In contrast, evidence from attention research suggests people compare the target and decoy first because of their similarity. We propose a mechanism that reconciles these accounts. Our framework assumes that the act of choosing increases the subjective value of the option that wins the first comparison and that individuals differ in the magnitude of this boost. Through simulations, we showed that when this increase is small, the decoy effect emerges only when the competitor and decoy are compared first, but when it is large, it emerges only when the target and decoy are compared first. We tested this prediction in a preregistered sequential-choice version of the decoy paradigm and found that first comparisons influenced target selection differently across individuals. Behavioral results and computational modeling confirmed that participants with larger value increases showed stronger decoy effects when the target and decoy were compared first. This work proposes that choice-induced value changes provide a unifying mechanism that accounts for existing theoretical contradictions and explains individual differences in the decoy effect.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Using qualitative content analysis, we analyzed open-ended responses from N = 626 German citizens (ages 14-65) on how Germany should engage with the Nazi past. Applying latent class analysis to the content-coded responses, we identified three response classes: those advocating for continued remembrance, those rejecting remembrance and showing ingroup-defensive tendencies, and those supporting remembrance while still engaging in defensive responses, such as relativizing German crimes or attributing them to coercion. We discuss how particularly the finding of the third, ambivalent class extends existing literature on identity protection and collective remembrance by reflecting a commitment to confronting the ingroup’s atrocities, a practice highly endorsed in the country, without fully acknowledging responsibility. Situated beyond the binary of either endorsing remembrance or disengaging from ingroup wrongdoing, this class highlights the complexity of remembrance desires within a society navigating the legacy of mass atrocities.",

          "abstract": "Under the theory of memory reconsolidation, memory reactivation induces a temporary window of destabilisation during which memories become malleable. Behavioural reconsolidation interference has been proposed as a method for weakening maladaptive emotional and pain-related memories; however, evidence for its efficacy remains mixed. In this study, participants (N = 51) completed a three-day reconsolidation interference paradigm. On Day 1, they underwent a pain conditioning procedure in which visual cues (conditioned stimulus; CS) were paired with moderately painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus; US). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Reactivation + Working Memory (R+WM), Reactivation Only (RO), or Working Memory Task Only (WMO). An adaptive emotional n-back task served as the WM interference, which consisted of negatively valenced word stimuli. On Day 3, all participants underwent extinction learning. Learning was assessed via explicit expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCR). On Day 1, conditioning produced robust discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues in both expectancy ratings and SCR amplitudes. Overall, expectancy ratings declined from conditioning to extinction, but this did not differ across groups. Similarly, SCR amplitudes decreased over time during extinction, consistent with CS-US unpairing, but with no group differences. These findings suggest that WM interference following reactivation does not impact later pain recall or extinction. This contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of behavioural reconsolidation interference. The null effects observed here underscore the need to clarify the so-called boundary conditions of reconsolidation and better understand neural mechanisms underlying pain memory and learning.",

          "abstract": "Across the cognitive sciences, researchers have studied theory of mind (making sense of other people’s behaviors in terms of their mental states, or ‘naive psychology’) and physical reasoning (making sense of physical events in terms of their underlying mechanics and dynamics, or ‘naive physics’), as two separate processes. In this Perspective, we describe two ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience that provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind that articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together. We propose that from early in human development people navigate the social world by using two distinct but interacting systems for reasoning about other agents’ ethereal minds and their physical bodies.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for identity development, often accompanied by identity distress. Simultaneously, adolescents are also preoccupied with presenting themselves as positive as possible on social media, which may reflect and reinforce identity distress. Yet, the dynamic associations between adolescents’ identity distress and positive online self-presentations remain unexplored. Accordingly, this three-wave panel study among adolescents from Belgium, France, and Slovenia (N = 1697; Mage = 15.14, SDage = 1.78, 57.2% girls) used Latent Class Growth Analysis to identify distinct co-trajectories of identity distress and positive online self-presentation in the domains of friendship and appearance over one year. The findings showed that identity distress and positive self-presentations can follow maladaptive, adaptive, or stable co-trajectories over time, depending on the identity domain, adolescents’ demographic and social media use characteristics. In doing so, the study provides novel evidence on the heterogeneous co-development of adolescents’ identity distress and online self-presentation.",

          "abstract": "Research has long been interested in cognitive complaints as indicators of cognitive performance limitations. While longitudinal studies suggest that an active lifestyle and emotional well-being may be beneficial for cognitive function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent work emphasizes momentary assessments for capturing everyday cognitive functioning. In this ten-day experience-sampling study, 325 university students completed thrice-daily surveys on stress, mood, social, cognitive and physical activities, subjective memory lapses, and performed a working memory task. Memory lapses and working memory performance were unrelated at both between- and within-person levels. Memory lapses were more likely during periods of increased activity, worse mood, and higher stress. Participants engaging in more cognitive activities reported more memory lapses. Higher average physical activity and increased momentary social activity were associated with lower working memory performance. Daily memory lapses in university students appear primarily driven by current affective states and activity levels rather than cognitive performance limitations. These results advance our understanding of cognitive processes in young adults and highlight different time scales in cognitive functioning.",

Previous research indicates that nose-tip temperature increases with parasympathetic activation, whereas periorbital temperature reflects sympathetic arousal. However, facial thermal fluctuations during resting state have not yet been systematically investigated, which represents the aim of the present study. \n Here we examined the relationship between regional facial temperature - measured from nose-tip and periorbital regions using functional infrared thermal imaging - and cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed by high-frequency (HF) power and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV). Analyses included (i) grand-average correlations to identify overarching physiological patterns, (ii) within-subject correlations to explore the strength of individual-level associations, and (iii) between-subject correlations to examine inter-individual variability of the cardiac and thermal signals. \nAcross 32 participants during a 13.5-min resting-state session, HF power showed a positive association with nose-tip and a negative association with periorbital temperature, whereas RMSSD showed weaker effects. A differential temperature index (nose-tip minus periorbital) was the most robust correlate of HF power.  These findings suggest that facial thermal dynamics mirror vagal modulation at rest and that the differential index converging the information from different facial areas may provide a sensitive, contactless indicator of autonomic activity.",

This review examines and integrates empirical work across scales, from large-scale network dynamics to fine-grained neuronal mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. We synthesize findings from existing frameworks, including the Entropic Brain Hypothesis and Dendritic Integration Theory, which explain changes in brain connectivity, dynamics, and neuronal integration under anesthesia. However, neither framework fully addresses how agency and subjectivity may become dissociated. To bridge this gap, we review Irruption Theory (IT) as an emerging conceptual and methodological approach that may offer a novel lens for interpreting measurable changes in neural signals, encouraging further empirical research to distinguish the neural signatures of agency and subjectivity.",

Traditional detection methods fail because they target low-effort humans while AI produces high-effort patterns. Economic incentives are powerful, and the threat recursive: AI-mediated responses become training data for models that mediate future responses, creating feedback loops toward model-shaped consensus.

          "abstract": "The feeling of togetherness, which we understand as creating something larger than oneself with others, often emerges in creative, open-ended interactions, such as dancing or making music. We ask what states of mind are associated with this felt togetherness and what interactional skills can be used to foster it. To investigate this, in this study, we record eight short dance improvisation duets in controlled conditions. Video recordings are used as prompts for in-depth interviews with dancers involved and with expert dance improvisation teachers. Based on the interviews, we portray togetherness as a state of mindful attunement to one’s partner, with a focus on building a relational unity. This form of unity goes beyond typical dialogue dynamics rooted in turn-taking. We associate togetherness with moments in dance when dancers’ attention is focused on the process happening “in between” individuals, and they feel that the “dance dances itself”. To achieve this state, dancers use deliberate strategies, such as shifting attention focus to peripheral vision, adjusting the speed of their actions, and expanding the field of trust. Our results show that, if theories of social cognition are to be congruent with human experience, they should explain both individual- and collective-level processes.",

          "abstract": "Planning is an expensive computational operation that easily exhausts our cognitive resources. For this reason, it is critical to learn strategies to initiate planning wisely. Although recent advances have shown where and how planning should be engaged to aid adaptive behavior, little is known about when planning should be engaged. Here, we investigate how individuals choose to engage or delay planning. For this purpose, we developed a task where, at certain decision points in a multistep decision problem, it is optimal to delay planning and relinquish control because all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two studies, we show that humans can optimally delay planning and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. In doing so, we demonstrate that meta-policies to engage or delay planning are not simply learned from experienced outcomes, rather, they are constructed by searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can optimally delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

In this perspective, we propose ten strategies to improve the many-analysts methodology. The proposed strategies were build based on insights from past projects and our own experience as team leaders and are organized around six themes: (1) moving many-analysts projects beyond merely exposing analytic variability; (2) creating structured opportunities for participating teams to share their insights; (3) recognizing analytical quality and expertise; (4) uncovering sources of variability through meta-regression and complementary methods; (5) addressing epistemic uncertainty on a smaller scale; and (6) developing comprehensive models of uncertainty. To showcase their practical application, we illustrate these strategies using data from the Many-Analysts Religion Project.",

A PRISMA-compliant systematic review was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of 4177 resultant articles, 61 were included (46 on group level outcomes and 15 on individual differences). The most common specialties were internal medicine (15, 24.6%), emergency medicine (11, 18.0%), and psychiatry (5, 8.2%). Studies provided evidence for the existence of hindsight bias, anchoring, framing effect, outcome bias, and availability bias. Prevalence varied by bias. Of five studies examining how cognitive biases affected physician diagnosis, 4 (80.0%) found a negative effect. Interventions to reduce the impact of cognitive biases were limited. Individual differences in susceptibility to cognitive biases may relate to length of experience, similarity to previous cases, and case complexity. This systematic review of studies of moderate quality and with moderate risk of bias indicated cognitive biases are prevalent in physicians and often negatively impact decision-making.",

We explore this in terms of LLM information-processing dynamics, which are structurally oriented toward minimizing uncertainty and maintaining coherence. This model offers an alternative framework for both humans and LLMs that compliments the current moral reasoning approach. In addition, the model makes new predictions on how LLMs should be trained to avoid this problem.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

In Study 1 (N = 310), women with higher levels of AMCYS and greater cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 393) replicated these results and also examined the effect of cyber-sexual violence victimization through the lens of objectification theory. Results showed that women with higher AMCYS scores and more cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and body shame, as well as lower self-esteem and body appreciation. Importantly, these relationships occurred through the indirect effect of body surveillance (self-objectification). Both studies indicated that AMCYS play an exacerbating role in the emotional impacts reported by women who have experienced more frequently cyber-sexual violence, while also highlighting the framework of objectification theory in understanding these results. These findings can be useful to develop interventions and prevention campaigns against cyber-sexual violence.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behavior. They appear to document a continuous practice of mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex markings such as cross-hatchings. Previous work examining the cognitive implications of these changes concluded that the engravings were likely used as decorations and may have served as group identity markers but not as denotational symbols. To inform discussions of the emergence of symbolic behavior, we conducted a two-part experimental study inspired by these engravings and based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements. Part 1 combined a delayed reproduction task with a transmission chain design to simulate an enduring mark-making practice. Eleven transmission chains were seeded with four drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings and reproduced over eight generations. Transmission chain drawings showed a tendency to become increasingly regular, organized, and symmetric. Part 2 subjected a sample of the transmission chain drawings to a suite of psychophysical experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the accumulated structural changes. We found that the drawings became easier to discriminate, looked more like they had been intentionally made, and became easier to remember and reproduce, but there was no evidence of a systematic change in saliency or stylistic properties. Finally, we compared the results from the transmission chains with a similar analysis of the drawings derived from the original engravings. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the experimental drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlighting the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behavior. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analyzing trajectories of early symbolic behavior.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder) is a body-focused repetitive behaviour characterised by the recurrent and compulsive pulling of one’s own hair, where both the act of pulling and the visible consequences of hair loss cause distress and impairment. Shame has been identified as central to adult hairpulling, increasing the urge to pull and reinforcing the cycle of behaviour. Yet little is known about how adolescents experience this emotion, despite adolescence being the typical point of onset of trichotillomania and a developmental period marked by heightened sensitivity to shame. Hence, the present study explored how adolescents with problematic hairpulling experience, navigate and make sense of shame.\n\nDesign: A qualitative methodology was employed. \n\nMethod: Twelve adolescents with problematic hair-pulling aged 16–19 participated in online semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\n\nResults: An overarching theme of “There’s something wrong with me” – The Stigmatised Self captured how experiences of pervasive stigma were internalised as shame, permeating participant’s inner lives and social worlds. Under this, five themes were generated: The Flawed Self; The Scrutinised Self; The Misunderstood Self; The Isolated Self; and The Disempowered Self.  Shame was experienced as an enduring, identity-shaping emotion that triggered, maintained, and exacerbated hairpulling. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend our understanding by positioning shame as a central process in adolescent hairpulling and highlight the developmental vulnerability of this age group. Clinically, the results underscore the need for interventions that target shame, and for family and social contexts to be addressed alongside behavioural symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced a rapid increase in fame due to their versatile capabilities, including document processing, image generation, and even providing psychological support. Autonomous agents—defined as entities such as robots or LLMs that perceive and respond to environmental stimuli—are increasingly integrated into human teams. These agents are capable of interacting and collaborating with both humans and other autonomous systems to solve problems and achieve shared objectives. As human reliance on autonomous agents grows, understanding the mechanisms of trust becomes critical, given its central role in team effectiveness.\nThis study investigates two dimensions of trust in autonomous agents: a cognitive component, uncertainty communication, and an affective component, anthropomorphized language. It was hypothesized that both communicating uncertainty and anthropomorphized language would contribute to trusting the LLM. A total of 606 participants were recruited via the online platform PanelClix. Participants viewed video scenarios depicting a first responder interacting with a Chatbot that employed either anthropomorphized or machine-like language. Additionally, participants were exposed to varying levels of reliability information: no reliability cue, a numerical reliability estimate (approximately 75% certainty), or a colour-coded reliability indicator (dark blue for ~75% certainty, light blue for 25% certainty).\nThe findings revealed that neither anthropomorphized language nor uncertainty communication significantly influenced trust in the Chatbot. However, trust was positively associated with perceived intelligence, general propensity to trust artificial intelligence, and perceived liveliness of the Chatbot. These results suggest that both cognitive and affective factors contribute to the development of trust in autonomous agents, albeit in more nuanced ways than initially hypothesized. Implications and future directions are discussed in the concluding section.",

Specifically, we examined the ‘liberalizing’ potential of cognitive control processes (i.e., the ability to regulate thoughts, emotions, and actions in accordance with one’s prespecified plans and goals), and we advanced the hypothesis that the RWA-prejudice association is curbed among those high in cognitive control. Two experimental studies (total N = 876) provided only weak support for our key hypothesis. In Study 1 (a university student sample), we found that proactive (but not reactive) control moderated the RWA-explicit prejudice association, such that this relationship was reduced to insignificance among those high in proactive control. By contrast, in Study 2 (an online panel sample), no significant RWA x cognitive control interactions emerged for any of the operationalizations of cognitive control. In addition, we did not observe any cognitive control moderation effects on the RWA-implicit prejudice link across both studies. Taken together, our findings cast reasonable doubt on the liberalizing potential of cognitive control, while at the same time they provide further support for the robustness of the RWA-prejudice association.",

Access to treatment for adolescents presents an additional challenge. Effective, practical, and targeted treatments are urgently needed. To achieve this, we must identify key mechanisms of adolescent depression and develop interventions that address them directly.\n\nGrowing evidence highlights reward function as a key mechanism in adolescent depression. At the same time, research suggests that Behavioural Activation (BA), with its emphasis on reward-focused behavioural changes, may be an effective treatment for adolescents with depression. To integrate these lines of research, we used a narrative approach to synthesise cross-disciplinary literature on reward function and BA in adolescent depression.\n\nThis review found encouraging evidence for the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of BA in adolescents. BA also shows potential for those with co-occurring autism or anxiety. However, the mechanisms through which BA works in adolescence are still unknown, and questions remain on its optimal delivery. Further research is needed to clarify how reward function influences both adolescent depression and response to BA, as well as how adolescents themselves wish to engage with BA therapy.",

          "abstract": "The current research aims to understand the nature and directionality of self-valence relationships.  While separate literatures have documented advantages in perception and cognition for information associated with the self and information of positive valence, gaps remain in understanding the relationship between these effects. Across three experiments combining evaluative priming and shape-label matching tasks, the current research examined whether intrinsic self-positivity and self-negativity are underpinned by bidirectional expectations between self and emotional information.  Results revealed asymmetric bidirectional relationship: positive emotion primes inhibited stranger-related target processing, enhancing self-bias magnitudes (Experiment 1a), whilst self-primes facilitated positive emotion targets, enhancing positivity-biases (Experiment 2). Critically, no interactions emerged with negativity (Experiment 1b). These findings suggest that intrinsic self-positivity is maintained through facilitatory self-positive interactions and inhibitory other-positive interactions, with the dominant mechanism depending on relationship directionality. This distinction indicated that whilst the self solely leads to the expectation of positivity, positivity is associated with the self and extended self (i.e., friend). The theoretical and practical applications of these results are discussed.",

This article argues that the answer depends on four interrelated aspects developed in the text: ethical and legal requirements for the use of tests and permissions, the tension between open science and intellectual property, regional regulatory frameworks, and the licensing and availability conditions of specific instruments. Based on international guidelines, regional regulations and examples of public domain, open licensed and commercial tests, we distinguish between simply administering an instrument, reproducing its protected content and creating derivative works such as translations or adaptations. We show that, in non-commercial academic contexts, administering lawfully acquired or openly licensed tests usually does not require additional permission, as long as items, keys and manuals are not reproduced or altered. In contrast, copying item banks, publishing reagents, adapting instruments without authorization or disseminating content from proprietary kits and neuropsychological batteries generally requires explicit permission. The article closes with practical recommendations and a checklist to guide responsible decisions.",

          "abstract": "In perception experiments, researchers often collect multiple perceptual judgements from the same stimuli and participants to answer their research questions. While the way in which perceptual judgements are collected may affect the data, research rarely considers task design when investigating this topic. In our experiment, we investigated how two frequently used ways of collecting multiple ratings for affect perceptual judgements, focusing on first impressions of faces. One participant group provided ratings of seven person characteristics (e.g. femininity, youthfulness, trustworthiness) blocked by characteristic, rating faces for one person characteristic at a time, across seven blocks. Another participant group completed one block in which they rated all seven characteristics simultaneously via a list of rating scales. The listed presentation format reduced task duration by 22%, but affected the perceptual ratings in several ways, pointing to reduced data quality. Inter-rater agreement was lower for some person characteristics (youthfulness, femininity, and trustworthiness) in the listed format. Variance in ratings was also reduced for youthfulness, femininity, and dominance, with ratings clustering closer to the middle of the scale. Importantly, correlations between different person characteristics became universally positive in the listed format, indicating reduced independence of judgments. These findings highlight that while presenting multiple judgements at the same time may offer efficiency, this approach can introduce systematic biases and potentially reduce the reliability of perceptual data. We therefore suggest using a blocked presentation format and consider how these trade-offs would impact experiments looking at multiple perceptual judgements collected from the same participants.",

We show how these concepts improve polysemy and synonymy issues, and together constitute a useful set of descriptive tools for the associationist framework. As they allow more transparent articulation of results and theories concerned with associations in both biological and artificial systems, they facilitate comparison of findings from different fields.

Hungry participants were more likely look at and subsequently select tasty over healthy food items, while attention and choice remained unaffected in the non-food tasks. Cognitive modelling indicated that hunger state selectively affected attention-driven evidence accumulation processes in the food choice task.

This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation.\n\nKeywords: free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience",

The SIS measures seven aspects of smartphone use, capturing both positive (e.g., task support) and negative (e.g., loss of control) behaviors. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the seven-factor structure identified in the Italian version. Measurement invariance (MI) and construct validity were evaluated across three linguistic groups: Italian (n = 739), English (n = 1,078), and French (n = 2,045). MI analyses demonstrated that the SIS subscales met criteria for configural, metric, and full or partial scalar invariance across languages and gender. The results also indicated good construct validity. Overall, the SIS is a psychometrically sound tool for assessing the impact of smartphoneuse across languages and can be used in cross-cultural research to examine smartphone behaviors in diverse populations. We found lattent differences in use across cultures and gender suggesting a nuanced impact of smartphone use.",

It has an explicit cross-domain scope and has had considerable impact in the learning sciences. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been applied in research on instructed second language (L2) learning. This is notable because, although L2 research is sometimes siloed within the learning sciences, it has undergone a cognitive turn emphasizing domain-general learning mechanisms.\nWe propose that a KLI-informed cognitive view on instructed L2 learning helps to systematically integrate the field into the learning sciences, encompassing not only domain-general learning mechanisms but also domain-general perspectives on knowledge and instruction. Importantly, this integration may generate novel, testable hypotheses in L2 research, grounded in an interdisciplinary understanding of knowledge, learning, and instruction.\nWe present a cognitive KLI-based perspective on instructed L2 learning and discuss challenges of this perspective, including the fundamentally integrative nature of language knowledge, the inherently expressive character of language (verbal, written, signed), and the limited relevance of understanding and sense-making processes in instructed L2 learning. Moreover, we provide an illustrative KLI-informed analysis of two empirical L2 studies. Based on these analyses, we discuss novel, testable hypotheses generated through the KLI lens that offer interdisciplinary approaches to known issues in L2 pedagogy, such as integrating multiple induction- and refinement-enhancing instructional principles to mitigate individual differences in L2 classrooms.",

Maladaptive personality traits may further exacerbate loneliness.

Loneliness (βmomentary = 0.51; βdaily = 0.67) was higher when participants were alone, yet only the presence of close others (e.g., friends)—not weaker ties (e.g., classmates)—reduced loneliness (β = –0.39 to –0.62). Interestingly, youth who were alone more frequently did not report higher overall loneliness. Maladaptive personality traits were associated with higher (βmomentary = 0.32; βend-of-day = 0.40) and more variable (βmomentary = 0.31; βend-of-day = 0.34) loneliness but amplified the effect of being alone on loneliness only on the between-person level (β = –1.13). Detachment and Negative Affect showed unique patterns. Exploratory analyses indicated that social satisfaction partially mediated the association (β = 0.50). These findings underscore the importance of both structural and qualitative aspects of social environments, as well as personality-related vulnerabilities, to better understand loneliness-dynamics in youth.",

We argue that this view obscures a fundamental division within English causative verbs. Building on Rose et al. (2021), we show that a substantial subset of causatives – thick causatives such as burn, melt, break, bury – encode information about the way a change is brought about, and that this specification yields systematic semantic and pragmatic restrictions. Thick causatives in their physical sense resist subjects that denote absences, facts, degrees, or events that fail to instantiate the appropriate productive (force- transmitting) mechanism, in contrast to thin causatives like kill, destroy, and change, which readily combine with such subjects. Using corpus evidence from a representative sample of 37 frequent English causatives, we demonstrate (i) that most thick causatives pattern like Embick’s 2009 break-causatives – compatible with strong adjectival resultatives and requiring production-based causation – while (ii) some thick causatives (e.g., bury) encode the relevant manner information via the state they lexicalize rather than via an event predicate. We develop a pragmatic competition account linking the production constraint to the directness constraint, yielding a unified explanation for the distribution of thick vs. thin causatives in English.",

As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

Research has rarely examined predictors within a unified theoretical framework and has yet to explore autism traits in a neurotypical sample. We address this gap by applying the Direct and Indirect Effects of Text (DIET) model to investigate predictors of inferential narrative comprehension in 113 neurotypical Australian children aged 4-8 years. We assessed foundational cognitive (non-verbal intelligence), oral language (vocabulary, grammar), and social-cognitive skills (theory of mind and autism traits) as predictors of inferential narrative comprehension. Analysis using hierarchical regression found chronological age, vocabulary, and grammar predicted significant variance in inferential comprehension. Theory of mind and autism traits correlated with inferential narrative comprehension but did not explain unique variance beyond existing DIET predictors. Findings support the DIET model’s emphasis on foundational oral language skills and highlight the importance of including age in future models. Findings contribute novel evidence from an Australian context and underscore the need for further research into social-cognitive influences on inferential comprehension. Implications include the potential for early identification of children at risk for comprehension difficulties and the need for further longitudinal and intervention research to clarify developmental pathways.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a cross-disciplinary model for understanding the organization of the psychological system, offering a structure for the dynamic terrain of consciousness and adaptation that underlies human experience. Through the lens of an auto-ethnographical study rooted in Whole Body Knowing, the work draws upon Internal Family Systems (IFS), structural dissociation, somatic therapies, and complex-systems theory, it proposes a metaphysical home for the constellation of parts that make up the psyche. This home takes shape in the Cohesion Network Topology (CONEKT) model which details the fabric of an internal living landscape governed by laws of energy, form, and adaptation, thereby contributing a missing layer of richness and insight to psychological systems of meaning, regulation, and transformation. This knowledge is crucial to conceptualizing and realizing internal systems change in practice. The model integrates metaphors from physics (gravitational fields), ecology (resilience and phase-shifts), and physiology (homeostasis and self-healing) to illuminate how systems of consciousness naturally reorganize following trauma and again, towards healing.",

          "authors": "Natalie Bleijlevens; Tanya Behne",
          "abstract": "When children learn novel words, referential ambiguity is a constant challenge. However, despite facing this uncertainty, children acquire their vocabulary with remarkable ease. One possible key to their success might be that children use active learning strategies and employ their developing metacognitive skills. To test this idea, we assessed whether 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers (and adults) are aware of their own uncertainty during referent identification, and to what extent they can effectively use this information to guide their learning process. Participants encountered a series of labeling events that varied in referential ambiguity: from minimal (e.g., hearing a familiar label), to medium (hearing a novel label in presence of a familiar and a novel object, resolvable via mutual exclusivity), to maximal (hearing a novel label in presence of two novel objects). Following this, they received counterevidence to their initial word-object-mappings and decided which mappings (learned in more vs. less ambiguous contexts) to update. Results revealed three key findings: First, both children’s and adults’ explicit and implicit uncertainty increased with the amount of referential ambiguity. Second, when confronted with uncertainty, children spontaneously aimed to resolve this by seeking additional information. Third, while adults preferentially updated words learned in higher ambiguity, children instead tended to revise information that was learned less recently, leaving open questions about whether and how contextual uncertainty shapes their updating strategies. The pattern of results provides insights into the skills and mechanisms that enable children to learn correct word meanings under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research highlights reward probability (i.e., access to and pleasure derived from environmental reward) as a potential explanatory factor in posttraumatic stress (PTS). This study examined the explanatory utility of reward probability for PTS severity and specific symptom clusters while controlling for depression. In a cross-sectional design, 428 undergraduates completed the DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the Reward Probability Index (RPI) subscales: Reward Probability (RPI-RP) and Environmental Suppression (RPI-ES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested three models: (1) associations between RPI subscales and PTSD symptom clusters (Intrusion, Avoidance [AAR], Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood [NACM], Hyperarousal); (2) the same model controlling for depression; and (3) exploratory indirect pathways from RPI-RP/ES to PTSD clusters via depression. All SEMs demonstrated robust psychometric structure. In Model 1, RPI-RP was positively associated with Intrusion and negatively with NACM, whereas RPI-ES was negatively associated with all clusters. In Model 2, controlling for depression, RPI-RP remained positively associated with Intrusion and AAR, while its association with NACM became nonsignificant; RPI-ES remained negatively associated with all clusters. Depression was positively associated with all clusters except AAR. In Model 3, depression partially accounted for the association of RPI-ES on all PTSD clusters and of RPI-RP on Intrusion, and fully accounted for the associations between RPI-RP and NACM/AAR. Findings support the utility of the RPI, specifically the RPI-ES subscale, in understanding PTS symptom severity beyond depression. Further research is needed to clarify the ambiguous associations between RPI-RP and PTS symptoms.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War has led to a deterioration in the psychological well-being of residents of Ukraine as well as populations in neighboring and more distant countries. The present study aimed to assess mental health and the effectiveness of stress-coping strategies during the 34th month of the ongoing conflict. The sample consisted of 2,962 residents from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using an online panel survey. The findings indicate that the highest levels of stress-related disorders, anxiety, and depression were observed in Poland, whereas the lowest levels were found in the Czech Republic. Across all countries, respondents most frequently adopted problem-focused coping strategies, while emotion-focused strategies were used less often. Linear regression analyses showed that younger age, lower perceived quality of life, and emotion-focused coping strategies were the strongest predictors of mental health disorders. Among Polish respondents, problem-focused strategies were associated with reduced psychological distress. Overall, the results suggest that the Russo-Ukrainian War has had a negative impact on mental health in Central and Eastern Europe. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring by health services and the development of effective interventions to support the psychological well-being of populations living near Ukraine.\nKeywords: mental health, distress, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, Central and Eastern Europe.",

Circularity of respiratory data particularly affects the problem of multiple comparisons in phase-related inferential statistics.

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides significant benefits but also risks psychological overdependence, termed AI addiction (AIA). Understanding the mechanisms underlying this emerging form of addiction is thus essential. Anchored in the Interaction of Person–Affect–Cognition–Execution (I-PACE) model, we conceptualize general attitudes toward AI (GAAI) as “person-level” dispositions and the sense of agency (SoA) as the “cognitive-affective” response that mediates AIA. Study 1 (NSample 1 = 500; NSample 2 = 896) adapted and validated a concise Chinese General Attitudes toward AI Scale, confirming a stable two-factor structure with good reliability. Study 2 (N = 780) applied this scale to a parallel mediation model linking GAAI to AIA via positive (SoPA) and negative (SoNA) facets of SoA. Results revealed that positive attitudes towards AI (GAAIP) indirectly mitigated addiction by enhancing SoPA and reducing SoNA, whereas negative attitudes towards AI (GAAIN) positively associated with GAA through diminishing SoPA and increasing SoNA. These findings extend the application of the I-PACE framework in the AI field, by demonstrating the association between GAAI and AIA, and the mediating role of SoA. Our findings also have the potential to guide the development of cognitive or attitudinal interventions for AIA.",

          "authors": "Issei Ichimiya; Hiroko Ichimiya",
          "abstract": "Background. Dichotic listening, in which different sounds are simultaneously presented to each ear, can evoke perceptual phenomena that are not noted during monaural or diotic listening. A well-known example is the scale illusion, in which listeners perceive coherent melodic streams that vary from the actual auditory input. This illusion underscores the interaction between pitch proximity-based grouping and laterality cues. However, the original scale illusion is complex, which makes it challenging to isolate specific perceptual mechanisms. Previously, we introduced simplified tonal sequences that allowed for a clearer evaluation of how pitch proximity and laterality interact. This study explores two questions: (1) to what extent pitch proximity-based grouping dominates over laterality in dichotic listening and (2) whether dichotic presentation decreases the perception of roughness, an unpleasant auditory sensation caused by overlapping frequencies.\n\nMethods. This study included 20 adults with normal hearing (eight men and 12 women; mean age: 35.6 years). In Experiment 1, participants listened to pairs of tone sequences (dichotic and diotic) and chose the one in which an ascending scale was perceived more clearly. In Experiment 2, the participants determined the tone pairs that sounded rougher. The two dichotic tone sequences were named 2S and 2J, respectively. The 2S consisted of the C major scale with ascending tones presented to the right ear, whereas the pitch of the simultaneously presented tones to the left ear was two whole tones lower. Furthermore, 2J was created by swapping every other tone between the right and left ears in 2S. The diotic versions included one in which the tones from the right and left channels of 2S were mixed in both ears (DO) and one in which the tones of the right channel of 2S were heard from both ears (S).\n\nResults. In Experiment 1, the participants most clearly perceived the diotic version S. Regarding dichotic tonal sequences, no considerable differences were observed in perception between 2S and 2J. In the diotic version of the DO, pitch perception varied across individuals. In Experiment 2, the DO was rated as substantially rougher than in all other conditions, including 2S and 2J.\n\nConclusion. Our results showed two perceptual benefits of dichotic listening in individuals with normal hearing. First, dichotic listening supports the perception of coherent melodic patterns, with pitch proximity dominating the location of the sound input. Second, the dichotic presentation considerably reduced roughness, likely owing to the separation of frequency processing in the cochlea of each ear. Despite being a preliminary investigation, this study underscores the potential of dichotic listening to improve auditory clarity and comfort.",

          "abstract": "Striving for social status is a fundamental human motive, yet individuals vary considerably in their status-seeking tendencies. Drawing on attachment literature and life history theory, we propose that attachment anxiety drives status pursuit through heightened intrasexual competition. Across six preregistered studies (N = 4,456) spanning five countries, we found that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicts stronger status strivings. This relationship is mediated by intrasexual competition—competing with same-sex rivals—rather than, as previously documented, by materialism or general competitiveness. Experimental evidence confirmed causality: inducing attachment anxiety (vs. avoidance) increased desire for high-status cars and houses through heightened intrasexual competition. A moderation-of-process design demonstrated that experimentally manipulating intrasexual competition correspondingly enhanced or reduced the effect of attachment anxiety on status strivings, but only for high-status possessions. These effects held for both men and women. Our findings show that anxiously attached individuals pursue status to compensate for relational insecurities, and they do so by competing with same-sex rivals. This research extends attachment theory to status pursuit and clarifies whether, when, and why individual differences in attachment patterns predict people’s status strivings.",

According to previous research, people are not only poor at detecting deepfakes but also often overestimate their detection ability, highlighting the need for effective interventions. Despite this, evidence on how to improve deepfake detection and calibrate metacognitive judgments remains limited. In this preregistered 2 x 2 experiment, we examined the effects of an educational infographic, cognitive load, and their interaction on deepfake detection accuracy and metacognitive overestimation (absolute and relative). We also investigated age, cognitive reflection, and general trust as potential moderators. A total of 229 participants were randomly assigned to infographic versus control conditions and high versus low cognitive load conditions, viewed 12 political videos (deepfakes and authentic videos), and rated videos’ authenticity and their perceived performance. The results showed that participants exposed to the infographic showed higher detection accuracy and more accurate relative performance judgments, whereas cognitive load did not produce significant main effects. An interaction suggested that the infographic’s metacognitive benefits weakened under higher load, although this finding requires caution due to an inconclusive manipulation check. None of the individual differences moderated the findings. Lastly, participants slightly underestimated their absolute performance but considerably overestimated their relative standing, with the lowest performers showing the strongest overconfidence. Overall, the results suggest that concise and engaging guidance, such as infographics, can enhance deepfake detection and promote more calibrated self-assessments, providing a scalable tool for strengthening resilience to synthetic media.",

          "abstract": "Humans excel at leveraging relational knowledge (e.g., relative features or locations) to facilitate object processing. This knowledge is thought to emerge gradually through associative learning over the course of experience. While extensive research has shown how experience shapes attentional biases toward non-social regularities, far less is known about whether the learning of social relationships – the most consequential form of relational knowledge for humans – tunes attention toward social entities. Across four experiments (N = 144), we examined this question by training participants to associate face pairs with either interacting (face-to-face) or non-interacting (back-to-back) configurations. In a subsequent cueing task, direct-gaze face pairs from interacting configurations captured attention more strongly than those from non-interacting configurations, an effect abolished for upside-down faces. This bias persisted even when individual faces from learned dyads were tested in isolation. In contrast, this bias did not occur for arrows, ruling out domain-general cueing, and for animal faces, even when training promoted identity-level processing, indicating its specificity to human faces. Our findings demonstrate that social relationships can be internalized through experience as emergent attributes of face representations, highlighting a key role of social learning in shaping attention to social information.",

Study 1 (n = 1099) revealed that stronger orthographic imagery correlates with heightened between-cluster semantic associations and reduced semantic conformity to group norms, suggesting a role in generating novel conceptual links. Study 2 (n = 875) linked orthographic imagery to lower sensory processing sensitivity, suggesting its function as a top-down sensory filter. Unexpectedly, Study 3 (n = 487) found that visual imagery—not orthographic—predicted reduced engagement with reading apps, suggesting a cognitive-mismatch effect. These results position orthographic imagery as a unique mechanism that expands semantic networks while attenuating sensory influx, with implications for creativity research and clinical interventions for sensory hypersensitivity.",

          "abstract": "The tendency to overweight low probability events and underweight high probability events stems from the categorical distinction between ``not happening,'' ``a chance,'' and ``happening.'' We demonstrate that there exist multiple intermediary categories within the probability space that produce additional inflection points. Across preregistered studies, sensitivity jumps when probabilities cross these boundaries. With numeric probabilities, left-digit changes amplify certainty equivalents (Study 1) and shift risky choices in incentive-aligned gambles (Study 2). With visual probabilities, pie-chart partitions at halves and quarters have the same effect (Study 3). Hierarchical CPT fits reveal systematically negative residuals at boundary-crossing pairs, and a reanalysis of Wu &amp; Gonzalez (1996) exhibits the same signature (Study 4). Thus, probability weighting is not smooth between 0 and 1—it is punctuated by context-dependent inflection points that distort the space. Recognizing these format-specific categories clarifies when behavior shifts and offers actionable guidance for judgment and decision-making theory.",

Bullying victimization has been categorized as an adverse childhood experience (ACE) by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Studies examining the long-term impact of repeated bully victimizations have found that victimization in childhood and adolescence leads to poor mental health outcomes such as anxiety disorders later in the life course (Carlisle and Rofes, 2007; Copeland et al., 2013; Stapinski et al., 2014).  Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this association across categories of sex and race/ethnicity despite documented differences in reported rates of general anxiety disorder. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, the present study explores the relationship between childhood bullying victimization and generalized anxiety disorder in middle adulthood. The results suggest the impact of experiencing repeated bully victimizations in childhood and adolescence had a positive association with general anxiety disorder and this association was general across categories of sex and race/ethnicity. The policy and theoretical impacts of our work will be discussed.",

          "abstract": "Parental incarceration is a significant issue that impacts millions of children in the United States,\nleading to adverse effects on their behavioral, educational, and psychological well-being. Despite\ngrowing self-reports on the stigma faced by children of incarcerated parents, little is known\nabout the biases held by their peers, particularly among university students. This study\ninvestigates bias against classmates experiencing parental incarceration and examines how these\nbiases vary based on the severity of the crime committed by the parent (violent vs. non-violent\nvs. non-incarcerated absent parent) and the parental role (mother vs. father). A sample of\nuniversity students (ages 18-25) was recruited from the University of Maryland’s SONA system\nand randomly assigned to read one of six vignettes describing a hypothetical classmate whose\nparent (mother or father) was either incarcerated for a violent crime, incarcerated for a non-\nviolent crime, or not incarcerated but absent for unspecified reasons. Participants then completed\nmeasures assessing their biases toward their classmates. Results revealed that students exhibited\nsignificantly greater bias toward classmates with a parent incarcerated for a violent crime\ncompared to those with an absent but non-incarcerated parent. However, no significant\ndifferences in bias were found against classmates regarding their parent’s role (father or mother).\nThese findings highlight the potential stigma associated with parental incarceration in higher\neducation settings and emphasize the need for further research that explores the differences in\nbias across race and different family structures (such as a two-parent household vs an\nincarcerated parent). Further research, along with this study, will help inform advocacy and\nawareness efforts in educational institutions, as well as guide the implementation of the best\nsupports for children of incarcerated parents.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making models of memory retrieval hold that across-trial variability in memory representations and within-trial variability in matching the contents of memory to the retrieval cue both contribute to variability in the speed and accuracy of retrieval decisions. In contrast, most recent studies of visual working memory (VWM) using continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, do not distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability in characterizing retrieval errors and are silent on decision times. We combined a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM), with a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution of memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution, to characterize the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions about the hues of saturated and desaturated color patches in four experiments that varied the difficulty of the decision task and the memory load of the VWM task. The CDM provided a good account of the marginal and joint distributions of response times and response errors and the anisotropies of stimuli in different parts of the color space across all experiments. VWM precision followed either an inverse square-root law or power law in set size, depending on saturation, as predicted by sample-size and attention-weighted sample-size models, respectively. The results support a model in which the capacity limits of VWM reflect the statistical properties of a population of noisy neurons that are divided among items in memory under attentional control and determine the precision of recalled items.",

          "abstract": "Scale-free temporal structure in resting-state intrinsic neural activity has been proposed to support the interaction between internal and external cognition, but its role in decision making remains unclear. We examined whether individual differences in the dynamics of resting-state alpha activity are related to how much people rely on externally reinforced options versus internally generated preferences during free choice. Participants first performed an externally guided reward-learning task, in which they learned through feedback which abstract shapes tended to yield rewards. They then completed an internally guided preference-judgment task, repeatedly choosing between these previously rewarded shapes and new shapes without feedback. Resting-state electroencephalography was recorded before, between, and after the two tasks. A computational model provided trial-by-trial estimates of stimulus value in preference-judgment task, and long-range temporal correlations in the alpha-band amplitude envelope were quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis. We replicated the superiority of intrinsically learned value: the most preferred new shape acquired a higher final value than the previously rewarded shapes, despite their higher initial values derived from external reinforcement. Stronger scale-free temporal correlations in resting-state alpha activity were associated with a larger superiority of intrinsically learned value, primarily reflecting lower final values for previously rewarded stimuli and relatively higher values distributed across multiple intrinsically learned options. These findings suggest that scale-free temporal dynamics in resting-state alpha activity reflect an intrinsic neural bias that favours internally generated preferences over extrinsically reinforced values in free choice.",

          "abstract": "Humans are capable of remarkably flexible moral judgment. Yet societies rely on rigid rules—obligations and prohibitions that apply categorically, even when case-by-case reasoning could yield better outcomes. Why would a species capable of such flexibility bind itself to inflexible rules? We propose that rigid rules arise as social technologies for managing ambiguity around noncooperation. People often have legitimate reasons for failing to cooperate, yet those reasons are typically opaque to observers, allowing opportunists to disguise selfishness as justified hardship. We formalize this idea with an evolutionary game-theoretic model. Two cooperative equilibria emerge: a flexible norm that accommodates legitimate excuses but is vulnerable to exploitation, and a rigid norm that closes this loophole by mandating cooperation even when inefficient. Comparing these equilibria reveals an efficiency–robustness trade-off: flexibility maximizes welfare when trust is secure, whereas rigidity preserves cooperation when trust is fragile. This explains why rigid rules prevail in low-trust settings—interactions with strangers, formal institutions, or tight societies—where flexibility is more common in high-trust contexts.",

          "authors": "Sarah Horan Kerns",
          "abstract": "The modularity of cognitive processes has been debated for centuries, with neuroscientists investigating specialized face processing mechanisms for over 50 years. Behavioral studies, neuroimaging evidence, and face-specific deficits have provided support for dedicated face processing mechanisms. However, practical constraints have limited neuropsychological tests to only a few object categories, restricting clear dissociations between impaired face perception and intact object perception. Leveraging participants with prosopometamorphopsia(PMO), a condition characterized by conscious distortions in face shape, features, texture, and color, we address this limitation through three contributions. First, we develop a comprehensive perceptual assessment containing over 500 object categories to provide an unprecedented test of face-specificity claims. Second, we document face-specifi c distortions in two PMO individuals, offering compelling evidence for dedicated face-processing mechanisms. Third, we attempt to isolate drivers of object distortions in PMO individuals, such as symmetry and ovoid shape processing, providing clues to the broader organization of human visual processing systems. Five PMO participants completed our task, revealing distinct response patterns. Three participants reported distortions to both faces (43%, 77%, and 90%, respectively) and objects (2.9%, 3.5%, and 25.6%, respectively), with greater face distortion frequency predicting greater object distortion frequency. However, two participants (A.S. and Aurora) exhibited perfect face-specificity with distortions of 100% of face images and zero object images. The clear dissociations between face and object perception in these two cases within the unprecedented breadth of object categories examined, provide compelling evidence for face-specific processing mechanisms. Further exploration found that although distortion-provoking objects were dissimilar to faces in several compared dimensions, they frequently contained ovoid shapes, suggesting non-face-specific PMO involves general shape processing mechanisms. In sum, our results develop a strong test of face-specificity, elucidate the existence of face-specific mechanisms in a context of unprecedented breadth of tested objects, and offer potential insights into human visual processing more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAnhedonia, defined as a reduced capacity for pleasure or motivation for reward, is a core transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology and a key determinant of social functioning. Cognitive dysfunction, particularly verbal memory impairment, may contribute to anhedonia by reducing anticipatory pleasure, in turn decreasing social functioning. This study examined whether anhedonia mediates the relationship between verbal memory and social functioning in a large, population-based sample, and whether this pathway varies by sex, lifetime psychiatric history, or transdiagnostic symptom dimensions.\nMethods\nParticipants (N=8,576) were drawn from the UK Biobank. Verbal memory was assessed using the Paired Associate Learning test, anhedonia by frequency of disinterest/little pleasure, and social functioning by frequency of social visits. Participants with and without lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were matched on age, sex, and Townsend Deprivation Index. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses tested indirect effects of verbal memory on social functioning through anhedonia and the role of sex, lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, and Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) symptom dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, psychosis).\nResults\nAnhedonia significantly mediated the association between verbal memory and social functioning (indirect effect = 0.0024, p &lt; 0.001), whereas the alternative model (verbal memory as moderator) was not significant. The mediation was stronger among males, individuals with psychiatric diagnoses, and those with internalizing symptoms.\nConclusions\nFindings support a transdiagnostic cognitive-symptom-function pathway linking verbal memory deficits to poorer social functioning through anhedonia. These results highlight memory-focused cognitive interventions as potential targets to enhance motivation and social outcomes across dimensional and transdiagnostic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Pairing a conditioned stimulus (CS) repeatedly with aversive imagery as unconditioned stimulus (US) induces conditioned subjective and autonomic fear responses which can explain fears without prior aversive experiences. To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences.",

          "authors": "Terje Sparby; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "Meditation, in particular advanced meditation, develops toward meditative endpoints (MEND), sometimes referred to metaphorically as awakening, enlightenment or salvation. A well-known instance of such an endpoint is called nibbāna (Pali) or nirvana (Sanskrit). Contemporary mindfulness teachers and diverse Buddhist traditions present differing views of nirvana. Some define nirvana as the ultimate reality beyond awareness, while others define it as liberated or pure awareness itself. Some descriptions of nirvana focus on the cessation of various mental phenomena (and particularly the cessation, or end, of suffering) and others based on affirmations (e.g., ultimate happiness). Nirvana has also been defined as ineffable, or as paradoxical (e.g., as neither existence nor non-existence). These, and other, different views and descriptions of nirvana make it challenging to understand this construct, and to establish a science of advanced meditation including meditative endpoints (MEND). Here, we propose an integrated taxonomy that unifies the different views and descriptions. It differentiates between ways of MEND entry, MEND events, and persistent MEND. The proposed taxonomy hence provides a unified view, a framework for differentiating and relating distinct approaches to MEND in the sense of nirvana, and a starting point for investigating MEND beyond the case of nirvana.",

          "authors": "Nang Lisa Longphai",
          "abstract": "Working objectification, defined as treating workers as mere objects and means to a purpose instead of individuals with ideas, feelings, and moral rights, still exists as a major challenge in many modern organisations despite numerous interventions including participatory work design, managerial training, well-being program, and ethical technology redesign efforts to alleviate the challenge. Empirical and theoretical data suggests that these interventions often fail to produce long-term change (Carmeli, Brueller, &amp; Dutton, 2010; Loughnan, Haslam, Murnane, Vaes, &amp; Suitner, 2010). This commentary seeks to argue that working objectification persists because interventions merely target surface-level symptoms of workers like stress or satisfaction instead of addressing the underlying cultural and structural causes rooted in organisational systems that make working objectification a prevalent practice in modern organisations. A fundamental shift in organisational values is required to make an effective intervention addressing the challenge. Such a shift is only possible if human dignity is elevated to the top of the organisational value hierarchy which views workers as human beings with autonomy and emotional needs, not as objects and tools for productivity. However, several gaps exist in the current research on working objectification. One of these gaps is that of a comprehensive study of interventions by modern organisations to address the issue of working objectification, their impact, and implications for developing focused interventions. This research gap points towards an ample scope for future research on one of the less researched areas, which, however, must include longitudinal and cross-sectional studies on working objectification.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Trait mindfulness—one’s disposition toward non-judgmental awareness of present-moment experience—has been associated with various affective and cognitive outcomes. One proposed mechanism is that this kind of mindfulness attenuates the tendency to become attached to some experiences and avoid others. In line with this, a previous study reported that trait mindfulness reduced the development of affective preferences for letter strings that, unbeknownst to participants (n=18), followed a specific grammatical structure (Whitmarsh et al., 2013). If robust, this finding would confirm that trait mindfulness reduces implicit affective biases. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate this main finding with a much larger sample size (n=127) and also explored whether prior meditation experience influenced implicit preference formation.\nMethods. Trait mindfulness was measured in 127 participants using the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, 2011). Over five days, participants were exposed to strings of apparently random letters, some of which conformed to an artificial grammar. They reproduced these strings in a working memory task and later rated whether they liked them, providing an index of implicit preference.\nResults. We replicated basic artificial grammar learning effects but found no association between trait mindfulness and implicit preference development. Meditation experience similarly showed no effect on preference formation.\nConclusion. In this preregistered study, we did not replicate the previously reported effect of trait mindfulness on implicit preferences with our larger sample and improved design. Preference development may be too automatic to be modulated by mindfulness. Alternative explanations are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Does selection history reshape attentional priority along the depth axis as it does in the image plane? Across three immersive virtual-reality visual-search experiments (total N=65), we tested whether observers implicitly learn depth-based regularities and exploit them to guide attention. Participants searched for an oriented target among distractors distributed across stereoscopically defined planes while target probability was manipulated between the depth planes. In Experiment 1 (N=37), with two eligible frequent target planes (near vs. far; 80/20 between subjects), responses were reliably faster when the target appeared on the frequent plane, regardless of whether it was near or far. In Experiment 2 (N=15), when all three planes were eligible and the target probability was concentrated at the fixation-aligned middle plane (10–80–10), no benefit emerged for the frequent plane. Experiment 3 (N=13) reinstated a between-subjects 80–10–10 probability distribution across all three planes: robust prioritization reappeared when the frequent plane was near or far, but again failed when it coincided with the middle plane. Together, the findings show that statistical learning can reweight plane-level priority in three dimensions, yet fixation depth constitutes a boundary condition where probabilistic biases do not accrue. A two-stage account is proposed consisting of plane-level gating followed by within-plane selection. This account reconciles the results with planar contextual-cueing findings and informs VR interface design.",

Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure consisting of Avoidance of Discussion and Expression and Negative Thoughts toward Parents. Internal consistency, as assessed by McDonald’s omega (ω = .81–.90), and test-retest reliability, as indicated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = .74–.84), were satisfactory. The PCAS-KJ subscales showed significant small-to-moderate positive correlations with measures of acculturation discrepancy, depression, anxiety, social isolation, and cognitive fusion, thereby supporting convergent validity. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of the PCAS-KJ on the relationship between acculturation discrepancy and depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that adding the PCAS-KJ to experiential avoidance (EA) and acculturation discrepancy significantly improved the prediction of depression and social isolation. These findings suggest that the PCAS-KJ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing EA specifically related to parent-child communication among youths of Korean descent in Japan.",

          "abstract": "Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can paradoxically precipitate suicidality, agitation, and behavioral disinhibition in 2-5% of patients, particularly during the first two weeks of treatment. Current explanations—notably \"activation theory\"—fail to account for observed temporal patterns, demographic vulnerabilities, and patient phenomenology.\n\nMethods: We conducted systematic literature review (N=188 sources) combined with computational pattern mining using large language models to identify convergent evidence across pharmacological, phenomenological, demographic, and temporal domains.\n\nResults: Five patterns emerged consistently: (1) precise temporal clustering in days 4-14 post-initiation; (2) demographic vulnerabilities (youth, women, trauma survivors, low SES, social isolation, first-time users) independent of depression severity; (3) phenomenology emphasizing identity disruption and disorientation rather than energization; (4) comorbidity patterns involving identity-disturbed conditions (BPD, PTSD, OCD); and (5) identical 10-14 day response timelines across all antidepressants and placebo.\n\nInterpretation: We propose the \"identity disruption\" framework: SSRIs produce rapid neurobiological changes that alter patients' experiential substrate before cognitive/identity adjustment can occur. For patients whose identity is organized around symptoms SSRIs target, this creates acute ontological crisis. Risk factors reflect diminished capacity for identity navigation, not depression severity.\n\nClinical Implications: Treatment protocols must scaffold identity transition through pre-treatment identity assessment, existential psychoeducation, anchor person protocols, and intensive monitoring at days 3, 7, 10, and 14.",

          "abstract": "False memory (FM) has been widely studied using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). The present work investigates FM across two experiments, focusing on emotional valence, gender, and working memory capacity (WMC). Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that women would show higher FM rates for emotional word lists, using neutral, negative, and positively valenced lists, with both recall and recognition tests. Contrary to predictions, FM rates did not differ by gender. Experiment 2 extended this by incorporating WMC measures (RSPAN, SymSpan, and backward digit span) to test the hypothesis that higher WMC would be associated with reduced FM. While WMC was positively associated with correct memory performance, its relationship with FM was more nuanced. Higher WMC was linked to reduced false recall among women, suggesting WMC may buffer activation effects, particularly for negative stimuli. Across both experiments, FM rates were highest for negative lists but did not differ by gender. These findings contribute to understanding how emotion and cognitive resources jointly shape FM susceptibility and suggest that WMC may play a moderating role in emotional FM, especially among women.",

However, there has been insufficient research on individuals’ diverse beliefs about the location of the person or presence of God (or the Divine)—a concept we refer to as the Where-being of God. Here, we report on the development and validation of a measure of U.S. Christians’ and SBNRs’ representations of the Where-being of God: Transcendent, Internal (Immanent and Indwelling), Emergent, and Sacramental. Generally, Christians scored higher than SBNRs on Transcendent, Evangelicals scored higher on Internal, Catholics scored higher on Sacramental, and Catholics and SBNRs scored higher on Emergent compared with the other groups. However, each representation was differentially predicted by individual differences in existing measures of religion and spirituality, and differentially correlated with various character strengths, ethical frameworks, and conditions for obtaining God’s forgiveness. More research is needed to investigate the generalizability of our findings and, possibly, to expand our novel Where-being measure to include other conceptualizations of the location of the presence of the Divine.",

We propose an integrative, interdisciplinary approach for a more comprehensive understanding of individuality in social behaviour, considering: (1) features (What kinds of individual differences exist?), (2) sources (How do these differences emerge within individuals’ social environments?), and (3) outcomes (What are the consequences of these differences, and how can relevant outcomes be changed through tailored interventions?). We highlight common insights across disciplines, key challenges stemming from discipline-specific approaches, and novel potentials enabled through the interdisciplinary approach. By allowing comparative analyses across species, groups of individuals, and contexts, our approach promises to uncover the shared and unique nature of individuality in human social behaviour. We offer concrete recommendations to guide the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach.",

Known variously as interpersonal emotion regulation and social emotion regulation, researchers in affective science have begun to develop theoretical models of and a diverse set of methodologies to study this phenomena. However, two aspects of the phenomena remain underspecified: a) target and regulator roles are often blurred and variable and b) the goal dynamics that guide social emotion regulation are social in nature – tenets that have been historically discussed in relationship science and developmental science. Here, we review relevant literature from affective, social, and developmental sciences to highlight underexplored questions related to fluctuating roles in social emotion regulation and heterogeneous and interdependent (often social) goals that meaningfully impact social emotion regulation in everyday life. Then, we provide brief methodological suggestions that illustrate new analytic approaches that can be utilized to help understand roles and goals better in social emotion regulation. By paying attention to both variable roles and the social nature of goals, we can build better models of social emotion regulation that are inclusive of the heterogeneous situations, while also adopting rigorous analytical methods that respect the social nature of SER and broaden our temporal resolution to examine the interplay of roles and goals across the lifespan.",

In the current study, we investigated whether the ensemble encoding of these facial cues is processed differently between moving and static faces. Across two experiments, participants performed a delayed-match-to-sample expression recognition task using dynamic and static stimuli. Ensemble size was manipulated by increasing the number of faces in the target array. In Experiment 1, we presented one, two, and four target faces. In Experiment 2, we presented one, four, and eight target faces. Results demonstrated that while recognition accuracy for dynamic and static faces was comparable when one target face was presented, task accuracy diverged as the ensemble size increased. Specifically, increasing the number of faces in the target array failed to improve task performance for the dynamic expression stimuli. In addition, the results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that when eight faces were presented in the dynamic condition, performance was impaired for all expressions (disgust, fear, and happy) as well as in the non-emotional air-puff condition. This suggests motion in general disrupted the participants ability to extract an accurate summary statistic as the ensemble size was increased.",

In this regard, Easy-to-Read (E2R) recommendations aim to enhance text comprehension, particularly for individuals with cognitive or linguistic needs, but evidence is still limited regarding whether these adaptations also benefit the general population. This study investigated the effect of different text formats on accessibility and reading comprehension among Spanish university students, using eye-tracking technology. Twenty-four young participants without cognitive disabilities read texts under three conditions: Hard-to-Read (serif font, justified text, high contrast); Control (sans-serif font, left-aligned, standard spacing); and Easy-to-Read (greater spacing, optimised contrast, icons for information organisation). Comprehension was assessed through multiple-choice questions, and eye-tracking data were collected. The results revealed no significant differences in comprehension between conditions, although E2R scores tended to be higher. Eye-tracking showed that Hard-to-Read texts required longer reading times and more fixations, indicating greater cognitive effort, while the E2R format led to shorter fixations and larger saccades, suggesting more efficient visual processing. Overall, E2R modifications, though originally developed for individuals with cognitive needs, may also enhance accessibility for the young population.",

Findings showed that public self-consciousness was pronounced on social media in women relative to men (Study 1). Greater femininity predicted greater public self-consciousness on social media as well (Study 2), suggesting the effect goes beyond gender categories. We corroborated these findings with women’s qualitative experiences, which further suggested the prominent role of image-based platforms and attempts to manage self-consciousness online (Study 3; N = 37, 76% women). Our findings imply unique gender dynamics on social media, namely a context collapse centering public self-consciousness in women on social media.",

          "abstract": "A diverse account of allyship suggests that many individuals can be allies and that some allyship strategies fit their personalities and character strengths better than others. Allyship can be categorized into Committed Strategies (e.g., publicly highlighting women’s strengths) that involve social risk or personal sacrifice, and Relationship-Building Strategies (e.g., active listening) that build supportive and trusting bonds with marginalized group members. Latent profile analyses of survey data from two randomly split samples of 1,814 and 1,813 men from 103 countries were used to examine mean differences across Big Five personality profiles on Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies toward women in the workplace. Results indicated that people with Well-Adjusted personalities (high on all Big Five traits except low in neuroticism) viewed both Committed and Relationship-building strategies as better-fitting to their personalities, relative to the other three personality profiles that emerged in our data. Hierarchical regression analyses further found that five key character strengths (bravery, kindness, fairness, social intelligence, and perspective) explained additional variance beyond the Big Five in both Committed and Relationship-building strategies, reinforcing the value of character strengths in allyship. Exploratory bivariate correlations revealed that among the Big Five, agreeableness and openness were the strongest and most consistent predictors of 10 Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies. In a first of its kind, the current study broadens the scope of who allies are as well as what allyship can look like and offers an additional path for allyship training through consideration of personality traits and character strengths.",

While the program is effective in terms of patient outcomes, the scarcity of specialized pain psychologists limits its broader implementation. \n\nAims: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an evidence-based psychology intervention used at the TPS. We aimed to develop a fully self-guided, digital psychology intervention for individuals at risk for CPSP.\n\nMethods: The digital self-guided intervention was modeled after a 3-hour ACT group workshop at the TPS. It includes psychoeducation about ACT and pain that revolves around the ACT Matrix, a tool for evaluating coping strategies and enhancing quality of life. The intervention was developed on the digital health application, Manage My Pain (MMP), as an interactive, self-guided program. Development followed an iterative process, with qualitative feedback from TPS patients, clinicians, research staff and app developers. \n\nResults: The online intervention was implemented as four sequential 15 min parts plus a fifth optional summary and reference part. Each part includes didactic modules interspersed with interactive activities, experiential exercises, and optional learning checks. The MMP platform’s existing navigation features helped streamline development. Patient and clinician feedback from “think-aloud” and retrospective interviews helped refine key usability factors, including engagement, navigation, and content clarity. \n\nConclusions: The self-guided digital ACT intervention is scalable and can be easily implemented at clinics without specialized pain psychologists. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial will assess its acceptability and efficacy as a substitute for psychologist-led group workshops.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains to the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Flanker tasks are among the most popular paradigms for studying conflict resolution, particularly the intuitive “arrows” flanker task. To date, there is no auditory equivalent of this task, potentially due to the risk of perceptual masking. Using the strategy of reducing masking through vocal differences between the two competing talkers, the present study explores the validity of a speech-based flanker task with co-located talkers. One hundred and forty two healthy young participants (aged 18 – 24) participated in three auditory flanker tasks using naturally-produced speech with increasing spectral separation. Stimuli were the command words ‘left’ and ‘right,’ as well as two neutral flankers designed to impose masking effects, one containing only acoustic-phonetic information, and another containing lexical information. On each trial, the target and flanker the target and flanker words were heard concurrently, with participants responding to the direction spoken by the target talker. Classic conflict effects were observed to the incongruent flanker which could not be attributed to masking. As expected, both masking and conflict effects were attenuated by spectral separation. A final experiment with 62 healthy adults (aged 18 – 59) compared the test-retest reliability and distributional properties of this directional command flanker task with the arrows flanker task. The auditory task demonstrated very similar test-retest reliability and evolution of conflict effects over time to the visual task. This pattern of results indicates that the directional command flanker task is highly similar to the arrows flanker task and can be used to quantify inhibitory control in the auditory modality.",

          "abstract": "Gender essentialism and stereotyping emerge early in childhood, even though parents rarely discuss essentialist ideas with young children and often try to communicate egalitarian messages. Here we considered that parents’ generic references to gender, which subtly convey that gender reflects a natural kind, could contribute to the transmission of harmful beliefs even when they express counter-stereotypic ideas. In this pre-registered study, we used unmoderated remote research methods to record 192 parent-child dyads (children ages 3–5) talking about gender and assess children’s gender essentialism and stereotypes over time. Parents’ generic references to gender predicted children’s essentialism and stereotyping, even when this language expressed neutral and counter-stereotypic content. These findings suggest that highlighting specific counter-stereotypical examples (e.g., “That girl is great at soccer!”) might be more effective than counter-stereotypical generic sentences (e.g., “Girls are good at soccer too!”) at mitigating the development of gender essentialism and stereotyping in childhood.",

In this study, we measured perceived masculinity, femininity, agency, and communion for 347 U.S. jobs using O*NET descriptors and 2022 Census data. Participants rated 134 job characteristics, which we combined into composite scores weighted by activities, skills, abilities, and values. We tested whether percent women in a job predicted communal or agentic work, whether job femininity-masculinity aligned with perceived communion and agency, and whether these relationships differed by job preparation level. Results show that women are consistently overrepresented in communal jobs, but men are only overrepresented in agentic jobs for high-preparation occupations. Job femininity strongly aligns with communal content, while job agency only aligns moderately with masculinity in high-prep jobs.

Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. \nSample: Participants were 135 Undergraduate Psychology students.  \nMethods: Participants completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. They were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Self-reported motivation was measured.  \nResults: Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation differed depending on whether gestures were present: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning gains primarily when they also reported higher motivation to study further, whereas the presence of gestures was associated with more consistent learning gains across motivation levels. \nConclusion: These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

However, experiences of rejection and acceptance often unfold in dyadic contexts, and can have implications for how partners interact, relate, and support each other. Employing a novel dyadic task, we examined affective responses to simultaneous social feedback among cohabiting couples (Nparticipants = 168). Consistent with preregistered hypotheses, participants reporting higher relational interdependence were more likely to experience their partner’s social feedback as a personal reward or loss. This pattern emerged even when participants received incongruent social feedback (e.g., receiving negative feedback while a partner received positive feedback). Moreover, positive affect for a partner’s social feedback was associated with higher perceived partner support, and perceived capitalization attempts. Together, findings suggest that a key signature of relational interdependence may manifest as responding sensitively to a partner’s rewarding and aversive information (e.g., feeling a partner’s social feedback as one’s own), and being responsive to a partner’s outcomes (e.g., providing support during times of need, showing enthusiasm during positive events).",

          "authors": "Ilenia Falcinelli; Chiara Fini; Anna M. Borghi",
          "abstract": "Concepts, typically classified into more abstract (e.g., “chair”) and more concrete (e.g., “friendship”), are the mental shortcuts that people commonly use to organize knowledge and navigate their inner and external world. Research on categorization highlights social interaction as crucial for the acquisition and use of abstract concepts. Behavioral evidence shows that people typically learn abstract concepts primarily through language; even after acquisition, they feel less confident about their meaning and tend to rely more on others to refine or negotiate them. Neuroscientific studies support this evidence by showing a greater activation of social and linguistic brain areas for concepts higher in abstractness. However, existing literature relies on constrained experimental methods, testing participants mainly in isolation (“single-brain” approach) or, when using more interactive (conversational) paradigms, they have two main limitations: (I) using non-naturalistic settings; (II) extracting only behavioral indices. Within the emerging “second-person neuroscience” panorama, we contend that hyperscanning—a technique consisting of the simultaneous recording of brain activity from multiple individuals—may be ideally suited to adding evidence on the link between abstract concepts and social interactions by capturing Inter-Brain Synchronization (IBS) of individuals during real-time social exchanges. The availability of portable devices further broadens hyperscanning potential, allowing for the study of brain-to-brain coupling in more ecological environments. Drawing on prior hyperscanning evidence from learning to free conversations, we contend that using hyperscanning in naturalistic settings, with the due care, may offer a novel and interesting lens to investigate the role of social interactions for abstractness, thus enriching categorization research.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that long-term memory (LTM) knowledge can support working memory (WM) performance. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated the role of two WM maintenance mechanisms, attentional refreshing and articulatory rehearsal, in the short-term retention of words that are more or less easily retrievable from LTM, high- versus low-frequency words. Young adults studied a series of five (Exp. 1) or three (Exp. 2) high- versus low-frequency words in Brown-Peterson tasks. In Experiment 3, the number of words in the series varied from two to six. The opportunity to use refreshing was manipulated by varying the attentional demand of the concurrent task. Orthogonally, the use of rehearsal was either strengthened by instructions or impaired by concurrent articulation. The results showed that, when three or fewer words had to be maintained, the word frequency effect, i.e., better correct recall of high- relative to low-frequency words, was reduced in the condition where the use of rehearsal was strengthened relative to the articulatory suppression condition (Exp. 2 and 3). However, when more than three words had to be maintained, the frequency effect was evident in both conditions (Exp. 1 and 3). Finally, the frequency effect was never moderated by opportunities for attentional refreshing (Exp. 1 and 2). These findings suggest that articulatory rehearsal is at least partly responsible for the impact of LTM knowledge on WM recall performance.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory represents past experiences in a temporally compressed form—remembering an event typically takes less time than its actual duration. This compression is not uniform, however: recent work has shown that negative events are remembered with less temporal compression than neutral ones. In the present study, we conducted two experiments to investigate encoding processes that may contribute to this effect. In Experiment 1, we used a divided-attention manipulation to test whether attentional resources during encoding modulate the effect of emotion on temporal compression. Although divided attention produced a general decline in memory quality—elevating compression rates and reducing memory detail and dynamism—the magnitude of the emotional memory advantage remained unchanged under divided versus full attention. This suggests that attentional allocation alone does not explain emotion-related reductions in temporal compression. Experiment 2 examined whether negative emotion influences the segmentation of unfolding events. Results indicated that emotion and event segmentation exerted independent effects on temporal compression. Together, these results suggest that negative events yield richer and less compressed memory traces through encoding mechanisms that operate beyond attentional allocation and event segmentation, potentially involving the rapid replay of just-experienced content at event offset.",

          "abstract": "Impulsivity is a multifaceted personality trait reflecting a tendency to act on immediate urges, often linked to maladaptive real-world behaviors. One facet of impulsivity, Positive Urgency—the tendency to act rashly in response to positive affect—has been increasingly recognized as an important predictor of detrimental risk-taking behaviors. While a body of past work has uncovered a small positive predictive relationship between Positive Urgency and individuals’ propensity to take risks in laboratory tasks, little work has examined whether Positive Urgency relates to speed at which risky choices are made. Here we directly examined the relationship between Positive Urgency (measured using the SUPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale) and risky choice behavior in a simple, gain-only risky decision-making task wherein outcomes and probabilities were fully described to participants. Across two samples (a laboratory and a direct online replication; total N = 285), we observed that participants higher in Positive Urgency made significantly faster risky choices, but not choices to the ‘sure thing’ (certain) option. This predictive effect was specific to Positive Urgency as other impulsivity dimensions, such as Sensation Seeking and Negative Urgency, did not appear to relate to risky choice speed. Finally, individuals higher in overall impulsivity (taking a composite all SUPPS-P dimensions) also exhibited heightened post-reward slowing following risky wins. Together, these results highlight how Positive Urgency captures the ‘rash’ aspect of impulsive decision-making for rewards under risk.",

Participants included large population-representative twin and clinic-referred samples of youth. Using several criteria, increasingly elaborated models comprising an Externalizing dimension and seven fine-grained symptom factors outperformed models containing omnibus ADHD, ODD, and CD symptom dimensions. Results replicated across clinic and twin samples, with the Externalizing dimension most strongly reflecting defiant behavior. Symptom domains varied in their measurement properties across levels of Externalizing. This elaborated model of youth Externalizing sets the stage for future investigations of causes and outcomes, and for examining measurement invariance across individuals of diverse backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "The study of mind-wandering relies on the assumption that people accurately introspect and report on their attentional state. Yet self-reports may be distorted by extraneous motives, such as a desire to appear attentive. Across two sustained attention tasks, we demonstrate that social desirability bias is systematically linked with task-unrelated thought (TUT). In Experiment 1, higher social desirability bias scores predicted fewer subjective TUT reports during a reaction time task, despite no relationship with objective response times (RTs). This suggests a self-presentation effect rather than true attentional differences. Time pressure during thought probes further weakened RT–TUT coupling. In Experiment 2, controlling for social desirability bias enhanced the ability of an objective, RT-based real-time triggering procedure to predict deeper subjective TUT reports in the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The alignment between objective triggers and subjective reports was strong for low-bias individuals, but weakened for those high in bias. Triggers were also less effective at capturing working memory lapses in participants prone to deliberate mind-wandering, suggesting that intentional off-task thinking manifests differently in behavior. The results show that social desirability bias can obscure TUT reports and should be considered in a science of attention and thought.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence linking media use to worse child outcomes highlights a need to understand mechanisms driving media use. Past research links media use to infant negative affect, and parents report using media to cope. However, trait-level measures can mask within-person effects that reflect mechanisms more directly. In the current study, 401 predominantly White (70.32%), college-educated (88.03%) parents (75.56% mothers) of an infant 12-24 months old (M=16.43 months, 51.37% boys) completed daily diaries reporting the frequency of parent and child activities, behaviors, and affective states each day for 21 consecutive days. Temporal network modeling was used to examine associations among parents’ daily reports of infant affect, media motivations, and parenting behavior. On days when infants were fussier, parents reported more frequent yelling and more frequent media use to occupy children, regulate children, and regulate parents’ own emotions the same day, and more media to occupy children the next day. The reverse was not true: Media use did not predict negative affect the next day. Using media to relax alone and to regulate children predicted more parent comforting the next day, while using media to connect with children predicted more infant positive affect the next day. Again, the reverse was not true. Thus, temporal effects suggest media use may be an adaptive strategy, at least in the short term. Critically, short-term (i.e., same-day and next-day) within-person effects were not found at the between-person level, underscoring the importance of examining fluctuations within individuals to identify mechanisms and potential intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering is frequently associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the precise nature of this relationship remains elusive. The current study applies a novel approach from mind wandering research to the context of ADHD, distinguishing between remembered mind wandering (explicitly recalling off-task thoughts) and subjective feelings of inattention (sensing one's mind has wandered without recalling specific thoughts). We investigated how these distinct aspects of inattention relate to ADHD symptomatology and well-being. Participants from university and online ADHD communities completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) incorporating our thought probe methodology, along with measures of ADHD symptoms and well-being. Results revealed a double dissociation: subjective feelings of inattention predicted overall ADHD symptomatology, inattention symptoms, and measures of well-being and daily impairment, while remembered mind wandering only predicted hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Our findings suggest that the link between mind wandering and ADHD is best characterized as an association between subjective feelings of inattention and inattention symptoms. We propose that this association can be explained in terms of executive dysfunction, which may underlie both increased subjective feelings of inattention and symptoms of ADHD. This nuanced perspective provides novel insights into the complex relationship between mind wandering and ADHD, underscoring the importance of considering multiple dimensions of inattention in both research and clinical contexts.",

We find that while the co-expression of meanings at both levels is highly systematic, the specific meanings recurrently involved in the two levels differ. Despite these differences, regularity at and below the word level is explained by the same underlying principle: a tension between pressure for lexical compression—favoring form reuse for related meanings, thus easing learning and processing—and for lexical differentiation—favoring distinct forms to avoid confusion in context. These findings thus offer a unified account of lexical organization across the world’s languages, with subword-level form reuse emerging as a principled compromise under universal functional pressures.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and support from school management and community are related to their self-efficacy in the context of inclusive music education. Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom. Results also show the impact of the school community on success when implementing inclusive music education.",

However, despite decades of research, its measurement remains inconsistent, and new scales continue to be added to the literature rather than reusing and validating existing ones. This proliferation of overlapping but unvalidated scales obscures what is actually being measured, undermines cross-study comparison, and limits the accumulation of reliable evidence for theory and practice.\nOur goal is to assess the current degree of fragmentation of measures with a psychometric analysis of their validity. Building on preceding review data, we systematically review the self-efficacy literature in privacy and security from 2010 to 2025, examining its application across distinct domains and specific technologies. We identify, cumulatively, a total of 330 different measures across 327 publications, often with unclear contextual differentiation between scales. In a second step, we analyze the convergence of 148 fully-reported measures comprising 654 items using silicon samples generated by a fine-tuned large language model. The results of the synthetic item and scale correlation estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity, indicating measurement fragmentation.\nOur findings highlight widespread evidence of current jingle-fallacies, where measures intended to assess self-efficacy capture different psychological factors in multiple cases. This emphasizes the need for standardized, validated scales to improve comparability and reproducibility. We recommend increasing methodological rigor to generate reliable insights into human-centered security and privacy behavior and to ensure the design of more effective interventions.",

In this study, we investigate the potential of machine learning models for deriving trait scores from multimodal measurement data. We consider two classes of unsupervised models, kernel principal component analysis and autoencoders, and examine their empirical performance across various measurement settings. Numerical experiments using simulated and real-assessment data suggest that machine-learned scoring recovers generating trait scores reasonably well and demonstrates close alignment with traditional scoring methods.

          "abstract": "When confronted with danger, humans display a range of defensive behaviors, such as freezing and active avoidance. Prior research has identified a distinct physiological response pattern to avoidable threats, characterized by heart rate bradycardia, reduced visual exploration, and suppressed visual alpha activity (8–13 Hz), all of which are associated with faster flight responses. This pattern suggests an adaptive state of attentive immobility. However, the relationship between this state and the encoding of explicit threat-related memories remains largely unexplored. To investigate this, we recorded parieto-occipital alpha activity, eye movements, and autonomic responses in 60 participants during anticipation of either an avoidable threat, an inevitable threat, or no threat, while viewing images of various facial identities. In a subsequent memory task, participants were asked to recognize previously seen faces among novel faces. Results showed enhanced suppression of alpha activity during avoidable threats, accompanied by heart rate bradycardia, centralized gaze, and increased sympathetic arousal. However, these responses were not linked to memory encoding. Instead, memory effects were associated with reduced pupillary responses, heightened visual exploration, and decreased alpha activity, particularly in occipitotemporal regions. Together, these findings suggest that when individuals face avoidable threats, they enter a state of attentive immobility that enhances perceptual processing and prepares them for action but does not extend to improved memory encoding.",

          "abstract": "Designing for humans is a profound challenge. The consequences of design shape people’s present and future well-being across individual, social, mental, and physical domains. Despite the rise of human-centred design, failures to understand the true beneficiaries of design decisions continue to produce harmful or ineffective outcomes. Designing well requires insight into the complex psychological systems that govern behaviour, motivation, bias, and decision-making – yet psychological knowledge is rarely integrated systematically into design practice and application. While psychology offers rigorous tools for understanding how people think, feel, and act – and although both designers and psychologists acknowledge the importance of each other’s fields – collaboration remains limited. Existing design approaches, such as those for Human Centered Design, provide process guidance but lack structured mechanisms for embedding psychological principles into everyday practice, leading to a lack of efficacy and unintended consequences in designed outcomes. To address this gap, we propose the Design Psychology Model (DPM): a practical and action-oriented framework for integrating established psychological insights into design. The DPM presents a designer-led process that sets strategic intentions, grounds work in established psychological theory, validates ideas in current contexts, and future-proofs outcomes through ongoing monitoring. The proposed model offers pathways for bridging disciplinary boundaries and invites the wider practitioner community to advance a more rigorous, ethical, and human-attuned design psychology.",

          "abstract": "While biological motion processing has been extensively studied, little is known about the top-down impact of expectations in this context. We tested whether expectations about the likelihood of encountering a human walker influence the detection of biological motion in point-light displays, particularly when perceptual information is unreliable. 74 participants completed a signal detection task, responding to stimuli featuring either a human walker or scrambled biological motion, each masked with one of four levels of visual noise. Participants were randomly assigned to the high or low expectations group and were told that 75% or 25% of the displays would feature a human walker, although the actual proportion was 50%. Participants in the high expectation group showed a greater tendency to respond “yes”, with the largest group difference emerging at the highest level of noise. These findings suggest that expectations can bias biological motion detection, particularly under conditions of sensory unreliability. The results also support the predictive processing model of agency detection, which proposes that false-positive perceptions of (supernatural) agents arise from culturally learned priors combined with ambiguous input.",

          "abstract": "Many everyday decisions involve integrating multiple attributes rather than comparing a single value. While normative and stochastic choice theories assume that each option is evaluated independently, evidence shows that choices can instead depend on attribute-wise comparisons between options. To investigate the source of imprecision in such comparisons, we introduce a paradigm in which participants compare two sequences of numbers and decide which sequence has the larger sum. Across three conditions, which only differ in how numbers from the two sequences are paired, we observe systematic differences in accuracy: participants perform best when paired values are closer in magnitude. This finding indicates that judgments depend on frame-wise comparisons of values presented simultaneously, rather than on independent processing of each option.\nTo account for these results, we fit several models of noisy judgment based on cumulative integration of frame-wise comparisons. We consider both models based on nonlinear integration of frame-wise comparisons and models in which comparison noise variance depends on size of the frame-wise differences, and find that these mechanisms are of differing importance for different subjects.\nClustering analyses confirm this heterogeneity, identifying one subgroup best characterized by models with value-dependent noise and another for whom nonlinear transformation of the framewise-differences is more important. Finally, we introduce hybrid models integrating both mechanisms, and find that these best explain behavior across clusters, and predict participants’ performance more accurately than single-mechanism models.\nOur findings demonstrate that attribute-wise comparisons play a central role in multi-attribute decision-making, even in tasks that do not involve subjective preferences. They further highlight the need for models that combine distorted value encoding with value-dependent noise to explain heterogeneity in human choice behavior.",

          "title": "Evidence for motor imagery in the management of vestibular disorders does not support recent guidelines: a systematic search and review",
          "authors": "Fabre Dimitri; Florian Naye; Thomas Rulleau",
          "abstract": "Context: Vestibular disorders significantly impact people's quality of life, affecting functions such as balance and walking. Current treatments involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, with vestibular rehabilitation proving effective in helping to compensate for deficits. Although traditional techniques address various aspects of the vestibular system, many fundamental studies suggest motor imagery could reduce vestibular impairment. Despite the paucity of research on motor imagery for vestibular disorder rehabilitation, recent expert recommendations suggest it could enhance functional recovery. This review questions the evidence in the literature on the clinical value benefits of motor imagery as part of vestibular rehabilitation.\nThe aims of this study were 1. to identify motor imagery interventions used in the literature, 2. to critically appraise them, and 3. to report their impact on clinical outcomes.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web Of Science, CINAHL and Scopus databases. The review was registered on PROSPERO and is reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. PICO criteria were adults undergoing a motor imagery intervention as part of vestibular rehabilitation, studies with or without comparators, and the use of clinical outcome measures. A critical grid was completed, and a risk of bias assessment was performed.\nResults: Despite identifying 2344 (after duplicate removal) concerning motor imagery and vestibular rehabilitation, only two articles met our inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest a clinical benefit of integrating motor imagery into vestibular rehabilitation. However, the limited evidence and methodological shortcomings warrant caution, including small sample size, absence of imagery quality assessment, and poor generalizability. \nConclusion: Future research should address the identified limitations, including the need to study a broader range of vestibular pathologies, use comprehensive assessments, and evaluate long-term effects. This would contribute to a more thorough understanding of motor imagery as part of vestibular rehabilitation.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

However, in WEIRD countries, most individuals recommend complex, maximizing strategies to others—an “ideal–reality gap” absent elsewhere—suggesting that maximizing is a culturally specific belief rather than universal behavior. These findings challenge a long tradition of applying laboratory-derived standards to real-world uncertainty and illuminate new ways to help people navigate the most important decisions in their lives.",

          "abstract": "Persistence, defined as a trait-like characteristic, reflects the personal tendency to endure different hardships. In a recently developed model, three dimensions—persistence despite difficulties, persistence despite fear, and inappropriate persistence—were proposed to cover distinct facets of this ability, along with goal-time preferences as a persistence-related construct. The Multidimensional Persistence Scale (MPS) and the Goal-Time Preferences Scale (GTPS) were created to gauge these two separate constructs. In the current study, we conducted two studies using the Polish version of the scales (MPS-PL and GTPS-PL, respectively), with the aim of evaluating both measures. We also proposed a profile model as better reflecting the multidimensionality of persistence as opposed to the original superordinate model. In Study 1, the three-factor structure of the MPS-PL was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. In contrast, the GTPS-PL showed a poor fit to the data as well as a vague factor structure. In Study 2, we tested the nomological network of the MPS-PL, providing evidence for its construct validity as well as the distinctiveness of its dimensions. Last, we conducted a latent profile analysis, which revealed the three qualitatively different configurations of persistence dimensions in the total study sample. Overall, the evidence we gathered supports our proposal about persistence as a multidimensional profile construct.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults involves inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often accompanied by emotional dysregulation and significant functional impairment. Although stimulant medication effectively reduces core symptoms, its impact on broader psychosocial functioning is less consistent. Personality pathology, varying in severity and expression, may account for this variability.\nThis naturalistic study examined how dimensional models of personality pathology influence symptomatic and functional outcomes during pharmacological treatment for adult ADHD. A total of 246 adults (66% women; mean age = 33.5 years) completed assessments of general personality dysfunction, maladaptive personality traits, ADHD symptoms, and functional impairment.\nLinear mixed-effects models showed that individuals with higher levels of personality dysfunction and maladaptive traits were more functionally impaired and demonstrated less symptomatic improvement during treatment. General personality dysfunction predicted greater functional impairment and higher ADHD symptom burden, while maladaptive domains - particularly Negative Affectivity, Detachment, and Psychoticism - were strongly linked to functional impairment. In contrast, Disinhibition was the only domain meaningfully related to ADHD symptom burden, consistent with its overlap with core ADHD features. Stimulant dosage and treatment duration showed only modest associations with functional change.\nThese findings indicate that personality pathology substantially constrains the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment in adults with ADHD. Higher impairment and limited functional gains among individuals with pronounced personality dysfunction suggest that medication alone is insufficient to improve adaptive functioning. Integrated, personality-informed interventions addressing both neurocognitive and personality-based mechanisms may therefore be required to achieve lasting recovery in everyday life.\nKeywords: ADHD; Adult ADHD; Pharmacotherapy; Stimulant Medication; Dimensional Personality Pathology; Personality Dysfunction; Functional Impairment",

          "abstract": "Designing for humans is a profound challenge. The consequences of design shape people’s present and future well-being across individual, social, mental, and physical domains. Despite the rise of human-centred design, failures to understand the true beneficiaries of design decisions continue to produce harmful or ineffective outcomes. Designing well requires insight into the complex psychological systems that govern behaviour, motivation, bias, and decision-making – yet psychological knowledge is rarely integrated systematically into design practice and application. While psychology offers rigorous tools for understanding how people think, feel, and act – and although both designers and psychologists acknowledge the importance of each other’s fields – collaboration remains limited. Existing design approaches, such as those for Human Centered Design, provide process guidance but lack structured mechanisms for embedding psychological principles into everyday practice, leading to a lack of efficacy and unintended consequences in designed outcomes. To address this gap, we propose the Design Psychology Model (DPM): a practical and action-oriented framework for integrating established psychological insights into design. The DPM presents a designer-led process that sets strategic intentions, grounds work in established psychological theory, validates ideas in current contexts, and future-proofs outcomes through ongoing monitoring. The proposed model offers pathways for bridging disciplinary boundaries and invites the wider practitioner community to advance a more rigorous, ethical, and human-attuned design psychology.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although extensive evidence suggests domain-general differences in autistic attention are common and impactful, frameworks for understanding these experiences remain confused. Concepts like monotropism, autotelic (flow-prone) personality, and hyperfocus seemingly have overlapping features and distinct attributes. How they relate to one another is not empirically clear.\nMethods: 111 autistic and 39 non-autistic adults filled out a Prolific survey. We examined group differences in ADHD inattention traits and subscales from monotropism, autotelic personality, and hyperfocus measures, and how subscales were related in autism. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as an initial exploration of dimensions potentially underlying these constructs. We also examined whether PCA components were related to anxiety and sensory hyperresponsitivity.\nResults: Autistic people reported more monotropism, hyperfocus, and inattention than non-autistic people. Autistic people reported more of some autotelic personality subscales (enjoyment of boredom, curiosity before correction) but less of another (attentional control). However, attentional control and self-centredness were largely unrelated to other autotelic personality dimensions; instead, they respectively converged with ADHD inattention traits and social anxiety. One PCA dimension seemingly reflected intense, enjoyable focus; it was related to sensory hyperresponsiveness, and indirectly via hyperresponsiveness with anxiety. Another seemingly reflected inattention and difficulties with attentional control; this was directly related to anxiety. These two PCA dimensions each explained relatively little variance, reflecting the complexity of autistic attention.\nConclusion: These results emphasise that attention in autism can have both positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., propensity to sensory distress) aspects. Underlying intense, enjoyable focus experiences likely contribute to hyperfocus, monotropism, and autotelic personality, but there appear to be many dimensions of attention in autism. Autotelic personality, as currently conceptualised, likely includes aspects that are more reflective of other existing constructs. Further research is needed to understand neurocognitive of and real-world manifestations and effects of these attention styles.",

          "abstract": "Boredom is an uncomfortable feeling of wanting but failing to engage with the world. Trait boredom proneness – the tendency to experience boredom more frequently and intensely – is associated with a wide range of mental health concerns including feelings of loneliness and problematic smartphone use. We conducted a comprehensive online survey (N=385) that included a range of psychological scales measuring boredom proneness, mental well-being, and usage of social media sites, smartphones, and the internet writ large. We also included measures of loneliness, the sense of belonging, and life satisfaction. Boredom proneness was positively correlated with higher levels of loneliness (r = 0.32) and negatively associated with the sense of belonging (r=-0.43). In addition, boredom proneness was associated with various metrics of problematic engagement with the internet and social media (including total hours of usage, nomophobia and problematic internet usage). Individual levels of self-control mediated many of these relations These findings suggest that boredom proneness significantly impacts both feelings of connectedness and online engagement behaviours, with implications for understanding the interplay between mental health and the use of technology among young adults.",

          "abstract": "The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.",

          "abstract": "Pre-experiencing future climate events using either episodic future thinking (EFT) or perspective taking (PT) can increase climate change risk perception and action. Here we tested if combining EFT and PT would be more effective than EFT alone. 259 participants recruited online were randomly assigned to one of three groups: EFT+PT, which involved reading a vignette about a young friend or relative enduring a future storm; EFT, where participants read the same vignette but about a generic person; or a control condition, where participants read climate change facts. Climate action was measured by having participants make a series of real-stakes choices in which they allocated money between themselves and a climate charity. Climate change risk perception was assessed with a survey before and after the manipulation. Climate change risk perception increased overall after the manipulation, but the increase was significant only in the control group. There was also no effect of our manipulation on charitable choice. However, in the EFT+PT group, participants who reported feeling closer to their chosen friend or relative made more charitable choices. In a follow-up study, we obtained ratings of the vignettes from an independent group (n = 50). The control condition was rated as the most likely to occur, consistent with that vignette being most effective at increasing risk perception. The EFT+PT vignette was rated as the most motivating for climate action. Together, these results suggest that perspective taking with close others may encourage climate action, even if individuals’ climate change risk perception is not affected.",

Using a Hidden Markov Model–based approach, we found that while non-lonely individuals exhibited similarity, lonely individuals’ neural event segmentation patterns were dissimilar to others, particularly in high-order brain regions (e.g., the default mode network).

          "abstract": "Speech comprehension has been described as an effortless and robust process; yet, in real-world contexts, it is common for a listener to misunderstand what was said, or fail to derive meaning entirely. Typically, methods of measuring speech comprehension are applied `post-hoc' - that is, after the comprehension has happened. This approach fails to capture comprehension as it is happening, which has limited the field's understanding of the cognitive processes involved in real-time comprehension. To overcome these challenges, we designed and tested a novel method of measuring real-time speech comprehension during naturalistic listening. We built a slider device that synchronizes with experimental software and provides millisecond read-out. In three experiments, participants listened to audiobook segments while providing continuous comprehension ratings using the slider. To vary comprehension success, we presented speech segments at speed factors 1-5 times faster than normal. We validated the time-resolved slider data against established speech comprehension assessment methods. Overall, our findings validate our novel time-resolved comprehension measure and demonstrate that it is possible to derive an online behavioral measure of real-time speech comprehension. We also confirmed numerous limitations of static post-hoc assessments, including challenges of multi-choice question design, and the confounding of potential effects due to recency bias and comprehension for summarization. The measure proposed here overcomes the constraints of static post-hoc assessments, and can be effectively integrated with neuroimaging techniques, offering a valuable tool for future research on dynamic processes during naturalistic listening.",

          "abstract": "Personality science has been slow to translate into clinical prediction, largely because research has focused on broad self-reported trait domains. Although these domains are established risk factors for common mental disorders (CMDs), including anxiety and mood disorders, they overlook more specific facet-level risk markers and limit the overall predictive power. Using data from the Estonian Biobank (N = 3,221; 1,918 females; ages 18–75), we linked baseline multi-informant NEO-PI-3 personality domains and facets with six future CMD diagnoses recorded in national health insurance data within 1–15 years after assessment (Mdn = 7 years), controlling for prior diagnostic history. While prior diagnosis was the strongest individual predictor (β = .32–.64), personality traits accounted for additional unique variance. Facet-level models explained 17–47% of variance across diagnoses and outperformed domain-level models (R²mean = .34 vs. .31; nearly doubling explanatory power when diagnostic history was excluded: R²mean = .15 vs. .08), exceeding well-established risk factors (R²max ~ .13) by up to 2.6-fold. We identified six transdiagnostic and three disorder-specific personality markers that were uniquely associated with clinical CMDs. Multi-informant design reduced single-method bias and enhanced prediction, particularly when prior diagnostic information was unavailable (facet models: R² = .08, .06, and .15 for self-, informant-, and multi-informant reports, respectively). This facet-level, multi-informant approach represents a comprehensive advance in personality-based clinical prediction, refining how lower-level personality facets map onto future real-world psychopathology and underscoring the untapped potential of personality-based risk assessment and fine-grained intervention targets in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), concerns about its psychological safety have increased. Recent psychiatric reports show that some users—especially those with vulnerable mental health—may develop delusional thoughts or psychosis-like experiences during interactions with GenAI. Detecting such risk language is therefore important for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). This study examined whether LLMs can identify delusional statements and whether retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance. A dataset of 200 simulated user statements (50% delusional, 50% non-delusional) was created based on DSM-5 criteria and validated by a licensed psychotherapist. The dataset was divided into a 100-item retrieval corpus and a 100-item test set. Two GPT-4o-mini classifiers were evaluated: a baseline non-RAG model and a RAG-enhanced model that retrieved the three most semantically similar examples from the corpus. When a statement was classified as delusional, models also assigned a severity rating (1–3). The non-RAG model achieved 81% accuracy with a recall of 0.66, whereas the RAG model reached 94% accuracy with improved recall (0.89) and perfect specificity. However, both models systematically underestimated severity, with the RAG model showing greater underestimation. These findings indicate that RAG can enhance early detection of psychosis-like language but is insufficient for reliable severity assessment, highlighting both the potential and the limits of current LLM-based cognitive-risk detection.",

Validation included three experiments: (1) a four-alternative forced-choice task assessing recognition accuracy, (2) a “point-and-click” task rating valence and arousal in a two-dimensional affective space, and (3) a trait-rating task evaluating perceived actor characteristics. Participants accurately identified mental states across categories (77 % of stimuli). Mean valence–arousal ratings revealed a non-linear one-dimensional manifold structure that correlated with behavioral measures. An interactive online visualization allows users to explore this “Theory of Mind manifold” (https://hctor99.github.io/TheoryofMindManifold/). By integrating social-category diversity with complex emotional expression, this database provides a new resource for studying how socially perceived group membership shapes the perception and inference of mental states.",

          "authors": "Jessica C. Lee; Tracy Dang; Jack Collins",
          "abstract": "The tendency to overgeneralize fear learning has been identified as a potential risk factor for anxiety disorders. In this study, we examined whether highly anxious individuals differed from low anxious individuals in how they generalized fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) following differential conditioning with an aversive scream outcome. We achieved this by using a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization from the fear cue (predicting the scream) and generalization from the safety cue (predicting the absence of the scream). In two experiments, we found that relative to low trait anxious participants, high trait anxious participants showed higher outcome predictions to stimuli resembling the safety cue (i.e., they undergeneralized safety learning), but not for stimuli resembling the fear cue (i.e., they did not overgeneralize fear learning). Undergeneralization was not found when a neutral outcome was used, suggesting that this effect is dependent on the use of an aversive outcome and specific to safety learning. Our findings suggest that safety generalization may vary more as a function of trait anxiety than fear generalization, and therefore future research should separately measure these processes to uncover the mechanisms driving excessive spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "It is important for researchers to be able to identify sources of low-quality data in their surveys. At the same time, it is important that the methods researchers use to detect these sources of low-quality data do not result in a substantially worse survey-taking experience for their participants. The purpose of the present project was to investigate how two types of attention check items—infrequency/frequency items (e.g., “I don’t have a first name”) and instructed-response items (e.g., “Choose disagree for this item”)—impact the survey-taking experiences of participants. In Study 1 (N = 400), we found that participants responded most favourably to a survey composed entirely of control items, followed by a survey composed entirely of infrequency/frequency items and, finally, a survey composed entirely of instructed-response items. However, in Study 2 (N = 793) and Study 3 (N = 800), we found that these effects only appeared when over half of the survey consisted of infrequency/frequency items and instructed-response items, respectively. These results suggest that attention check items can negatively impact a participant’s survey-taking experience but only when administered in large quantities. They also suggest that infrequency/frequency items tend to be better received than instructed-response items.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one’s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DE) are a class of models in dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a methodologically novel approach to creativity research by simultaneously exploring creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice within a unified research design. This integration allows for the first systematic analysis of the patterns of creative engagement across these three dimensions, revealing how they co-occur and interact across multiple domains within a university student sample. Participants reported on their creative achievements, time investment, aspirations, comparison standards, and audience orientations across 11 creative domains. Correlation and logistic regression analyses revealed broadly consistent evidence of within-domain alignment: individuals who produced something creative in a given domain were generally more likely to consume creative content from that domain. Domains such as literature, visual arts, and film/video &amp; TV showed stronger cross-domain connections, whereas science and sports were more domain-bound. Creative consumption exhibited a more generalized structure, indicating stronger interrelationships among domains, while creative production clustered into smaller, domain-specific groupings. Engagement in creative practice was positively associated with both production and consumption within domains, underscoring the possible interdependence of these forms of participation. Breadth of creative production and consumption showed limited predictive potential with respect to self-reported creative achievements. Analyses of preference alignments indicated slightly higher coherence in production than in consumption, suggesting that creative production may involve more deliberate and integrated preference structures. Together, these findings illustrate the tight interrelation of creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice as dimensions of creative engagement. This integrative approach broadens the conceptual and empirical scope of creativity research beyond its traditional production-centric focus.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety is reliably characterized by biases toward avoidance and aversive learning. Frontal-midline theta (FM-theta) oscillations have been implicated as a key neural mechanism underlying these learning biases. Here we combined dynamic network neuroscience with computational modeling to investigate how FM-theta coordinates large-scale functional network interactions on a trial-to-trial basis for feedback-guided learning, and how these neural dynamics are altered in social anxiety across different social contexts. A sample of 146 individuals (mean age = 20.4 years) with varying levels of social anxiety completed a probabilistic selection task while performing alone and under social observation. Results indicated that FM-theta contributed to two theta-dependent functional subgraphs, each differently supporting probabilistic learning. Frontal-parietal functional connectivity increased following aversive outcomes and scaled with prediction error, consistent with error-monitoring and feedback-updating. In contrast, social anxious individuals exhibited heightened context-sensitive frontal-occipital connectivity for positive feedback across contexts and for negative feedback during performance observation. Social scrutiny amplified integration between these neural network patterns, impairing learning performance, particularly in high socially anxious individuals. Together, these findings show that social anxiety is associated with dysregulated, context-sensitive FM-theta neural network dynamics, reflecting reduced neural flexibility for adaptive learning under scrutiny.",

We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

          "abstract": "Collective emotional responses represent responses of multiple people to an emotional situation. Such responses are ubiquitous in many contexts, such as conflicts, crises, and celebrations. Yet, a closer look at processes of collective emotions leads to an observation: collective emotion often co-occurs with attempts to influence the emotions of the group. We refer to these attempts as collective emotion regulation, where members of groups aim to change collective emotions. In this paper, we first define collective emotion and propose a model of collective emotion generation. We then define collective emotion regulation and distinguish it from related concepts. We propose a process model to describe the unfolding of collective emotion regulation that help organize a variety of behaviors previously discussed in other literatures. We show how the concept can help explain collective behavior and facilitate planning interventions designed to regulate collective emotions. Finally, we discuss open empirical questions and future directions.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted a connection between divergent and creative thinking with episodic memory. According to the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis, individuals draw on past experiences and flexibly recombine retrieved memories to generate novel ideas. However, most research examining this link has focused on people thinking in isolation, despite the fact that autobiographical remembering and idea generation frequently occur in social contexts such as workplaces, classrooms, and everyday conversations. Therefore, the present study compared individual and collaborative performance in recalling autobiographical memories and generating uncommon uses under parallel conditions, using object cue words across tasks. Our findings partially support the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis: the two tasks were strongly correlated, yielded similar overall performance across group conditions, and both showed a significant decline in the number and variety of responses over time, although this decrease was more pronounced for memory retrieval. Contrary to previous work documenting detrimental effects of collaboration, our results indicate that collaborative and individual performance in divergent thinking and autobiographical memory are largely equivalent, while collaboration increases participants’ enjoyment of this task. Future research should clarify the conditions under which group settings optimize both episodic retrieval and creative thinking.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Internalizing disorders frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and impede alcohol recovery, but directionality among these disorders is unclear. Further, shared risk factors may explain the co-occurrence of these disorders, rather than either disorder directly affecting the other. Additionally, there is evidence that these disorders are differentially associated in men and women. \nMethod: The current study examined a sample of clinical probands, recruited during adolescence based on externalizing problems, and their siblings to understand whether adolescent alcohol behavior is associated with changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms through young adulthood, and vice-versa. Participants were 1,161 individuals who completed a clinical interview in adolescence (M age=16.3) and at two subsequent waves (M age=22.6 and 28.5). Latent growth curve models tested whether baseline levels behavior (e.g., AUD) is associated with linear change in internalizing problems (e.g., depression) through young adulthood. Further, sibling-comparison analyses were conducted to control familial risk factors shared by siblings while testing whether siblings who have higher levels an independent variable (e.g., adolescent AUD) have proportionally greater increases in an outcome (e.g., depression), relative to their siblings with lower levels of that independent variable. \nResults: Adolescent AUD was associated with steeper increases in major depressive symptoms through young adulthood, and these effects were not explained by familial confounds. Additionally, adolescent AUD was associated with more adolescent generalized anxiety symptoms in females but less generalized anxiety symptoms among males. \nConclusions: These findings suggest that treating early-life AUD may decrease risk for depressive symptoms later in life, but the inverse may not be true.",

          "abstract": "Our brains are contextual, connected, social, and dynamic; failing to account for these aspects of the brain together risks misleading results that could be translated into worse health outcomes, especially for populations already underrepresented in neuroscience. In this manuscript, we synthesize recent studies that investigate the network neuroecology of social interaction and characterize how brain network organization varies across interpersonal social experience. We describe how certain patterns of brain connectivity are associated with particular social environments as a result of trade-offs in how functional connections are distributed across the brain in accordance with social experience. We call these environment-specific patterns of connectivity and their trajectories of reconfiguration over development network neuroendophenotypes. We propose two intersecting mechanisms that underlie the development of network neuroendophenotypes, addressing both how and why brain network organization contextually varies: one more protracted via stress physiology and the other more acute via the processing of affective/supportive touch. The existence of distinguishable patterns of connectivity that are associated with different social environments has important consequences for studying normative neurodevelopment and brain-based biomarkers of disease: The pattern of brain network organization that is associated with better (mental) health may look different in different environments. Ignoring social context therefore risks either pathologizing healthy brains or dismissing real disease among those who would otherwise be considered healthy. Moving forward, methodological advances that can effectively treat brain network organization as a dynamic, high dimensional, contextually influenced neuroendophenotype will be crucial for future research.",

Notably, the influence of act legality was not restricted to judgments of actions, but also guided perceptions of others’ moral character. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed individual differences in the extent to which people’s moral judgments were shaped by an act’s legal status, with act legality being most influential for participants viewing respect for authority as a moral good. Based on these findings, we forward an account in which individuals use legal judgments as heuristic cues when making moral evaluations.",

Here, I show that moral judgments depend more on how many different individuals engage in a behavior than on mere repeated exposure. Participants viewed stories about an observer witnessing repeated, morally relevant behaviors that were performed once by six different individuals, six times by the same individual, or once by a single individual. Participants rated each behavior on third-party acceptability (acceptability for the actors) and first-party acceptability (acceptability for themselves), and prevalence. Repeated behaviors increased third-party acceptability and prevalence, but more so for multiple-actor than repeated single-actor behaviors. Critically, only multi-actor behaviors, but not single-actor repeated behaviors, influenced participants’ own moral judgments. Moral norms thus shift primarily when transgressions are performed by multiple individuals.",

We investigated these questions using 600 full-face images of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese male soccer players. Korean participants (N = 52) viewed each face for 200 ms and rated it on attractiveness and trustworthiness. Ratings were then compared with accuracy data from our previous ethnicity categorization study using the same stimuli. Results revealed a clear pattern. Korean faces, as in-group members, received higher ratings than Japanese or Chinese faces. For Korean faces, higher ratings predicted greater categorization accuracy, suggesting that positive impressions can enhance rapid perceptual processing. For Chinese faces, the opposite occurred, favorable ratings were linked to lower accuracy, indicating a misattribution bias in which socially positive out-group faces were often classified as Korean. No such link appeared for Japanese faces. Across groups, attractive or trustworthy faces were more likely to be assigned to the in-group, regardless of actual ethnicity. In this study we show that rapid social evaluations can both improve and distort fine-grained ethnicity categorization, adding a social-affective layer to face perception that goes beyond visual cues alone.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation.\n\nKeywords: free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Prior evidence suggests that individuals with higher fitness exhibit attenuated \nendocrine and autonomic responses to acute stress. However, it remains unclear whether this \nstress-buffering effect depends on the type of stressor. This study examined whether aerobic \ncapacity modulates psychophysiological responses to two stress induction paradigms (Trier \nSocial Stress Tests, TSST; Maastricht Acute Stress Test, MAST). We hypothesized that fitter \nparticipants show lower stress reactivity, with stronger attenuation expected for the MAST, \nwhich includes a physical stress component. \nMethods: Healthy participants (n = 59; 28 women; age: 27.1 ± 5.5 yrs) completed the TSST and \nMAST on separate days under standardized conditions. We assessed self-reported stress, \nsalivary hormones (cortisol, cortisone, DHEAS), and autonomic cardiac regulation (heart rate, \nRMSSD). Aerobic fitness was determined via graded exercise testing (VO2peak: 50.4 ± 8.6 \nml/kg/min). We used multilevel regression models to examine the associations between \nVO2peak and stress responses. \nResults: Higher VO2peak was significantly associated with lower heart rate across both stress \ninduction paradigms (b = 0.99 bpm, p = 0.002). For other outcomes, no significant association \nwith VO2peak was found. The associations did not differ between TSST and MAST. \nDiscussion: Aerobic fitness was linked to lower heart rate during the experimental sessions, \nindicating a modest cardiovascular advantage under acute stress. Contrary to our hypothesis, \nthis effect did not differ between the two stress paradigms, suggesting that the influence of \nfitness was not specific to the type of stressor. Aerobic capacity, therefore, seems to reduce \ncardiovascular load during stressful situations in a general manner.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models has traditionally been viewed as a correctible error arising from imperfect training. We propose a fundamental reframing: Hallucination may not be a defect but rather a lawful geometric phenomenon emerging from semantic manifold curvature. By integrating information theory, differential geometry, and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that hallucination rate (h) systematically increases with representational curvature (κ), independent of information density (ρ). Using GPT-2 across five reasoning domains (n=1,500), we find a consistent correlation r(κ,h)=0.83 (p≈0.08), providing preliminary evidence that hallucination arises predictably where meaning-space bends most sharply. This transforms hallucination from mystery to measurement—not an error to suppress, but a quantifiable cost of compressing knowledge into finite linguistic form. We introduce the curvature–hallucination relationship h∝f(κ), unifying the manifold hypothesis in representation learning, information-geometry trade-offs, and distortion under abstraction. This framework enables a shift from error correction to geometric control: monitoring curvature to predict and regulate factual instability. What began as a reliability problem may become the first quantitative law linking representation, compression, and truth—the geometry of understanding itself.\nAll Tier 1 experimental code, datasets, and metrics are openly released at the GitHub repository https://github.com/enkiluv/hallucination_curvature_experiment, inviting the research community to replicate, extend, and test whether this relationship generalizes across architectures, languages, and modalities in forthcoming Tier 2 and Tier 3 studies.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS), the temporal alignment of brain activities\nbetween individuals, has been proposed as a biomarker for successful communication and smooth social interaction. Surging empirical evidence shows that INS emerges spontaneously between infants, children, and their caregivers from early on in development. Yet, little is known about the developmental preconditions and functions of INS in childhood. This paper presents a developmental framework for understanding INS, integrating insights from structural and functional brain maturation, as well as behavioral, social, and cognitive development. We discuss how early caregiver-infant interactions, characterized by shared perceptual rhythms, facilitate the emergence of INS. Given initial limitations in temporal precision of neural processing, early INS is likely constrained to low-frequency brain rhythms and evolves alongside the maturation of neural networks and socio-cognitive abilities. We outline how INS may support critical developmental processes, including social learning, language acquisition, and attachment formation, through enabling mutual prediction and co-regulation between caregivers and children. Furthermore, we hypothesize that tasks requiring higher-order mutual understanding are linked to qualitative changes in INS patterns over time. This framework highlights the potential of INS as both a marker and a driver of developmental change, offering new avenues for research and intervention. Longitudinal studies and rhythm-based interventions could deepen our understanding of how INS supports development, with implications for enhancing social learning and attachment in populations at risk for developmental challenges. This work underscores the importance of adopting a developmental perspective in INS research.",

          "abstract": "Individual differences in psychological reactivities (i.e., the degree to which individuals react differently to social interactions) are central to psychological research. Previous theory-based research has identified substantial individual differences in reactivities but few robust predictors of these differences. This work aimed to address two questions: First, can individual differences in reactivities to social interactions be accurately predicted at all? Second, what are the most important person-level variables for this prediction? A data-driven machine learning approach was applied to three large-scale experience-sampling data sets (overall N = 5,047) to predict the extent to which individuals reacted with positive and negative affect to momentary social interaction characteristics (e.g., interaction depth). Individual differences in reactivities were extracted via multilevel modeling (i.e., random slopes) and then predicted with machine learning methods using a variety of person-level variables (i.e., socio-demographics, personality traits, political and societal attitudes). The robustness of predictions was examined by built-in cross-validation and across independent samples. Feature importance and interactions were analyzed with SHapley Additive exPlanations values. Our results suggest that, whereas complex prediction models outperformed a baseline model in predicting individual differences in reactivities in most analyses, the overall predictive performance was limited. This finding underlines the importance of replicating machine learning results across outcomes and independent samples. We revealed several predictive patterns that can stimulate future research, elaborate on limitations of current machine learning approaches for intensive within-person data, and discuss the results against the background of dynamic conceptualizations of personality.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

In this study, we replicate prior validations of the Polar H10 chest strap for individual HR measurement and extend these findings by evaluating its validity for measuring HR synchrony between individuals. Dyads completed a previously validated experimental task designed to elicit HR fluctuations while jointly attending to emotionally evocative, 5-minute audiovisual stimuli. First, we observed strong agreement between the Polar H10 and a gold-standard ECG system in measuring individuals’ HR, both at the aggregate and moment-to-moment levels, thus confirming and extending prior findings. Second, we found high correspondence between the two systems in quantifying dyadic HR synchrony using multiple analytical approaches. These results support the use of the Polar H10 as a low-cost, easy-to-use, and reliable tool for both individual and dyadic HR measurement, particularly in real-world or mobile settings where traditional ECG systems are impractical.",

          "abstract": "Your understanding of what you see now surely influences what you will look at next. Yet this simple concept has only recently begun to be systematically studied and elaborated within theoretical frameworks. The Scene Perception &amp; Event Comprehension Theory (SPECT) distinguishes between front-end and back-end processes that occur while viewers perceive and comprehend dynamic real-world events. Front-end processes occur during each eye fixation (information extraction, attentional selection) and back-end processes occur in memory (the current event model, prior knowledge, and executive processes). We begin with a selective review of the scene perception literature on bottom-up and top-down effects on attentional selection in scenes, and highlight unanswered questions regarding the impact of the viewer's event model–their understanding of what is happening now. Then, we outline the SPECT theoretical framework, and  review empirical evidence  about how the viewer's current event model influences attentional selection. This influence is contrasted with those of visual saliency (e.g., color, brightness, motion, etc.) and task-driven control (i.e., goal setting, attentional control, inhibition). From this review, we specify a hierarchy of factors affecting attentional selection, in the order of task-driven control, visual saliency, and event models. We then propose several mechanisms by which the viewer’s event model influences attentional selection, and propose a systematic approach to investigating how that happens while watching dynamic scenes.

Such beliefs and behaviors—along with students’ perceptions of their instructors—comprise a growth mindset culture that reflects a broader meaning system that shapes academic pursuits.

To address this critical research gap, the goal of the present study was to conduct a conceptual replication of Muenks et al.

Extending this work in a new context, the present study examined these associations in a separate sample of undergraduate students (N = 434) and professional academic advisors (N = 13) at a large public research university in the southeast United States. Results closely mirrored those of the original findings in both magnitude and pattern of significance, except that the present study found a small negative association between advisors’ self-reported growth mindset beliefs and student perceptions of their advisor’s growth mindset beliefs. The present findings raise important questions regarding the similarities and differences in instructional and advising contexts and point to exciting new directions in mindset research that consider the important roles of both instructors and professional academic advisors in shaping student success.",

At the same time, they often face difficulties in accessing healthcare, experience many health inequalities, and are more likely to die of preventable causes than people in the general population. Learning Disability Liaison (LDL) services were established in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to support patients with LD in accessing care. The services aim is to improve the quality of care delivery and ensure an equitable and safe service.\n\nThis review summarises existing evidence from the UK and the ROI regarding the effectiveness of LDL services in improving health-related outcomes for people with LD in secondary care. The review also reports the barriers to and facilitators of implementing LDL services reported in published literature.  The included literature was published between 2002 and 2025. 44 academic studies, organisational reports, and other types of literature were identified. Of these, 21 were academic studies from England, Scotland, Wales, and the ROI, and 23 were organisational reports or other types of literature. \nNo studies assessed the effectiveness of LDL services in improving health outcomes for people with LD, but many focused on assessing the impact of LDL services on the care provided. Some evidence suggested that having LDL nurses was a facilitator of identifying patients with LD. Literature reported that LDL nurses facilitated provision of reasonable adjustments and potentially improved patients experiences with hospital care and their ability to access treatments, however, there was some literature that reported mixed or negative experiences. LDL nurses were sometimes described as playing an important role in preparing and sharing accessible information with patients and carers, facilitating communication between patients and carers and hospital staff, and preparing hospital passports for patients with LD. However, some literature reported that other hospital staff did not always consult hospital passports, making them ineffective. There was some evidence that employing an LDL nurse might be associated with reduced length of stay and readmission rates. The review identified barriers to implementation of LDL services, and also barriers to accessing these services.\nThis review provides a broad overview of the functioning of LDL services, with wide-ranging types of outcomes and examples of practice. This can help in designing LDL services and allocating resources. The evidence on the barriers of implementing and accessing LDL services provides a useful resource for service providers seeking to implement or improve LDL services.\nThere is a need for more independent research evaluating the effectiveness of LDL services, particularly in relation to health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

However, it’s not well understood whether the extent to which cognitive abilities are reflected in students’ school grades varies across socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether prospective associations between cognitive abilities and school grades differ by income-to-needs ratio, parental education, and area deprivation in 11,868 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study – a diverse national pediatric sample from the U.S. We additionally examined further stratification by sex assigned at birth and racial and ethnic identity. Socioeconomic and cognitive variables were measured at baseline (2016-2018; mean age 9.9 years (SD=0.7)). School grades were reported three years post baseline. We show that reading decoding ability and overall crystallized cognition were less predictive of school grades at higher levels of income-to-needs ratio. Stratification by race/ethnicity indicated that the weaker associations between crystallized cognitive functions and school grades at high incomes were only evident in non-Hispanic White students. Higher average academic achievement in this group may be more reliant on factors like greater parental expectations, cognitive stimulation at home, and attendance of schools with grade inflation practices. Conversely, students from less affluent backgrounds may face greater pressures to demonstrate cognitive abilities to receive high grades. In sum, cognitive abilities are not equitably reflected in school grades across economic and racial student strata and potential structural advantages availed to affluent White students in the U.S. require further examination.",

          "authors": "Amanda Makara; Kelsey Hagan; NA; Ann Frances Haynos",
          "abstract": "Dietary restriction, the problematic reduction of caloric or macronutrient intake, is a critical eating behavior occurring transdiagnostically across eating disorders and subclinical disordered eating. The definition of dietary restriction is highly heterogeneous, and restriction is often conflated with other distinct constructs, such as dietary restraint. The current practices related to the definition and measurement of dietary restriction have notable flaws, negatively impacting the ability to identify and establish risk, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. There is also limited evidence that commonly-used dietary restriction measures can validly predict food choice and objective intake. These issues raise questions about whether dietary restriction is a unitary construct or multiple distinct constructs that may be differentially related to adverse outcomes. This thesis examined these issues by performing secondary dimension reduction data analysis from adult participants (N = 89), including individuals with acute anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 18), weight-restored anorexia nervosa (AN-WR; n = 40), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 31), to identify factors of dietary restriction and their relations to clinical variables. First, dimension reduction was performed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on participants’ item-level responses to several measures associated with dietary restriction and restraint to capture different facets of restrictive eating. Subsequently, linear regression analyses examined the relations between resulting dimensions and short- and longer-term indices of objective restriction and affective symptoms. The EFA yielded a two-factor structure wherein one factor comprised cognitive and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor) and the second factor comprised affective and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Affective Restriction). Both factors predicted caloric intake, but the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted lower caloric intake (B = -175.63, SE = 63.89, p = .008), whereas the Affective Restriction factor predicted higher caloric intake (B = 354.65, SE = 161.90, p = .032). Only the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted cross-sectional BMI (p = .005). Both factors predicted cross-sectional depressive symptoms (ps = p = .005). Neither factor predicted follow-up BMI (ps = .740 to .799) affective symptoms (ps = .061 to .904). These findings provide additional evidence to support the multi-dimensional nature of restrictive eating, suggesting that the construct of restrictive eating may comprise cognitive, behavioral, and affective elements that may be associated with differential outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social media plays a central role in adolescents’ lives, suggesting powerful direct and indirect influences on their social norms and behaviors. This study examines these influences by applying the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) hypotheses to social media and physical activity. Physical inactivity is a pressing public health concern, particularly during adolescence, when activity levels often decline. Using data from a three-wave panel survey (N = 1.044), this study analyzes the development of perceived social media exposure among peers, peer influence, social norms, and personal behavior over time. The findings reveal that social media exposure directly increases physical activity but also via indirect effects proposed by IPMI assumptions. Perceived peer exposure and presumed influence on others strengthened injunctive social norms, resulting in higher physical activity. In contrast, no significant effects were found for descriptive social norms. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between injunctive and descriptive norms. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research and public health interventions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

While scholars have theorized the aesthetic and cognitive implications of these narratives, we know far less about how viewers actually experience them. This paper presents findings from a qualitative interview study exploring the subjective dimensions of engaging with narrational complexity. Drawing on 20 in-depth interviews with viewers of complex popular films and series, we identify key experiential themes that cut across cognitive, affective, and reflective dimensions: sense of presence, confusion, narrative play, epistemic emotions (such as curiosity and frustration), and moments of meta-awareness. Using thematic analysis, we show that although navigating narrational complexity can be demanding, viewers often find in this very challenge a source of enjoyment and meaning. Our findings offer a qualitative, data-driven perspective that complements existing media-theoretical and psychological models of narrative processing, with implications for the study of narrative engagement and cognitive film studies.",

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly depression and anxiety. Although emerging evidence emphasises the presence and impact of IU in multiple sclerosis (MS), it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

The prospective associations between DLD and offending, and the educational and criminal justice pathways through which DLD might increase the risk of offending and re-offending, remain unclear. Methods. We analysed existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (maximum N = 6,800; 51% female; 9% with DLD) with linked school data (national pupil database) and crime records (Avon and Somerset Police records for offences committed between ages 13-29 years in the region). DLD was determined when the individuals were aged 7-9 years using direct assessments and parent reports. Regression and mediation models were fitted to the data. Results. Individuals with DLD were nearly twice as likely (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.27, 2.48) to have a recorded offence (i.e., charged or cautioned by the police) compared to those without DLD. School suspension was a significant mediator of the relationship between DLD and recorded offending. However, special educational need identification had no effect on recorded offending for those with DLD. There was also no difference in the odds of being given an out of court disposal or re-offending for individuals with DLD compared to those without DLD. Conclusions. Individuals who have DLD are more likely to be cautioned or convicted for an offence by the police than those without DLD, and this may in part be mediated by school suspension.",

Offenders with ABI show deficiencies in different areas of cognitive functioning and have specific crime-associated characteristics, compared to those without ABI. The prevalence of ABI in detained persons with psychiatric disorders is understudied, despite of forensic relevance. The aim of the current study is to investigate neurocognitive differences and crime characteristics of forensic inpatients with and without ABI.\nThis cross-sectional study included 123 male inpatients detained in a forensic psychiatric hospital located in the Netherlands. Group differences in verbal abilities, memory, cognitive flexibility and attention, as well as age at first offense, previous violent offences and years of previous incarceration were compared between patients with and without ABI.\nFifty-five percent of forensic inpatients had ABI, and this group was 8 years younger at their first offense, more often convicted before the age of 18 and more often had a history of violent offenses. No group differences were found for neurocognitive functioning outcomes.\nThe results emphasize the importance of early ABI screening and awareness for individuals with ABI and associated characteristics. Timely intervention might enhance preventative strategies regarding early criminal activities. Appropriate treatment options could eventually contribute to lowering recidivism rates.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

It also incorporates frameworks from career decision-making models, cognitive styles, automatic behaviors, and social norms to illuminate the mechanisms that drive long-term engagement. Empirical research from over-the top (OTT) streaming services, online visual art platforms, and social media is used to illustrate practical implications for ethical, user-centered HCI design. The findings suggest that a nuanced understanding of cognitive biases, emotional decision-making, and retrospective evaluations can inform app design strategies that both enhance engagement and promote user well-being.",

          "abstract": "Corrugator supercilii (‘frowning muscle’) activity tracks affective valence of linguistic stimuli. According to Embodied cognition accounts this reflects simulation of the emotion at lexical and/or situational levels. Additionally, it may indicate evaluation, i.e., how we feel about an affective event within a context. This study used facial electromyography (fEMG) to examine corrugator responses as participants read short stories. Each story included segments, describing some character’s morally good or bad behavior, a behavior rating, and sentence-initial phrases describing the character’s positive or negative affective states (e.g., ‘Mark is frustrated’), followed by the reason for this. Our prior studies showed substantially more frowning when good characters were ‘frustrated’ compared to ‘happy’, but minimal differences for bad characters, suggesting a multiple-drivers account where both simulation and evaluation influence responses. Crucially, they can counteract in the context of bad characters, e.g., ‘happy’ has positive valence but is unfair in context and the opposite applies to ‘frustrated’. \nTo emphasize characters’ moral status and amplify fairness-based evaluations, an embedded morality judgment rating task was introduced. We hypothesized stronger frowning for “happy” than “frustrated” bad characters due to fairness considerations now outweighing simulation. However, results revealed increased frowning for “frustrated” bad characters. \nThe rating task might have unexpectedly reduced, rather than boosted, evaluative processing through cognitive interference. Nevertheless, previously observed frowning patterns for moral characters were replicated. These findings support a multiple-drivers model but suggest evaluative processes are more complex and layered than current models capture, calling for revisions to incorporate these complexities into affective processing theories.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to extract causal information from direct experience is crucial in making sense of our world. It is therefore puzzling that people often overestimate the relationship between objectively unrelated events. Such causal illusions can be investigated in a contingency learning task, where participants judge the effectiveness of a cue in causing a target outcome based on their observed covariation across a series of trials. When cue and outcome co-occur (cell A trials), the outcome is readily attributed to the cue. But how do participants interpret outcomes in the absence of the cue (cell C trials), where the cause of the outcome is unspecified? We asked participants to provide open-ended (Experiment 1) or forced-choice (Experiments 2 and 3) explanations for trials in a causal illusion task where the cue was a medicine and the outcome was recovery from a disease. Participants inferred a range of plausible hidden causes for cell C recoveries (e.g., stronger immunity, less severe disease, spontaneous recovery). Critically, they rated these causes as less likely to be present on cell A trials, and those who attributed cell A recoveries only to the medicine showed the highest causal ratings for the medicine. Such a selective inference about the scope of a hidden cause may allow learners to explain away cue-absent outcomes that would otherwise undermine the perceived causal strength of the target cue, without violating normative principles. This mechanism may help explain how false causal beliefs can be maintained in the face of a null relationship.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

However, less attention has been paid to the process of constructing causal DAGs. Methodological work often relies on toy examples that have limited practical utility for applied researchers working in complex contexts. This article introduces and demonstrates a stepwise, iterative procedure for drawing credible causal DAGs, which is designed to guide researchers in identifying important sources of confounding while also incorporating research design features of quasi-experiments or random experiments, as well as threats to validity (e.g., measurement error, treatment non-compliance). Although constructing a complete DAG that fully captures the data-generating process is difficult and rarely achievable in practice, we argue that developing a credible DAG—one that includes all plausible sources of confounding—is adequate for applied research. The proposed iterative drawing procedure is directly aligned with the goal of constructing credible causal DAGs.",

While mindfulness in parenting has been linked to mother-infant stress responses, no research has examined its relationship with developmental trajectories of neuroendocrine attunement. This study addresses this gap by examining maternal mindfulness—both alone and in the context of parenting risk and protective factors¬—in relation to mother-infant cortisol attunement over time. Using data from 56 predominantly white, low-income mother-infant dyads followed from 3-18 months postpartum, we tested maternal mindful parenting at 3 months as a predictor of both (1) within-session attunement of mother and infant cortisol responses to acute stress and (2) across-session attunement of developmental shifts in their cortisol levels from 6-18 months. Three-level hierarchical linear revealed that higher maternal mindful parenting, greater history of positive parental bonding, and lower parenting stress were associated with more inverse mother-infant cortisol attunement across timepoints. Additionally, parenting stress moderated the effect of mindful parenting: the inverse relation with attunement held for most dyads (60%), though reversed for those with the highest stress levels (top 9%). Findings delineate when and how positive versus inverse attunement may be adaptive and underscore the role of mindful parenting in mother-infant psychophysiological stress co-adaptation.",

In a preregistered experiment (N = 1,224 U.S. adults endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory), participants were randomized to a dialogue with an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) prompted to debunk their belief, or one of two control conditions. The debunking dialogue substantially reduced belief in antisemitic conspiracies relative to controls, and increased favorability toward Jews among initially unfavorable participants. These findings show that even deeply rooted, identity-linked conspiracies can be effectively debunked through factual correction, offering new insight into prejudice reduction and suggesting that LLM chatbots may help reduce antisemitism at scale.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

However, the various methods used to identify stalls were limited by reliance on irregular inter-survey intervals, inconsistent definitions, and failure to account for measurement uncertainty. We propose a new probabilistic approach for identifying fertility transition stalls based on the results of the 2024 revision of World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2024a) and apply it to all countries for periods when total fertility is above 2.1 live births per woman. Our method is not restricted to inter-survey intervals; it uses all available data from all available data sources, incorporates biases and measurement errors, and provides probabilistic estimates of fertility stalls. We compared our findings for sub-Saharan Africa to those in the literature and found that the probability of many previously identified stalls is quite low based on the data available. We also identify several stalls (or reversals) in fertility decline across all regions since 1950 and discuss potential reasons for these changes in fertility trends.",

To explain, we develop a framework of experience-based accountability, arguing that the electoral effect of adaptation is path-dependent: prior crisis experience sets the standard for what voters perceive as a sufficient policy. Consistent with this, we find modest electoral rewards where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence indicates that, prior to the policy, residents of high-disruption areas already held more negative and crystallized views of the governor. We offer a framework for the politics of adaptation, showing that credit depends on perceived sufficiency: a standard set not only by the policy, but also by voters’ prior experience with the crisis.",

          "abstract": "This study estimates the near-term risk of renewed Israel–Iran escalation using a modular, multi-model framework that converts expert judgments and open-source indicators into probabilistic scenarios over a 90-day horizon. We elicit LOW–CENTRAL–HIGH priors from domain experts across 18 indicators spanning air/missile, land, maritime, cyber, diplomacy, information, and proxy alignment (including Israeli standoff and air-strike activity), then fuse evidence via Bayesian updating and infer a weekly escalation state on a seven-rung ladder with a light stocks/flows scaffold for magazines, interceptor use, and repair/re-supply constraints. We triangulate forecasts across three complementary stacks (Bayesian state-space, statistical ensemble, and game-theoretic signalling). At the analysis cut-off (2025-10-22, UK), All three models agree that S1 (Managed Conflict) is modal, S2 (Northern War with Maritime Squeeze) is the principal alternative, and S3–S4 remain lower-probability tails. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the S1&lt;-&gt;S2 margin is most responsive to air/missile defence saturation and combined launch/strike pressure together with maritime war-risk stress, with mediation activity providing the strongest stabilising counterweight. We also formalise tail-risk triggers for potential state fracture and specify how crossing them would reweight S4. The result is a transparent, updateable, and non-partisan forecast designed for decision support: it communicates where risk mass sits, what could move it, and which levers plausibly bend trajectories while avoiding operationally sensitive detail.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To develop, calibrate, and evaluate a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to reduce citation screening workload for COVID-19 research.\nMethods: Citations from the WHO COVID-19 Research Database were used to train a logistic regression classifier, which was then calibrated using another independent dataset. A lower threshold was set, below which, records could be excluded from manual screening, and an upper threshold, above which, records could be automatically included into the database. The classifier was then validated on eight COVID-19 reviews to assess workload reduction and recall.\nFindings: The WHO-Cochrane-EPPI classifier was calibrated for 99% recall, with an upper threshold of 70% and a lower threshold of 39%. During validation, it achieved 98.6% recall across eight reviews. A smaller set of three reviews estimated a 12.5% workload reduction, with 1,390 of 11,153 records below the lower threshold. For database use, workload reduction was estimated at 80%, with 8,955 out of 11,153 records being automatically screened.\nConclusion: The WHO-Cochrane-UCL classifier significantly reduces manual screening workload with minimal risk of missing studies. It serves as a model for integrating machine learning into curated resources like the WHO COVID-19 Research Database, improving sustainability by reducing manual screening efforts. The classifier can also be adapted for systematic reviews on COVID-19 and other topics.",

Such approaches, however, are unlikely to offer actionable guidance to those developers (and their institutions) who are looking for strategies to minimise potential bias. This paper presents findings from a systematic literature review exploring existing work on how AI developers can mitigate bias in the field of engineering biology. A systematic search was conducted on the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published between 2015 and 2024. The findings from 51 reviewed articles showed that recommendations for bias mitigation within healthcare tended to be grouped around seven key themes, namely diversity in teams, training and education, awareness and responsibility, diversity of data, collaboration with end users and beneficiaries, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency. While these recommendations provide useful suggestions for reducing bias, they generally fail to provide actionable guidance or empirical evidence about how these strategies can be operationalised in a real-world setting. More research is needed to test the effectiveness and practicality of these recommendations across different scientific and clinical contexts as well as among different types of development teams.",

To address this question, we develop a model of LP competition and uncover a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off: toxic swaps yield payoffs independent of other LPs’ strategies, whereas non-toxic swaps generate payoffs that depend on strategic competition among LPs. We demonstrate that concentrated liquidity increasingly outperforms traditional mechanisms as swap toxicity rises, while at low toxicity levels, competitive pressure can instead worsen LP payoffs. Comparative statics further show that equilibrium liquidity provision rises with toxicity, volatility, and LP competition but falls with fees. Together, these patterns suggest how LPs should optimally adjust their strategies to market conditions.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

This qualitative study explored the factors contributing to teacher attrition and identified strategies to improve retention. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 28 teachers across 16 U.S. states who had either left the profession or were actively considering departure. Thematic analysis revealed four primary drivers of attrition: unsustainable workloads, inadequate administrative support, particularly regarding student behavior, insufficient compensation, and diminished professional autonomy. Participants also reported experiences of moral conflict and burnout, shaped by systemic challenges and shifting expectations following the COVID-19 pandemic. While some teachers indicated they would not return under any circumstances, others identified potential interventions, including increased pay, stronger leadership support, and reduced non-instructional responsibilities. These findings suggest that teacher attrition stems from multiple factors, highlighting the need for systemic reforms to support teacher well-being and retention.",

          "abstract": "Southern Central America played a key role in the continent-wide transition to the Neolithic and the transmission of its culture between South and Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, there has been a notable decline in linking processes within this region to contemporary developments in the rest of the continent. Here, there are early indicators of the Neolithic, besides evidence of the movement of cultigens and likely information about pottery manufacturing towards the other continent. Using a co-adaptive framework, I examine the social and ecological changes during the Archaic and Early Formative American Neotropics and adjacent regions, highlighting surprising networks that moved plants, goods and cultural systems during these periods. I focus mainly on the behaviors that link humans with their natural environments, beyond mere social changes occurring at the level of the producer. Finally, I present a Bayesian analysis of 161 radiocarbon dates from 39 sites in Costa Rica and Panama from the Late Archaic through the Middle Formative. These methods can identify anomalous dates and generate probability distributions regarding chronological questions about eight different material culture complexes: In Tilaran-Arenal, Fortuna* and Tronadora; in the Costa Rican Atlantic Watershed, La Montaña, in Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete* and Black Creek; and in Gran Coclé, the Preceramic B tradition and Monagrillo (archaic assemblages denoted with an asterisk*). I argue that there exists evidence for the early presence of ceramic from 4840-4144 BC cal, representing a correction to the established chronology of 1000-3000 years. Early ceramic complexes commonly interpreted as Formative coexisted with Archaic-period assemblages for hundreds, if not thousands of years before the abandonment of archaic-style complexes. Therefore, the presence of ceramics is not a sufficient marker of social processes commonly associated with the Formative. Resumen: El Sur de Centroamérica jugó un papel crucial en la transición al Neolítico y en la transmisión de la cultura neolítica entre Sudamérica y Mesoamérica. A pesar de ello, se ha disminuido la relación de procesos en esta región con el resto del continente. Aquí se encuentran tempranos indicadores del Neolítico, evidencia del tránsito de cultígenos y probable información sobre alfarería hacia el otro continente. Examinando los procesos sociales y ecológicos durante el Arcaico y Formativo temprano en el Neotrópico Americano y regiones aledañas desde una perspectiva co-adaptiva, destaco la sorprendente movilidad de plantas, bienes y sistemas culturales durante estos periodos. Me enfoco en los comportamientos que vinculan a los humanos con sus ambientes, más allá de los procesos sociales a nivel productivo. Un análisis Bayesiano de 161 determinaciones radiométricas de 39 sitios en Costa Rica y Panamá, desde el Arcaico tardío hasta el Formativo medio, permite identificar las determinaciones aberrantes y generar distribuciones de probabilidad sobre cuestiones cronológicas para ocho diferentes complejos: en Tilarán-Arenal, Fortuna* y Tronadora; en el Vertiente Atlántico Costarricense, La Montaña; en el Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete*, y Black Creek; y en el Gran Coclé, Preceramic B* y Monagrillo (complejos arcaicos marcados con asterisco*). Argumento que existe evidencia de la presencia temprana de alfarería desde 4840 - 4144 a.C. cal, representando una corrección en la cronología establecida de 1000-3000 años. Los complejos cerámicos frecuentemente interpretados como Formativos coexistieron con los complejos Arcaicos durante cientos, sino miles, de años antes del abandono de complejos asociados con la caza-recolección. Así, la presencia plena de alfarería no puede considerarse como un marcador de los procesos sociales asociados con el periodo Formativo.",

Nine policy instruments stood out for their high perceived potential, feasibility, and independence from economic growth: phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, greening credit regulations, North-South technology transfer, carbon consumption taxes, long-term warranties, repair infrastructure, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, ecological education, and environmental justice-focused education. Perceptions of higher policy potential were closely associated with greater perceived feasibility and a degrowth orientation in respondents’ own work.

Drawing on frameworks from other emerging literacies, we conceptualize demographic literacy as a multidimensional competence grounded in both demographic knowledge and its practical application.\nEmpirically, we focus on demographic literacy about ageing, operationalized through the knowledge of two key demographic processes that characterize post-transitional societies: the increase in the older population and the decline in younger cohorts. Using a nationally representative survey of 1,575 adults (Ipsos–Osservatorio Senior, 2023) living in Italy - one of the world’s most aged societies - and adopting a Machine Learning (ML) approach, we examine the socio-demographic patterns of demographic knowledge about ageing. Results reveal that nearly one-third of respondents lack basic knowledge of population ageing, with marked educational and economic gradients: low education and low income significantly reduce the probability of correct understanding and reinforce each other in predicting demographic illiteracy. The pronounced social gradient in demographic knowledge limits the capacity of some groups to apply it, reducing their potential to convert knowledge into agency. These findings call for policies that promote demographic literacy as a lever for inclusion, empowering citizens to better understand and respond to population change.",

          "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are standard tools for modeling social and\nphysical phenomena from the ground up by building detailed simulations in which\nindividual agents interact and study emergent behavior. However, since they are simulations,\nit is challenging to generalize or even quantitatively interpret the results. A\nfrequent output of an ABM model is a grid with points of one or more classes that\nrepresent the agents’ configuration over time. A canonical example is the Schelling\nsegregation model, where agents of two types follow a simple relocation rule based\non their tolerance to the proportion of different agents in a given location, resulting in\na segregated configuration that is visually revealing but not quantitative. In this work,\nwe propose assigning a quantitative measure of entropy, based on the spatial configuration\nof the steady state of the Schelling model, to a range of population values in\nthe model using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques. The resulting dataset\nof quantitative metrics related to the original configuration is analyzed via Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) methods to obtain a representation\nof the system dynamics in the form of an ordinary differential equation.",

          "authors": "Manuel Linsenmeier; Jeffrey Shrader",
          "abstract": "Weather forecasts provide substantial economic value for society, but differences in forecast accuracy across regions can potentially exacerbate existing---and create new---economic inequalities. These differences are particularly important given the role of weather forecasts in helping prevent damage from future climate change. In this paper, we provide a global analysis of the accuracy of numerical weather predictions of temperature and relate our findings to existing economic inequalities. We report two stylized facts: First, temperature forecasts are much more accurate in high-income countries compared to low-income countries. A seven-day-ahead forecast in a high-income country is, on average, more accurate than a one-day-ahead forecast in a low-income country. Second, while forecast accuracy has improved steadily since 1985, a persistent gap remains between high and low-income countries. These disparities result from both differences in the inherent scientific challenge of weather predictability across regions and from unequal weather observing infrastructure. Poorer countries have fewer land-based weather stations and radiosondes as well as lower reporting rates from existing infrastructure. Low-income countries also appear to have lower institutional capacity to issue official, local weather forecasts. Remedying the differences in monitoring infrastructure could help reduce the gap in forecast accuracy between rich and poor countries.",

          "abstract": "Obesity remains a highly contested issue across traditional media, digital platforms, and within academic and professional communities. This article explores the controversies and tensions surrounding obesity, its prevention, and weight loss, with a particular focus on the Finnish context. Drawing on international examples, the analysis highlights how global debates shape local understandings and responses. Four key areas of contention are identified: the definition and conceptualization of obesity; the methods used to measure it; the approaches deemed most effective for treatment; and the question of responsibility. These debates reflect fundamentally divergent perspectives that cannot be fully reconciled— and arguably should not be. Each viewpoint contributes valuable insights into how obesity is understood and addressed in contemporary society. By examining these controversies, the article reveals the complexity and discomfort that often accompany public and professional discourse on obesity.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is widely recognised as a key life stage, yet its meaning and experience remain under-explored due to the complex interplay between biological and social transformations. While researchers across fields such as psychology and public health increasingly frame adolescence as a “critical period,” anthropology offers distinctive insights that challenge simplistic and reductionist accounts. This special issue introduces the Anthropology of Adolescence, situating the discipline as an important contributor to the emerging interdisciplinary interest in adolescence. Drawing on a century of anthropological engagement, we emphasise adolescence not simply as a passage between childhood and adulthood, but as a dynamic biocultural stage through which broader social, political, and ecological processes can be understood. The contributions presented here span different forms of anthropology, employing varied methods from structured interviews and focus groups to multimodal ethnographic research. Together, they demonstrate the breadth of anthropological research, foregrounding themes such as spatiality, intersectionality, and socialisation. In doing so, this issue illustrates why anthropology and adolescence go together, and how the discipline can enrich wider debates on this vital life stage.",

          "authors": "Francesco Rampazzo; Jakub Bijak; Agnese Vitali; Ingmar Weber; Emilio Zagheni",
          "abstract": "Accurate and timely estimates of migrant population stocks, disaggregated by age and sex, are critical for population projections and for understanding migration dynamics. This study proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model that extends previous work by incorporating age and sex disaggregation, using data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and digital traces from the Facebook Advertising Platform. A Bayesian multinomial–Dirichlet–Dirichlet model harmonizes age and sex profiles from the two sources, leveraging the Rogers–Castro framework to characterize migration age schedules and utilizing the conjugate nature of Dirichlet priors to ensure computational efficiency. We illustrate the framework using data on migrant populations in the United Kingdom for 2018 and 2019, based on the two sources: the Labour Force Survey and Facebook. The analysis identifies three distinct migrant groups with differing age and sex profiles: younger Western and Southern European migrants, slightly older Central and Eastern Europeans, and a predominantly older Irish migrant population. Facebook data enhances the coverage of younger migrants, who are often underrepresented in traditional surveys, while the LFS provides broader demographic context and helps benchmark the estimates to standard population definitions. The findings highlight the utility of integrating traditional and digital data sources to address gaps in migration statistics. This framework enables more accurate disaggregation of migrant population stock data and offers a scalable, computationally efficient methodology for improving migration estimates, particularly in contexts lacking ground-truth data. The approach also yields insights into migration patterns and demographic structures, with potential applications in policy planning and demographic research.",

          "abstract": "Modern social policies, including cash benefits and public services have emerged to compensate for the loss of solidarity at the local level. While reducing poverty and increasing welfare, these policies have tended to remain technocratic, their democratic legitimacy being contested. This paper examines contemporary Western social policy in the light of Hannah Arendt’s distinction between making and acting. Making is the human condition of worldliness. We live in a world of durables and construct these durables through the process of making. Acting is the human condition of plurality. We live together with others and must therefore agree on the forms of our social life. For Arendt acting and making are strictly separate activities. Therefore, the means-ends schema plays no role in politics, which is about acting together. Thus, social policy is not about reaching a pre-defined outcome in technocratic fashion but about the negotiation and agreement on the forms of our social life.",

          "authors": "Jihun Yeo",
          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of internet technologies has substantially transformed sexual socialization among Indian youth, with digital platforms providing unprecedented access to pornography. This study investigates patterns of pornography consumption, perceptions toward it, the influence on sexual and gender identity, and associated psychosocial impacts among 100 youth respondents, primarily college students aged 18 to 30, across diverse backgrounds.\n\nFindings reveal that 13% of participants use pornography daily, demonstrating significant frequent engagement, while a majority also access it with varying less frequent patterns. Early exposure during adolescence is common, with 59% reporting first exposure before age 18. Smartphones (75%) and websites (74%) dominate access. Youth demonstrate divided moral perspectives, with 31% viewing pornography as morally wrong and an equal proportion (31%) considering it normal or acceptable. Guilt or anxiety is prevalent, reported by 65%. Approximately 29% report negative effects on self-esteem, body image, and sexual confidence, with 30% indicating functional impairments in education, work, or time management. The effects of pornography on sexual identity differ; 60–70% indicate no alteration in gender or identity confidence, while 20–28% report an expanded understanding or exploration, and some express confusion or diminished confidence. Gender differences emerge clearly: males tend to consume pornography more frequently and predominantly prefer heterosexual content, while females and non-binary youth display more diverse consumption patterns and greater variability in content preferences.\n\nThe study highlights a critical moral-behavior disconnect and points out that it requires comprehensive sex education, destigmatization, and mental health support tailored to digital sexualities. These insights contribute to the sociological discourse on youth and sexuality in India, offering empirical evidence to inform policy, educational practice, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we present the Indigenous Circular Economy (IndCE); not as a novel framework, but as an enduring system of stewardship, resilience, and relationality practiced by Indigenous communities for generations. As Indigenous (Yurok/Hoopa) and non-Indigenous co-authors, we draw on historical analysis, forest science, Yurok oral tradition, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to demonstrate how IndCE repairs the ecological and cultural harm of capitalist economies by weaving together forest health with human health. Through a case study of the Yurok Tribe in Northern California, we highlight how IndCE is not just a cultural or local economic alternative. It is a paradigm shift away from economic perspectives that ignore culture, history, land, and non-human &amp; human relationships. The Yurok stewardship practices that support its IndCE (e.g. Good Fire) provide a slew of benefits: wildfire risk mitigation, ecosystem restoration, economic revitalization, and cultural resilience. The Yurok case reveals the urgency of legitimizing and resourcing Indigenous-led ecological governance. We identify persistent policy and funding barriers that undermine this work and offer concrete paths forward to support it. This paper contributes to broader debates on sustainable economics, Indigenous rights, and community-led conservation. It also raises critical questions for non-Indigenous communities about how some state systems may sometimes obstruct, rather than support, regenerative land stewardship, cultural continuity, and ecological care. The Yurok model shows that another type of economy is not only possible; it already exists.",

While prior research highlights the online prominence of far-right and radical populist actors, most studies are limited to single platforms or national contexts. This study presents the first cross- platform and cross-national analysis of digital campaign communication by 401 parties across all 27 EU member states during the 2024 Euro- pean Parliament election. Using data from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, and YouTube, we examine party activity and audience engage- ment. By linking digital trace data with expert surveys, we test whether populist radical right parties disproportionately succeed in raising engage- ment online. Our findings confirm strong platform-specific advantages of radical populist parties, particularly on TikTok, YouTube and Facebook. We also observe high engagement for far-left populist parties with similar emotional and anti-elitist communication strategies. The more Eurosceptic positions a party holds, or the more frequently experts describe them to use emotional appeals or anti-elitist communication, the more audience engagement they received across several platforms. Overall the findings emphasize a disproportionate online support for radical populist parties across the European Union.",

Seven key themes emerged: early influences and role models, family and life-course pressures, gendered dynamics in daily practice, structural inequities, wellness and burnout, leadership and mentorship, and visions for the future of medicine. Participants described how career demands often conflicted with family responsibilities, how bias and misidentification shaped legitimacy, and how systemic burdens intensified burnout. Yet they also emphasized the strength of resilience, mentorship, and optimism regarding technology, as well as collective advocacy. These narratives suggest that achieving gender equity in medicine is essential not only to ensure justice among clinicians but also to sustain compassionate, high-quality patient care.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces and operationalizes the novel concept of demographic literacy, defined as the ability to access, understand, and critically interpret demographic information and to use it for informed life-course decisions. Drawing on frameworks from other emerging literacies, we conceptualize demographic literacy as a multidimensional competence grounded in both demographic knowledge and its practical application.\nEmpirically, we focus on demographic literacy about ageing, operationalized through the knowledge of two key demographic processes that characterize post-transitional societies: the increase in the older population and the decline in younger cohorts. Using a nationally representative survey of 1,575 adults (Ipsos–Osservatorio Senior, 2023) living in Italy - one of the world’s most aged societies - and adopting a Machine Learning (ML) approach, we examine the socio-demographic patterns of demographic knowledge about ageing. Results reveal that nearly one-third of respondents lack basic knowledge of population ageing, with marked educational and economic gradients: low education and low income significantly reduce the probability of correct understanding and reinforce each other in predicting demographic illiteracy. The pronounced social gradient in demographic knowledge limits the capacity of some groups to apply it, reducing their potential to convert knowledge into agency. These findings call for policies that promote demographic literacy as a lever for inclusion, empowering citizens to better understand and respond to population change.",

And their functions in teaching cover a wide range, from knowledge imparting and understanding to exploration, feedback, and assessment, permeating the entire process of classroom learning. Thirdly, the research finds that the application of AI enhances students’ cognitive, emotional, and behavioral abilities. However, it also faces significant challenges such as technical thresholds and insufficient reliability of generated content.

          "abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we study West Germans aged 50–59 with an innovative two-step approach addressing these shortcomings. First, life-course feature selection identifies key wealth predictors, such as education and unemployment experiences, but also family life-course characteristics and homemaking. Second, we apply the Ñopo decomposition to quantify their contribution to the gender wealth gap. Results show that family-related factors, including homemaking, and the sequencing and timing of life-course transitions decisively shape women’s lower wealth. Gender-exclusive experiences, for which there is no counterfactual, account for much of the gap, underscoring how entrenched life-course inequalities translate into lasting economic disadvantage for women.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization in America has intensified beyond mere disagreement to what scholars characterize as sectarianism – a condition where partisan identity fundamentally shapes moral judgments. A key marker of sectarianism is asymmetric moral standards for violence, where aggression against political opponents is considered more justified than identical violence targeting one's own group. Using a survey experiment featuring a realistic political rally scenario, we find compelling evidence in support of such sectarianism: partisan bias in the US extends to evaluations of political violence. By manipulating the partisan affiliations of perpetrators and targets, as well as provocation severity, we find that both Democrats and Republicans exhibit substantial and symmetrical partisan bias. This double standard is particularly pronounced among strong partisans, who are nearly three times more likely to justify violence against the opposition than violence targeting their own party. These results extend sectarianism theory beyond policy preferences to physical violence, suggesting partisan identity now functions as a powerful perceptual filter that can legitimize political aggression when directed at opponents.",

          "abstract": "Modern social policies, including cash benefits and public services have emerged to compensate for the loss of solidarity at the local level. While reducing poverty and increasing welfare, these policies have tended to remain technocratic, their democratic legitimacy being contested. This paper examines contemporary Western social policy in the light of Hannah Arendt’s distinction between making and acting. Making is the human condition of worldliness. We live in a world of durables and construct these durables through the process of making. Acting is the human condition of plurality. We live together with others and must therefore agree on the forms of our social life. For Arendt acting and making are strictly separate activities. Therefore, the means-ends schema plays no role in politics, which is about acting together. Thus, social policy is not about reaching a pre-defined outcome in technocratic fashion but about the negotiation and agreement on the forms of our social life.",

          "abstract": "This preprint presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding intersex bodies through the lenses of corporality, subjectivity, and emotions. Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

          "abstract": "This study examines negotiation effectiveness through AI-mediated simulations. Eight models – four contemporary (Principled Negotiation, 3D Negotiation, Voss, Shell) and four spiritually inspired (Confucian, Daoist, Sufi, Tibetan Buddhist) – were tested across 8,506 simulations conducted by three AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) acting as interpretive agents. The analysis spanned bilateral, multilateral, distributive, integrative, crisis, and communication-constrained scenarios, revealing a “context paradox”: models effective in one setting often faltered in another. Spiritually inspired approaches excelled in emotionally complex and relational contexts, while tactically optimized models thrived in structured, goal-driven situations. Under language barriers, models emphasizing authenticity and emotional intelligence showed greater adaptability, highlighting communication resilience as a key negotiation capability. Conversely, contemporary approaches proved particularly effective in maximizing quantifiable outcomes and sustaining strategic coherence under competing priorities. These findings challenge the outcome-centric orientation of mainstream negotiation research and support a pluralistic, context-sensitive understanding of negotiation effectiveness, showing that contextual variation fundamentally shapes negotiation practice.",

This study statistically investigates whether lunar phases influence the timing of childbirth in Japan using a dataset of 135,748 birth records collected via the web service charapla.net between 2010 and 2017.\n\nMethods: Lunar age (0–29) at birth was calculated for each individual, and expected frequencies were derived via a calendar-based simulation reflecting astronomical cycle length. The goodness-of-fit was analyzed using the Chi-square test and effect size (Cohen’s w).\n\nResults: The distribution was nearly flat, with no increased births near the New Moon or Full Moon. Although a statistically significant deviation was detected (χ²(29) = 55.43, p = 0.0022), the effect size was negligible (w = 0.02).\n\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that there is no substantial association between lunar phases and birth rates in the contemporary Japanese population. The findings challenge popular belief and reinforce evidence-based medical and social decision-making.",

This white paper presents a governance-focused approach to scenario planning as a strategic tool for boards of directors to anticipate and navigate disruptive technological changes. We outline a six-stage Adaptive Tech Scenario Governance Cycle that integrates scenario planning into board oversight processes, ensuring organizations remain resilient and proactive amid uncertainty. The proposed approach bridges academic foresight techniques and practical board governance needs, providing clear guidance on conducting annual technology disruption scenario workshops and embedding their outcomes into corporate strategy and risk management. Scenario case studies – covering artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and climate-tech disruptions – illustrate how boards can use scenario planning to uncover emerging risks and opportunities. Finally, the paper offers implementation templates and checklists to operationalize this approach, along with a discussion of limitations and future directions. The goal is to equip governance practitioners with a concrete, repeatable method to enhance strategic foresight and organizational preparedness for the next wave of tech disruption",

          "abstract": "AI adoption varies systematically across generations, with differential exposure to technology shaping patterns of engagement, reliance, and risk. I propose that generational priming skews the anthropomorphism baseline, producing cohort-specific tendencies in adoption and vulnerability. Older adults, shaped by the scarcity and novelty of early digital systems, anthropomorphize minimally and face risks tied to misunderstanding and misinformation. Bridge cohorts, transitioning from analog to digital, exhibit situational anthropomorphism and mixed vulnerabilities. Younger generations, immersed in digital environments from birth, often default to relational engagement with AI, raising identity-level concerns such as coherence erosion, dependency, and epistemic drift. While most existing evidence is cross-sectional or short-term, converging findings from developmental, design, and clinical studies suggest stronger emotional engagement, blurred human/AI boundaries, and heightened sensitivity to linguistic and interface cues among youth. Policy, regulation, and design can leverage these generational differences through measures such as transparent AI disclosures in youth-facing platforms, funding longitudinal studies that track identity development under AI exposure, and creating interdisciplinary advisory panels that bridge HCI, developmental psychology, and clinical research.",

Yet, because CSS, much like other scientific disciplines, operates within structural contexts addressing social bias remains a critical issue requiring attention in the field. Social bias, defined as the systematic discrimination and stereotyping of groups and individuals, relates to CSS in multiple ways. Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field. With our contribution, we seek to demonstrate the breadth of ways in which social bias and CSS intersect and to chart paths toward a more equitable and robust CSS.",

Findings indicate high engagement with social media, with older participants showing higher usage levels (p = .006). Platform use was function-specific: Instagram and Facebook facilitated broad information sharing, while WhatsApp supported tactical grassroots organizing such as donation coordination. Despite widespread participation (64% shared verified information), efforts were undermined by rumours and a lack of two-way engagement with formal disaster agencies.

This paper introduces the key principles and the relevant pedagogical practices for transitioning from content-driven to context-driven learning: dispositions, discernment, and productive inquiry. By engaging in an iterative cycle of discernment, prompt, prototype, and iteration within real-world challenge spaces presented in various degrees and forms, students cultivate their unique dispositions while practicing discernment and productive inquiry as tools for learning. Drawing on a case study from a cross-disciplinary school that helps students explore challenges at the intersections of technology, arts and design, and business, we illustrate how the challenge-based reflective learning (CBRL) framework equips learners to navigate complex sociotechnical entanglements and develop reflective practice essential in the age of AI. This learning framework emphasizes associative learning over progressive learning, focusing on cultivating a mindset equipped to address the real-world complexities.

          "authors": "Alen Kaminski",
          "abstract": "The comparative analysis of authoritarian regimes has traditionally oscillated between the Scylla of \"great man\" theories, which reduce macro-historical patterns to biographical contingency, and the Charybdis of structural determinism, which often obscures the distinct character of specific regimes behind statistical aggregates. While contemporary structural-demographic models excel at forecasting the temporal onset of systemic crises, they remain largely silent on the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the specific morphology of the successor regime. This article addresses this predictive gap by proposing the Ideological Correspondence Hypothesis. Building upon the Anatomy of Chaos theoretical framework, we posit that the operational strategy of a regime is structurally determined by the epistemological architecture of its dominant ideology. We argue that regimes grounded in materialist-rationalist epistemologies instinctively prioritize Structural Resilience Engineering (SRI), creating systems that are institutionally robust yet brittle in the face of legitimacy deficits. Conversely, regimes grounded in irrationalist-mythic epistemologies prioritize Archetypal Mobilization (AAI), generating intense charismatic loyalty but structural vulnerability to elite fragmentation. Through a comparative analysis of paradigmatic historical cases—contrasting the survival of the Stalinist bureaucracy against the collapse of the Nazi charismatic state, and examining the internal epistemological shift from Maoist voluntarism to Dengist pragmatism—we demonstrate that a regime’s underlying theory of knowledge serves as a robust predictor of its strategic behavior and post-crisis trajectory. Finally, we extend this hypothesis to contemporary geopolitical analysis, offering falsifiable forecasts for the trajectories of current theocratic and neo-authoritarian regimes, suggesting that the study of ideology must move beyond descriptive sociology to become a central component of predictive political science.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical and computational accounts of prehistoric warfare and migration frequently assume stochastic encounter probabilities of conflict and dispersal among forager groups. This review challenges that assumption. Synthesising ethnographic, archaeological, and ancient-DNA evidence, I demonstrate that both lethal conflict and dispersal in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene were systematically constrained by spatial proximity and kinship structure. Distance imposes energetic and informational costs that restrict routine interactions to neighbouring groups, while genealogical relatedness modulates cooperation and violence. Across studies, intergroup conflict concentrates at boundaries between genetically dissimilar communities. Migration follows short-range, kin-biased pathways producing spatial gradients of relatedness. Contradictory findings derive from methodological limitations and do not invalidate the predominant pattern. Recognizing warfare and migration as structured processes clarifies selective pressures shaping cooperation and offers an empirical basis for interpreting localized violence, displacement patterns, and institutional resilience in contemporary populations.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and challenges of maintaining scientific rigor that passed through peer review but were uncovered in the responses. The prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews and supports the creation of “meta-reviews” that integrate multiple critiques of a study. It also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in identifying influential articles and valid responses.

          "abstract": "Same-race teachers are linked to better academic outcomes for minoritized students, yet most students never encounter a teacher who shares their racial background. Prior work underscores the benefits of race-matched instruction but focuses on overall workforce diversity rather than the institutional structures that make cross-racial contact possible. We formalize this opportunity as race-match sufficiency, defined as whether the expected number of same-race teachers for students of a given race at a school is at least one. We treat this sufficiency measure as a structural property of schools. Using administrative data from 8,691 Texas public schools serving 5.4 million students, we model sufficiency as a function of racial composition, enrollment, grade span, and district context. Same-race student concentration emerges as the dominant factor, following a steep nonlinear S-curve whose thresholds differ markedly across racial groups. Secondary grade configurations and larger campuses modestly expand opportunities, yet disparities persist: white students experience near-universal sufficiency, Black students experience moderate access, and Hispanic students experience chronic underexposure—even in majority-Hispanic settings. These results show how diversity translates unevenly into contact and illustrate a portable framework for exposure-based staffing metrics that can be applied wherever administrative data exist.",

We theorize that unexplained\nvariance in regression models can serve as an indirect indicator of both good and bad\nluck. Building on the Breen and Goldthorpe model of educational inequality, we\nintroduce a stochastic component and derive a novel hypothesis: luck plays a greater\nrole, and thus generates more variability in outcomes, when structural resources and\nindividual propensity for education are misaligned, specifically for low-SES students with\nhigh educational propensity and high-SES students with low propensity. We test this\nhypothesis using variance function regression models with sibling fixed effects on two\nU.S. datasets. The results support our expectations: educational outcomes are most\nvolatile when parental SES and educational propensity diverge, particularly among low-\nSES students with high propensity, whose attainment appears most exposed to chance.\nWe conclude by discussing implications for the emerging sociology of luck and for\nresearch on inequality and mobility more broadly.",

          "abstract": "This commentary proposes a renewed place-based understanding of ageing and social care research, drawing together evidence from an updated review of interventions for social isolation and insights from public engagement in contrasting urban and coastal settings. Despite a longstanding policy emphasis on ‘ageing in place’, structural conditions across England remain uneven, with rural and coastal communities often experiencing shrinking services, limited transport, digital exclusion, and fragile social infrastructures. Our updated umbrella review of 75 recent publications indicates that psychological, social, and hybrid interventions can reduce loneliness, but their impacts are inconsistent, often short-lived, and rarely examined across different geographical settings. We found no study adopted a genuinely place-based framework, leaving questions about how local environments shape both risk factors and intervention effectiveness. Insights from community engagement in London and coastal Lincolnshire further illustrate how place influences everyday experiences of ageing, highlighting shared challenges, such as fragmented services, digital barriers, and rising living costs. Whereas urban location-specific issues included isolation amid density, geographically close inequalities, and limited continuity of services, by contrast, people in coastal communities cited transport deprivation, seasonal and precarious economies and the erosion of community spaces. Taken together, these findings show that spatial inequalities are widening and that research failing to account for these, risks reinforcing them. A strengthened place-based research agenda is needed to ensure interventions are equitable, context-sensitive, and grounded in lived experience.",

It operates fully offline with a system of Computational Epistemological Canons (CEC) that formalize classical principles of sociological object construction and convert them into heuristic rules applied to the user’s text. This logic avoids ambiguities, clarifies causal mechanisms, selects the appropriate analytical level, and identifies empirically viable indicators without delegating epistemology to external algorithms.\n\nValidated across five universities in Spain, Cuba, and Brazil (W = 0.81–0.84), SOCIOKAIROS constitutes a transparent, theoretically grounded tool for research and teaching, also integrable into Moodle through SCORM as a verifiable form of innovation.",

To understand the relationship between search behavior and the probability of a serendipitous discovery, we propose a formal modeling framework based on the 𝑁𝐾model. Our simulations suggest that searchers with a clear hypothesis convert good fortune into fitness or value far more effectively. Searchers that pursue their theories through incremental steps instead of long-distance jumps have the highest rates of serendipitous success. Our model also provides insight into the role of bias, inaccurate or incorrect beliefs, and the ruggedness of the terrain in determining the rate of serendipitous discovery.

          "abstract": "U.S. life expectancy plateaued since 2010 and declined in 2014-2017 and 2020–2021, increasing the gap between the United States and its peers. This analysis calculated U.S. trends in the number of individuals who lost a close kin, such as a mother, father, at least one sibling, or at least one child, and how the number of bereaved people changes under counterfactual mortality conditions. We found that adverse mortality in 2010–2019 and spikes in mortality in 2020–2021 resulted in a substantial increase in the number of individuals bereaved annually. Increases over time were especially large for individuals bereaved by sibling loss. If the United States had maintained its rates of mortality improvement from 2000–2009, about 2.7 million fewer people would have experienced at least one close-kin loss during 2010–2019. By 2021, the excess number of individuals who had ever been bereaved since 2010 had grown to 5.6 million. Considering single years, in 2019 alone 8.6% of all bereaved individuals—around 0.9 million people—would not have lost any close relative had the United States maintained its previous pace of mortality improvement. In 2021, the corresponding annual excess rose to 25%, or about 3.2 million individuals. Excess bereavement is similar when applying the concurrent rates of mortality improvement of countries like Japan and Switzerland. Decomposition analyses revealed that excess bereavement in the United States can be explained primarily by adverse mortality trends, rather than by differences in size or composition of the population at risk. Considering population health trends from the perspective of the number bereaved shifts the focus from individual deaths to their rippling effects on surviving family, at a population scale.",

This article argues that this rapid substitution risks undermining a core commitment of democratic administration: accountable, reason-giving bureaucratic discretion. Drawing on cases of automated eligibility, sanctioning, and standardization, it shows that algorithmic tools govern through statistical regularities, which can obscure responsibility, mishandle atypical cases, and weaken citizens’ claims to individualized consideration. Building on classic public administration debates and newer work on system-level bureaucracy, the article reframes AI adoption as a constitutional, not merely technical, question: which administrative decisions may be standardized, and which must remain under human control because they implicate fairness, equity, or rights? The article concludes with a selective ``centaur’’ model in which AI supports but does not displace human officials, preserving explanation, accountability, and appeal.",

This study introduces the concept of Withdrawn Advantage, describing how advantaged parents reduce their own educational inputs when they perceive school quality as high. I examine this mechanism using class size as a salient signal of school quality. Using TIMSS-2015 data and exploiting maximum class size regulations across six European countries, I implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of class size. I find that only highly educated parents reduce their engagement in children’s homework when classes are smaller, while less educated parents make no change. This occurs without any change in students’ achievement, teachers’ likelihood of assigning homework, or how frequently the child does homework. These findings suggest that equalizing effects of schools may partly reflect parental responses rather than purely in-school mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Multiplayer video games are part of everyday activities posing the question of which of these digital settings cluster crime or other deviant behaviour. A superficial analysis of the literature suggests that the evidence on cybercrime inside video games is scarce and a considerable number of digital settings have not been explored. This systematic review critically addresses the body of work that has studied the connection between video games and crime from the perspective of Environmental criminology and the Criminology of Place. The review is guided by two hypothesis on crime clustering on cyberspace: (1) the literature on video games and crime has focus in a small number of titles (2) the literature on video games and crime is more prone to understand video games as factor that can trigger victimization or perpetration in offline spaces rather than a setting in which cybercrime can manifest. Through the analysis of 41 studies published between 2014 and 2024 following the PRISMA model, our results show that there is indeed and overrepresentation of some cyber places within research around video games and crime. Likewise, the literature most frequently studies the effects of video games on perpetration or victimisation. The implications of the study are discussed within the context of the debate on the risks associated with playing video games and the limitations of our understanding of which video games are criminogenic virtual environments.",

          "abstract": "Growing citizen dissatisfaction with current governance raises the question of what future governance systems should look like. We conducted a large survey experiment in the United States and Germany, with 5,000 respondents each, to explore how citizens would design their ideal governance system. We focus on two scenarios: a utopian Mars setting, in which citizens were asked to design governance from scratch, and an Earth setting, in which citizens were asked to redesign the existing governance system they live in. On the basis of a constant sum and conjoint analysis, we find a strong preference for mixed and “multicameral” (McKay, 2025) governance models that distribute decision-making among multiple actors. In the Mars scenario, citizens slightly “de-center” the representative model in favor of a greater emphasis on participatory and expertocratic components. There is also an even more pronounced preference for strong oversight. Our findings suggest that citizens' ideal governance preferences differ greatly from the current institutional status quo in both countries. Despite current authoritarian trends, citizens favor a system of governance based on institutional cooperation and robust checks and balances.",

          "authors": "Takeshi Minakawa",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman birth timing was historically regulated by circadian biological rhythms, with spontaneous deliveries typically occurring during the late night and early morning. However, the increasing medicalization of childbirth raises the hypothesis that social and institutional schedules now exert a dominant influence. This study empirically examines the historical transition from “biological time” to “social time” by analyzing hourly and day-of-week birth distributions among individuals born in Japan between 1960 and 1999. Using a dataset of 135,748 self-reported birth records collected from a commercial astrology web service, and after excluding default values indicating unknown times, the final analytical sample comprised 68,224 individuals. Birth trends were assessed using hour- and weekday-level aggregation, minute-level kernel density estimation, and cross-decade heatmap visualization.\n\nResults reveal a pronounced shift toward institutional scheduling. First, weekend births declined markedly, forming a clear weekend gap by the 1990s. Second, the natural dawn peak visible in the 1960s was replaced by a sharp weekday peak between 13:00 and 15:00 in the 1990s, coinciding with typical hospital operating hours; minute-level analysis confirmed that the drop at 12:00 reflects lunch-break scheduling rather than analytical artifact. Finally, heatmaps demonstrate increasing concentration of births within business hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00). These findings indicate that late-20th-century Japanese birth timing increasingly reflected the logistics of medical practice rather than intrinsic physiological patterns. Beyond documenting this transition, the study demonstrates that large-scale self-reported digital data can replicate epidemiologically robust trends with high temporal resolution, suggesting potential applications in real-time public health monitoring.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity provides essential ecological, economic, and cultural value, yet it continues to decline under anthropogenic pressures driven largely by economic development. Although many corporations are developing biodiversity-related measures and reporting frameworks, their actual environmental awareness and responsibility remain critical. On 19 September 2025, the outdoor sports brand Arc’teryx held a large-scale fireworks event, Ascending Dragon in the Himalayas, in Shigatse, China, which drew widespread criticism for its potential negative environmental impacts. To evaluate the societal and financial consequences of this incident, we analyzed Chinese public responses based on Weibo discourse (public reaction), Baidu Search Index (public attention), and the stock performance of Anta, Arc’teryx’s parent company. Both reaction and attention peaked two days after the event, and we found a negative correlation between online trends and stock performance. Causal analysis further demonstrated a significant causal influence of Baidu search activity related to Anta on its stock price. Textual analysis revealed that public concern centered primarily on environmental impacts, followed by expectations of corporate responsibility. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a negative environmental event, together with the resulting public reaction and attention, can directly and immediately influence a company’s financial performance. These findings underscore the importance of genuine biodiversity awareness and responsible decision-making in corporate practice.",

I analyze the impact of the social movement, measured by the media exposure frequency, on public opinion, the proposal of bills and the legislation with the national-level time serial and the state-level data. I investigate the impact of the social discourse on public opinion and the legislative process to illuminate the underlying mechanism where the social movement affects the political outcome. The social movement contributes to the improvement of political representation by spreading the social discourse, setting the agenda in civic and political society and triggering partisan politics for institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "Forthcoming, Sociological Science \n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.",

          "authors": "John Downer",
          "abstract": "This paper argues that modern risk governance rests on a useful fiction: that technological safety can be rendered as objective fact. Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. That fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The paper contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices dominate outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction. \nThe argument unfolds in four steps. First, it maps the civic epistemology that privileges technical consensus and procedural validation in technological risk, contrasting it with the plural, openly provisional treatment of economic risk. Second, it explains how this order is sustained by performances of objectivity that are methodologically valuable even if epistemologically fragile. Third, it draws on reactors to show how certain systems ‘fracture’ those performances by coupling catastrophic potential to hard limits on verification. Finally, it sketches the governance implications of operating beyond the boundary: cultivating varied expertise rather than a single authoritative voice, emphasizing resilience alongside risk calculation, and acknowledging that restraint may at times be the only responsible policy.",

          "authors": "Pascal König; Kristina Sabrina Weißmüller",
          "abstract": "What factors lie behind bureaucrats’ readiness to delegate client interactions that commonly involve human empathy to artificial intelligence (AI) systems? Such delegation entails a crucial trade-off as it may reduce workload but simultaneously introduces inauthentic empathic engagement in citizen-state relations, which may undermine the moral integrity of public administration (PA). Drawing on bureaucratic legitimacy theory, this study tests the impact of efficiency gains, AI features, and organizational norms on civil servants’ willingness to delegate citizen engagement to AI. Findings from a pre-registered discrete choice experiment conducted with 300 active German civil servants (Obs.=3,000) show that while efficiency gains and norms do have some impact, utilitarian considerations concerning AI’s ability to serve clients well are clearly the most important motivator. The findings show that the acceptability of delegating empathic engagement with citizens to AI can be tied to key dimensions of bureaucratic legitimacy, and provide novel evidence that the delegation of counselling to AI in PA is more strongly linked with public service motivation rather than self-serving efficiency gains. These insights advance theory and inform responsible and client-centered use of AI in public bureaucracies.",

This paper connects TCNs to the MLG conceptual framework by locating the former within an institutional space defined by the two types of MLG formulated by Hooghe and Marks, and reflecting on some of the implications of TCNs’ position in this space. In doing so, the paper achieves two objectives: first, it opens up the dominant MLG typology to accommodate intermediate and hybrid configurations of multilevel governance. Second, based on this reconceptualization, it provides an analytical basis on which to build in subsequent empirical work on city networks.",

          "abstract": "Climate change adaptation (CCA) increasingly relies on collaborative efforts to generate and circulate actionable knowledge. Among these, knowledge networks (KNs) have emerged as key infrastructures for fostering transnational cooperation, enabling mutual learning, and supporting local implementation. While their theoretical value is widely acknowledged, the empirical landscape of adaptation-related knowledge networks in Europe remains poorly understood. This article offers the first systematic mapping of KNs working on CCA in Europe, with a particular focus on Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs)—a prominent subset composed primarily of local authorities. We identify and compare 32 knowledge networks across key dimensions including structure, governance, membership, funding models, and core activities. The analysis is grounded in two original datasets: a network-level dataset comprising 32 adaptation-related KNs and a membership-level dataset encompassing over 17,000 entries, systematically collected and geo-referenced. These resources provide an unprecedented empirical basis for understanding how climate knowledge is shared, institutionalised, and mobilised across Europe. Our findings reveal a diverse and uneven landscape, with significant variation in access thresholds, support mechanisms, and geographic representation. TMNs, in particular, differ in the type and intensity of support they provide—ranging from technical expertise and financial assistance to symbolic capital and peer learning opportunities. The article contributes to ongoing debates about multilevel climate governance and the role of networks in enhancing local adaptation capacity.",

          "title": "Counterpublics and haunted publics: Media imaginaries of landscape transformation in Central Kalimantan",
          "authors": "Heikki Wilenius",
          "abstract": "This chapter examines media imaginaries surrounding resource commodification in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a focus on events in 2020. It analyses two distinct yet interconnected media events. The first pertains to how the politics of natural resource commodification are debated and how various actors are positioned within these discussions. The second concerns the circulation of accounts of supernatural phenomena. The data include personal online exchanges from 2020–2021; three annual volumes (2018–2020) of a Central Kalimantan newspaper; selected news items from internet-based media (2017–2020); Twitter conversations from 2020 under various keywords; and selected YouTube videos featuring supernatural phenomena published between 2017 and 2020.\n\nFirst, the analysis argues that the Central Kalimantan mediascape is fragmented: established media outlets explicitly represent various state interests while claiming to serve the public, whereas social media discussions and circulating multimedia narratives often provide a counternarrative—if not constitute a counterpublic—serving as platforms for citizens to mobilise and articulate their interests. Second, the chapter introduces a new type of circulating discourse, termed “haunted publics,” in which accounts of supernatural events circulate in ways distinct from conventional counterpublics, yet the emergent effects of this circulation can still generate political critique. Third, consistent with previous research, it shows that discourses on supernatural events and resource politics are interrelated, even when they do not directly engage one another.",

          "title": "Recovery Housing Works: Outcomes from Kate’s House Housing Model with Justice-Involved Communities",
          "authors": "Sherri Candelario",
          "abstract": "Kate’s House Foundation operates and owns seven accredited MAT homes serving justice-involved adults referred by the Drug Court and the Department of Corrections (DOC). The program emphasizes trauma-informed care, no rapid-exit policies, and prohibits resident “vote-outs.” Because all participants were justice-involved at entry, the realistic alternative to remaining in housing was the possibility of losing drug court benefits or returning to jail or prison for relapse or non-compliance. Within this high-risk context, the longer lengths of stay observed in this cohort represent extended periods in the community in lieu of incarceration, underscoring the preventive impact of a non-punitive, stabilization-first recovery housing model. We evaluated early exits, length of stay (LOS), completion/active status, employment change, and age patterns using assessments at ~0, 45, and 90 days (REC-CAP). 10, 12. Mean LOS was ~141 days (median ~97), and among residents engaged beyond 30 days the mean LOS was 181 days. Using LOS ≥60 days as a priori “engagement success,” retention was strongest among older adults, while residents &lt;25 showed the weakest ≥60-day retention. 5, 6 REC-CAP Social Capital &amp; Meaningful Activities scores skewed high (94% scoring 4–5 on a 5-point scale across 394 responses), indicating substantial perceived connection and purposeful activity during residence. Uniquely, this large single-system cohort spans seven houses run by one foundation under consistent policies, with data collected by two trained staff—reducing site-level variability common in multi-operator studies. In this cohort, Drug Court participants achieved retention patterns similar to DOC participants, supporting the role of non-punitive, MAT-compatible housing in maintaining community placement across justice-system categories.",
