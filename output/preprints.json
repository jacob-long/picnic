          "abstract": "Reproducibility of research is a hotly debated topic, including aspects like causes and consequences of low levels of reproducibility. While some research fields have led the way and introduced various reproducibility practices and procedures, the call for efforts to ‘improve’ reproducibility in research has not come without criticisms. The current study uses a future studies methodology to gather perceptions of developments in the research ecosystem related to reproducibility issues. It draws on input from representatives of four main stakeholder categories: scholarly publishers, funding agencies, qualitative social scientists and machine learning researchers. Particularly, it discusses the enablers and barriers that members of these stakeholder communities foresee on the road towards a research ecosystem that is more conducive to reproducibility.\nThe study finds that enablers and barriers can be categorised into five main clusters. The factors most prominently mentioned as potentially supporting or hindering a desired future are located within research culture, including norms, values and shared definitions; and in the infrastructure required to engage in reproducibility practices, including repositories, support staff, and digital infrastructure. Three other clusters of factors put forth by participants relate to policy efforts required to incentivise reproducibility practices; training and education to empower researchers and support staff to engage in reproducibility practices; and the financial resources required to facilitate the transition towards a desired future and to specifically fund replication studies. This manuscript also identifies several tensions between enablers and barriers perceived by diverse stakeholders and concludes with recommendations for addressing these.",

          "authors": "Alberto Maydeu-Olivares; Jan-Benedict EM Steenkamp",
          "abstract": "Response styles and response biases can introduce systematic variance in measurement models. Their aggregated effect can be captured by introducing into the model an additional general 'method' factor, a random intercept that varies across items. To support the validity of interpreting this additional factor as method variance rather than a substantive general factor, we formulate testable queries, including an efficiency hypothesis that outlines conditions where method effects are more likely. The strongest validity evidence involves integrating into the survey and model a variable that, while theoretically uncorrelated with the assessed attributes, elicits similar response mechanisms. If this marker variable remains uncorrelated with this additional factor, it supports its interpretation as substantive, rather than method. When validity evidence supports the interpretation of the additional factor as method variance, we describe methods to quantify the extent of method bias on reliability and validity coefficients. In cases where method effects are substantial, our proposed approach ensures valid inferences and scores free from method bias. Fully worked out examples and code illustrate the implementation of these methods. In a neutral scenario according to our efficiency hypothesis, no indication of method effects is observed. However, when method effects could be expected, we found non-negligible method variance (up to 17%), which we subsequently controlled for.  Failure to account for method variance when present leads to poorly fitting models and over- or underestimation of validity and reliability coefficients.",

          "abstract": "Undergraduate college graduation is a pivotal developmental milestone that marks a transition for graduates. Unfortunately, the graduation rate of Latinx students is not keeping up with their rapid growth in postsecondary institutions (Weissman, 2023). For this reason, understanding the success of Latinx graduates is key to fostering Latinx academic success and degree attainment in this developmental transition. Cultural strengths, including personal growth and knowledge and an emphasis on educational values, play an important role in the educational process for Latinx students (Hernandez et al., 2016). However, less is known about the meaning of graduation personal statements as a way for students to reflect on their experiences and indicate important cultural capital utilized for their degree attainment. Further research is needed using a strength-based approach to understanding cultural capital utilized by Latinx graduates within a qualitative approach. To address this gap, we will code quotes from Latinx graduates and identify areas of cultural capital that they draw upon and acknowledge as important to their positive academic outcomes using structured tabular thematic analysis (Robinson, 2022). Quotes are short personal statements that graduates were able to submit for print in the graduation program. Utilizing the graduation program from the Spring 2024 Hispanic Convocation ceremony, we will analyze 628 quotes using structured tabular thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2021). Focusing on positive cultural aspects that Latinx students use to bolster their academic journey has implications regarding the best support mechanisms institutions can provide for this population and what these students personally value in education.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread discussions about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on society, little work has objectively measured how often people use this technology in the wild. The present paper collected up to 90 days of web-browsing data from students (Study 1: N = 499) and those in the general public (Study 2: N = 455), quantifying how often people used AI and evaluating the psychological correlates of such use. Upon coding 4.1 million websites in Study 1 and 9.9 million websites in Study 2, the evidence suggested AI use was relatively infrequent, totaling 1% of student web-browsing and 0.44% of general public web browsing, on average. The most consistent predictors of AI use across studies were aversive personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), albeit the traits were differentially associated with AI use across studies. Demographics were systematically unrelated to AI use across studies. Finally, we observed that self-reported AI use and actual AI use were only moderately correlated (ρ = .329), suggesting limitations in subjective measures of media use. These findings provide some of the first behavioral measurements of AI in naturalistic settings and establish important benchmarks for understanding the individual differences associated with AI adoption.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research has documented pervasive editorial inequities in psychology, suggesting that having majority-White, male, and U.S.-based editors disproportionately influences publication outcomes. These patterns are associated with systemic bias against scholarship produced by scholars of color, women, and psychologists outside the U.S. Proposed solutions to this problem range from diversifying editorial positions and enhancing editor training. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic synthesis of these recommendations to date.  This gap limits our ability to improve the knowledge production system in psychology. To address this need, we will conduct a systematic review of the literature on editorial inequities and recommendations to promote editorial equity. Our goal is to identify and summarize recommendations to guide editors and promote editorial equity in psychology. We describe our inclusion and exclusion criteria, search terms, search engines, and coding and analyses plans.",

          "abstract": "We here present some opinions about the challenge of understanding what the newer forms of artificial intelligence (AI)  are, and how they are similar to or different from human intelligence (HI)in its many manifestations. Our central thesis is this: now that the inner workings of an AI may consist of a huge network, and billions of weight parameters, we might really benefit from a research framework that studies these new intelligences using the array of tools that have been developed to assess dimensions or aspects of intelligence in humans and in animals. We feel that in the current model computer scientists seek to adapt the ideas and nomenclature of psychology, or psychologists try to run black box AI systems through various kinds of “maze tasks.”  While these efforts are aimed in the right direction, they are unlikely to birth a new science, which, we argue, is now needed. In this note we address several aspects of the problem, and propose that ways be found for psychologists and computer scientists to work together, respecting the strengths and weaknesses of their own disciplines, to develop much needed measuring instruments for AI, and its relation to human intelligence. We also offer some preliminary ideas about which dimensions of intelligence may prove salient when extending our notions of human or animal intelligence, to machines. This paper presents no new experimental or theoretical results.",

          "title": "When Order Matters and When It Doesn’t: Tracking the Time Course of Temporal Implicatures in Conjunctions Using ERPs",
          "authors": "Maria Spychalska",
          "abstract": "Conjunctive sentences in the past tense are often interpreted as describing a sequence of events occurring in order. In pragmatics, this phenomenon is known as temporal implicature. In three ERP experiments, we track the time course of how temporal implicatures are derived in conjunctions that report unrelated events. We also examine whether the contextual relevance of temporal order influences the processing of temporal order.\n\nParticipants observed game events, such as turning two cards face-up in sequence, and read conjunctive sentences describing these events in either the correct or reversed order. The relevance of event order was manipulated by varying the game pay-off: in Experiment 1, the sequence affected the pay-off, while in Experiment 2, it did not. Experiment 3 further enhanced the salience of order by introducing temporal connectives (\"before\" and \"after\") as alternatives to simple conjunctions.\n\nThe processing dynamics of temporal order depended on both the global experimental context and the connective used. Reversed-order sentences triggered increased P600 amplitudes at the first noun where the order violation became detectable, regardless of pay-off relevance. This effect is argued to reflect effortful combinatorial processing that is due to the violation of the expected discourse organization. In contrast, the N400 was modulated by order only in Experiments 1 and 3, where it was explicitly relevant—either through task demands or the presence of temporal connectives. This supports the hypothesis that temporal implicatures can be processed incrementally as part of enriched meaning representation when sufficiently supported by context.\n\n\nAdditionally, an early negativity (N100-P200 time-window) was observed at the connective \"and\" in reversed-order sentences, suggesting increased attentiveness to connectives used in order-incongruent sentences. For \"before\" in reversed-order conditions, \na prolonged negativity effect around the N400 time-window is observed, indicating that order incongruence with 'before' was processed as a meaning-related prediction error. In contrast, for \"after\" the effect is diminished, arguably due to conflict between semantic requirements for order reversal and the discourse-based expectations for iconic order. Finally, \na late positivity emerged at the second noun, in reversed-order \"and\" sentences, indicating the involvement of late inferential processing. This effect was present in experiments 2 and 3, where the task did not explicitly emphasize the order.\n\nThese findings provide new insights into the time course of temporal implicatures and the interplay between discourse structure, contextual relevance, and linguistic cues during real-time processing.",

          "abstract": "Researchers and methodologists in the group comparison tradition have identified questionable research practices that can compromise replicability and validity of conclusions. However, this concept of questionable research practices has not been widely applied to single-case experimental designs (SCED). This paper describes initial steps toward identifying questionable and improved research practices in SCED. Participants were 63 SCED researcher experts with varying backgrounds and expertise. They attended a one-day virtual microconference that included focus groups designed to solicit examples of questionable and improved research practices at different stages of the research process. A qualitative thematic analysis of over 2,000 notes from the participants resulted in 69 specific questionable and improved research practices. We discuss results in relation to the open science movement and quality indicators for SCED studies and explore future directions of research, including investigating whether consensus exists about the identified practices.",

          "authors": "Kareena del Rosario; Jay Joseph Van Bavel; Tessa West",
          "abstract": "Morality is often characterized as a set of stable values rooted in “moral truth,” where beliefs are treated as universal facts that transcend social context. We argue that moral expressions—behaviors that signal one’s sense of right and wrong, like outrage, guilt, and pride—are malleable and sensitive to social norms. These norms can amplify moral expressions (e.g., on social media) or restrain them (e.g., in professional settings). We challenge prevailing frameworks that treat morality as context-independent and propose that moral expressions are often motivated by two goals central to social influence: affiliation (desire to affiliate with one’s group) and accuracy (desire to be right in ambiguous situations). Although morality is subjective, group values are often treated as definitive truths. Thus, moral expressions satisfy both goals, making the fundamental question: “what does my group consider moral?” We outline how social influence shapes moral expressions, from unconsciously copying others to expressing outrage to gain status within the group. This framework explains why the same goals can result in different behaviors, highlighting how context-specific norms encourage (or discourage) moral expressions. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of these dynamics and suggest future directions to understand the social drivers of moral expressions.",

          "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a complex disorder shaped by factors such as craving, mood, and neurocognitive processes. While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

          "authors": "Kshipra Gurunandan; Andrea Greve; Richard Henson",
          "abstract": "Prediction error (PE) is the degree of conflict between predictions and new information. For a binary reward outcome, PE may be signed (positive if the outcome was correctly predicted and negative if the outcome was incorrectly predicted), or unsigned (absolute value of “surprise”). Using a “variable choice” paradigm, De Loof et al. (2018) examined the role of PE in one-shot learning of unknown translations of known words, showing associative memory for the translation to be greater when (financial) reward was more unexpected, and lesser when an expected reward was not received (i.e., signed PE); an effect they replicated in several subsequent studies. However, previous work on PE in declarative memory has assumed that memory is greater when an outcome is more unexpected (i.e., unsigned PE). We replicated De Loof et al.’s paradigm with and without financial reward, and found that memory was explained slightly better by unsigned PE (Experiment 1A-1B). However, we then identified a potential confound in the paradigm which could explain results without any role of PE. Simulations confirmed this possibility, and we designed and tested a modified version of the paradigm (Experiment 2). Results were inconsistent with the PE account and suggested that findings from variable choice paradigms might be an artefact of the experimental design. Overall, we conclude that variable choice paradigms may not be well suited to investigate the role of PE in one-shot declarative learning, and that the purported role of signed PE in declarative memory requires further investigation.",

          "authors": "Mathias Berggren; Robin Bergh",
          "abstract": "Several cross-country examinations have found larger gender differences in Western countries. More recently, it has been argued, from an evolutionary standpoint, that equality may paradoxically increase gender differences, because it provides more freedom for men and women to pursue innate preferences. However, this paradox has primarily been examined with this cross-country methodology, opening up for other cultural differences to drive the results. For instance, measures developed in Protestant and Germanic-speaking countries, may not work the same in other cultural clusters of countries, and may not have the same statistical qualities there (e.g., in terms of reliability). Here, we reanalyze the results from multiple studies on the gender-equality paradox with country-level data available. We find that gender differences co-vary more strongly with cultural regions and data quality than gender equality, and that any variable higher in the West appears to achieve similar correlations as gender equality. Also, controlling for cultural regions consistently and strongly attenuates the association with gender equality, including to become statistically non-significant, or to switch direction. In other words, the baseline associations differ between and within cultural clusters (a Simpson’s paradox), suggesting there is no simple causal relation between gender equality and expressed gender differences. Similarly, controlling for data quality indicators strongly attenuates the paradox. Finally, we show that, with and without controls, there is no consistent paradoxical association across many of the largest cross-cultural studies on gender differences, including newly analyzed data. The same is true for other country development variables considered in the gender-equality paradox literature.",

          "abstract": "Resource transfers among individuals can be driven by selfish, altruistic, competitive, or prudential motives. Here, we focus on prudence, specifically the propitiation of aggressive individuals or coalitions to avoid injurious loss. Across the animal kingdom, choosing to cede a resource to a stronger or needier individual is often more advantageous than losing the resource while also being harmed in the process. If the modern human skull houses a Stone Age mind, this ancient motive—though perhaps irrelevant in modern societies with impartial enforcement of property rights—might still be at work. In domestic politics, the game-theoretic logic of appeasement is encapsulated in the quip, “If there is to be revolution, we would rather make it than suffer it,” attributed to Otto von Bismarck, the father of the modern welfare state. Are people intuitive Bismarckians? Across three studies in the United Kingdom and the United States—two with nationally representative samples and one preregistered (total N = 1,911)—we observed robust associations between fear of being violently dispossessed and support for progressive redistribution. These associations were substantial and persisted even after controlling for other motives previously linked to redistribution, including self-interest, compassion, malicious envy, coercive egalitarianism, and proportionality, as well as political orientation. By elucidating the psychological mechanisms underpinning resource transfers, these findings advance our understanding of why individuals support redistribution in complex societies.",

          "abstract": "While artificial intelligence increasingly democratises art creation, people tend to devalue AI-generated content—a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. Recent work suggests that personalized AI models, trained on a user's past work, can increase credit attribution in text generation. We investigated whether this effect extends to visual art and examined the relationship between credit attribution and aesthetic appreciation. Across two studies (N=774), UK participants evaluated identical paintings that were described as being created either by hand, with a standard text-to-image generative AI system, or with an AI system personalized to the artist. While personalization significantly improved credit attribution and perceived authorship and commercial rights compared to standard AI use, it failed to enhance either aesthetic appreciation or willingness to categorise the outputs as \"true art\"—revealing a striking disconnect between judgments of artistic contribution and artistic value. Our findings suggest that although personalized AI may help bridge the \"achievement gap\" in credit attribution, it cannot overcome fundamental barriers to aesthetic appreciation of AI art. This challenges assumptions about the relationship between perceived effort and aesthetic value, with implications for understanding art categorization and human-AI cooperation in creative pursuits.",

          "abstract": "In response to a rise in youth vaping, the United Kingdom government announced a disposable vapes ban from the 1st June 2025. It is not clear how this will impact the 1.6 - 2.6 million adults in the United Kingdom who use disposable vapes. The ban could discourage youth vaping, but could have unintended impacts among adults, including adverse effects on smoking and vaping behaviour. In this qualitative study, we recruited and interviewed 22 young adults (aged 18-30) residing in the United Kingdom who regularly used disposable vapes and were either: never-smokers, ex-smokers, or dual-users. We explored the experiences and opinions of participants using online semi-structured interviews. The interviews explored participants’ experiences of vaping and smoking, what they might do once disposable vapes are banned, and how they thought the ban would impact other people. The data was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Three themes were constructed relating to our research aims: “reasons for using disposable vapes”, “personal impacts of the ban”, and “wider impacts of the ban”. Participants were largely supportive of the ban due to the rise in disposable vape use among young people. Many young adults said they would switch to reusable/rechargeable vapes after the ban. Mostly dual-users, but also some participants who had never regularly smoked and one ex-smoker, said they might or would smoke cigarettes instead.  Some suggested the ban would reduce current illegal sales of disposable vapes and others thought it may increase them. This study suggests the ban could have intended and unintended consequences for young adults who use disposable vapes, including increasing the use of cigarettes among some of these individuals. The findings highlight areas for future observational studies investigating the impacts of the ban and could aid identification of mitigating factors of unintended consequences.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in high levels of fatigue, while affecting individuals differently. This study aimed at identifying risk factors of experiencing fatigue during the first and second lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed at predicting fatigue, stress, anxiety, and mood dynamics during the second lockdown based on fatigue during the first lockdown. Finally, the study explores the link between hair cortisol and fatigue during COVID-19.\nMethods: In this ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study, 292 participants (231 women; Mage = 35.3 years, SDage = 13.1) provided data on fatigue, stress, anxiety, and mood for two seven-day measurement periods (20,343 observations) during the two national lockdowns in Austria and Germany. 85 participants provided hair strands for the analysis of hair cortisol.\nResults: Using linear mixed models, fatigue was related to younger age, lower socioeconomic status, higher chronic stress, and higher loneliness across both lockdowns. In addition, higher fatigue during the first lockdown was related to worse mood, higher fatigue, higher stress, and higher anxiety during the second lockdown. Finally, lower hair cortisol levels were related to a steeper diurnal increase in fatigue during the first lockdown.\nConclusions: Risk factors for experiencing fatigue during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic were young age, low socioeconomic status, higher chronic stress, and higher loneliness. The results further suggest hypocortisolism of fatigued individuals in the general population during COVID-19. Identifying fatigued individuals early during crises could help inform appropriate intervention strategies for those most at risk.",

          "abstract": "Metacognition – the capacity to represent and reflect upon our knowledge and its sources – is fundamental for higher cognition and learning. Yet, developmental research suggests that metacognition emerges surprisingly late, not before school age. However, this research has assumed that metacognition is optimized for private reflection and therefore tested children’s metacognitive judgments in individual settings. In contrast, recent theoretical approaches propose that metacognition may have a primarily social function and should therefore become most evident in socio-communicative contexts. To test this, we conducted two preregistered studies (N = 130) in which 3- and 5-year-old children participated in a social version of a well-established metacognition task (partial ignorance task). Children had to communicate their uncertainty towards a cooperative partner who relied on their advice. Even 3-year-olds demonstrated metacognitive competence under these conditions: They spontaneously and explicitly expressed uncertainty when they were partially ignorant, but not when they were knowledgeable. Two preregistered control studies (N = 65) confirmed that the enhanced metacognitive performance in the first two studies was indeed mainly due to the socio-communicative context rather than other factors. These findings support the claim that metacognition is primarily a socio-cognitive capacity.",

          "abstract": "The push for Open Science practices, including open data, clashes with the need for strict data protection of participant information. This creates a growing crisis in HCI research. Despite its critical role, data protection remains an afterthought in metascience, leaving researchers without clear guidance and dedicated resources, endangering both participant privacy and scientific openness. We illustrate that Meta-HCI is uniquely positioned to address this challenge by investigating how researchers navigate these tensions and developing strategies that align openness with privacy. We propose starting points for solutions such as minimizing data collection and reusing datasets. This is a call to action—without urgent intervention, both the privacy of research data and Open Science are at risk.",

          "abstract": "Predicting what other individuals will do is an important adaptive challenge for many organisms. Social prediction can be achieved by constructing a detailed model of the mental states of other agents, but this is computationally expensive. We argue that mindreaders can often bypass the need for constructing such a detailed model: they can keep track of the facts in their own world model that another agent also knows, instead of explicitly representing the content of the agent's world model. Using a simple computational approach, we find that this 'factive' mindreading strategy emerges as the optimal social prediction strategy for organisms with limited cognitive resources across a range of social ecologies. Factive mindreaders in our model behave like young human children and non-human primates: they successfully predict the behavior of knowledgable and ignorant agents, but fail to predict the behavior of agents with false and even accidentally true beliefs. Our results elucidate the computational principles underlying efficient social prediction, and provide a first-principles account for a range of empirical findings about human and non-human mindreading.",

Despite the established benefits of optimism in promoting mental well-being, limited research has examined the direct impact of structured optimism training on students' mental health. Addressing this gap, the present study investigates optimism training as a novel intervention to mitigate depressive symptoms in first-year university students. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, 200 first-year students were recruited and assigned to either an experimental group (n=100), which received optimism training, or a control group (n=100), which received Low-Intensity Treatment (LIT). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was administered at baseline and post-intervention to measure depression severity. Statistical analyses, including repeated measures ANOVA, were conducted to assess the intervention’s effectiveness. Results revealed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in the experimental group, with mean PHQ-9 scores decreasing from 17.19 (pre-test) to 13.57 (post-test), whereas no notable change was observed in the control group. These findings highlight optimism training as a cost-effective and scalable mental health intervention that could be integrated into university counseling services to support students' psychological well-being and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that many young people in the UK experience worry and negative emotions about climate change. University students may be particularly likely to experience such emotions if, for example, exposed to distressing climate change content in their studies. In a pre-registered online mixed-methods study, we investigated climate anxiety, climate change-related emotions, thoughts, and views about their university’s role in climate action among 869 students at a large UK university. Results showed that students experienced moderate climate anxiety intensity across different situations. Students reported high levels of negative emotions, including sadness, helplessness, and powerlessness, and low optimism and indifference. Students also experienced high levels of negative climate change-related thoughts, such as “The future is frightening”. Regarding their university’s role, many students favoured more climate change-related teaching and mental health support. On average, students moderately endorsed the thought that their university was “Dismissing people’s distress” about climate change, which correlated significantly with students’ climate anxiety intensity (r = .32, p &lt; .01) and frequency of strong climate anxiety symptoms (r = .30, p &lt; .01). These results demonstrate serious impacts of climate change on students’ mental wellbeing. They also highlight the importance of universities recognising their responsibilities in climate action and protecting students’ wellbeing.",

Recent work suggests that personalized AI models, trained on a user's past work, can increase credit attribution in text generation. We investigated whether this effect extends to visual art and examined the relationship between credit attribution and aesthetic appreciation. Across two studies (N=774), UK participants evaluated identical paintings that were described as being created either by hand, with a standard text-to-image generative AI system, or with an AI system personalized to the artist. While personalization significantly improved credit attribution and perceived authorship and commercial rights compared to standard AI use, it failed to enhance either aesthetic appreciation or willingness to categorise the outputs as \"true art\"—revealing a striking disconnect between judgments of artistic contribution and artistic value. Our findings suggest that although personalized AI may help bridge the \"achievement gap\" in credit attribution, it cannot overcome fundamental barriers to aesthetic appreciation of AI art. This challenges assumptions about the relationship between perceived effort and aesthetic value, with implications for understanding art categorization and human-AI cooperation in creative pursuits.",

Intensive speech and language teletherapy combined with remotely supervised, self-administered tDCS may be suited to remove barriers to accessing potentially effective treatments, but there is only limited evidence on the feasibility of this combined approach. This pilot case series investigated the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a novel telerehabilitation programme combined with home-based, self-administered tDCS for people with primary progressive aphasia (pwPPA). The intervention programme was co-developed with pwPPA and their caregivers, to reflect their priorities regarding treatment content and outcomes. Two pwPPA successfully completed the telerehabilitation intervention with daily naming training and communicative-pragmatic therapy paired with tDCS, over 10 consecutive workdays. Caregivers assisted in the setup of equipment required for teletherapy and home-based tDCS. Participants successfully completed the programme with a 95% completion rate. Home-based tDCS was well tolerated. Both participants showed improvements in naming and communication, suggesting preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefit of a novel easily accessible telerehabilitation intervention for pwPPA.",

          "abstract": "The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) framework has been gaining momentum over the last 25 years. Although the basic configuration of the JD-R model has hardly changed, it is increasingly being referred to as a theory. This paper sets out to critically review the framework, its basic assumptions, and the extent to which it lives up to this seemingly more mature status. Specifically, we argue that the ever-increasing attention the model is receiving paradoxically is due not to its logical capacity to explain when or why a particular (i.e. specified) resource or demand will instigate health impairment or a motivational process, but instead its superficiality. In this paper, we describe the qualities of a robust theory following principles of philosophy of science and demonstrate how the JD-R model performs in relation to scientific standards. In addition, we analyzed the ideological assumptions of the model, questioning aspects of the model that to date have not been critically discussed. With our review, we seek to stimulate greater understanding of whether and how conceptually distinct demands and resources constructs idiosyncratically relate to individual and organizational outcomes in different contexts, therewith encouraging the development of more robust and refined frameworks for understanding job-related stress.",

However, these sources may be biased, potentially distorting our beliefs and behavior. Here, we examine whether individuals can detect biased sources and mitigate their influence. We studied a large cohort of participants who completed a decision-making task involving choices between lotteries. Outcome feedback was provided by sources that were either unbiased or biased in a favorable or unfavorable direction. Participants initially learned about source biases, and later, used this knowledge to interpret biased feedback and adjust belief updating. Using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that participants successfully distinguished between favorable, unfavorable, and unbiased sources and adjusted for biased feedback. However, these corrections were incomplete, allowing residual biases to continue shaping beliefs and decisions. Moreover, following exposure to biased sources, participants systematically misperceived unbiased sources as biased. Strikingly, participants prioritized learning about source biases over value learning, resulting in reduced task performance. Our findings highlight the challenge of forming accurate beliefs in biased environments and offer insights for countering misinformation.",

          "abstract": "A persistent question for individuals, social scientists, and organizations is whether we are ‘ourselves’ online as we are in settings that are not fully online. Unsurprisingly, several attempts to resolve this question indicate that it is complex. Instead, much scholarly attention has increasingly attended to the various practices by which we construct, claim, and negotiate our and others’ identities. Recent social scientific thrust on examining identities fully embraces the public, performative, and contextually salient aspects of identities. Over the years, there have been several collections of papers and book sections devoted to examining and theorizing the ways that our ‘selves’, identities, and group memberships are presented, constructed, and negotiated (Antaki &amp; Widdicombe, 1998; Benwell, 2006; McKinlay &amp; McVittie, 2011). This is in distinction to treating identities as stable, essential, cognitive, and socialized aspects of individuals. The focus on examining identities on the above approaches, is less concerned with a better understanding of who the ‘real’ person is but with examining what is being accomplished in claiming, rejecting, and negotiating various forms of identities.",

Drawing on empirical evidence from psychological studies and human-AI interaction research, we demonstrate how this perspective stems from a fundamental attribution error: projecting qualities of \"otherness\" onto systems that represent extensions of our own informational activities. Through the Dissipative Representations (DiRe) framework, grounded in information theory and analytical idealism, we dissolve the false dichotomy between \"natural\" human intelligence and \"artificial\" computational systems, revealing both as patterns within the same informational field. Our methodology integrates psychological analysis with historical technological transitions and contemporary interaction studies to identify the ontological continuity underlying diverse manifestations of intelligence. By reconceptualizing the human-AI relationship through this non-dualistic lens, we propose practical implications for technological development, education, and cultural representation that foster more integrative human-AI interactions. This framework offers an epistemically economical alternative to dualistic models that have dominated both academic discourse and popular narratives about artificial intelligence.",

The annoyance of tags and seams; fitted or tight clothing and thick fabrics or clothing accessories causing feelings of heaviness and constriction; as well as the itchiness of certain fabrics all contribute to a general preference for comfort over style when autistic and non-autistic people make fashion purchasing decisions.

That is, the greater the dissonance, the stronger the motivation to reduce it, and consequently, the greater the invested effort (Festinger, 1957). For many years, this assertion was accepted without direct empirical testing. Moreover, Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989) provides well-established empirical evidence about the factors that determine motivated effort investment and explains why it is inaccurate to perceive dissonance reduction as always, an effortful process. Motivated effort is influenced by various factors, not just motivation, such as the difficulty of the task and the individual’s level of ability (which was incorporated into the original theory by Rex Wright, 1996). I argue that these principles should be applied to any mental activity, including cognitive dissonance reduction. The primary objective of this article is to propose an integration of Cognitive Dissonance Theory by Leon Festinger with Motivational Intensity Theory by Jack Brehm. I believe that this proposed integration significantly contributes to psychological knowledge.",

          "authors": "Paulina Szwed; Ewa Szumowska",
          "abstract": "In everyday life, we encounter information that contradicts our beliefs, often disrupting our self-concept and triggering cognitive dissonance. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) suggests that discrepancies between cognitions create discomfort, motivating individuals to restore psychological consistency. It indicates that the magnitude of dissonance depends on the importance of conflicting beliefs, yet the role of importance has not been fully explored. Our hypothesis posits that the importance of a cognition moderates’ motivation to reduce dissonance. Two studies (N = 640) were conducted to test how people respond to discrepancy about their abilities. Study 1 showed that dissonance led to greater motivation toward reduction, but only for those who found those abilities as important. Study 2 (with a measure of the dissonance state) confirmed that dissonance magnitude and importance interact, influencing motivation to reduce dissonance. This research expands CDT by highlighting the role of importance in dissonance reduction.",

          "abstract": "How we live dictates how we will be remembered. Crucially, studying how our legacy endures may reveal new philosophical and psychological insights about human nature and social phenomena. In the current investigation, we present a large-scale analysis of over 38 million obituaries spanning nearly 30 years (1998-2024) and comprising nearly 7 billion words. Through dictionary-based natural language processing techniques, we map the moral and emotional landscape of these obituaries to investigate differences in how people are memorialized by gender and age. We find that men and older people were remembered with more words; women were remembered more for caring for others (in the case of love and friendship), whereas men were remembered more in contexts reflecting a lack of care (e.g., war, conflict), and this gender asymmetry intensified with age. The present work may be the first large-scale analysis of obituaries building toward a psychology of legacy.",

The present paper collected up to 90 days of web-browsing data from students (Study 1: N = 499) and those in the general public (Study 2: N = 455), quantifying how often people used AI and evaluating the psychological correlates of such use. Upon coding 4.1 million websites in Study 1 and 9.9 million websites in Study 2, the evidence suggested AI use was relatively infrequent, totaling 1% of student web-browsing and 0.44% of general public web browsing, on average. The most consistent predictors of AI use across studies were aversive personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), albeit the traits were differentially associated with AI use across studies. Demographics were systematically unrelated to AI use across studies. Finally, we observed that self-reported AI use and actual AI use were only moderately correlated (ρ = .329), suggesting limitations in subjective measures of media use. These findings provide some of the first behavioral measurements of AI in naturalistic settings and establish important benchmarks for understanding the individual differences associated with AI adoption.",

          "abstract": "Psychological scientists are increasingly acknowledging the importance of transparency for research integrity. The present study examined one important facet of transparency: providing enough information about measures so that readers can evaluate aspects of construct validity. With a focus on social and personality psychology, we explored how often authors in one journal report a scale name, citation, example item, number of items, and reliability coefficient, as well as how often authors provide access to the study’s materials. We also investigated how measurement reporting practices have changed from 2010 to 2020, the decade encompassing the start of the “credibility revolution” in psychology. Across two samples, we coded 506 Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS) articles (N = 425 articles with at least one questionnaire measure; 1,198 questionnaire measures). Overall, ~31% of measures were reported with a name, ~53% a citation, ~66% an example item, ~76% the number of items, and ~78% of multi-item measures included some reliability information; approximately 22% of measures were single-item and 46% were ad hoc. We did not detect any apparent changes in the reporting practices examined from 2010 to 2020 in either sample, except for an increase in the availability of materials over time. Therefore, the replication crisis may have motivated increased access to studies’ materials in recent years but otherwise does not seem to be associated with more transparent reporting of measurement information for questionnaires in brief social and personality articles.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility are dispositions to seek out and respond to evidence and the testimony of others in ways that are conducive to the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of knowledge. In recent years there has been a growth of interest in this topic, with the development of ten different scales designed to capture individual differences in intellectual humility and related constructs. In a series of ten studies (N = 5,922), we analyze the psychometric properties of these measures to consolidate them into a single inventory with five subscales (open-mindedness, sense of intellectual superiority, intellectual defensiveness, intellectual arrogance, and tendency to criticize one’s ingroup). Given the importance of intellectual humility in intergroup relations, we intentionally include items designed to capture the presence (or lack) of intellectual humility in an intergroup context. These items allow us to capture distinct aspects of intellectual humility where people remain open-minded about the perspectives of outgroup members or turn a critical eye to the beliefs and reasoning of ingroup members. Our new inventory — the Collected Intergroup Intellectual Humility scale (CIIH) — demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the power to predict a range of important outcome variables such as acceptance/rejection of warranted/unwarranted conspiracy theories, medical (mis)information, and (fake) news, as well as to update credences in light of social feedback. CIIH offers strong psychometric properties and greater utility than existing measures for assessing the willingness to learn from a wide variety of individuals and groups. Our results suggest that the disposition to criticize oneself and the disposition to criticize one’s ingroup are distinct.",

The initial paper presents the methodological foundation for the Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics, with subsequent papers focusing on clinical populations. Our method aims to elucidate personal idiolectic connections, providing a deeper understanding of the semantic landscape within and between individuals. This study analyzed group-level differences in the text of forum posts on a popular social media site and individual-level idiolect comparisons in OCD populations compared to more general population. Our results demonstrate significant differences in the semantic associations with the word \"attract\" between OCD users and general users. Specifically, OCD users exhibited more varied and less consistent associations, reflecting the diverse nature of their obsessions and compulsions, while general users showed more stable and uniform associations. Additionally, group-level comparisons between art and programming subgroups revealed significant differences in semantic distances in associations with the word “abstract,” indicating distinct word usage patterns across communities. These findings highlight the potential of Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics in uncovering meaningful differences in semantic relationships within clinical populations and online communities, both at group- and individual-level.",

This exploration delves into how AI systems, from chatbots to companion apps, employ data-driven strategies to mimic emotional intelligence—analyzing speech patterns, sentiment, and behavioral cues to craft responses that feel deeply personal. Yet this \"understanding\" remains a carefully orchestrated mimicry, leveraging human psychological tendencies to project meaning onto algorithmic outputs. While users often experience comfort in these interactions, the essay interrogates the ethical and psychological consequences: the erosion of reciprocal human bonds, the commodification of emotional vulnerability, and the uncanny discomfort evoked by flawlessly sanitized compassion. Ultimately, it questions whether AI’s empathetic facade enriches or diminishes our capacity for authentic human connection.",

          "abstract": "Human societies reliably develop complex cultural traditions with striking similarities. These “super-attractors” span the domains of magic and religion (e.g., shamanism, supernatural punishment beliefs), aesthetics (e.g., heroic tales, dance songs), and social institutions (e.g., justice, corporate groups), and collectively constitute what I call the “cultural manifold.” The cultural manifold represents a set of equilibrium states of social and cultural evolution: hypothetically cultureless humans placed in a novel and empty habitat will eventually produce most or all of these complex traditions. Although the study of the super-attractors has been characterized by explanatory pluralism, particularly an emphasis on processes that favor individual- or group-level benefits, I here argue that their development is primarily underlain by a process I call “subjective selection,” or the production and selective retention of variants that are evaluated as instrumentally useful for satisfying goals. Humans around the world are motivated towards similar ends, such as healing illness, explaining misfortune, calming infants, and inducing others to cooperate. As we shape, tweak, and preferentially adopt culture that appears most effective for achieving these ends, we drive the convergence of complex traditions worldwide. The predictable development of the cultural manifold reflects the capacity of humans to sculpt traditions that apparently provide them with what they want, attesting to the importance of subjective selection in shaping human culture.",

          "abstract": "Based on previous findings and psychometric reasoning, we hypothesized that personality traits closely follow chronological age (chronAge), but that this has been obscured by reliance on limited and single-method personality assessments. We investigated how accurately chronAge could be predicted from personality traits (persAge) in 13,253 individuals (aged 20 to 70) whose personality domains and nuances had been comprehensively assessed by themselves and a close informant. Observed persAge, based on self-ratings or combined self- and informant-ratings, correlated with chronAge up to r ≈ .80. Latent persAge, based on the shared variance of both assessment sources, correlated with chronAge up to r ≈ .90. Over the 50-year age span, we estimated typical differences between chronAge and latent persAge to be less than 4.5 years. This implies latent persAge differences so large that the persAge distributions of younger and older people barely overlap. These findings suggest a strong normative component in personality development as a whole. Yet, individuals can arrive at the same persAge differently, and normative age-related factors are only one reason why people differ on any given trait.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

Loneliness-linked individual differences in goal-directed mental simulation were examined across four domains: episodic detail richness, imagery perceptual vividness, emotional sentiment, and sociality. Results revealed that mental simulations reported by lonelier individuals were lower in internal episodic detail and imagery vividness, more emotionally negative, and were less social than those of less lonely individuals, with most associations persisting even after accounting for depression symptom level.

          "abstract": "Some psychological models—especially complex, typological ones or those with a three-dimensional structure—cannot be properly verified within the classical 2D measurement space. Their projection onto a plane geometrically distorts the actual relationships between variables or persons, leading to false simplifications and erroneous interpretations. In response to this limitation, the article proposes an expansion of the measurement space using tools from artificial intelligence—specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel—which enable the transformation of data into higher-dimensional spaces.\nThe article shifts the focus of measurement from relationships between variables to relationships between individuals, treated as vectors of psychological traits. It demonstrates that the kernel RBF not only classifies data but transforms the very space in which the data operate—creating a new geometric framework in which the verification of complex and deep models becomes possible. In this new logic, individuals become carriers of the model rather than mere data observations. The concept culminates in a proposal for a psychometric scale based on independent response vectors, compatible with the structure of kernel space. Altogether, this constitutes a breakthrough shift: from variable space to person space, from geometric projections to the structural depth of psychological models.",

To control for such variables, researchers working on German Sign Language (DGS) need to use stimuli rated for these constructs (e.g., iconicity) by an independent group of participants before implementing their actual experiment. Up to now, several research groups have made such rating data publicly available but a central resource is currently still lacking. Against this background, this short paper provides a roadmap for the collaborative creation of a so-called “DGS-LEX”, a lexical database for psycholinguistic research on DGS, similar to ASL-LEX. By integrating relevant data from different published and forthcoming studies, this joint effort aims to establish a new database for lexical variables in DGS primarily based upon subjective ratings.

This performance involved dancers moving in synchrony or in-canon behind and next to a pair of seated participants, creating a ‘mirror fusion’ effect that blurred the boundaries between the two participants. The results show that experiencing a synchronous performance induces more self-other boundary blurring than an in-canon performance, and self-other boundary blurring significantly predicts the experience of awe and an increase in bonding with the other participant. These findings suggest that art performances induce social bonding effects typically observed in religious rituals, highlighting the role of synchrony and awe in inducing cohesion during collective experiences. This study contributes to the understanding of the embodied mechanisms of collective effervescence.",

          "abstract": "Belief in misinformation has been attributed to digital media environments that promote intuitive thinking, which is thought to foster uncritical acceptance of content. We propose that this intuitive ``truth bias’’ may be an ecologically rational adaptation to environments where information is typically accurate. Across a large-scale pre-registered survey experiment and an incentivized replication, we test whether intuitions indeed adapt to the base rate of true versus false content. Participants viewed news feeds composed primarily of either true or false headlines. We find that individuals make more—and faster—errors when encountering the less frequent headline type, and fewer errors with the more common type. Computational modeling of the deliberative process reveals these effects are driven by intuitive responses that function like Bayesian priors about content accuracy, which exhibit some persistence. Our findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation may not merely reflect a cognitive failure, but rather a rational byproduct of learning from statistical regularities in digital environments.",

          "abstract": "Some objects have specific places where you can expect them to be found (e.g., toothbrush), while others vary widely (e.g., cat). Previous studies have pointed to the importance of the spatial associations between objects and scenes in informing search strategies. However, the assumptions about objects having a specific location that they are typically found does not take into account the imprecision inherent in the spatial associations of objects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of the variability of objects’ spatial associations on visual search. First, we quantified this variation and developed the Object Spatial Certainty index by having participants rate where 150 objects were expected to be found in scenes; the index provides a relative measure that ranks these objects from the most spatially predictable (almost always found in one region of the scene, e.g., boots) to the least spatially predictable (equally likely to be in every region of the scene, e.g., plant). In two experiments, we examined how these variations affected search by manipulating targets are either being High Certainty or Low Certainty. Our findings demonstrate that the variability of spatial association of objects significantly affected how effectively scene context influences search performance.",

While existing behavioral research on moral appeals has primarily focused on \nharms inflicted on animals, this study takes a different approach by examining whether \nemphasizing the negative impacts of factory farming on human well-being can influence \nattitudes and behavioral intentions. Drawing on two evolutionary frameworks—the Adaptive \nConservation Rule and Morality-as-Cooperation—we tested whether highlighting human\ncentered harms could shift perceptions of animal welfare and related behaviors. \nIn a preregistered experiment (N = 403), participants were exposed to messages \ndescribing how factory farming disrupts different domains of cooperation, focusing on human \nhealth, labor conditions, community well-being, and environmental outcomes. We assessed \nmoral concern for factory-farmed animals, intentions to choose more sustainable animal \nproducts, and willingness to support organizations opposing factory farming. \nThe messages did not produce significant effects on any outcome measures. However, \nperceived fitness interdependence (PFI)—the extent to which individuals view their well-being \nas linked to that of animals—consistently predicted pro-animal and anti-factory farming \noutcomes. Endorsement of moral values such as Loyalty, Fairness, and Reciprocity, as well as \nstakeholder identity, also influenced these outcomes. \nThese findings suggest that moral framing alone may be insufficient to shift consumer \nattitudes and behaviors. Instead, individual differences—particularly PFI and identity-related \nfactors—may play a more central role in shaping responses to factory farming and should be \nconsidered in future behavioral interventions.",

Although the basic configuration of the JD-R model has hardly changed, it is increasingly being referred to as a theory. This paper sets out to critically review the framework, its basic assumptions, and the extent to which it lives up to this seemingly more mature status. Specifically, we argue that the ever-increasing attention the model is receiving paradoxically is due not to its logical capacity to explain when or why a particular (i.e. specified) resource or demand will instigate health impairment or a motivational process, but instead its superficiality. In this paper, we describe the qualities of a robust theory following principles of philosophy of science and demonstrate how the JD-R model performs in relation to scientific standards. In addition, we analyzed the ideological assumptions of the model, questioning aspects of the model that to date have not been critically discussed. With our review, we seek to stimulate greater understanding of whether and how conceptually distinct demands and resources constructs idiosyncratically relate to individual and organizational outcomes in different contexts, therewith encouraging the development of more robust and refined frameworks for understanding job-related stress.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has become popular to assess dietary intake in real life and real time. Available tools differ substantially in the type and number of implemented features including features to assess what and how much was consumed. The features require qualitatively different input that might exert differential impact on the participants’ cognitions and behaviours while taking part in the study. This preregistered online experimental study aimed to test whether more complex dietary assessment tools, indicated by the type and number of assessment features, induce more active information processing. A total of 373 participants (65.4% female; mean age 30.4 years) were randomly allocated to viewing one of eight EMA protocol mock-ups, each describing a food tracking process verbally and using screenshots. Afterwards, they rated the protocol in terms of its complexity (manipulation check), active information processing and its potential impact on eating-related cognitions, intentions and eating behaviour change. The eight EMA protocols differed regarding perceived complexity, i.e. protocols with more tracking features were perceived as more complex compared with ones with fewer tracking features. EMA protocols that were perceived to be more complex were also perceived to induce more active information processing. However, there were no differences regarding perceived impact on eating-related cognitions, intentions, and behaviour. These differences in complexity and usability may influence compliance and study results. Researchers thus need to carefully select the appropriate EMA protocol for their study to balance the need for collected information with the need for high compliance.",

We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

          "abstract": "Learning to recognize and produce foreign speech sounds can be challenging, particularly when only subtle differences distinguish these new sounds from phonemes in the native language. Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Though theoretical accounts describe self-regulation as dynamic, empirical studies typically rely on static measures that fail to capture changes in self-regulation from day to day or moment to moment. As a result, little is known about how or why children’s self-regulation may vary within-person, despite clear relevance for educators. In this paper, we capitalized on repeated observations from wearable devices to test the idea that daily increases in activity (DIA) across the school day could reflect a school-age child’s inability to regulate their physical activity to be appropriate to the school setting. In a national sample followed from birth to age 26 (N = 747; 49% female, 76% White, 13% Black, 6% Hispanic, 5% Other), children showing greater DIA in third grade, objectively measured using actigraphy at school and charted across hourly intervals, were rated as more impulsive and disruptive by teachers and classroom observers, had lower academic achievement in high school (β = -0.11), and completed fewer years of education as adults (β = -0.05). These findings reveal a temporal dimension to children’s behavioral regulation at school. Findings suggest that children’s behavioral regulation, proxied by the ability to inhibit motor activity, deteriorates across the school day and that children who can sustain behavioral regulation for longer go on to greater educational success long-term. Findings also reveal temporal patterns of behavior in third grade that motivate future investigations into daily experiences that could restore children’s behavioral regulation.",

There are few studies in low-and middle-income countries where most of the worlds’ adolescents live. We investigated whether adolescents’ relationships with their parents and peers mediated the association between their economic circumstances and internalising symptoms in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam.\n\nMethods: We analysed longitudinal data of 3,529 adolescents from the Young Lives study (1,741 female [49.3%]). Household consumption expenditure and adolescents’ subjective assessment of household wealth were measured at age 15. The mediators – adolescents’ positive relations with their parents and peers – were measured at age 19. The outcome – internalising symptoms, characterised by low mood and anxiety – was measured at age 22. Mediation was assessed through counterfactual g-computation formula, adjusting for baseline and intermediate confounders.\n\nFindings: We found no evidence that adolescents’ positive relations with their parents and peers mediated the association between economic circumstances and internalising symptoms in any country. Living in poorer economic circumstances was typically associated with greater future internalising symptoms.\n\nInterpretation: The role of adolescents’ parent and peer relationships in mediating the effects of poorer economic circumstances on internalising mental health is potentially less important in these countries compared to a more important role in high-income countries as highlighted by previous studies. Further research is needed to explore other potential mechanisms, including different aspects of social relationships, that might influence mental health outcomes for adolescents living in poverty across different settings.",

The current study attempts to address this gap in knowledge, recruiting a sample of straight and LGB participants (N = 242) to explore differences in consent attitudes across sexual orientations. Participants read four staggered vignettes depicting ambiguous sexual encounters. Findings revealed significant differences in consent attitudes between straight and LGB participants. On average, straight participants had fewer positive attitudes about consent compared to LGB participants. Additionally, exploratory analyses found that bisexual participants consent attitudes were more predictive of their consent judgements across vignettes featuring different gender combinations, compared to both straight and gay/lesbian participants. These findings suggest that not only do attitudes toward sexual consent vary across sexual identities, but the extent to which these attitudes inform judgments about consent may also vary.",

This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper provides a structured exploration of the methodological workflow essential to multimodal language and communication research. We present a flexible decision-making framework that guides researchers through key considerations, from data selection and its alignment with research questions, to data collection methods, technical requirements, and data management, including ethical considerations and data sharing. We also address critical factors such as equipment choice, data synchronization, and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and data protection) while illustrating these processes with examples from different research contexts (i.e., lab-based experiments, large-scale annotated corpora, field studies including non-human primates). Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for newcomers to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.",

          "abstract": "For many deaf people, lip-reading plays a major role in verbal communication. However, lip reading is inherently ambiguous and does not allow for a complete understanding of speech. The consequences of these limitations are significant, potentially impeding language, cognitive, and social development. Cued speech (CS) was developed to eliminate this ambiguity by supplementing lip-reading with hand gestures, giving access to the entire phonological content of speech through the visual modality alone. Despite its documented efficacy in enhancing linguistic and communicative abilities, the mechanisms of CS perception remain largely unknown. The present study is the first to examine eye movements during CS perception, with a sample of deaf CS users, hearing CS users, and hearing naive controls. We presented silent videos of words, pseudowords, and sentences in their CS form, while recording the participants’ eye movements. All groups fixated almost exclusively on the face, and predominantly on the lips of the speaker, despite the effective processing of CS gestures by CS users. Deaf and hearing participants differed strikingly in the way fixation was distributed between the left and right halves of the face. While both hearing groups mostly fixated the left side of the speaker’s face, deaf participants showed a more symmetrical pattern. Finally, in CS users, stimuli that were phonologically, lexically or semantically more difficult tended to increase fixation in the inferior and left sector of the face. Apart from reading, CS stands as the sole system for visually conveying full phonological information of a spoken language. This study elucidates the fundamental behavioral tuning that facilitates the efficient recovery of phonology in this distinctive form.",

Such difficulties are likely to have a significant emotional and practical effect on individuals. However, numeracy difficulties are rarely assessed or managed clinically. This study aims to provide insight into speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs’) experiences of and attitudes towards supporting individuals with numeracy difficulties.\n\nMethodology: We disseminated an online survey to reach a representative sample of SLPs in the United States and United Kingdom. Sixty three respondents completed the survey comprising 22 items, collecting information about: difficulties observed in numerical processing and calculation; work carried out to address these; possible facilitators and barriers for work on numeracy.\n\nResults: SLPs reported observing a range of difficulties in numerical processing (e.g. counting, transcoding) and calculation (e.g. addition, multiplication), as well as in functional numeracy skills (e.g. paying bills, calculating a tip), but low levels of confidence regarding their assessment and treatment. Where difficulties were addressed in intervention, this most often targeted functional skills. Barriers to working on numeracy included a lack of standards relating to management of difficulties as well as appropriate assessments and intervention approaches.\n\nDiscussion: Respondents felt that numeracy was relevant in their work but that additional training would be beneficial. Future work could explore the effects of incorporating numeracy into clinical training on outcomes for aphasic individuals. The development of more assessments and evidence-based interventions for numeracy difficulties in aphasia could help to improve the management of this largely unmet clinical need.",

Several sibling interventions have been developed, but few are readily available, leaving many siblings unsupported. Therefore, the free, online, self-administered sibling serious game ‘Broodles’ was developed. This study assessed its social validity and effectiveness in promoting quality of life, and inter- and intrapersonal factors in siblings (6–9 years) of children with intellectual disabilities and/or visual impairments. Methods: A mixed methods, waitlist control group, randomized controlled trial was conducted. In total, 107 Dutch or Belgian parent-child dyads completed questionnaires at three timepoints (baseline, one-month post-test, two-month follow-up). The intervention group also completed post-test interviews. Effects were assessed using multilevel modelling, and thematic analysis was applied to the evaluations. Results: Significant, weak interaction effects (R² = .03–.06) were found on sibling negative adjustment, but only in those who completed ≥75% of the game and followed the study timeline. Regardless of group, (very) small, significant improvements over time were found on several outcomes (R² = .01–.06). ‘Broodles’ was experienced as fun (80%) and helpful (79%). Perceived learning outcomes included the themes: ‘sibling awareness and validation’, ‘emotions and needs’, ‘coping with emotions and situations’ and ‘family interactions’. Conclusion: Although quantitative data showed small effects, qualitative data revealed a variety of learning outcomes which can contribute to siblings’ resilience, and prevention of mental health problems. To unlock its full potential, future studies should examine if additional family-targeted components can enhance the intervention’s impact.",

Leveraging advancements in natural language processing to overcome limitations of behavioral research, this study employed word embeddings to investigate more nuanced societal-level positive self-bias in human languages and its universality across cultures and historical periods using multilingual corpora totaling approximately two trillion words. We first validated the presence of positive self-bias in English. Cross-cultural comparisons then revealed self-deprecation tendencies in trait-based self-evaluation in specific Eastern languages, contrasting with Western patterns. However, affective self-positivity—the tendency to associate the self with generally positive rather than negative words—was universally observed across 11 languages. Analysis of 200 years of English texts further substantiated this dichotomy: while trait self-positivity fluctuated historically, affective self-positivity remained stable.

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

          "abstract": "Teaching efficacy plays a crucial role in both teacher and student outcomes. Despite its importance, there are issues with the measurement and statistical representation of teaching efficacy. This study evaluated several measurement models of teaching efficacy, identifying the bifactor exploratory structural equation model (B-ESEM) as the best-fitting solution. We assessed its measurement invariance across five countries (Brazil, Mainland China, Singapore, USA, and Slovenia) and examined its criterion validity with respect to job satisfaction with the environment and the profession. The B- ESEM demonstrated strong measurement invariance, confirming that teaching efficacy, as measured by both general (G) and specific (S) factors, is interpreted similarly across different cultural and linguistic contexts. This contrasts with prior studies which used traditional confirmatory factor analysis that found only weak or partial invariance, highlighting the advantages of using B-ESEM to eliminate country- level biases. Criterion validity results indicated that general (G) teaching efficacy was systematically positively linked with job satisfaction and there was one single S-factor that was linked with job satisfaction: efficacy for student engagement was positively associated with satisfaction with the work environment, but not with satisfaction with the profession. These findings offer implications for theoretical refinement and applied research. Future research should explore longitudinal designs and continue employing advanced statistical methods to reflect the multidimensional nature of teaching efficacy.",

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

          "abstract": "The meeting in which the United States and Ukraine were supposed to sign a rare earth minerals deal attracted a lot of attention, and its course elicited strong opinions, especially in Europe. Common views included President Zelenskyy having been treated unfairly. A closer analysis of the meeting reveals a more multifaceted picture of the events. \n\nThe main difference in perspectives appeared to be whether to take a judgmental attitude towards Russia or maintain a neutral position. Many interpreted taking a neutral stance to be an acceptance of the actions of Russia and a betrayal of Ukraine or democratic values. Taking a judgmental position was considered a moral requirement, whereas the White House considered a non-judgmental attitude a necessary condition for successful negotiations. Zelenskyy ignored previous guidance from the White House, stated his unwillingness to compromise, and maintained a distrustful attitude towards the capability of the White House to secure peace. Instead, he appeared to be looking for emotional support for the war trauma of his people and himself, whereas the White House considered such a pursuit in the context of the meeting an obstacle. \n\nThis article contributes an annotated transcript with a proposed emotional structure of the conversation, as well as some additional analysis. The main issue appeared to be Zelenskyy's refusal to agree to the necessary conditions set by the White House, combined with his distrust of Trump's judgment.",

          "abstract": "Our eyes engage not only in visual perception but also in visual mental imagery, mimicking perceptual processes without external stimuli. Mental imagery vividness varies along a spectrum, with aphantasia at the lower extreme, where individuals report a reduced or absent ability to visualize voluntarily. However, they can recall visual information from memory. For example, they can state from memory that Bordeaux is left of Paris on a map of France while denying any mental imagery. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this dissociation? \nSome theories suggest aphantasia stems from impaired image generation, while others propose it reflects a lack of metacognitive awareness of visual mental imagery.\nThis study examines oculomotor and pupillometry patterns in typical imagery and aphantasia during a mental exploration task involving an imagined map of France. We test four competing hypotheses: (i) reduced eye movements in aphantasia due to absent mental images, (ii) increased exploratory eye movements as a sensorimotor compensatory strategy, (iii) typical eye movements with impaired metacognitive access, or (iv) heterogeneous eye movement patterns. We also predict greater pupil dilation in aphantasia, indicating increased cognitive load. By distinguishing between these possibilities, this study will contribute to the understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Abrupt onsets are commonly assumed to be a class of stimuli with high physical salience. Presumably because of this, abrupt onsets tend to capture attention even when other types of distractors, such as color singletons, do not. However, there has been a lack of consensus on the definition and measurement of physical salience. As a result, it is unclear if high physical salience is indeed the reason why abrupt onsets tend to capture attention more strongly than other types of stimuli. Using a psychophysical technique recently developed by Stilwell et al. (2023), we explicitly quantified the level of physical salience of abrupt onsets, color singletons, and color singleton onsets. Surprisingly, abrupt onsets were the least salient among the three types of items. Despite this, only abrupt onsets captured attention in a subsequent visual search task, whereas the other two types of distractors were suppressed. These results indicate that high physical salience is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for abrupt onsets to capture attention.",

          "abstract": "The lateral visual stream has been recently proposed as a third visual stream, in addition to the ventral and dorsal streams, specialized for processing dynamic social content. While prior work has suggested that the regions of this pathway form a hierarchy representing increasingly abstract information, the computations along this pathway are still largely unknown. High spatiotemporal resolution data are particularly informative for characterizing the information flow and thus neural computations across different brain regions. Using a novel regression approach, we combine data from EEG, fMRI, and behavior in response to the same videos to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG and whole-brain spatial resolution of fMRI. We find that low-level visual features are represented in early visual cortex with a short temporal latency and are not represented in higher-level regions of the lateral stream. Further, we find that mid-level features are represented in mid-level lateral regions with a shorter latency than high-level features in more anterior regions of the lateral pathway. However, both mid- and high-level features were decodable in anterior regions of the lateral pathway with a similar latency. Together, these results provide evidence that features of social actions are processed rapidly in the lateral visual stream in a manner that is consistent with hierarchical processing, but the lateral stream does not exhibit a strict temporal sequence of representational transformations along the posterior-to-anterior axis.",

          "abstract": "Associative memory naturally declines with age. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older adults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci, which involves associating each item of a to-be-memorized list with a location along a familiar route, that we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory. The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

          "abstract": "Although exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is generally effective for anxiety disorders, many people do not benefit. A better understanding of treatment predictors is required. This study investigated whether the dynamics of threat expectancy likelihood, which is one of the theorized working mechanisms of exposure, after an exposure exercise would predict subsequent intervention outcome. The short exposure exercise was designed to decrease the likelihood of one idiosyncratic threat expectancy. It was hypothesized that individuals with public speaking anxiety who hold on longer to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood after the exposure exercise (slower speed of return to equilibrium), show greater benefit from subsequent exposure intervention (i.e., less public speaking anxiety). Participants with subclinical public speaking anxiety (N = 60, M age = 25.42) completed an exposure exercise and momentary assessments in daily life (eight times per day) three days before and four days after the exposure exercise. One week later, they did an online one-session exposure intervention to decrease public speaking anxiety. Result showed that threat expectancy likelihood decreased after the exposure exercise and public speaking anxiety decreased after the intervention. Against expectations, speed of return to expectancy likelihood equilibrium did not predict intervention effects. Potential explanations of null results are discussed, like sampling frequency to measure speed of return to equilibrium and timing of the exposure exercise. Given the potential of dynamic predictors for exposure therapy outcome, more research is needed to examine the conditions in which speed of return to equilibrium predicts subsequent treatment outcome in anxiety.",

          "authors": "Ana Carolina Kodama Cottington; Yuichi Shoda",
          "abstract": "Background: Camouflaging is a strategy widely used by autistic individuals to conceal their autistic behaviors in response to stigma; however, it is also associated with negative mental health outcomes. Because identity cues in social environments can signal either stigma or safety and shape how individuals experience their identity, they may also directly influence the extent to which autistic people engage in camouflaging. In a social psychological experiment, we examined the extent to which autistic adults adjust their camouflaging efforts in response to autism-affirming or stigmatizing identity cues within a controlled setting.  Method: Using the Highly-Repeated Within-Person design, we tracked 135 autistic adults’ reports of camouflaging efforts across 24 hypothetical situations each featuring either autism-affirming or autism-stigmatizing identity cues.  Results: Most participants reported significantly less camouflaging efforts in situations with autism-affirming (vs. autism-stigmatizing) cues. This was particularly the case for those who more strongly identified with the autistic community. The study also demonstrated substantial diversity among autistic individuals in the effect of identity cue type on camouflaging efforts, even after accounting for participants' strength of identification with the autistic community. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that autism-affirming cues can create environments where autistic people feel safe to express themselves authentically. At the same time, the finding that identity cues influenced camouflaging efforts differently for each participant highlights the limitations of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, underscoring the need to further explore individual differences among autistic adults.",

How do children think these achievement goals influence adults’ child-directed behaviors? Across two preregistered experiments (n = 90 adults; n = 160 5- to 8-year-old children), we found that children systematically predict that an adult would select a more difficult task for a recipient child when the adult held a learning (vs. performance) goal, and when the recipient was more competent. Importantly, we found that this pattern matched adults’ actual task choices, although adults showed more sensitivity to choosing a task that anchors closely to what a child can reasonably learn from or accomplish. These results suggest children can reason about how adult’s achievement goals manifest into observable actions, which may have consequences for children’s own goal orientations and task selections.",

          "abstract": "Retrieved-context models of memory posit that a slowly drifting neural context signal is encoded alongside items in memory. However, this signal can be disrupted by event boundaries, affecting the temporal relationships between items across event boundaries. Here, we investigated how temporal proximity and event boundaries affect the detailed recall of events. Specifically, we assessed memory for events in the movie Forrest Gump, chosen specifically because of its hierarchical event structure with individual events in the movie being nested within broader life-periods (e.g., childhood, college, etc.). Importantly, the trial order at recall was structured such that adjacent trials tested events that were (1) either temporally close or far and (2) either within or across a life period. Participants provided both more event-specific details and more false memories for an event when the preceding event came from the same life period, suggesting that recall of the life period supported recall of episodic information, but also increased the likelihood of providing false information. Further, participants provided more intrusions from non-cued events after just recalling an event that was temporally distant, with this effect exacerbated if the preceding event was also across a life period boundary. Quantifying event similarity between the cued event and the sources of intrusions suggests that participants may be providing supplementary information to help scaffold memory for the cued event. Altogether, these results demonstrate that both temporal proximity and event boundaries affect detailed memory recall, extending previous findings into the domain of naturalistic events.",

In line with our hypotheses, our results suggest that the onset and incidence of these intervention categories do indeed vary with child development.",

However, it is unclear which component processes are altered, and how other aspects of neurodiversity (e.g., ADHD traits) affect these processing stages. Here, we applied diffusion models to decompose numerosity task performance into distinct processing stages, across two pre-registered studies with rigorous blinded analyses. In Study 1 we validated our approach and investigated relationships between diffusion-model parameters and autism- and ADHD-related traits in the general population (n=130). Study 2 investigated group differences between diagnosed autistic (n=100) and non-autistic (n=100) adults with comparable non-verbal reasoning ability, and assessed relationships with ADHD traits. Study 1 found no relationships between diffusion-model parameters and autism and ADHD-related traits in the general population. Study 2 revealed that autistic individuals had shorter non-decision times than non-autistic individuals, reflecting less time taken for sensory encoding and/or response generation, with no group differences in sensory evidence accumulation or response caution. We also found that individuals with higher motor hyperactivity-impulsivity had lower non-decision times and that individuals with higher verbal hyperactivity-impulsivity accumulated evidence more slowly. The diffusion model therefore reveals the convergence and divergence of processing stages in autism and across ADHD-related traits.",

Despite survivors of NCSII facing long-term consequences, they still face victim-blaming attitudes. Extant literature has typically sampled from countries where NCSII has long been illegal, such as the United Kingdom (UK); neglecting perspectives from countries lacking NCSII-specific legislation, such as Norway at the time of data collection. \nMethods: Participants (n = 477) from the UK and Norway responded to vignettes depicting NCSII, which differed by the survivor-perpetrator relationship depicted (i.e., casual vs. committed). \nResults: Controlling for participant sex and psychopathic personality traits (previously implicated in judgements of image-based sexual abuse), UK citizens perceived NCSII to have worse impacts on survivors than Norwegian citizens. Moreover, data trends suggested participants attributed increased victim-blame in vignettes featuring casual relationships, with higher self-reported psychopathic personality traits predicting judgements associated with viewing NCSII as less criminal in nature. \nConclusion: These findings emphasise a need to better understand the role of legislation in public perceptions of NCSII (and image-based sexual abuse more broadly) and the need to be conscious about further exploring technology-facilitated crime internationally.",

Research from self-determination theory has shown that certain rewards such as competition and performance contingencies undermine intrinsic motivation, while others like positive feedback enhance it. To shed light on learners’ metamotivational beliefs about rewards, this study investigated Saudi language learners’ (N = 316) attitudes toward, perceived effects of, and reported prevalence of certain task rewards (namely, competitively contingent, performance contingent, task contingent, non-contingent, unexpected, and positive feedback) to examine how these beliefs correspond to evidence-based recommendations. Results revealed that learners recognized the value of positive feedback. However, they also favored and believed that competitions and performance-contingent rewards would enhance motivation, contrary to empirical evidence. There were also some gender differences, with male learners favoring performance-contingent rewards more, while female learners reported a higher prevalence of competitions and performance-contingent rewards and a lower prevalence of positive feedback. The findings demonstrate a mismatch between learners’ metamotivational beliefs endorsing undermining rewards and research on their detrimental effects. These results have implications for enhancing intrinsic motivation, quality engagement, and psychological well-being.",

          "abstract": "A switch cost can be observed in cued task-switching on trials that follow a cue-only trial, which presents a task cue indicating a task to be performed but does not present a target stimulus to be responded to. This finding has provided important implications as to the source of the performance cost that emerges when switching tasks. However, cue-only trials differ from completed trials (for which the target occurs and is responded to) in several task parameters, and there are a few untested assumptions about a task-switch cost after cue-only trials, which restricted the conditions under which cue-only trials have been used. The present study first examined whether a switch cost emerged after cue-only trials when cue-only trials were matched with completed trials in as many task parameters as possible, and found that an expected switch cost following cue-only trials was absent in response time. In the subsequent six experiments, we explored critical task parameters to obtain a switch cost after cue-only trials. The present results indicate that the use of a short preparation interval was an important factor and that the switch cost was more short-lived and dissipated more quickly after cue-only trials than after completed trials. These outcomes are consistent with the proposal that there are at least two sources of a task-switch cost, one that originates from processing a task cue and another that originates from performing a cued task. Early processes of task preparation (e.g., cue or task identification) may be sufficient to produce the switch cost after cue-only trials, but response-related processes might generate a more persistent switch cost.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to produce words and sentences relies on lexical retrieval and structural assembly processes, which are supported by domain-general skills. Important topics in current psycholinguistics concern the degree of interaction of both processes and the cognitive costs they incur. Targeting the latter topic, we used an individual-differences approach to test whether the involvement of domain-general skills in language production varies as a function of task complexity. Our participants (n = 169) completed three production tasks that capitalized on lexical retrieval (picture naming) and structural assembly (phrase generation and sentence generation) processes, respectively. In addition, they completed 15 tests measuring linguistic experience, processing speed, working memory, and nonverbal reasoning. Our analysis showed that extensive linguistic experience sped up onset latencies. However, its effect interacted with task, suggesting that it benefited picture naming more than phrase and sentence generation. Critically, this effect was complementary to that of processing speed, which selectively predicted phrase and sentence production but not picture naming. Nonverbal reasoning affected onset latencies in all three tasks, suggesting a non-selective influence. Working memory only had a weak effect. Our findings suggest that while lexical retrieval is primarily supported by linguistic experience, structural assembly is more reliant on processing speed. By integrating multiple predictors, this study provides novel insights into the cognitive architecture underlying language production and highlights the value of a holistic individual-differences approach.",

For example, in English and other languages, two interpretations commonly available to NPIs are each other's logical duals. \nWe explore the hypothesis that these systematic ambiguities arise due to a bias in the learning process.\nSpecifically, when  a given word is restricted to a specific logical environment (such as the scope of negation), multiple equally `correct' analyses are available to a language learner. Learners might find some of these analyses more attractive than others, explaining why an ambiguity arises when the distributional constraint is relaxed.\nWe employ an artificial grammar learning paradigm to test which interpretations of NPIs are preferred by learners when they encounter NPIs in a positive environment. Our results show strong evidence of a `wide-scope dual' interpretation, although specific properties of the training paradigm may influence these preferences.",

          "abstract": "Jessica Benjamin is a prominent figure in relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis. Her unique intersubjective recognition theory focuses primarily on the concepts of mutual recognition and the Third. Benjamin posits that dyads in interpersonal interactions engage in mutual influence and reciprocal shaping. Recognition, according to Benjamin, represents a psychic position where both parties are recognized as subjects, fostering a process of giving affirming responses to each other; the Third functions as a principle, function, or relationship that creates an intersubjective space, accommodating both commonalities and differences. Types of the Third includes the rhythmic Third, the differentiating Third, the moral Third, the symbolic Third, and so forth. The distinctiveness of Benjamin's intersubjective recognition theory are reflected in several aspects: The concept of recognition is inclusive because of the information transmission mode, the impact of intersubjective responsiveness, the manifestation of otherness, and the focus on both intrapersonal and intersubjective dimensions; the concept of the Third, akin to phenomenological reflection, is more effective than the concept of conflict. In general, Benjamin’s intersubjective recognition theory provides a paradigm for maintaining a tension between the scientific and humanistic dimensions of psychoanalysis.",

While event segmentation is a well-explored topic, its underlying mechanisms have remained a subject of debate. In this study, we address this debate by comparing the two contrasting theories of event segmentation: prediction error and contextual stability. In two experiments, we manipulated contextual stability while keeping prediction error constant. Event segmentation was more prominent when there were stable contexts (Experiment 2) compared to prediction errors among unstable contexts (Experiment 1). This stronger segmentation took place despite signs of a smaller prediction error in Experiment 2. We conclude that contextual stability plays a pivotal role in driving event \nsegmentation, highlighting its dominance over the role of prediction errors. Our study sheds new light on the mechanisms behind how our minds divide continuous experiences into meaningful memory units.",

Each component of state empathy—including emotion sharing, perspective taking, and compassion—was significantly predicted by theoretically-relevant trait measures. However, trait empathy explained limited variance in daily experiences overall, ranging from just 3% for emotion sharing to 15% for perceived empathic efficacy. Adding emotional valence as a predictor improved model fit and variance explained for most state experiences, highlighting the crucial role of context.

Exposure to tobacco retail has been associated with smoking outcomes, but substantially less is known about how objectively logged day-to-day, real-world tobacco retail exposure is linked to smoking outcomes. \n\nObjective: To assess pre-registered hypotheses that individuals report greater craving and cigarettes smoked on days when their objectively logged retail exposure is higher than usual. Design: A 14-day within-person observational study combining objectively logged geolocation tracking, public tobacco-retail location records, and ecological momentary assessment. Data collection occurred from 2022 to 2024. \n\nSetting: A multimodal study including participants statewide in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \nParticipants: Main eligibility criteria were: aged 21-65 years, smoked at least five cigarettes per day for the previous six months, owned an iPhone or Android smartphone, and a resident of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states. \nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment. \n\nResults: A total of 273 participants were included in the final analyses (151 [55.3%] women; 175 [64.1%] white; mean [SD] age, 42.46 [10.69] years). Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses. On days when individuals had more tobacco retail exposure than their usual baseline, they reported significantly higher levels of craving (b = 0.04, t(3,456.79) = 2.56, p = 0.01) and smoking significantly more cigarettes (b = 0.01, t(3,469) = 2.47, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: People’s environments shape their feelings and behaviors. Exposure to tobacco retail in the real-world is associated with increases in craving and smoking. Findings highlight the significance of retail exposure in relation to smoking, information that is critical for developing effective tobacco control interventions, and lays foundations for broader health research on environmental factors shaping health behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Word recognition is supported by a competition process in which words that partially match the input are activated and vie for recognition. Recent work has shown that adolescents with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) do not fully resolve this competition, likely due to a deficiency in inhibition among words (lateral inhibition). It is not yet clear how this develops. Three experiments investigated the development of lateral inhibition using a variant of the Visual World Paradigm. Experiment 1 compared adults (N=35), older children (11-12) (N=43), and younger children (7-9) (N=45). In line with previous works, adults demonstrated robust inhibition, with marginal evidence in older children and no evidence in the youngest children. Experiment 2 tested 222 younger children to achieve greater statistical sensitivity and found a small but significant effect. Experiment 3 asked if these weaker effects were due to the younger listeners’ failure to activate competitors, or if competitors were active but simply not inhibiting the target. It found robust competitor activation even in younger children, suggesting the weaker effects may derive from true inhibition differences. Implications for DLD are discussed.",

We propose an alternate account that treats conversation as a complex dynamical system. In such systems, pink noise is a hallmark of successful mutual adaptation. Here, we test whether pink noise can be found in interlocutors’ co-navigated trajectories through semantic space. Not only is pink noise present, but its strength predicts positive conversation outcomes, increases with practice, and is reflected in a large language model’s representation of conversation quality. These results demonstrate an important role for mutual adaptation in promoting successful conversation.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

          "abstract": "The human mind automatically divides continuous experience into meaningful events (event segmentation). Despite abundant evidence that some kinds of situation changes (e.g., action, goal, or location changes) contribute to event segmentation, a component of experience that is critical for understanding and predicting others’ behavior, emotion, is rarely investigated. In two experiments, we sought to establish that viewers can track emotion changes while viewing naturalistic videos, and that these changes contribute to event segmentation. Participants watched commercial film excerpts while identifying either emotion changes or event boundaries (moments that separate two events) of different grains (Experiment 1: neutral-grain; Experiment 2: fine-grain or coarse-grain). We found that participants agreed with each other about when emotion changes occurred in the videos, demonstrating that viewers are able to track changes in the emotional content of dynamic naturalistic videos as they are experienced. Moreover, the emotion changes participants identified were temporally aligned with the event boundaries identified by other groups. In addition, valence and arousal ratings from separate groups of participants uniquely predicted the likelihood of identifying emotion changes and event boundaries, even after accounting for other types of change. However, emotion changes were more strongly tied to valence changes than arousal changes while coarse boundaries were more strongly associated with affective changes than were fine boundaries. These novel findings suggest that emotional information plays a substantial role in structuring ongoing experiences into meaningful events, providing a stronger basis for understanding how emotion shapes the perception and memory of everyday experiences.",

Although studies have characterized many aspects of children’s intuitive theory of the mind and children’s intuitive theory of relationships, it is largely unknown whether and how children think about mental state reasoning within relationships. In three experiments, we asked whether children think accurate mental state reasoning is a cue to social closeness. In Experiment 1 (n = 145), we found that 4- to 9-year-old children inferred that characters who are socially close know about each other’s goals and desires. In Experiment 2 (n = 137), we found that 6- to 9-year-old children, but not younger children, inferred that characters who are correct about each other’s minds are socially close. Children did not think that being correct about external states of the world was evidence that a character was close to another. In Experiment 3 (n = 79), we conceptually replicated the main findings from Experiments 1 and 2, and we found that 6- to 9-year-old children did not form the same inferences concerning knowledge about observable features of individuals (e.g., an individual’s outfit); children’s inferences were specific to unobservable mental content. Thus, by 6 years of age, children integrate their intuitive theories of the mind and relationships to make sense of whether and how people are connected to each other, as well as the strength and nature of those connections.",

Isager, Van ‘t Veer, &amp; Lakens (2024) approach replication value from a utilitarian perspective, and propose a formula to quantify it. The value of a replication for a claim increases with the scientific impact of the initial study reporting the claim measured by the average number of citations per year since the study appeared, and reduces with the certainty of the finding, measured by the number of observations supporting the initial claim. \nIn this comment, I offer two criticisms on the proposal for the replication value formula, and I propose an alternative: that the empirical content of a claim and the opportunity to improve the severity of the test of a reasonably large effect size makes claims more important targets for replications.",

Here we hypothesized that representations of social roles (e.g., cashier, mechanic, doctor) enable people to build rapid expectations about what others know and how they might act. Using a self-paced read- ing paradigm, we show that role representations support real time expectations about how other people might act (Study 1) and the knowledge they might possess (Study 2). Moreover, people reported more surprisal when the events deviated from role expectations, and they were more likely to misremember what happened. Our results suggest that roles are a powerful route for social understanding that has been previously under- studied in social cognition.",

          "authors": "Hirohito Okano; Michio Nomura",
          "abstract": "Self‑compassion, defined as compassion directed toward oneself in difficult situations, has been widely studied. However, the specific cognitive and behavioral patterns related to self-compassion remain poorly understood. Previous research that relies on predefined rating scales restricts the discovery of novel processes, whereas qualitative analyses of small free‑text samples suffer from limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we applied structural topic modeling—a natural language processing technique—to 9,360 free‑text responses (12 responses each from 780 participants; mean age = 43.0, SD = 10.6, range = 19–75) to identify thought and behavior patterns associated with self‑compassion. Participants responded to 12 free‑text prompts asking them to describe their typical thoughts and behaviors in three difficult situations (suffering, recognizing personal shortcomings, and experiencing failure). Higher self‑compassion was linked to topics reflecting problem‑solving orientation, balanced optimism, and adaptive flexibility. In contrast, lower self‑compassion was associated with self‑criticism, upward social comparison, envy, and depressive inaction. These patterns varied by context: for example, among individuals high in self‑compassion, balanced optimism predominated in contexts of suffering and failure, while adaptive flexibility emerged when participants recognized personal shortcomings. This study advances the literature by offering context‑sensitive, nuanced insights into self‑compassion across situations and providing a data‑driven foundation for future theoretical models and interventions. It also demonstrates that a data‑driven approach employing topic modeling on large‑scale free‑text data can uncover nuanced processes that conventional rating scales may not capture, with broad implications for emotion research and psychological science.",

By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a cost-effective intervention within workplace settings, but more generalisable evidence is lacking. This naturalistic, observational study investigated the impact of iCBT on work-related outcomes using nationally representative data from patients enrolled in routine care in Ireland. Methods. We analysed retrospective data from N=7125 patients enrolled in iCBT through the Irish national health service between March 2023-May 2024. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire was used to measure absenteeism, presenteeism, overall productivity loss, and activity impairment. Secondary outcomes included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7). We used mixed-effects models to assess pre-post treatment changes in outcomes, and estimated cost-savings from productivity improvement using Irish median salary data. Results. Overall, patients showed significant improvements in all WPAI outcomes with small effect sizes (6-9%, d=.18-30). Greater improvements in workplace functioning were linked to larger reductions in depression (r=.10-.34) and anxiety symptoms (r=.06-.33), both of which on average reduced by ~3 points. Patients with higher baseline clinical severity experienced more substantial improvements in workplace functioning than subclinical patients. These productivity gains correspond to &gt;€4000 annual savings per patient treated, totalling to over €29 million for our nationally representative sample. Conclusion. Our findings support iCBT as a scalable, cost-effective intervention that can effectively improve workplace functioning associated with depression and anxiety when integrated within public health service provision.",

          "abstract": "Managing our natural resources often involves learning about the dynamics of the resource while society simultaneously harvests from the resource. However, little is known about how society’s actions affect our ability to learn about a vulnerable resource. Here, we investigate how experience managing a shared resource impacts one’s ability to learn about the underlying dynamics of a resource. We hypothesised that participants' capacity to learn from experience would depend on the behaviour of other group members. 320 participants played a four-player resource management game with computer partners who acted sustainably, unsustainably, or conditionally cooperatively. Participants’ ability to learn the underlying resource dynamics was then assessed in a subsequent single-player resource management game, where the social dynamics were removed and the participants’ understanding of the resource could be evaluated in isolation. Compared to controls with no prior experience, performance on the single-player game improved after experience with sustainable and unsustainable partners, but not after experience with conditionally cooperative partners. However, experience with a single-player game (rather than a group game) outperformed all other experimental conditions; thus individual experience improved performance more than experience in any group dynamic tested. These findings suggest that the presence of others generally hinders learning in resource management contexts, though how much this learning is hindered depends on the behaviour of others.",

How do children think these achievement goals influence adults’ child-directed behaviors? Across two preregistered experiments (n = 90 adults; n = 160 5- to 8-year-old children), we found that children systematically predict that an adult would select a more difficult task for a recipient child when the adult held a learning (vs. performance) goal, and when the recipient was more competent. Importantly, we found that this pattern matched adults’ actual task choices, although adults showed more sensitivity to choosing a task that anchors closely to what a child can reasonably learn from or accomplish. These results suggest children can reason about how adult’s achievement goals manifest into observable actions, which may have consequences for children’s own goal orientations and task selections.",

We asked children and adults to view a television episode, a naturalistic task for which there exists a ground truth, and assessed their event cognition, forced-choice recognition for event details, ability to temporally order scenes, and free recall. Children’s free recall performance improved dramatically with age, with many young children recalling nothing, even though recognition measures showed retention. However, detail in free recall was related to both recognition and temporal order forced-choice memory performance in our full sample, showing agreement among memory measures. For children, free recall was additionally related to verbal skills and more adult-like event segmentation. We propose that free recall has a more protracted developmental trajectory because it requires more substantial verbal skills and better understanding of event schemas than forced-choice memory tasks.",

Residual IRTs exhibited strong sequential dependencies, being positively correlated at lags of one and two transitions.  We used this IRT model to evaluate the hypothesis that chunking helps subjects learn unstructured materials.  Specifically, we hypothesized that chunks would appear as a slow IRT, indicative of a boundary, followed by a sequence of fast IRTs.  Model-based analyses that included sequential dependencies in IRTs offered evidence for spontaneous chunking in free recall of lists that lacked any grouping or hierarchical structure.",

With this literature review, we explore this parallel using the concept of social contagion—the process of information (including attitudes or behaviors) spreading throughout a group— to examine peer influences on quitting smoking with the goal of generating hypotheses about peer-to-peer influence on veg*nism.",

The reason for searching for alternative learning approaches is mainly because of a lack of engagement from both staff and students. 3D full immersive VR application and 2D desktop computer simulations have previously been found to provide an effective alternative learning environment keeping students and staff engaged with the learning and teaching process. This study explores whether the independent learning environment using a 3D fully immersive application could enhance undergraduate students learning of interview skills compared to an independent use of the 2D desktop application and video presentation resources in a class environment. Students and staff took part in three different learning conditions (3D full immersive application, 2D desktop application and video in class), where participants' employability skills, user experience and presence were assessed. University staff rated the 3D fully immersive learning condition better for employability skills training, presence and user experience compared to the 2D desktop environment and lecture conditions. Students, on the other hand, found the 3D immersive application to be a more enjoyable experience than the other two learning conditions but no learning environment was significantly better than another. This raises a question regarding the integration of 3D fully immersive systems in class for employability training",

This study focuses on affect anchored to the parenting context (i.e., daily emotional exhaustion, emotional distance from children, and feeling fed up) to assess whether the way parenting affect fluctuates relates to dysfunction: parental burnout severity. We focus on three specific patterns (i.e., affective dynamic indices): inertia (i.e., persistence across days), variation (i.e., magnitude of change), and covariation (i.e., whether affect variables fluctuate together). We reanalyzed multiple datasets (from Belgium and the U.S.) yielding 180 parents who had rated their parenting affect daily for either three or eight weeks. We computed a regression model with all affective indices as predictors (controlling for mean levels), with parental burnout severity as the outcome variable. Results indicate that inertia of emotional distance predicts parental burnout severity across most sensitivity models (i.e., even with varied operationalizations of affective indices). No other temporal pattern (i.e., variation or covariation) robustly predicted parental burnout severity, although the mean levels of emotional distance and emotional exhaustion did. Results from sensitivity analyses emphasize that operationalization choices for affective indices can yield varying values and impact results.",

A sample of 343 autistic and 345 non-autistic women completed each questionnaire and the proportion of those scoring above or below each suggested cut-off were used to analyse specificity and sensitivity. The AQ50 was less sensitive in correctly identifying autistic women than both the CAT-Q and GQ-ASC. However, the AQ50 showed high specificity in correctly identifying most non-autistic women. The CAT-Q and GQ-ASC were equally highly effective in identifying autistic women but over half of non-autistic women scored above the cut-off for the GQ-ASC making it the least specific. Additional evaluative ratings and comments showed that autistic women found the AQ50 to be stereotyped and the least clear to interpret. The GQ-ASC was overall preferred despite some questions not feeling age appropriate. This study highlights the need for assessment questions that reflect the broader diversity of autistic traits.",

Recent advances in systematic review methodology and computational linguistics reveal gaps in earlier narrative reviews, particularly regarding methodological transparency, heterogeneity across OCD subtypes, and integration of objective linguistic biomarkers. This article synthesizes evidence linking neurotransmitter dysregulation (serotonin, dopamine, glutamate) and frontostriatal circuit abnormalities to language deficits in OCD, while emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies, computational tools, and stratification by symptom dimensions.

          "abstract": "Theories of embodied cognition suggest that after an initial visual processing stage, emotional faces elicit spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM), and that the accompanying change in proprioceptive facial feedback contributes to facial emotion recognition. However, this temporal sequence has not yet been properly tested, given the lack of methods allowing to manipulate or interfere with facial muscle activity at specific time points. The current study (N=52, 28 female) investigated this key question using EEG and facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) – a technique offering superior control over which facial muscles are activated and when. Participants categorised neutral, happy, and sad avatar faces as either happy or sad, and received fNMES (except in the control condition) to bilateral zygomaticus major muscles during early visual processing (-250 to +250 ms of face onset), or later visual processing, when SFM typically arises (500 to 1000 ms after face onset). Both early and late fNMES resulted in a happiness bias specific to neutral faces, which was mediated by a reduced N170 in the early window. In contrast, a modulation of the beta-band (13-22 Hz) coherence between somatomotor and occipital cortices was found in the late fNMES, although this did not predict categorisation choice. We propose that facial feedback biases emotion recognition at different visual processing stages by reducing visual processing load.",

          "authors": "Matti Toivo Juhani Heino",
          "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving world, human behaviour plays a crucial role in addressing complex challenges. These span from mitigating non-communicable diseases, to climate action and pandemic preparedness. Traditional behaviour change research has focused on identifying and addressing specific factors that impede positive change, using a decomposition-based approach. This approach breaks key behaviours down into their component parts, and seeks to affect influences – again broken down into e.g. attitudes, social norms, resources and other opportunity-related factors – on these components. Component-dominant dynamics refer to a situation, where the behaviour of a system is determined primarily by the properties of its individual components, rather than by emergent phenomena. The decomposition-based approach is highly effective when this is the case. However, the approach may have severely limited effectiveness in contexts characterized by interaction-dominant dynamics, where outcomes are determined not by individual components, but emerge from the ongoing interdependent influences between them. Interaction-dominant systems have been studied in various fields under the interdisciplinary rubric of complex systems science. \n\nThis work argues that people are active agentic creatures, who are self-determined and self-organising experts of their own environments, which infuses social systems with inherent non-stationarity and hence uncertainty: Objects of study in behaviour change science, as well as their relationships, change. In addition, small events can cause large impacts, and long periods of apparent stability can be punctuated by rapid change. This implies that past data may be of limited use for inference and interventions across contexts or time. Indeed, the opportunities and risks laying in the future of complex systems or decision making contexts, are vastly more numerous than those which could be called merely complicated. Therefore, it should be carefully evaluated, to what extent a given situation is indeed amenable to decomposition-based solutions. While it might be impossible to predict the long-term future of some complex “non-linear” systems, risks and opportunities can be evaluated based on evolutionary potential of their space of possibilities. \n\nThe specific contribution of articles included in this work supports the argument as follows. Article I takes the view of people as agentic, autonomous decision makers, and points to the need to foster their capacity to self-organise. It describes a compendium of techniques, which (combined with proper scaffolding and support) could enable individuals to better self-manage their motivation and behaviour. Article II uses data containing self-management techniques to demonstrate a conceptually important model, where behaviours – and what the literature has conventionally considered their influences, precursors, or determinants – are represented as components of a mutually interacting network. The network representation reflects a deviation from the conventional conceptualisation, which hinges on component-dominant dynamics to depict simplistic causes and their effects with boxes and arrows. The article also discusses the importance of distributional shapes, as well as how summary statistics developed for simple, symmetric distributions can misdirect inference when the shape is more varied. Article III proposes a process definition of behaviour change, particularly calling for attention to some core features of complex systems; interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity. It points out how interaction-dominant dynamics can produce distributional shapes, poorly amenable conventional analysis. It also discusses problems of traditional linear models of between-individual data for studying behaviour change, and expands the idea of aforementioned between-individual networks to those containing temporal recurrences of idiographic system states – attractors. Article IV depicts how the conceptualisation of behaviour change as movement in an attractor landscape can be used to understand change on different scales of observation, from individuals to communities and the society at large. It brings our attention to how non-linearities in interconnected systems can mean sudden transitions after long periods of stability and, more generally, the need to be wary of attractor states yet unseen, when there is uncertainty about distribution shapes.\n\nTo address the transparency and irreducibility concerns currently being voiced across scientific disciplines, all the data and analysis scripts are made publicly available online. Apart from Article I, these supplements are produced directly from the data as accompanying websites to reduce error and increase accessibility.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization is driving disconnection and animosity between opponents. We propose that perceptions of self-disclosure between partisans helps reduce this hostility. Building on extensive research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal connections, we test whether political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate that self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity, through building connection between political opponents. While previous work showed that political discussions based on sharing personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based discussions, our results indicate this is because of the self-disclosing nature of experiences. Leveraging this, we find many arguments partisans share with each other (e.g., facts) can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing (tested through manipulating self-disclosure). By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging political divides.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to systematically review research concerning changes in music consumption across the lifespan to better understand how adults of all ages consume music. Keyword searches of four academic databases (i.e., Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, &amp; Academic Search Complete) identified 2,002 peer-reviewed articles, and of these, fifteen articles were selected for review using the PRISMA protocol. The findings of the review indicated that very few studies have investigated how people of all ages consume music, and what little research has been done on this topic has been methodologically inconsistent and led to findings that are contradictory and inconclusive. Several questionnaire studies found that music consumption decreased with age, whilst an interview study found that music consumption is likely to increase with age. This review also identified a shortlist of possible factors (e.g., life goals, personality, conformity) that might account for any age-related changes in musical consumption. With many people living in ageing societies, and music a ubiquitous part of daily life, the review recommends that future research on this topic should seek to reflect how people of all ages consume music, and to identify the factors responsible for any changes in music consumption as people grow older.",

Recently, various behavioural sciences have begun to acknowledge the systematic nature and high relevance of this individuality – but approaches from different disciplines are currently isolated from each other. We propose an integrative, interdisciplinary approach for a more comprehensive understanding of individuality in social behaviour, considering: (1) features (What kinds of individual differences exist, and what is their magnitude?), (2) sources (How do these differences emerge in the social environments that individuals live in?), and (3) outcomes (What are the consequences of these differences, and how can relevant outcomes be changed through tailored interventions?). We highlight common insights across disciplines; key challenges stemming from insular, discipline-specific approaches; and novel potentials enabled by the proposed interdisciplinary approach. Moreover, by allowing comparative analyses across species, groups of individuals, and contexts, our approach promises to uncover the shared and unique nature of individuality in human social behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Almost all parents lie to their children, and recent studies warn that parental lying may negatively impact trust of children in their parents. However, perspectives of children on parental lying and its effect on trust in parents have rarely been studied. In the current manuscript, we (1) report the development and co-creation of an age-appropriate instrument to assess children’s perspectives on parental lying in middle childhood (8- to 12-year-olds), (2) investigate in a pilot sample (n = 62 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) whether the instrument is able to capture children’s perspectives on parental lying and truth telling, and (3) explore children’s perspectives on parental lying and trust. Three different lies were distinguished: lies to benefit the parent, lies to benefit the child and prudential lies. The instrument was co-created with a child panel (n = 5 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) and a game designer. The instrument was deemed age-appropriate based on the high percentages of correct classifications of parental lies and truths. Our results demonstrated that children evaluated child-benefit and prudential parental lies more positively than liar-benefitting parental lies. Children expected trust to be lower when a parent used a liar-benefitting lie as compared to a child-benefitting lie. Our results demonstrated that 8- to 12-year-olds already have differentiated opinions about different types of parental lies and how they can affect trust, and our open-access instrument provides an engaging and age-appropriate opportunity for future research into children’s view on parental lying and its effect on trust.",

          "abstract": "Background: 91% of those who menstruate reported to experiencing associated pain. Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, the prevalence, extent and socio-demographic variation of menstrual pain remains understudied at national levels - whether due to a shortage of applicable data at national scales or other factors.\nMethod: We assess the extent and variation of menstrual pain at a national level. To achieve this, we develop a novel proxy measure for menstrual pain, utilising behavioural data extracted from mass supermarket shopping logs. Baskets where pain and menstrual items co-occur are investigated, and normalized against baskets in which pain or menstrual items occur in isolation. Propensity of menstrual pain purchases are aggregated temporally and geographically across England, prior to linkage with socio-demographic indicators regionally. \nResults: Findings indicate high prevalence of menstrual pain across England, with 26.7% of customers I our dataset buying pain relief together with menstrual products. People who menstruate are observed to be four times more likely to purchase pain relief with menstrual items than without. Average regional income provides the strongest predictor of menstrual pain co-purchases, with lower income regions exhibiting a 32% lower menstrual-pain purchase than higher income regions.\nDiscussion: The robust presence of a consistent 28-day cycle in menstrual-pain purchases provides empirical evidence for the use of behavioural proxies for menstrual pain alongside traditional measures. Significant regional differences observed in the prevalence of menstrual-pain transactions across England brings into light existing disparities. Future research into improved understanding of sociodemographic factors associated with menstrual pain could inform strategies to predict and prevent menstrual pain and its adverse impacts.",

It is being studied by mental health professionals, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners, and computer science communities due to its growing prevalence. However, the lack of a survey article highlighting the study approaches of these communities is still a knowledge transfer impediment between the communities. This survey article aims to bridge the gap by providing a systematic and comprehensive overview of the existing SAD research from all these communities.\n \n    We have discussed the existing SAD assessment techniques and focused on leveraging digital technologies to detect SAD. Furthermore, we have grouped the existing literature based on the study approach into two groups (i.e., lab and field). For each group, we have discussed the research methodologies followed to attain respective objectives. We have emphasized on the field studies owing to the growing use of digital devices, especially smartphones, and wearables, for understanding SAD.   This template simplifies and summarizes the use of artificial intelligence to predict and detect SAD using digitally captured data. In addition to the existing digital SAD psychotherapy, we have also discussed mHealth interventions that use smartphones and wearables to manage mental disorders. Finally, we have discussed challenges and future directions with possible solutions that can be incorporated into future SAD study designs.",

The test consists of two cards each containing the same 20 pictures: one with bare pictures and the other with superimposed written word distractors. In this proof-of-principle study with two experiments, we report on the test’s development and initial validation. In an age-diverse pool of language-unimpaired individuals, we found the expected interference and repetition priming effects, next to convergent validity.

We specifically test in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1603 American and Singaporean adults) whether thinking about karma (a supernatural force that punishes misdeeds) reduces punishment. Results confirm that being prompted to consider karma reduces inclinations to punish selfishness in a Third Party Punishment Game. These findings suggest that karma beliefs may have played a role in the cultural evolution of human cooperation by reducing the costs of human norm enforcement while maintaining incentives for prosocial behaviour through the threat of supernatural punishment.",

We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel et al., 2021, 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.",

We find that while a third of consumers collect, very few who do so identify strongly as collectors.

This interdisciplinary contribution explores the psychological and economic motivations that drive individuals without substantial financial resources to engage in symbolic and ostentatious consumption behaviors. Drawing on classical (Veblen, Bourdieu) and contemporary theories (behavioral economics, self-psychology, signaling theory), and integrating reflections on the impact of digital media and popular music trends (especially rap and trap), the article highlights how the search for visibility and social recognition can lead to risky behaviors such as indebtedness, pursuit of \"easy success\" models (e.g., online trading), and the commodification of the body through sexual content platforms. The final reflections offer a critical interpretation of the phenomenon and emphasize the need for education aimed at substance, identity resilience and economic awareness.",

Our results show that progressively increasing task difficulty during training facilitates learning compared to training at a fixed level of difficulty or at random. Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-transcendence—connectedness within and beyond the self—is a complex phenomenon theorized to increase with age, but evidence is mixed. This longitudinal study is the first to investigate changes in self-transcendence across late midlife using life story narratives. \nMethod: We tracked self-reported and narrative identity self-transcendence scores of 163 participants as they aged from M=56.4 (SD=0.95) to M=64.5 (SD=0.94). Participants were 64.4% women, 35.6% men; 55.2% White, 42.9% Black, 1.8% interracial/other; median income was $75,000–$100,000; median education was college graduate. \nResults: Self-transcendence narrative themes of closure and self-actualization increased significantly over time, especially between ages 60–65, but self-reported self-transcendence did not change. These trends were not uniform; race by gender groups exhibited distinct trajectories over time.\nDiscussion: Late midlife is seen as ushering in opportunities for increased self-transcendence, especially acceptance of oneself and one’s life. We found some of the strongest empirical evidence of this phenomenon to date. On average, U.S. Black and White adults narrated their life stories with less regret and more satisfaction with self across late midlife. Findings demonstrate the utility of leveraging first-person narrative identity methods to collect and analyze data about rich, complex personality constructs and highlight positive changes associated with late midlife.",

          "abstract": "Background: Most research assessing HIV anxiety relies on single-item measures or psychometric measures that are outdated in terms of concepts and language. There is a critical need for a robust, reliable, and contemporary measure to identify populations at risk of avoiding HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, thereby supporting global HIV eradication goals. Method:  Focus groups informed the initial development of the HIV Anxiety Scale (HAS), revised through expert feedback. The factor structure was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with 251 participants. In Study 2, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 participants was performed alongside validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance assessments. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 supported a 3-factor model, resulting in a 16-item measure with the following subscales: Psychosocial Implications of HIV, Lifestyle Implications of HIV, and HIV Testing Anxiety. The HAS demonstrated a good factor structure, acceptable validity and excellent internal consistency across diverse groups in Study 2. Conclusions: The HAS provides a contemporary, robust measure of HIV anxiety, addressing limitations of previous tools and contributing to efforts to identify and support populations at risk of HIV avoidance behaviours.",

Two hundred forty-nine licensed psychologists in the United States, rated the quality of AI-generated and human-generated psychological reports across six dimensions: overall quality, readability, writing style, organizational structure, summary quality, and recommendation quality. The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability. Participants were more likely to prefer and approve human-generated reports for clinical use (p = 0.042), though the majority expressed discomfort with both types. While AI shows promise in augmenting psychological report writing, particularly in generating recommendations, human expertise remains crucial, especially in summarizing information. These findings highlight the need for professional guidelines on AI use in psychological practice and updated educational curricula to prepare future psychologists for an evolving technological landscape in mental health care.",

Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories. Our results shed new light on young infants’ sensitivities to foundational domains of everyday life prior to their capacity for self-guided exploration.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation often relies on people’s ability to discern in whom to invest their limited resources. One solution to this partner choice dilemma entails estimating one’s fitness interdependence with others. Previous studies indicate that estimates of fitness interdependence (i.e., shared fate) motivate cooperation, but the sources of information that contribute to shared fate remain an elusive question. We examine links among ten sources of interdependence (i.e., attributes and experiences that yoke partners’ fitness), shared fate, and cooperation among the Mayangna, a small-scale horticultural society in Nicaragua. While eight sources of interdependence showed positive bivariate associations with shared fate, only relatedness, commensality, and shared subsistence activities were uniquely associated with higher shared fate. Moreover, shared fate (1) was associated with more cooperation across seven fitness-relevant domains, (2) statistically mediated associations between relatedness and cooperation, and (3) had strong effects on cooperation (i.e., forgoing money to buy rice for a partner). Results indicate that shared fate arises from sources of fitness interdependence and cooperation is proximally guided by shared fate. Estimates of fitness interdependence by way of shared fate may therefore offer a simple solution to partner choice dilemmas: Help partners if one has a positive stake in their welfare.",

We have developed a list of Ten Simple rules to aid researchers to perform data collection on queer individuals, focussing on study design and data dissemination. We address several issues in queer data, such as language use, dealing with small populations, and balancing demands. We also discuss how to extend this inclusive practice for studies on animal populations. These rules are aimed at anybody surveying populations which may contain queer individuals, including for example research studies and inclusivity surveys for conferences.

However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impacts of such policies could have on individuals with eating disorders. This review aimed to summarise the literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition labels on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. Methods: A systematic search across eight databases was conducted up to 11th of October 2023. Studies were included if they assessed the impact of out-of-home nutrition labelling policies on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. 538 studies were screened, of which 16 studies met inclusion criteria and were included. Results: The reviewed studies included 5 experimental/quasi-experimental studies, 5 cross-sectional studies, and 6 qualitative/mixed methods studies. Most studies were conducted in Western countries and all study participants were adults. Across studies, eating disorder pathology was associated with noticing labels more frequently, paying more attention to caloric intake, and more frequent behaviour changes due to caloric values. The meta-synthesis identified 5 themes based on the qualitative findings, being drawn to calories, facilitating the eating disorder, reassurance, social eating, and frustration.  Discussion: The current review summarised the existing literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition label policies on individuals with eating disorders. The evidence suggests that there is cause for concern regarding negative impacts, particularly for those with restrictive eating disorders, which should be explored further by research and considered by policy makers when making decisions on public health policies.",

As she sits in her obstetrician's office, trying to understand the doctor's explanation about amniocentesis, Maria's limited English proficiency becomes a significant barrier. Without an interpreter, she grapples with unfamiliar medical terms and complex risk statistics, leaving her confused and anxious about this critical decision. This scenario, highlighting communication barriers faced by the approximately 25 million limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals in the U.S., is precisely the kind of problem Chipman, Meagher, and Barwise (2023) address in their framework for improving healthcare for LEP populations. However, even if Maria could understand every word perfectly, she would face another, less obvious challenge. Recent research suggests that merely using a foreign language can alter decision-making processes, potentially leading patients to make choices that do not truly reflect their values or risk preferences. While Chipman and colleagues. provide valuable insights on improving access and communication for LEP individuals, here I explore how the cognitive effects of foreign language use might impact patient choices in critical medical decisions, even when linguistic comprehension is not an issue.",

          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

This study explored this phenomenon, for the first time, from a language processing perspective. Across three studies, English- and Spanish-native adults completed a translation elicitation task, in which they listened to a series of words from an unfamiliar language (Catalan or Spanish for English speakers, Catalan for Spanish speakers). For each presented word, participants had to type their best-guess translation in their native language. Both English and Spanish natives were surprisingly good at translating unfamiliar words, efficiently exploiting the phonological similarity between the presented (unfamiliar) words and their correct translation. When the correct translation belonged to high-density phonological neighbourhood, participants' ability to benefit from phonological similarity decreased. Spanish participants, whose native language was typologically closer to the presented language, benefited more strongly from phonological similarity than English participants. Overall, we show that speech in an unfamiliar language triggers equivalent dynamics of lexical selection than native speech, providing a psycholinguistic account for homophonic translation.",

For example, in English and other languages, two interpretations commonly available to NPIs are each other's logical duals. \nWe explore the hypothesis that these systematic ambiguities arise due to a bias in the learning process.\nSpecifically, when  a given word is restricted to a specific logical environment (such as the scope of negation), multiple equally `correct' analyses are available to a language learner. Learners might find some of these analyses more attractive than others, explaining why an ambiguity arises when the distributional constraint is relaxed.\nWe employ an artificial grammar learning paradigm to test which interpretations of NPIs are preferred by learners when they encounter NPIs in a positive environment. Our results show strong evidence of a `wide-scope dual' interpretation, although specific properties of the training paradigm may influence these preferences.",

To mitigate these issues, we propose a 'validity by design' approach that separates measurement validation from substantive hypothesis evaluation. Central to our proposal is the establishment of a collaborative consortium tasked with defining core constructs, systematically validating standardized instruments, and disseminating them through open-access platforms.

          "authors": "Yin-To Chui; Susu LAI; Quentin Zhen Qin",
          "abstract": "Distributional learning enables listeners to form phonetic categories by extracting statistical regularities from speech input. Younger Cantonese speakers can acquire the Mandarin level-falling (T1–T4) contrast through distributional learning, with bimodal exposure facilitating category formation and unimodal exposure suppressing it, and fine-grained pitch sensitivity predicting success. However, aging is associated with declines in pitch sensitivity and phonetic boundary formation, which may disrupt this process. This study examined whether Cantonese-speaking older adults exhibit distributional learning of Mandarin T1–T4 and whether cognitive factors predict success. Sixty-four participants completed a pretest–training–posttest procedure with bimodal or unimodal exposure. While older adults improved in tone discrimination, no group differences emerged. Further analysis showed those with lower pitch-related auditory memory failed to learn from unimodal input. These results suggest a shift from perceptual encoding to memory-based learning and highlight age-related changes in speech perception and the limits of statistical learning in older adulthood.",

          "authors": "Kim Marie Sobania; Kai Härpfer; Hannes Per Carsten; Tania Marie Lincoln; Franziska Magdalena Kausche; Anja Riesel",
          "abstract": "Fear learning processes are often considered underlying mechanisms in the development and maintenance of various anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, limited attention has been paid to whether these changes are shared across disorders or certain symptoms. In this context, transdiagnostic research on symptom dimensions is especially relevant, as it addresses the significant symptom overlap and heterogeneity observed in anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the current study, we investigated attentional processes (late positive potential), defensive responding (fear-potentiated startle), and subjective ratings (US-expectancy) in a transdiagnostic sample of participants with OCD (n=38), social phobia (n=39), specific phobia (n=40), and control participants (n=39). We focused on two transdiagnostic anxiety dimensions: anxious arousal and anxious apprehension. A differential fear learning paradigm using geometrical forms was employed, including a habituation, acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. We observed successful fear acquisition across all outcomes, which generalized to the stimulus most similar to the CS+. While fear responses to the CS+ decreased during extinction, they remained significantly elevated compared to the CS-. The results revealed no differences between the diagnostic groups for neither phase, stimulus nor outcome measure. On a dimensional level, anxious arousal was associated with an increased shock expectancy to the CS+ during acquisition, while depressive symptoms were associated with a higher shock expectancy for both CS+ and CS- during extinction. The unexpected absence of differences between diagnostic groups, along with the modulating dimensional effects, supports the utility of these transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in unraveling altered fear learning processes in internalizing disorders.",

We conducted three quantitative vignette-based studies (n = 200) in UK general public samples, considering seven disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)). For each disorder, participants rated how much the disorder reflects the vignette character’s true self, along with perceived causes of the disorders (studies 1 and 2), perceived severity, age of onset, duration, probability of recovery (study 2), and stigmatization (study 3). Disorders differed sharply in the extent to which they were judged to be part of the true self: ADHD, ASD, and OCD received higher true self ratings than major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder intermediate. A disorder was rated more ‘true self’ when it was: perceived more “biologically” caused; perceived less “psychologically” caused; perceived less severe; and recovery was perceived as less likely. Although the extent of stigmatization also varied across disorders, true self ratings did not predict stigmatization. Our results show that the public thinks about different mental disorders in quite different ways, suggesting that different disorders should not be lumped together when considering attitudes and their consequences.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has garnered interest from social and political science researchers alongside its technical dimensions. While technology acceptance has been widely studied, there is a growing need to understand how political ideologies shape public acceptance of AI in an increasingly polarized world. This scoping review synthesizes findings from empirical studies examining ideological differences in the perception and acceptance of AI technologies, with a focus on theoretical explanations for these effects. Using PRISMA guidelines, we applied a systematic search protocol across nine academic databases, identifying 21 relevant articles. We reviewed and mapped the key research themes, constructs, methodologies, results, and theoretical rationales across studies. Our analysis highlights two main explanatory frameworks for the influence of political ideology on AI acceptance: (1) the alignment or conflict between the intended purpose and context of AI technology and the core values of different ideologies, and (2) the heightened sensitivity to threat associated with conservatism, which may reduce acceptance of AI technologies. We integrate perspectives from political and social psychology to expand on these findings, particularly regarding stimulus sampling, threat sensitivity, and ideological orientation. Notably, we observe that study results may be affected by design choices, such as stimulus selection and outcome measures. We advocate for a broader and more diverse array of empirical investigations to rigorously test these two explanations and deepen understanding of ideological influences on AI acceptance.",

Our results show that progressively increasing task difficulty during training facilitates learning compared to training at a fixed level of difficulty or at random. Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "authors": "Ross Watson; Stuart Mackinnon; Andrew Haddon Kemp",
          "abstract": "This article explores the traditional martial art of Wing Chun through the lens of psychology, examining its potential to promote inner development and holistic wellbeing. Originating in Southern China and now practised worldwide, Wing Chun is characterised by its emphasis on fluidity, adaptation, and effectiveness. At its core are five guiding principles—Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness (SPEED)—which shape its practice and reflect its Buddhist and Taoist philosophical roots. We propose that these principles provide a foundation for understanding psychological wellbeing that lay a foundation for developing novel interventions and promoting wellbeing at scale. To articulate this, we introduce a new conceptual framework, REACH, which encompasses five interconnected constructs: Radical nonattachment, Embodied empowerment, (skillful) Adaptation, (self) Control, and (psychological) Hardiness. Radical nonattachment cultivates presence and responsiveness through mindfulness-in-action, facilitating a compassionate awareness of self, others and nature. Embodied empowerment enhances awareness and intuitive decision-making through embodied self-reflexivity, supporting individuals to navigate internal and external cues with greater agency while promoting a deeper sense of groundedness and engagement with the world. Skillful adaptation promotes flexibility and creativity, enabling the experience of psychological flow and supporting practitioners to dynamically engage with their environment. Self-control refines focus and energy management through reflexive, nonconscious regulation, supporting purposeful goal-setting with reduced cognitive effort while cultivating harmony and balance. Psychological hardiness strengthens resilience and fierce compassion, enabling individuals to transform adversity into growth and enhancing capacity for working toward social justice and resisting dominant social narratives. These constructs are presented as power resources, and by bridging martial discipline with mindful awareness and social engagement, we suggest that the REACH model provides a foundation for supporting inner development and holistic wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Measurement is at the core of research in many fields such as psychology. One way that\nresearchers can test the factorial structure of an instrument is to use confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA). When using CFA, researchers evaluate how well the hypothesized structure of a measure\nfits the data. Fit indices, which quantify the degree of misfit, are then used to evaluate the\nfactorial model. Traditionally, researchers have used fixed index cutoff values to judge the\nappropriateness of their factorial models. However, many have discussed the limitations of using\nfixed cutoffs, as fixed values do not generalize to all kinds of models. Recently, McNeish &amp;\nWolf (2023) have developed the Dynamic Fit Index approach (DFI) which enables the\ngeneration of fit index values that are tailored to the characteristics of the model being tested. In\nthe following tutorial, we conduct a CFA on the Attainment of School Achievement Goal Scale\n(A-SAGS) using the lavaan package in R. We then generate fit indices using the dynamic\npackage. We conclude that the DFI approach, although very promising and interesting,\nnecessitates further testing. Dynamic fit indices can be overly strict and do not always agree on\nthe appropriateness of factorial models, which stresses the need to further test its algorithm to see\nwhether it is of practical value when evaluating model fit.\nKeywords: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Fit evaluation, Fit indices, Dynamic fit.

The PCS-J demonstrated sufficient internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Given the known association between hypnotic susceptibility and positive schizotypy, the convergent validity of the PCS-J was supported by a weak positive correlation with positive schizotypy. The discriminant validity of the PCS-J was demonstrated by the absence of a correlation with negative schizotypy.

          "authors": "Peter D. Kvam; Abhay Alaukik",
          "abstract": "Operational definitions have long been a core approach to measuring and relating observed data to theoretical constructs in psychological science. However, many contemporary modeling approaches violate basic assumptions of operational definitions and operationalism more generally -- foregoing assumptions about objectivity, repeatability, independence, and fixed elicitation procedures. Counterintuitively, these departures imbue model-based definitions of constructs with superior measurement properties, such as improved reliability and validity, when compared to their operational counterparts. Instead of relying on operational definitions of constructs, we instead suggest that psychology can adapt relational definitions, representing constructs as latent variables in a multilevel generative model of behavior, self-report, or neuroimaging data. These model-based metrics can better reflect measurement error at multiple levels, account for the interactions between measurement devices (tasks, scales) and measurement objects (participants, processes), provide a holistic account of latent constructs and how they manifest across different measurements, facilitate convergence or discrimination tests among different tasks seeking to measure the same construct, and improve scientific communication by clarifying core psychological concepts. Relational definitions of important constructs should naturally emerge as we apply models more regularly, and these definitions and models will improve as we discover mathematical approaches that are suited to describing psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Are chimpanzees able to inhibit anti-social behavior towards their friends? And how do they react when a friend acts anti-socially towards them? Past work has demonstrated that chimpanzees are selectively prosocial towards their friends: they groom them more, help them more, and share more food with them. However, the influence of friendship in anti-social behavior remains underexplored. Here, we use food theft as a test case to examine the influence of friendship on anti-social behavior – and emotional responses to it. We assigned 26 sanctuary-living chimpanzees to pairs of friends and non-friends based on 20 months of observational data. The pairs then participated in a stealing task, in which one chimpanzee (the “thief”) could pull a tray with pieces of pineapple, which the other was feeding on (the “victim”). Theft was low cost since the chimpanzees were separated by an inaccessible corridor. Each victim was assigned to one friend and one non-friend thief (46 pairs total) and each pair participated in one session of three trials. Chimpanzees stole less from their friends. When theft did occur, chimpanzees initially expressed more negative emotions in the friend condition, but then attenuated this response with increasing trial number. Thieves, meanwhile, expressed more negative emotions in the non-friend condition, suggesting that they treated interactions with non-friends as more hostile. These results speak to the complex role of emotion in chimpanzee friendship.",

The Trigeminal-Somatic Memory Encoding and Neurodegeneration (TMEN) model proposes a radical answer: chronic jaw clenching may physically over-encode traumatic memories via trigeminal-vagus-hippocampal hyperstimulation. In the acute phase, masseter activation triggers brainstem vagal nuclei, driving locus coeruleus norepinephrine surges that hijack hippocampal memory consolidation. In the chronic phase, vagal-mediated gut dysbiosis elevates LPS, priming microglia for neuroinflammatory synaptic pruning. With bruxism-PTSD and bruxism-addiction comorbidities far exceeding chance (Huffman et al., 2019; Mackey et al., 2019), TMEN suggests dental interventions—like Botox to masseters—could disrupt maladaptive memory encoding.

The discrepancy D_EP(f || g) between distributions f(x) and g(x) equals E[p(Mf|xf)], that is, the expected posterior probability for Mf after a single observation x from f(x). In contrast to the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy (which is based on the expected logarithm of the Bayes factor for Mf) the discrepancy D_EP(f || g) (a) is symmetric in the sense that D_EP(f || g) = D_EP(g || f); (b) is defined even when the two distributions are not absolutely continuous with respect to one another; (c) is robust to differences in the tail of the distributions; and (d) quantifies dissimilarity of distributions on the familiar scale of probability. For hypothesis testing, this implies that the expected posterior probability for a true null hypothesis H0 equals the expected posterior probability for a true alternative hypothesis H1, despite the fact that default Bayes factors generally accumulate much more quickly for a true H1 than they do for a true H0.",

One view is that the ability to generate detours and shortcuts demonstrates retention of direction and distance information integrated within a common frame of reference. Another view is that spatial representations are not Euclidean, given findings of biases, distortions, and lack of recognition of impossible spaces in VR. A compromise comes from an individual-differences perspective, suggesting that some people in some environments may be able to use a common reference frame to integrate across routes. We created Virtual Copetown to examine within-route knowledge, integration between routes with experienced connections, and integration between routes requiring inference. We also examined cognitive correlates of the ability to make these judgments. Our results indicated that some people were more accurate across all kinds of pointing judgments, crucially including the ability to judge inferred relations. Their accuracy was not related to the number of node-path-segments separating locations. Other people were less accurate overall, and less accurate for between-route relations than within-route relations, had worse mapping scores, and did decline in accuracy as the number of nodes separating locations became high. Variability was related to self-reports of navigation strategy use.",

In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "authors": "Motonori Yamaguchi",
          "abstract": "Task-irrelevant features are processed even when people are fully aware of their undesired effects on task performance. This fact is exemplified by several types of interference effects in choice-reaction tasks, such as Stroop interference and the Simon effect. The observations are typically attributed to inextricable consequences of automatic cognitive processes involved in performing these tasks. However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox. I propose an integrated view of attentional control, Action Field Theory, which formulates principles that account for a range of phenomena concerning automatic control of human behavior.",

The core idea is that if memory is entirely encoded in synaptic structures, then duplicating a known connectome into a naive host should transfer trained behavioral patterns. This experiment aims to examine whether neural identity and learning are wholly emergent properties of physical structure — offering indirect evidence for the material basis of memory and, more speculatively, consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment increases the risk for mental disorders, including postpartum depression (PPD). Outside the peripartum period, attenuated long-term hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation and perceived chronic stress are discussed as potential mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of childhood maltreatment. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) enables the detection of long-term changes in HPA axis regulation. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of HCC linking childhood maltreatment with symptoms of PPD.\nMethods: We measured childhood maltreatment, symptoms of PPD and chronic stress via online questionnaires in N = 111 individuals 12 months after childbirth. Current and past major depressive episodes were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. To determine HCC of month 09 – 12 postpartum, participants provided self-collected hair samples. Mediated regression models examined the role of HCC and chronic stress for the relation between childhood maltreatment and PPD symptoms.\nResults: Childhood maltreatment predicted higher levels of PPD symptoms and chronic stress, and was associated with higher rates of a current depressive episode but not with HCC. Perceived chronic stress mediated the relationship of childhood maltreatment with symptoms of PPD. \nInterpretation: Individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment are highly vulnerable for adverse mental health outcomes in the postpartum period. Perceived chronic stress may be an important underlying pathway, while neuroendocrinological mechanisms between CM and PPD remain poorly understood. Longitudinal studies are needed to improve our understanding of pathways of CM and PPD, enabling the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) refers to a process by which a priori neutral stimuli gain attentional priority when associated with reward, independently of goal or stimulus-driven attentional control. Although VMAC is considered an automatic and implicit process, the role of awareness of the stimulus-reward contingency on its learning process remains unclear at best. In a well-powered replication of a previous study, we found that VMAC is absent when participants are not explicitly informed about the stimulus-reward contingency in the pre-task instructions. In a second experiment, we show that when instructions are manipulated between groups, only the instructed group shows VMAC. Interestingly, although the no-instruction group did not show VMAC at the group level, participants who became aware of the stimulus-reward contingencies did nevertheless show robust VMAC at the end of the task. Meta-analytic evidence further supports our conclusion by showing that studies that include instructions about the stimulus-reward contingencies yield significantly larger VMAC effects. Taken collectively, these findings suggest that the learning process behind VMAC may not be entirely implicit.",

          "abstract": "Spatial reasoning involves understanding and visualising spatial relations and the spatial properties of objects, including spatial aspects of quantities. Spatialising the mathematics curriculum by emphasising thinking and working spatially has broad benefits for mathematics, including geometry, measures, number, algebra and statistics. Research shows that teaching children to think and work spatially results in substantially improved mathematics performance, with lifelong benefits.\n\nThis trajectory of spatial reasoning development for 7- to 11-year-olds complements the trajectory of spatial reasoning development for birth to seven years developed by the Early Childhood Maths Group (see ECMG Spatial Reasoning Toolkit). These two trajectories are informed by extensive review of research in this area and together offer activities for children from birth to 11 years. This trajectory is presented in four sections, covering space (spatial relations) and shape (objects and properties) for 7- to 9-year-olds and 9- to 11-year-olds. Three columns identify the areas of spatial reasoning, the progression in children’s learning and developmentally appropriate activities. Each child develops in their own unique way: age bands are approximate and dependent on previous experience, so should be used as a guide rather than age-related expectations. Spatial reasoning is wider than traditional geometry, including aspects of space and shape such as position and direction, navigation, perspective-taking, scaling, transformations, shape properties and structure, composition and decomposition; the document could be used to substitute a geometry curriculum, with activities integrated throughout the curriculum. \n\nThis document forms part of a series of Royal Society publications on spatial reasoning which can be found at: Royal Society Curriculum and Assessment and accompanies our earlier work on the ECMG Spatial Reasoning Toolkit. \nThe series includes: \n•\tRS ACME Primary and early years expert panel perspective: Spatial reasoning - June 2024 (royalsociety.org) \n•\tProgression of Spatial Reasoning across age bands (Appendix 1 of document listed above)\n•\tThis document, An evidence-based trajectory of spatial reasoning development for 7- to 11-year-olds.\n•\tWhole-school approach case studies: Supporting Primary Children’s Spatial Reasoning in Geography and Design &amp; Technology",

          "authors": "Rebecca M. Kuiper; Eli-Boaz Clapper",
          "abstract": "In social and behavioral science, the gold standard for scientific evidence is finding results that are consistent across independent studies. To summarize results from multiple studies, parameter estimates are conventionally aggregated with meta-analysis. However, this method is limited to studies that share the same context and design, which often means that a wealth of information remains unexploited. This paper proposes evidence aggregation using GORIC(A) weights: an alternative and/or complementary statistical tool for the aggregation of evidence across studies. Rather than aggregating parameter estimates to come to an overall estimate, GORIC(A) evidence aggregation combines support for a shared central theory and quantifies the overall support. It does so using GORIC(A), an information criterion that can evaluate both equality and inequality/order restrictions. GORIC(A) can be applied to a single study, and this GORIC(A) evidence can be aggregated over multiple studies, irrespective of context or design. The method is validated with a simulation study that shows that GORIC(A) evidence aggregation is not affected by study heterogeneity and can be used for evidence synthesis. This implies that GORIC(A) evidence aggregation can successfully combine evidence for a central theory over a widely diverse set of studies. This increases the available information to investigate a theory. Furthermore, GORIC(A) evidence aggregation aids in robustness and confidence of results because it can take into account the results of all type of studies that examine the central theory.",

          "abstract": "Strong magnetic fields in MRI scanners induce magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS), leading to illusory motion perception, and reflexive eye movements (nystagmus). Studies outside the scanner have shown that vestibular information can interfere with cognitive tasks. This study examines the effect of MVS on cognitive functions in 30 participants performing mental rotation tasks in a 7T MRI\nscanner. To investigate specific cognitive components, participants completed both a mental self-rotation task and a mental figure rotation task. Tasks were performed while lying in the 7T MRI scanner under two conditions: supine (strong MVS) and tilted head position (weak MVS) to manipulate stimulation strength within-subjects. Strength of MVS was confirmed by nystagmus response using eye tracking inside the bore. Bayesian multilevel models show that stronger MVS impaired performance in mental self-rotation but performance in the figure rotation task was unaffected. These findings suggest that MVS selectively disrupts cognitive tasks reliant on own body reference frames, highlighting the influence of vestibular information on spatial cognition. This study provides first evidence of a specific effect of MVS on performance in a cognitive task, with important implications for neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Decades of research on the dimensional nature of personality disorder (PD) have led to the replacement of categorical PD diagnoses by a dimensional assessment of PD severity (PDS) in ICD-11, which essentially corresponds to personality functioning in the alternative DSM-5 model for PDs. Besides advancing the focus in the diagnosis of PD on impairments in self and interpersonal functioning, this shift also urges clinicians and researchers worldwide to get familiar with new diagnostic approaches. \nAims: This study investigated which PDS dimensions among different assessment methods and conceptualizations have the most predictive value for overall PDS. \nMethods: Using semi-structured interviews and self-reports of personality functioning, personality organization, and personality structure in clinical samples of different settings in Switzerland and Germany (n = 534), we calculated a latent general factor for PDS (g-PDS) by applying a correlated trait correlated method – 1 model. \nResults: Our results showed that four interview-assessed PDS dimensions - defense mechanisms, desire and capacity for closeness, sense of self, and comprehension and appreciation of others’ experiences and motivations account for 91.1% of variance of g-PDS, with a combination of either two of these four dimensions already explaining between 81.7% and 88.9%. Regarding self-reports, the dimensions depth and duration of connections, self-perception, object perception, and attachment capacity to internal objects predicted 61.3% of the variance of a latent interview-based score, with all investigated self-reported dimensions together adding up to 65.2% variance explanation. \nConclusions: Taken together, our data suggest that focusing on specific dimensions, such as intimacy and identity, in time-limited settings might be viable in determining PDS efficiently.",

          "abstract": "Background: Despite the benefits smartphone technology offers, our phones are available to us almost all of the time and excessive smartphone use may be linked to problematic behaviours and mental illness symptoms. Therefore management of our daily screen time is integral to wellbeing in the digital era. Design: A recent randomised controlled trial (NCT06353451) randomised university students (N=111) to either reduce their daily phone use (intervention) or continue use as normal (control). Using a cross-over design, the control group later received the intervention. The results demonstrated that reducing smartphone use to &lt;2hrs/day improved self-reported mental health, as compared to a control group with no change in screen time. Methods: The aim of this paper was a secondary analysis of daily heart rate variability data (HRV) measured with Fitbit devices to assess physiological changes during the intervention. A total of 45 participants provided baseline, intervention and follow-up HRV data. Mental health variables were measured using standardised questionnaires. Results: A linear multilevel regression indicated HRV significantly declined during the intervention compared to baseline. HRV during the intervention significantly correlated with craving and sleep quality. Conclusions: This may suggest that participants are experiencing a response akin to withdrawal from a behavioural addiction. Importantly, participants reported improved mental wellbeing, suggesting benefits of controlled smartphone use, but our findings provide a deeper insight into the processes underlying reduction in smartphone use and suggest craving and sleep hygiene may be important factors to additionally consider in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Overconfidence is prevalent despite being linked to various negative outcomes for individuals,\norganizations, and even societies. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, C. Anderson, Brion, et al. (2012) proposed a status-enhancement theory of overconfidence: Expressing overconfidence helps individuals attain social status. In this registered report, we conducted a direct replication of Study 5 by C. Anderson, Brion, et al. (2012), who found that individual differences in desire for status were positively correlated with being overconfident about one’s task performance relative to others. We also tested the generalizability of the key relationship to a different measure of desire for status. Furthermore, we complemented traditional significance testing with equivalence testing and Bayesian analysis to test a set of null hypotheses in the original study.We found support for the status-enhancement hypothesis: Desire for status had a positive association with overconfidence using both the original measure of desire for status (β = 0.19, 95% CI [0.09, 0.28]) and the alternative measure (β = 0.31, 95% CI [0.22, 0.39]). A follow-up extension study aimed to test this relationship causally by manipulating the social context where status motives may be stronger (a competitive vs. cooperative context) and testing whether such an effect is driven by state-level desire for status. We did not find a direct causal effect of social context on overconfidence but an indirect association via state-level desire for status: A competitive (vs. cooperative) group context increased desire for status (β = 0.34, 95% CI [0.18, 0.51]), which in turn predicted greater overconfidence (β = 0.38, 95% CI [0.31, 0.46]).",

          "abstract": "Valid generalisations from sample to population require representative samples. This is especially the case for psychological test norms as they are only useful to the extent that the normative samples can stand in for reference populations. However, as a field, we continue to face difficulties defining, acquiring, and describing representative samples. Having engaged with similar problems for a long time, political and other social scientists have developed a sophisticated set of tools for dealing with them. In this article, we therefore draw on insights from these fields to illustrate what measures need to be taken at all research stages to maximise sample representativeness, and the potential benefits of sample weighting in psychology. We argue that a specific class of weighting methods, Regularised Prediction and Poststratification (RPP) holds promise for improving psychological test norming practice. RPP involves fitting a regularised prediction model to a large and diverse sample and weighting predicted scores by true population values (sourced from census data, for example). Using IQ test data from the TwinLife study (N = 9,980, Culture Fair Test, CFT 20-R) as a case study, we show that RPP yields IQ scores that differ by up to 19 IQ points (on average by 4.21 points) from those reported in the CFT 20-R manual, which were based on traditional norming methods. We observed sizeable differences to other norming/weighting approaches, such as semiparametric and other continuous norming methods. Differences of this magnitude can lead to decision errors with potentially life-altering consequences (e.g., about intellectual disability). We contend that psychology could benefit from more widely available, high-quality norms for many aspects of research and practice and plead for the change in research practice necessary to make these benefits possible.",

Participants were categorized into six clusters based on psychological characteristics and the gap between subjective and actual ages. Based on cluster analysis, psychologically mature groups exhibited high ego resilience, adaptability, self-awareness, and autonomy, aligning with traits of successful aging. Cluster 2 participants perceived themselves as younger due to positive psychological traits associated with increased longevity and improved health outcomes. Conversely, Cluster 6 participants exhibited low psychological maturity and high depressive symptoms, recognizing their subjective age as older. Subjective age and psychological maturity significantly impact the trajectory of successful aging.

          "abstract": "This study explores the complex relationship between psychological maturity and subjective age perception through analyses using uniform manifold approximation and projection and machine learning. A survey involving 3,000 adults revealed a general tendency for subjective age to be perceived as younger than the actual age. Participants were categorized into six clusters based on psychological characteristics and the gap between subjective and actual ages. Based on cluster analysis, psychologically mature groups exhibited high ego resilience, adaptability, self-awareness, and autonomy, aligning with traits of successful aging. Cluster 2 participants perceived themselves as younger due to positive psychological traits associated with increased longevity and improved health outcomes. Conversely, Cluster 6 participants exhibited low psychological maturity and high depressive symptoms, recognizing their subjective age as older. Subjective age and psychological maturity significantly impact the trajectory of successful aging. The current psychological maturity classification model provides a new framework to enhance strategies for successful aging.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical models suggest that loneliness may be linked to abnormal social information processing and reduced emotion regulation capacity; yet these effects have mostly been investigated using self-report methods. Therefore, the current preregistered study examined whether loneliness is associated with objective and subjective markers of bottom-up emotional reactivity and cognitive reappraisal efficiency in a cohort of 150 young adults (18–35 years old) recruited to reflect the distribution of loneliness scores in the Polish population. Participants completed an emotion processing and regulation task with both social and nonsocial stimuli while their electroencephalography activity was recorded. Contrary to the hypotheses, when faced with socio-affective stimuli, lonelier individuals did not exhibit abnormal markers of early sensory processing, late sustained processing, or decreased efficiency in reappraisal use, as indicated by event-related potential markers. Only a weak association between loneliness and an increased P300 response to negative vs. neutral social stimuli was found. This pattern of findings did not align with subjective arousal reports, which suggested a decreased response to negative social stimuli and reduced cognitive reappraisal efficiency in lonelier participants. These results suggest that loneliness is linked to disruptions in emotional self-awareness rather than an abnormal response to socio-affective stimuli.",

Here, we assessed 4,350 healthy individuals and 235 people with major depressive disorder or on antidepressants. The results demonstrated significant symptom overlap between the three syndromes. However, factor analysis revealed five distinct dimensions: depression, anhedonia and three apathy domains (behavioural, social, emotional). While depression was strongly correlated with behavioural apathy and moderately with social apathy, there was no such relationship with emotional apathy. Using a feature-selection algorithm, we identified ten key symptoms – phenotypic markers – that reliably distinguished each syndrome in isolation, with replication in independent datasets. Crucially, emotional apathy emerged as a key domain differentiating apathy from depression and associated with reduced affective empathy as well as diminished sensitivity to emotional intensity. These findings reveal key relationships between apathy, depression, and anhedonia, but also demonstrate their separability on the basis of distinct phenotypic patterns.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Network theory of psychopathology offers a promising framework for personalizing psychotherapy based on personalized symptom networks. However, the estimation of these networks representing an individual's mental disorder is methodologically challenging. The recently developed method of perceived causal relations (PECAN), in which relations between symptoms are determined on the basis of the individual's perception, represents a promising method of network creation. However, no child- or adolescent-sensitive PECAN version exists.\nMethods: This study adapted PECAN for individuals aged 10 and older (PECAN-CA) and evaluated its reliability and feasibility. A total of N = 75 socially anxious children and adolescents (10–21years) created personalized symptom networks based on PECAN-CA for a past social situation. Retest reliability was tested immediately and after four weeks, comparing results to prior studies applying PECAN to adults and adolescents. Exploratory analyses examined factors influencing reliability and feasibility.\nResults: Participants generally rated PECAN-CA as feasible. Networks generated were comparably reliable to those from PECAN studies with adults and more reliable than those from PECAN studies with adolescents. Centrality measures, critical for clinical decisions, showed high reliability (r = .89–.95). Older age and greater understanding of network theory concepts enhanced feasibility and reliability. Selecting fewer symptoms improved reliability.\nConclusion: Overall, PECAN-CA enables the creation of reliable networks in childhood and adolescence. Psychoeducation on concepts of network theory seems important for effective implementation. For younger individuals, PECAN-CA may not work in some cases or only if the number of symptoms included in the network is reduced to a minimum.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn because they employ the base-10 system as whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, leading to worse performance when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs, like 0.8 vs. 0.26, than Consistent pairs like 0.86 vs. 0.2. Students may be applying the whole number rule: “more digits = larger number” or they could be ignoring the decimal points and comparing 8 vs. 26. This study used neuroimaging and our specially designed stimulus set to distinguish between these possibilities. We focused on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), implicated in numerical magnitude processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, implicated in inhibitory control. We found no neural differences between Consistent and Inconsistent comparisons, suggesting that the number of digits does not drive brain responses in skilled adults (n=21). Instead, for Consistent comparisons, we found that the IPS was sensitive to the actual distance between the decimals, while the ACC showed this pattern for Inconsistent comparisons. Crucially, we also examined the effect of the distance between the decimal pairs when ignoring the decimal point. Here, we found sensitivity to this distance among Inconsistent comparisons in the IPS and insula, suggesting that whole number referents are automatically processed during decimal comparison and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. More broadly, our results underscore the unique challenges of decimal notation, revealing the need for educational practices that emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than highlighting similarities.",

          "abstract": "Backgrounds: The overlapping symptoms between bipolar disorder (BD) in the depressive period and major depressive disorder (MDD) pose a substantial challenge in diagnosis and treatment. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that mood dysregulation may be linked to impairments in the dopamine reward system in the brain, but the underlying neurocomputational differences between BD and MDD remain elusive. In this study, we investigate whether atypical reward processing affects subjective mood in adolescents with BD and MDD. Our findings aim to elucidate the behavioral and neural differences between the two groups, facilitating more accurate and timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\nMethods: Forty-five adolescents (aged ≤ 19 years) diagnosed with BD (N = 25) or MDD (N = 20) were asked to complete a risky gambling task while their brain responses were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Several computational models were constructed to uncover the associations between various reward components (e.g., reward prediction errors, RPE) and trial-wise fluctuation in subjective mood during the gambling task.\n\nResults: We found that adolescents with BD exhibited a greater behavioral propensity for uncertain options, as compared to those with MDD. Computational modeling and mediation analysis suggest a triple relationship between RPE-mood association, decision rationality, and symptom severity. Using fMRI, we further observed distinct brain response patterns in a distributed mood regulation network between adolescents with BD and MDD.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of RPE in mood regulation and suggest more potential engagement of the model-free control system in BD as compared to MDD. These results provide new insights into the diagnosis and rehabilitation of BD and MDD in adolescents.",

This mechanism could explain the high bruxism-PTSD comorbidity (60-70% vs. 8-15% general population) and offers immediately testable interventions, including botulinum toxin to masseters and occlusal splints to disrupt encoding.

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This work has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

Consumer-grade devices tend to rely on heart rate (HR)-based estimation methods to classify PA intensity, which contrasts with traditional research-grade accelerometers that use count- or raw-acceleration metrics. Comparability issues are particularly salient across individuals with varying weight status. In this commentary, we discuss systematic discrepancies between HR-based (relative intensity) and acceleration-based (absolute intensity) classifications of MVPA among individuals with greater adiposity. Using Fitbit data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we illustrate how HR-based PA intensity classification may indicate higher MVPA in youth with greater adiposity despite lower step counts and light PA levels. We highlight implications for research design, public health surveillance, messaging, policy, and interventions. We also call for greater transparency, standardized methodologies, and integrative measurement approaches to ensure more accurate assessment of PA behavior.",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of curve group such as similarity curve using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using an exponential distribution. We obtained an equation relating the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time he or she is depressed, and described the importance of considering the time when a person becomes depressed. Next, we derived an equation giving the time of being depressed and showed that the time of being depressed has an exponential distribution. We also described the connection to similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, we stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

Much less is known about how belief in one God, multiple gods, or spiritual forces (“Belief in God”) differs across cultures and demographic groups within those cultures. Using a diverse and international dataset of over 200,000 individuals from 22 countries, we examined the proportions of Belief in God across key demographics, focusing on country, age, gender, marital status, employment status, religious service attendance, education, and immigration status. Being mindful of interpretative challenges due to varying cultural contexts and the nature of the response items used, we offer insight into country-specific variations in Belief in God and lay a foundation for future investigations into sociocultural influences that might shape—or be shaped by—belief (or non-belief) in God, gods, and spiritual forces.",

          "abstract": "Food preferences differ among individuals, and these variations reflect underlying personalities or mental tendencies. However, capturing and predicting these individual differences remains challenging. Here, we propose a novel method to predict individual food preferences by using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training), which can capture both visual and semantic features of food images. By applying this method to food image rating data obtained from human subjects, we demonstrated our method's prediction capability, which achieved better scores compared to methods using pixel-based embeddings or label text-based embeddings. Our method can also be used to characterize individual traits as characteristic vectors in the embedding space. By analyzing these individual trait vectors, we captured the tendency of the trait vectors of high picky eater group. In contrast, the group with relatively high levels of general psychopathology did not show any bias in the distribution of trait vectors, but their preferences were significantly less well-represented by a single trait vector for each individual. Our results demonstrate that CLIP embeddings, which integrate both visual and semantic features, not only effectively predict food image preferences but also provide valuable representations of individual trait characteristics, suggesting potential applications for understanding and addressing food preference patterns in both research and clinical contexts.",

          "abstract": "It is common knowledge that psychological measures are hardly ever unidimensional. Some authors explain the multidimensionality by additional construct-irrelevant factors, such as social desirability, careless responding, or verbal abilities. However, we focus on spurious multidimensionality, caused by imperfections in the measurement model, and provide an unifying account of why it arises. We hypothesized that if the latent factor and at least two groups of items have the same non-linear relationship, it will require modeling an additional, apparent “method” factor to account for the non-linear relationship, even though the items are fundamentally unidimensional. An empirical study (N = 11,979 people, 51% women) supported our expectations. Items sharing a similar pattern of misfit disrupted unidimensionality and tended to form an additional factor, but this factor still contained construct-relevant variance. Our findings pinpoint under which conditions spurious factors arise and underscore how it is essential to check whether the relationship between a latent variable and its indicators is modeled correctly to avoid spurious multidimensionality, interpret spurious factors substantively, or needlessly remove items that seemingly disrupt unidimensionality.",

          "abstract": "To obtain comparability between scores on different forms of tests and exams, one can use test equating or linking methods. Most equating and linking methods require either common (anchor) items or equivalent groups of test takers to link the tests. However, in some circumstances neither of these two situations may occur. In these situations, expert judgment is required to assess the difficulty of the items of the two tests. One method to use expert judgment for linking tests is pairwise linking. This is done by asking experts to compare one item from Test 1 to one item from Test 2, do this for several different item pairs, and rate which of the items of the pair they think is most difficult on the attribute that the tests measure. In this chapter, we introduce an adjusted Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise linking that uses both information from the expert judgments and from the items of the separate tests. We tested the performance of the model in terms of bias and precision of the shift parameters that are used to link the tests. The adjusted BTL model for pairwise linking can be used to link tests without common items or equivalent groups. The model can be used for linking tests with dichotomous items and provides a starting point for model adaptations allowing for more general situations like test with polytomous scored items. We advise to use at least 800 pairwise item comparisons from experts about the relative difficulty of the item for a student with average ability as input to obtain a sufficiently precise link between the two tests.",

          "abstract": "Pavlovian threat acquisition and extinction are fundamental processes by which individuals\nlearn about threat and safety in their environment. Research has shown that humans learn\nmore rapidly and persistently to associate threatening and—somewhat counterintuitively—\npositive rewarding stimuli with aversive events, supporting predictions derived from\nappraisal theories of emotion (Stussi et al., 2018; Stussi, Pourtois, et al., 2021). Here, the\npresent study aimed to provide a confirmatory analysis of these findings and further\ncharacterize their algorithmic bases. Data from the four original experiments (N = 247) using\na differential Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm were combined and reanalyzed. In this\nparadigm, threat-relevant (angry faces, snakes), positive-relevant (baby faces, happy faces,\nerotic images), and neutral (neutral faces, colored squares) stimuli were used as conditioned\nstimuli, and skin conductance response was measured as an index of learning. Computational\nmodeling was applied to identify signatures of learning biases in Pavlovian threat acquisition\nand extinction. An expanded model comparison indicated that a reinforcement-learning\nmodel differentiating between excitatory (learning from reinforcement) and inhibitory\n(learning from the absence of reinforcement) learning best explained the observed data.\nAlthough no evidence for differences in excitatory learning rates was found between stimulus\ncategories, both threat- and positive-relevant stimuli exhibited a lower inhibitory learning rate\ncompared to neutral stimuli, contributing to the persistence of the conditioned response\nduring extinction. These results confirm the robustness of the original findings and further\nvalidate the appraisal-based approach, thereby informing the affective and computational\ndeterminants of Pavlovian threat extinction biases and their translational relevance.",

          "authors": "Youmi Suk; Weicong Lyu",
          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and illustrate how our approach can be applied to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam. We further demonstrate how it differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study and conclude with the broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

          "abstract": "Despite media portrayals to the contrary, immigrants to the United States tend to commit less crime than U.S.-born citizens. However, the factors underlying this at the individual level are not fully understood. To examine this, we conducted two complementary studies among individuals in the U.S.- México border region who were recently booked into jail. In the first study, we examined the current charges and pretrial risk assessments of 5,175 successive intakes to the jail. Compared to U.S.-born citizens, immigrants had less extensive criminal histories and were less likely to have current drug charges, though they had higher rates of current DWI/DUI charges. In the second study, we interviewed and conducted structured risk assessments with a sample of 273 individuals booked to the jail. We found that immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, had lower levels of seven of the Central Eight risk factors for crime, and that higher levels of acculturation towards U.S. culture were associated with higher levels of risk. We also found that undocumented immigrants were less likely than U.S.-born citizens or documented immigrants to be booked on serious charges such as violence or DWI/DUI, and most (58%) were booked on offenses related to illegal immigration (e.g., illegal entry). We conclude that policies limiting immigration (particularly from México) based on the idea that immigrants are prone to crime are misguided given our finding that jailed immigrants have low levels of criminal risk factors. We discuss our findings within the context of informing correctional policy, practice, and research.",

There are only few original research studies on this condition and no study that has meta-analytically synthesized findings to describe the characteristics of persons with emetophobia. To this end, we extracted data from 31 reports and—as we examined different dependent variables—each meta-analysis was based on five to 21 samples. The pooled mean age of persons with emetophobia was 29 years but was reduced to 21–27 years when adjusting for publication bias. The pooled mean age of disorder onset was 10 years. The pooled proportion of females was 91%. The pooled proportions of reporting fear of vomiting oneself, fear of seeing others vomit, or both, were 47%, 11%, and 39%. The most common comorbid mental disorders were social anxiety disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. The pooled point prevalence of emetophobia was 5%. Higher emetophobic symptomatology moderately related to higher disgust propensity and higher anxiety, and weakly related to higher depressive symptomatology. This meta-analysis is the first to quantify that most adults with emetophobia are in early adulthood but the disorder started in childhood, almost all are women, the primary locus of fear is vomiting oneself, the most common comorbid mental disorders are other anxiety and affective disorders, and higher emetophobic symptomatology relates to a more general tendency to be easily disgusted and to be anxious. Studies based on representative samples to obtain reliable estimates on the prevalence of emetophobia are needed.",

Despite such possibilities, little empirical research has examined these pathways. We propose a conceptual model, which we call the mental illness self-labeling model, that can be used to study the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling. We begin by reviewing existing literature on self-labeling, including sociological research on modified labeling theory, and how it can be leveraged to support the conceptual approach we propose. We then outline the proposed model, articulating how self-labeling can cause beliefs about mental illnesses to be internalized, and how subsequent changes in psychological mediators (such as perceived control, self-blame, and others) can have downstream effects on clinical outcomes. Our model provides a conceptual framework and methodological toolkit for researchers interested in investigating the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling.",

While excess weight has been associated with difficulties in cognitive and affective processes, their interplay has not been thoroughly explored.

The mean BMI was 32.80 (SD = 9.68). We estimated a regularized partial correlation network. Bootstrapping was used to assess network stability with the correlation stability (CS) coefficient. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by comparing the full sample network to participants with overweight/obesity only.\nThe three highest Expected Influence (EI) values were Lack of ER Strategies (EI = 1.19), Eating Concerns (EI = 1.15) and Overvaluation of Weight and Shape (EI = 1.11). The most central bridge node was Depression (BEI = 0.37). Binge Eating was connected to Lack of ER strategies in both networks. Cognitive Rigidity was connected to Overvaluation of Weight and Shape in network 1. BMI was significantly more central in the full sample, compared to the sensitivity network (p &lt; .01).\nOur results point to the importance of incorporating alternative ER strategies in treatment, in addition to weight, shape, and eating concerns. Depressive symptoms bridged ER difficulties, BMI and eating pathology, highlighting the relevance of evaluating and treating depression in routine clinical care.",

Young adults experience important transitions, such as starting university education, and establish new relationships. However, few empirical tests of the direct influence of university student peer groups on individual change in personality traits exist. Here, we conceptually replicated an earlier study and randomly allocated students (N = 351) to study groups of 3 to 6 peers that met over the course of the first semester. This randomization approach allowed the estimation of peer group socialization effects unconfounded by selection effects. We conducted a series of robustness checks to determine whether regression to the mean constitutes an alternative explanation for the results. The preregistered, confirmatory models seemed to support the hypothesis of peer group influence for all Big Five traits, showing patterns of assimilation where an individual’s personality became more similar to the personality of the remaining group members over time. Robustness checks, however, demonstrated convincingly that these patterns were due to the statistical artifact of regression to the mean and should not be interpreted as substantive evidence for peer group influence. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications for studying personality development though social relationships.",

Notably, the subject maintained high-order narrative reasoning, metacognitive flexibility, and symbolic visualization—even during a real-time environmental stressor (a 4.9-magnitude earthquake). These findings suggest the presence of a selfless narrative processor capable of functioning independently from conventional emotional frameworks, raising implications for clinical diagnostics, AI-cognition interaction, and post-structural models of selfhood.

          "abstract": "To understand how the brain responds to robots with varying levels of human-likeness, we investigated the electrophysiological neural correlates of the uncanny valley effect while human observers viewed pictures of various robot faces. We examined three event-related potentials (N400, N170, and Late Positive Potential, or LPP) and two oscillatory components (frontal alpha asymmetry and frontal-midline theta) and found characteristic non-linear trajectories of the N400 amplitude when plotted against the self-rated human-likeness of the robot faces, similar to the trajectory found for the self-rated likability score. The frontal alpha asymmetry also showed a similar trajectory but not was statistically significant, while the N170, LPP, and frontal-midline theta showed parabolic trajectories against the human-likeness scores. The N170 appeared to show larger amplitudes for more mechanical robot faces with little change across more human-like faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta produced the highest amplitudes for the middle ranges of the human-likeness scores, with lower amplitudes for more mechanical and near-human-like faces. These results corroborated the proposal that the uncanny valley effect stems from expectation violation for human faces, but they surprisingly provided little evidence for affective reactions to uncanny robot faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta could reflect increased cognitive control for ambiguous faces rather than their uncanniness, whereas the N170 appeared to reflect visual processing of facial configurations irrespective of their emotional contents. These findings suggest that the uncanny valley effect is primarily a cognitive phenomenon, and its emotional impact might be less prominent than commonly believed.",

The benefits of a candidate control signal are weighed against its costs (e.g., opportunity costs). Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants' proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

Odwołując się do matematycznej topologii – w szczególności do pojęcia wymiarowości i rzutowania – proponuje nową interpretację konstruktów psychologicznych, wykraczającą poza klasyczne reprezentacje dwuwymiarowe. Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową. W oparciu o analizy koncepcyjne, metodologiczne i psychometryczne autor(ka) pokazuje, że przejście do modelowania trójwymiarowego pozwala na pełniejsze odwzorowanie badanych konstruktów psychologicznych. Przykład modelu błędów wychowawczych Antoniny Guryckiej służy jako ilustracja sytuacji, w której pojawienie się dodatkowego wymiaru wynika z niespójności interpretacyjnych w centrum modelu kołowego. Artykuł omawia ograniczenia klasycznych metod statystycznych, takich jak analiza czynnikowa, i proponuje alternatywne podejścia analityczne – w tym maszyny wektorów nośnych z jądrem RBF (z obszaru sztucznej inteligencji) oraz topologiczną analizę danych (TDA). Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej.

Based on 25 items from the International Personality Item Pool collected through a web-based initiative, we examined subscales of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness, along with sociodemographic variables such as education, age, and gender. The findings reveal significant correlations among traits and highlight the complex relationships between personality traits and educational factors. These results suggest important implications for understanding how personality influences mental well-being and for developing advanced psychometric tools and personalized interventions aimed at improving mental health outcomes.",

          "authors": "Mingya Huang",
          "abstract": "In large-scale educational assessment, students’ academic outcomes can evolve over time, due to various effect modifiers. For instance, parents’  education level, a common modifier, has been found to have time-varying effects on children’s test scores, leading to heterogeneous academic trajectories. To model these varying trajectories, parametric models like hierarchical linear models (HLMs) are commonly deployed. While these highly parametric methods are interpretable, their predictive capacities have not been rigorously compared to those of more flexible nonparametric approaches. We present the results of systematic simulation studies and empirical analyses comparing traditional parametric models to Bayesian nonparametric models based on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). Our findings indicate that BART-based alternatives can (1) achieve comparable out-of-sample prediction as HLMs, after accounting for individual variability over time; (2) provide a reasonable amount of interpretability and uncertainty quantification; and (3) do not incur much more computational burden. This work contributes to the existing social science literature by demonstrating that Bayesian treed regression methods are viable and feasible alternatives to conventional HLMs for predicting heterogeneous trajectories across time.",

          "abstract": "This retrospective case study features a woman in her mid-50s who spent her childhood in a religious community plagued by sexual abuse of children. She was abused by her father for more than a decade. The church and her mother ignored her reports about it. In her early twenties, she enrolled herself in the Erhard Seminars Training program that destabilized her, inducing a first-onset psychosis, decades later used as the main rationale for diagnosing her with bipolar disorder. For the following decades, she suffered from severe depression and emotional isolation but was functional professionally and became a medical doctor. 35 years of talk therapy helped somewhat but did not resolve trauma ingrained in her body nor her at-times catatonic depression.\n\nIn her early 50s, she experimented with psilocybin, which resulted in somatic improvement but did not resolve her depression. She wanted to attend underground ayahuasca ceremonies but was rejected because of her bipolar diagnosis. Eventually, she decided not to disclose her diagnosis and attended four ceremonies in two different ceremony groups, with excellent outcomes. She considered that the core of her embodied trauma had dissolved.\n\nThe rationale for assigning diagnoses is questioned; a focus on etiology combined with the broad-spectrum nature of psychedelic therapy may mostly eliminate the need to discern between 'psychiatric conditions'. Trauma is considered socially contagious, similar to infectious diseases. The prohibition of psychedelic therapies is interpreted as a society-wide refusal to recognize trauma: a refusal to see what actually happened and happens.",

This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of SWAN, a game-based digital intervention targeting foundational number language skills: counting and transcoding.\n\nAims: (1) To explore rates of recruitment, retention and adherence to SWAN; (2) To assess whether SWAN improves numeracy skills.\n\nMethods &amp; Procedures: Eighteen individuals with aphasia were given SWAN to play at home for 15 minutes per day over three weeks. Outcome measures included assessments of transcoding, counting, calculation and functional numeracy. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated intervention effects, with the Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) calculated to identify individuals who responded to the intervention.\n\nOutcomes &amp; Results: SWAN was feasible to deliver remotely, with high adherence. Significant group-level improvements were observed for transcoding, counting and calculation, although counting was the only outcome where no improvement was observed at baseline. Twelve participants demonstrated meaningful gains in at least one outcome measure, exceeding their individual SDC. Functional numeracy did not improve, though participants reported increased confidence in skills.\n\nConclusions &amp; Implications: The findings suggest that SWAN is effective in motivating users and providing intensive practice for number sequences. However, further research is required which explores individual response to intervention in order to determine those most likely to benefit.",

However, notable inconsistencies remain across AO+MI study designs. Our aim was to systematically search all major academic databases to evaluate AO+MI practice effects on motor learning in healthy adults (search completed March 2024). Eligible peer-reviewed studies included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials comparing AO+MI against AO, MI, or controls, written in English. AO+MI was delivered synchronously or asynchronously, with a physical post, retention, or transfer test. Studies involving physical practice during mental practice were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and findings were narratively synthesised. Seventeen studies comprised 34 AO+MI groups across 10 tasks. Positive effects for AO+MI (n=422) were observed, compared to AO (n=99), MI (n=98), and controls (n=227), across tasks, modalities and training durations, and when mentally practised and physically executed actions differed. Limitations included inconsistent terminology, ill-defined interventions, and lack of retention and transfer tests. While AO+MI represents a widely applicable practice augmentation for motor skill development, we recommend designing the right intervention for the right individual. Future research must curb the proliferation of terminology and refine intervention designs to support scientific progress.",

          "abstract": "Teaching efficacy plays a crucial role in both teacher and student outcomes. Despite its importance, there are issues with the measurement and statistical representation of teaching efficacy. This study evaluated several measurement models of teaching efficacy, identifying the bifactor exploratory structural equation model (B-ESEM) as the best-fitting solution. We assessed its measurement invariance across five countries (Brazil, Mainland China, Singapore, USA, and Slovenia) and examined its criterion validity with respect to job satisfaction with the environment and the profession. The B- ESEM demonstrated strong measurement invariance, confirming that teaching efficacy, as measured by both general (G) and specific (S) factors, is interpreted similarly across different cultural and linguistic contexts. This contrasts with prior studies which used traditional confirmatory factor analysis that found only weak or partial invariance, highlighting the advantages of using B-ESEM to eliminate country- level biases. Criterion validity results indicated that general (G) teaching efficacy was systematically positively linked with job satisfaction and there was one single S-factor that was linked with job satisfaction: efficacy for student engagement was positively associated with satisfaction with the work environment, but not with satisfaction with the profession. These findings offer implications for theoretical refinement and applied research. Future research should explore longitudinal designs and continue employing advanced statistical methods to reflect the multidimensional nature of teaching efficacy.",

          "authors": "Daniel P. Moriarity; Emily R. Perkins; Keanan Joyner",
          "abstract": "As psychiatry increasingly embraces precision medicine principles, there has been increasing efforts to characterize the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations (e.g., is biology associated with syndromes or symptoms?). Unfortunately, the vast majority of research selects to test syndromes (e.g., case-control, symptom total/average scores) or individual symptoms a priori based on untested assumptions. Alternatively, most studies that attempt to empirically compare these options test biology as a predictor of a) syndromes and b) symptoms in separate models that are unable to directly falsify the specificity of observed associations because these options are not directly competing for the same variance. In this review, we will (i) discuss the historical tension between symptom- and syndrome-focused psychiatry; (ii) introduce hierarchical phenotyping as an approach to determining the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations; (iii) highlight how hierarchical phenotyping approaches are complementary to leading nosological movements in psychopathology research; (iv) illustrate how a hierarchical phenotyping lens can generate promising future directions for precision psychiatry using immunopsychiatric, genetic, and neurophysiological examples (1); (v) highlight clinical implications of hierarchical phenotyping approaches to psychiatry; (vi) discuss methodological implications of hierarchical phenotyping for best practices in measuring and modeling psychopathology; and (vii) introduce methodological resources for readers interested in investigating hierarchical phenotyping in their own work. In doing so, this review seeks to build the case for hierarchical phenotyping approaches while simultaneously preparing motivated readers to use these methods in their own work to advance precision psychopathology research.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has been extensively studied in cognitive psychology, with numerous tasks developed to measure its capacity. Among these, binding and updating tasks that assess the ability to build, maintain, and manipulate temporary relational representations have been shown to be particularly suitable for assessing WM capacity (WMC). In the present study, we investigated the specific processes involved in updating during WM encoding by comparing the electrophysiological signals in binding and updating tasks. In addition, we compared specific forms of updating demands by contrasting substitution and transformation processes. Finally, we examined whether individual differences in updating activity are related to WM performance. \nWe recruited a heterogeneous sample of 151 participants (female = 89, Mage = 34.77, SD = 12.78) who completed a binding and two updating tasks while an EEG was recorded. Mass univariate cluster-based permutation analyses of event-related potentials consistently showed a temporally and spatially widespread cluster when comparing updating and binding. This cluster was characterized by an increased positivity associated with updating, appearing predominantly in the frontal regions during early time windows (approximately 130–350 ms after stimulus onset) and later shifting to the parietal regions (from approximately 350 ms onward). Additionally, when comparing transformation and substitution, we found an increase in positivity, peaking within a typical P3 time window (approximately 400 ms). Finally, we found that only individual differences in transformation-related activity were associated with individual differences in WMC. \n\nWe recruited a heterogeneous sample of 151 participants (female = 89, Mage = 34.77, SD = 12.78) who completed a binding and two updating tasks while an EEG was recorded. Mass univariate cluster-based permutation analyses of event-related potentials revealed a temporally and spatially widespread cluster when comparing binding and updating demands. Within this cluster, there was an increase in positivity associated with the processing of updating demands, which was mainly concentrated in frontal regions in the early time window and later shifted towards parietal regions. When comparing transformation and substitution, we also found an increase in positivity, especially within the traditional P3 time window. Our results point to notable differences in the neurophysiological processes underlying the different WM tasks, while indicating greater similarities for the different updating demands. Further exploration of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying WM processing could improve our understanding of the essential functions that underlie WM performance.",

          "abstract": "Backgrounds: The overlapping symptoms between bipolar disorder (BD) in the depressive period and major depressive disorder (MDD) pose a substantial challenge in diagnosis and treatment. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that mood dysregulation may be linked to impairments in the dopamine reward system in the brain, but the underlying neurocomputational differences between BD and MDD remain elusive. In this study, we investigate whether atypical reward processing affects subjective mood in adolescents with BD and MDD. Our findings aim to elucidate the behavioral and neural differences between the two groups, facilitating more accurate and timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\nMethods: Forty-five adolescents (aged ≤ 19 years) diagnosed with BD (N = 25) or MDD (N = 20) were asked to complete a risky gambling task while their brain responses were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Several computational models were constructed to uncover the associations between various reward components (e.g., reward prediction errors, RPE) and trial-wise fluctuation in subjective mood during the gambling task.\n\nResults: We found that adolescents with BD exhibited a greater behavioral propensity for uncertain options, as compared to those with MDD. Computational modeling and mediation analysis suggest a triple relationship between RPE-mood association, decision rationality, and symptom severity. Using fMRI, we further observed distinct brain response patterns in a distributed mood regulation network between adolescents with BD and MDD.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of RPE in mood regulation and suggest more potential engagement of the model-free control system in BD as compared to MDD. These results provide new insights into the diagnosis and rehabilitation of BD and MDD in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the varying effects of potential losses compared to gains on mental effort and problem-solving performance. Building on prospect theory and previous studies, we hypothesized that individuals would engage in longer effort when faced with potential losses compared to equivalent potential gains, and that this extended effort would enhance problem-solving performance, particularly in more challenging tasks. Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 established that participants persisted longer in tasks designed to avoid monetary losses than to achieve gains, confirming the hypothesis regarding prolonged effort. However, this increased persistence did not translate into better performance across various tasks, suggesting that losses encourage mental effort but do not inherently improve problem-solving efficacy. Study 2, which employed anagrams of varying difficulty, revealed that losses indeed correlated with longer persistence times but only improved performance in tasks deemed more difficult. These findings indicate that the effect of losses on performance is nuanced, highlighting the importance of task difficulty and the sensitivity of performance measures in understanding the interactions between loss aversion and cognitive processing. Overall, the results suggest that while losses prompt greater cognitive engagement, their influence on performance is contingent on task complexity, necessitating further exploration into the conditions under which losses enhance mental effort and problem-solving capabilities.",

We examined three event-related potentials (N400, N170, and Late Positive Potential, or LPP) and two oscillatory components (frontal alpha asymmetry and frontal-midline theta) and found characteristic non-linear trajectories of the N400 amplitude when plotted against the self-rated human-likeness of the robot faces, similar to the trajectory found for the self-rated likability score. The frontal alpha asymmetry also showed a similar trajectory but not was statistically significant, while the N170, LPP, and frontal-midline theta showed parabolic trajectories against the human-likeness scores. The N170 appeared to show larger amplitudes for more mechanical robot faces with little change across more human-like faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta produced the highest amplitudes for the middle ranges of the human-likeness scores, with lower amplitudes for more mechanical and near-human-like faces. These results corroborated the proposal that the uncanny valley effect stems from expectation violation for human faces, but they surprisingly provided little evidence for affective reactions to uncanny robot faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta could reflect increased cognitive control for ambiguous faces rather than their uncanniness, whereas the N170 appeared to reflect visual processing of facial configurations irrespective of their emotional contents.

They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may bias grade-to-grade score distributions. Simulation and real data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce very different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

Five waves of flanker performance and behavioral and emotional problems were drawn from a large longitudinal sample of elementary school children in the Netherlands (1424 children, ages 7 to 12 years). Latent growth curve modeling (LGM) identified a piecewise decrease in flanker response time: the steepest decline was found from 7 to 9 years old. Boys had lower levels of response time at age 7 than girls. Children showed a linear decrease in behavioral and emotional problems over time. Parallel LGMs revealed that lower levels of initial flanker response time were associated with a stronger decrease in anxiety problems and oppositional defiant problem behavior.

          "abstract": "Niniejszy artykuł stanowi wkład w toczącą się debatę na temat wyjaśnień topologicznych, rozwijając pojęcie topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym. Odwołując się do matematycznej topologii – w szczególności do pojęcia wymiarowości i rzutowania – proponuje nową interpretację konstruktów psychologicznych, wykraczającą poza klasyczne reprezentacje dwuwymiarowe. Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową. W oparciu o analizy koncepcyjne, metodologiczne i psychometryczne autor(ka) pokazuje, że przejście do modelowania trójwymiarowego pozwala na pełniejsze odwzorowanie badanych konstruktów psychologicznych. Przykład modelu błędów wychowawczych Antoniny Guryckiej służy jako ilustracja sytuacji, w której pojawienie się dodatkowego wymiaru wynika z niespójności interpretacyjnych w centrum modelu kołowego. Artykuł omawia ograniczenia klasycznych metod statystycznych, takich jak analiza czynnikowa, i proponuje alternatywne podejścia analityczne – w tym maszyny wektorów nośnych z jądrem RBF (z obszaru sztucznej inteligencji) oraz topologiczną analizę danych (TDA). Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej. W zakończeniu wskazano, w jaki sposób topologizacja może wpłynąć na przyszłość teorii psychologicznych, metod pomiaru i interpretacji terapeutycznej.",

In this study, we investigated the association between adolescent cognitive abilities, educational attainment, and adult mental health. Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data (N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment. These individuals may be an underutilized target group for mental-disorder prevention.",

Nearly four million adolescents in rural U.S. lack adequate mental health care, highlighting the need for scalable, accessible solutions integrated into existing systems. Digital self-guided single-session interventions (SSIs) offer a promising solution with proven clinical efficacy, scalability, and low cost. However, widespread adoption depends on developing effective dissemination support systems. This protocol aims to develop a dissemination toolkit to implement Project YES – an evidence-based SSI platform – into primary care settings and schools across rural Montana. Methods. Using implementation science approaches and the Accelerated Create-to-Sustain Framework, we outline a six-step process involving advisory boards of primary care providers, schools, and parents of Montana youth. Activities include refining implementation strategies, developing actionable toolkit components, prototype creation, usability testing, and initial implementation planning. Discussion. This study will provide a practical, user-centered approach to developing a dissemination toolkit, supporting the effective integration of Project YES into rural care systems.",

          "abstract": "Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is a severe deficit in recognising facial identity in the absence of known brain damage or other cognitive, socio-emotional, or low-level visual impairments. Although initially thought to be quite rare, DP has been estimated to affect between 1.0% and 2.5% of the population, with different estimates reflecting different tools and analytical approaches to categorising DP. Research over the last 25 years has identified several cognitive and neural mechanisms that appear to contribute to face recognition deficits in DP, and both structural and functional neural differences have been found between individuals with DP and neurotypical participants. Nevertheless, clear neurocognitive signatures of this condition remain elusive, likely due to a) the high degree of individual variability observed in the behavioural and cognitive profiles of individuals with DP and b) the focus on group-based analyses rather than on in-depth, individual-level investigations. We recommend that future studies emphasise the latter approach.",

          "abstract": "Formal theories translate verbal theories into a mathematical representation, such as a coupled differential equation or other dynamical systems, intending to strengthen the deductive power of (clinical) theories and to formulate testable and novel hypotheses. Work in clinical formal theories mainly relies on simulations, which is an intuitive method to evaluate overall model performance but may fall short in establishing a precise link between the mathematical properties of the model and the dynamic property of the model outcome. Moreover, when the model outcome contradicts clinical observations, it is unclear where the discrepancy comes from, and how to improve the model. In this current article, we introduce formal mathematical techniques for graphical model analysis, including phase plane analysis, which allows identifying a system’s stable and unstable equilibria, and bifurcation analysis, a framework to delineate parameter regimes corresponding to qualitatively different dynamical outcomes for a model. Using two formal dynamic models in psychology (one for panic disorder and one for suicidal ideation), we illustrate those methods through an easy-to-use R package, deBif, with a graphical user interface. With these examples, we show the importance of using graphical tools to investigate the hypothesized mechanisms of psychological systems.",

Il presente contributo esplora - in prospettiva interdisciplinare - le motivazioni psicologiche ed economiche che spingono individui privi di reale benessere economico ad assumere comportamenti di consumo simbolico e ostentativo. Attraverso l’analisi di teorie classiche (Veblen, Bourdieu) e contemporanee (economia comportamentale, psicologia del sé, teoria dei segnali) e integrando riflessioni sull’impatto dei media digitali e della musica di tendenza (reggaeton, rap, trap) l’articolo mette in luce come la ricerca di visibilità e riconoscimento sociale possa spingere verso condotte rischiose quali l’indebitamento, l’adesione a modelli di “successo facile” (es. trading online) e la mercificazione del corpo attraverso piattaforme sessuali. Le riflessioni conclusive propongono una lettura critica del fenomeno e la necessità di un’educazione alla sostanza, alla resilienza identitaria e alla consapevolezza economica.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal designs support temporally granular study of social, behavioral, and psychological processes making methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) increasingly common. However, the repetitive and intensive measurement strategies associated with these designs increase participant burden which limits the breadth and precision of EMA surveys. This is particularly problematic for complex clinical phenomena, such as suicide risk, which research has shown is multidimensional and fluctuates over narrow time intervals (e.g., hours). To overcome this limitation, we proposed the computerized adaptive test for suicide risk pathways (CAT-SRP) which is the first multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) designed for intensive longitudinal data. The CAT-SRP leverages multidimensional item response theory to support the simultaneous assessment of multiple empirically informed risk domains and facilitate personalized survey content. Study 1 calibrates the CAT-SRP item bank using a large community sample (N = 1759, 36.33% with a history of suicidal ideation [SI]). Study 2 evaluates the performance, feasibility, and acceptability of the CAT-SRP in an EMA study of participants with a past month SI history (N = 29 across 2,134 observations).  The calibration study suggested twelve risk domains and two SI domains (active and passive). Results from the EMA study suggested that the CAT-SRP 1) administered surveys with low to moderate item overlap, 2) incurred low participant burden, and 3) may improve near-term prediction of suicidal thoughts relative to traditional EMA measurement. Although additional work is needed, the CAT-SRP marks the first MCAT for EMA and represents a significant methodological advancement for ambulatory measurement.",

          "abstract": "The paper aims to present the results of adaptation of the Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale (Sverko &amp; Babarović, 2024). Methods. At the preparatory stage of adaptation the double translation procedure was carried out for the Ukrainian version of the scale to correspond as closely as possible to the original one. After that, the equivalence between the original scale and its translated version was assessed. The study sample (N=336) included: 1) high school students (14-17 y. o.) – 68.15%; 2) first year university students (17-20 y. o.) – 31.85%. The gender distribution of respondents was following: 1) female – 65.18%; 2) male – 30.36%; 3) unidentified – 4.46%. Results. The results of the study confirm theoretical structure of the Scale, which is consistent with previous conceptual ideas about the measurement construct. Exploratory factor analysis allowed us to identify a clear factor structure that supports the hypotheses about the multidimensionality of the concept and indicates the sociocultural stability of the model. Conformational factor analysis showed high indicators of model compliance, which proves the adequacy of the chosen structure, however, some accuracy indicators demonstrate potential for further improvement of the model. The reliability of the scales is at an acceptable and high level, which confirms their consistency, homogeneity and ability to stably reflect the measured construct. Convergent and discriminant validity of the Scale are also confirmed, which demonstrates the ability of the Scales to correlate with the corresponding items and at the same time distinguish between different constructs. The high discriminantity of the scales indicates the effectiveness of the tool in distinguishing different aspects of career motivation, which is important for further use of the questionnaire in empirical research and for achieving practical goals by psychologists, career counsellors, etc. Conclusions. The Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale shows a number of high psychometric indicators, which allow to positively assess the factor structure (model), reliability, construct, convergent and discriminant validity and discriminantity of its subscales. Obtained results indicate the effectiveness of using this Scale to measure autonomous career motivation, while indicating directions for further optimization of the model.",

Moderated network analysis was used to estimate the expression and co-occurrence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and social functioning, while controlling for age and gender, and moderating for ethnicity (11 categories). There was substantial variation in symptom networks between ethnic groups. White British individuals showed the most differences compared to other ethnic groups, particularly in anxiety-related symptoms and functional impairment. Fewer differences were observed in symptom co-occurrence across ethnicities (the relationship between symptoms) compared to individual symptom variations (the effect of ethnicity on individual symptoms). The influence of ethnicity on mental health symptoms highlights the need for culturally appropriate assessment and care.",

          "abstract": "Reliability Generalization (RG) studies frequently interpret meta-analytic heterogeneity in score reliability as evidence of differences in an instrument’s measurement quality across administrations. However, such interpretations ignore the fact that, under Classical Test Theory (CTT), score reliability depends on two parameters: true score variance and error score variance. True score variance refers to the actual variation in the trait we aim to measure, while error score variance refers to non-systematic variation arising in the observed, manifest variable. If the error score variance remains constant, variations in true score variance can result in heterogeneity in reliability coefficients. While this argument is not new, we argue that current approaches to addressing this issue in the RG-literature are insufficient. Instead, we propose enriching an RG study with Boot-Err: Explicitly modelling the error score variance using bootstrapping and meta-analytic techniques. Through a comprehensive simulation scheme, we demonstrate that score reliability can vary while the measuring quality remains unaffected. The simulation also illustrates how explicitly modelling error score variances may improve inferences concerning random measurement error and under which conditions such enhancements occur. Furthermore, using openly available direct replication data, we show how explicitly modelling error score variance allows for an assessment to what extent measurement quality can be described as identical across administration sites.",

Exam access arrangements (AA) are provided as reasonable adjustments to reduce disadvantage for students with SpLD. However, the application process for AA has become increasingly burdensome, requiring extensive documentation and formal assessment. The number of applications for AA continues to rise, adding pressure to schools and examination bodies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape around AA provision. The present study captured current practices and provisions around identifying the need for AA for students with SpLD, the nature of support offered, and barriers to effective provision. Semi-structured interviews with 35 practitioners (21 Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs); 14 Specialist Assessors) working in secondary schools in England identified three themes: ‘the importance of equity in identification’, ‘resources impact identification and support’, and ‘lack of consistency and a systematic approach’. Findings highlighted the complexities of identifying and assessing students for AAs, the need for better communication with stakeholders, and the need to provide clearer guidance covering identification, implementation, and training for students on AA use. Findings also uncovered continued inequities, with eligibility for AA as well as access to best practice in arranging accommodations partially influenced by socio-economic status. Structured guidance in effective identification, assessment, and implementation processes with student training programmes, with specifically dedicated resources, could help address disparities and ensure more equitable support.",

In addition to describing and appraising the insights from each of these areas, we highlight methodological considerations for the field and outline promising future directions to establish the clinical relevance of (neuro)computational changes in AN.",

          "abstract": "Background: Approximately 5% of children are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder of their sensorimotor skills. DSM-V and ICD-10, the two most widely used diagnostic systems, define this diagnostically as ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ (DCD) or ‘Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function’ (SDDMF), respectively. A diagnosis of DCD/SDDMF has been found to have a detrimental impact on a range of outcomes (e.g., health and education). It is therefore crucial that these children receive timely intervention. This is reliant, however, on effective assessment and support pathways. Research has shown there is great parental dissatisfaction, but there has been limited research exploring a clinical and education perspective. This study therefore aimed to understand barriers and facilitators for clinical and education practitioners in the pathway in a diverse district in the UK (Bradford). Methods: Semi-structured interviews were completed with stakeholders across the pathway to identify barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with sensorimotor skill difficulties. Theoretical thematic analysis aligned to the COM-B model were used to analyse the qualitative data. Results: Interviews revealed many barriers in the DCD pathway related to capability (confusing terminology, inconsistent knowledge, inappropriate referrals), opportunity (resource constraints, DCD/SDDMF being considered low priority, and disconnected services), and motivation (overlapping job roles, a desire to consider those with difficulties not eligible for a diagnosis). Conclusion: Families face multiple barriers to obtaining a diagnosis for their child through existing clinical pathways for assessment and support. These findings are unlikely to be unique to Bradford and appear to reflect national and international health service challenges. There is an urgent need for: (i) clear communication across different services (with consistency in terminology), and (ii) a more collaborative and integrated approach to assessment, diagnosis, and support in order to help these children thrive.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also termed dissociative convulsions, are paroxysmal events resembling epileptic seizures but without ictal EEG correlates, reflecting complex biopsychosocial etiology. Despite high prevalence and significant functional impairment, limited research has comprehensively examined biological, psychological, and social determinants of PNES in Indian clinical populations.\n\nAim: To examine biopsychosocial factors in patients with dissociative convulsions and evaluate interrelationships among these domains.\n\nMethods: Seventy‑two patients (mean age 26.15±8.87 years; 91.7% female) diagnosed with dissociative convulsions per ICD‑10 criteria at a tertiary psychiatric center in North India were recruited. Participants completed validated self‑report instruments assessing dissociative experiences (DES‑II), cognitive distortions (CD‑Quest), alexithymia (TAS‑20), trauma symptoms (ITQ‑18), emotion dysregulation (DERS‑18), and sleep disturbances (ISDI). Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained via semi‑structured interview. Spearman correlations explored associations among biopsychosocial variables. Principal component analysis and k‑means clustering identified distinct patient subgroups, with discriminant analysis validating cluster membership.\n\nResults: Psychological measures were strongly intercorrelated (rs 0.58–0.94; p&lt;0.01). Sleep disturbances correlated positively with dissociation and emotion dysregulation (rs 0.71–0.88; p&lt;0.01). Lower education, joint family status, and lower socioeconomic status were significantly associated with greater sleep pathology and higher dissociation (p&lt;0.01). Cluster analysis yielded two distinct groups: a high‑trauma cluster (n=23, 32.8%) characterized by greater trauma history, elevated DES‑II, ITQ‑18, DERS‑18, TAS‑20, CD‑Quest scores, and more severe sleep disturbances; and a low‑trauma cluster (n=49, 67.2%) with comparatively lower scores across biopsychosocial domains. Discriminant analysis achieved 99% classification accuracy (Wilks’ λ=1.00).\n\nConclusions: Dissociative convulsions in this sample are associated with pervasive emotion dysregulation, alexithymia, cognitive distortions, trauma exposure, and sleep disturbances, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. Identification of high‑ and low‑trauma phenotypes underscores the importance of tailored, multidisciplinary interventions targeting trauma processing, emotional regulation, and sleep hygiene to optimize outcomes in PNES.\n© 2025 Akhand Pratap Singh.

          "abstract": "Human brain, as the carrier of memory and consciousness, has become a hot topic in neuroscience research recently, the study of memory may be the hottest one. However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

          "abstract": "Motivation is critical to successful academic functioning. A growing body of evidence details how motivation evolves throughout the lifetime, yet middle adulthood is rarely examined. Here we examined how trait apathy and fatigue, both of which manifest in diminished motivation, relate to academic functioning among university students aged 30 – 50. 332 students completed trait apathy and fatigue scales, measures of academic functioning (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, study engagement, study effort, academic stress, dropout intentions, academic performance, and study satisfaction), and measures of family, household, work-related factors. Apathy and fatigue were related to almost all academic measures, yet apathy was more closely linked to academic functioning; in particular autonomous motivation, study engagement, and study satisfaction. Our findings suggest that apathy is an important and likely overlooked factor in understanding academic functioning, at least among university students aged 30 – 50.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents Quantum Consciousness Field Theory 4.0 (QCFT 4.0), an integrated theoretical framework that models consciousness as a field defined on a non-orientable toroidal Möbius manifold. Building upon previous iterations, QCFT 4.0 introduces a topological approach that addresses key challenges in consciousness science: the binding problem, phenomenal unity, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes. By incorporating empirical findings from quantum interference experiments and neurophysiological data, we demonstrate how consciousness may emerge through field interactions constrained by a specific topological structure. The model's predictions include half-integer harmonic signatures, coherence tunneling effects, and π-phase offset phenomena that match observed experimental data. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous yet ontologically nuanced framework that bridges quantum field theory, neuroscience, and phenomenology while suggesting new experimental directions for consciousness research.",

          "authors": "Edwin S. Dalmaijer; Yifan Huang; Ivo Dalmaijer-Denning; Joris Dalmaijer-Denning; Thomas Armstrong",
          "abstract": "Disgust helps humans avoid potentially pathogenic substances such as bodily effluvia. This reduces illness risks, and is difficult to overcome with cognitive strategies or even through simple habituation in the short term (minutes to hours). Whether habituation emerges in the long-term (months to years) is an unsolved question. Regular professional exposure to disgust elicitors is associated with lower disgust sensitivity and avoidance, but this could be due to selection and survivorship bias. Here, we avoid these limitations by testing a sample of parents (N=99) and controls (N=50) on self-report and behavioural avoidance measures. We used parent-specific items in disgust-sensitivity questionnaires, and child-related stimuli (soiled diapers) in a preferential-looking task. While the control group showed the expected behavioural avoidance, parents of children who were past the weaning stage showed almost no avoidance of stimuli depicting child-related or general bodily effluvia. Curiously, parents whose children had not been fully weaned showed similar disgust avoidance to the control group, even if they had older children who were weaned. These results suggest that parents habituate to disgust induced by faeces in diapers, and that this had generalised to other bodily effluvia. Contrary to our expectations, parents did show disgust avoidance while their (youngest) children were fed only milk, which could point to an adaptive response to reduce the risk of illness in young infants. In sum, continuous exposure to their children’s bodily effluvia inoculates parents to disgust for bodily effluvia, but only after the sensitive milk-feeding stage.",

          "abstract": "obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in elderly populations represents a critical yet understudied frontier in mental health, characterized by diagnostic ambiguities, treatment resistance, and dynamic symptom evolution. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, neurobiology, and clinical management of late-life OCD, while proposing a novel polymorphic systems framework to reconceptualize its evolving nature. Drawing parallels to adaptive computational algorithms, we posit that OCD symptoms \"mutate\" contextually (e.g., contamination fears → symmetry obsessions) while retaining core anxiety-neutralizing functions, necessitating precision medicine approaches that map real-time symptom trajectories. Key findings include: (1) Genetic (SLC1A1 polymorphisms) and epigenetic (NR3C1 hypermethylation) factors driving late-onset OCD; (2) Neuroimaging biomarkers (orbitofrontal cortex hyperactivity, white matter hyperintensities) predictive of SSRI resistance; (3) Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) correlating with symptom severity; and (4) Pandemic-induced exacerbations (68% increased compulsive handwashing). We critique traditional diagnostic frameworks and advance Bayesian hierarchical models to address cohort heterogeneity, integrating socio-cultural, genetic, and neuroimaging data for personalized interventions. Emerging tools such as virtual reality exposure therapy, AI-driven compulsion tracking, and caregiver-mediated CBT demonstrate promises but require age-specific adaptations. The review underscores the urgency of transcending static diagnostic paradigms in favor of dynamic, computationally inspired models that mirror OCD’s fluid architecture. By aligning geriatric psychiatry with precision medicine innovations, this work charts a roadmap for scalable, cost-effective interventions tailored to the unique needs of aging populations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Eating disorders are serious psychiatric disorders associated with high levels of co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, high rates of relapse and poor treatment outcomes. The collection of standardised, routinely collected data within clinical services holds promise to improve patient care. Proposals for standardised variables for collection in eating disorders services have been made, but not implemented, and have included limited biological measures. Given emerging evidence about the importance of metabolism and other biological factors in eating disorders, there is a need for such measures to be integrated into routine data collection. \nObjective: To agree on a set of biopsychosocial variables for routine data collection within eating disorder services in the United Kingdom.\nMethods: Two online workshops were conducted using an adapted nominal group technique to agree priorities for data collection in adult (n= 20) and child/adolescent (n=23) eating disorder services (n = 43 participants, comprised of people with lived experience, carers, clinicians and researchers). Two researchers independently conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of the workshop transcripts to identify qualitative priorities for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the results of online voting. Measures and variables were chosen based on the priority-setting workshops, informed by prior work on psychometric properties of relevant measures. \nFindings: Thematic analysis identified four superordinate themes for data collection in eating disorder services: (1) a mutually valued and beneficial collaboration; (2) a holistic approach; (3) a balance between standardisation and individualisation; (4) doing no harm. Quantitative analysis of voting identified priorities across a range of domains\nConclusions: This project agreed a set of biopsychosocial variables which have been implemented for routine data collection as part of the Eating Disorders Clinical Research Network. Further research should investigate the implementation of these variables for data collection in eating disorder services and identify priorities for data collection in under-represented groups such as people with experience of binge eating disorder.\nClinical implications: Patients, caregivers, and clinicians support routine data collection in eating disorders services so long as the measures used are considered meaningful, not overly burdensome, non-stigmatising and collected as a collaboration between patients and treatment providers.",

          "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a distributed set of brain regions that is active during task-free, or “resting state,” periods. Various cognitive processes operate autonomously in the absence of external inputs or demands. Spontaneous thoughts—mental experiences that accompany ongoing cognition—are ubiquitous during wakeful rest. Spontaneous memory reactivations—neural events that replay recently learned information—also occur at rest and have a fundamental role in long-term memory consolidation. Here we review recent research on how the DMN may act as a neural workspace to jointly support spontaneous thought and memory consolidation. We identify gaps in the current understanding of the DMN’s function and propose avenues to study how spontaneous thought and memory systems may operate synergistically. Through our review of closely related yet traditionally siloed literatures, we aim to bridge the gap between research on spontaneous thought and memory consolidation to advance understanding of the DMN’s function.",

Since the simpler model can be viewed as a subset of the more complex model it is nested in, Popper has argued that the axioms of probability are violated when the simpler model is nonetheless assigned a higher prior probability. While Popper raised this objection in the context of assigning prior probabilities to models, we argue that Popper's objection does not just concern the priors, but Bayesian model comparisons more generally. We term this `the subset problem'. A variety of solutions have been proposed in the literature. We discuss some of these solutions and combine them into a new Bayesian account, in which both the probability assignments and the algebra over which they are assigned receive a specific interpretation. Finally, we discuss a new non-Bayesian solution, in which nested models are assigned an attractiveness measure that need not be additive.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. One hundred twenty-eight participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. Additionally, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

          "authors": "Lucy H Eddy; Cara E Staniforth; Megan L Wood; Liam Hill; Mark Mon-Williams",
          "abstract": "Background: Approximately 5% of children are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder of their sensorimotor skills. DSM-V and ICD-10, the two most widely used classifications systems, define this diagnostically as either ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ (DCD) or ‘Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function’ (SDDMF, respectively). Being diagnosed with DCD/SDDMF has been found to have a detrimental impact on long-term health and education outcomes. Research repeatedly highlights parental dissatisfaction with the pathways for assessment and support of DCD/SDDMF, however, there has been a lack of research quantitatively exploring the diagnostic landscape. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the incidence of DCD/SDDMF in a diverse District (Bradford, UK) from 1950 -December 2024. Methods: Clinical codes related to sensorimotor skill assessments and diagnoses were searched for within the Connected Bradford dataset, which houses routinely collected primary and secondary healthcare data for over 800,000 residents. Results: There are 182,978 children currently in the Connected Bradford primary care records, suggesting there should be ~9149 children with a diagnosis (given estimated prevalence rates of 5%). But over 74 years of records available, there were only 152 recorded childhood diagnoses of SDDMF (the ICD-10 used in the UK and Europe for diagnosis). When exploring related diagnoses and findings there were 1037 cases (~14 per year), however this amount over 74 years is still nine times lower than would be expected within current childhood populations in Bradford. Moreover, there were low levels of recorded assessments and a lack of clarity regarding how children are being assessed. Conclusion: Diagnosis is the current pathway to accessing support across UK services, yet the current study highlights that children with DCD/SDDMF are not being diagnosed within Bradford. This likely reflects national and international challenges. Further research is needed to investigate the barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with DCD/SDDMF.",

A testlet can be used to measure clinical reasoning skills because each scenario is evaluated with two or more items. Unfortunately, testlets are challenging and time consuming to create. The purpose of our study is to address the item writing challenge by describing and illustrating testlet-based automatic item generation. We use this method to create testlets for evaluating clinical reasoning skills across four different scenarios in thoracic surgery. We created a testlet-based item model. The item model contains global and local variables. Global variables can be used to place content in any item across the testlet and hence are unique to testlet-based automatic item generation. Local variables are specific to each item model and can only be used for one specific item in the testlet. We generated 47 unique 3-item testlets. A sample of three, 3-item testlets, one from each clinical scenario, was independently evaluated by four surgical content experts and judged to be of high quality.

We discuss the criteria for suitable taxometric indicators and outline characteristics that indexes of criminal evidence should meet. We derive quantitative indexes of four types of criminal evidence: eyewitness identifications, interrogations and confessions, forensic match evidence, and propensity evidence. We sketch how the proposed indexes could be validated within the taxometric program. Further, we illustrate how researchers can empirically probe critical assumptions underlying these indexes, quantify the sizes of departures from these idealizations, and leverage these estimates to modify and improve index calculations. The proposed indexes address an outstanding impediment to the realization of the taxometric program to study guilty-suspect base rates in the criminal justice system.",

(2022) recently found that participants had a strong preference for completing a virtual box-clearing task cooperatively with a partner rather than alone, despite it being more motorically and cognitively costly. Participants completed the task standing beside each other in close proximity, which may have created a social pressure to cooperate through a need to manage one’s reputation or a sense of commitment. Here, 50 human pairs—each composed of a “Decision-maker” and “Helper”—completed a box-clearing task modeled after Curioni et al. while seated farther away and out of view of one another. In 50% of trials, Decision-makers were forced to complete the task alone or with the Helper. In the remaining 50% of trials, Decision-makers chose to work alone or cooperatively. When working together, participants were required to synchronize their movements without communication or feedback of their partner’s movements. Decision-makers answered open-ended questions regarding why and when they chose to complete the task alone and together. We found a slight preference for individual action over costly joint action, yet this preference was not significantly different from chance. Inductive thematic analysis revealed two dominant themes: “chose actions with greater instrumental utility” and “chose actions with greater social value”. The identified themes suggest that preferences to cooperate are highly individualized, and that cooperative actions may provide additional social rewards that drive preferences for cooperation even when it is more costly.",

Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment.

          "abstract": "Many see effort as something to be avoided. In this study, we analyse the experience of effort in more detail by examining perceived exertion (RPE) and feelings at three intensity intervals, and how these are shaped by the state and trait value of physical effort (VoPE). 65 participants (52% female, 48% male, Mage = 22.8 years ± 3.0) were included in this study. During a bike ergometer task, participants’ state VoPE, RPE, feeling, and heart rate at light, moderate, and vigorous cycling intensities were measured. The intensities were individually tailored using a VO2 max measurement. Additionally, trait VoPE was assessed. Higher trait and state VoPE were positively related to feeling better during cycling, independent of intensity, whereas no relation to RPE was found. These findings suggest that VoPE may play a role in shaping exercise experience, which could be relevant for long-term adherence to exercise or physical activity.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Value-based decisions are driven by subjective estimates of value for each available option, but recent work has shown that subjective measures of certainty about those value estimates also influence choice behavior. Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decision-makers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain – and sometimes revised – value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty – which we classify as a demand effect – and increasing functions of familiarity – which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.",

A broader cognitive zone of bounded surprisal emerged during Late Miocene times in small social units of mosaic-landscape dwelling homininans than in woodland-dwelling paninans.    \n2.Small-world homininan networks of small, mixed-sex philopatrial, social units, with maternal and paternal close proximity to children, facilitated the augmentation of intra- and inter-unit information.\n3. Pliocene and Pleistocene spatiotemporal spread of homininans involved increases of transmissible information that expanded tool-making, resource-exploitation, and communicative fluency.\n4. Biological and natural processes are indicated which could have been advantageous or disadvantageous to the survival of various homininan taxa identified in the Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil record.       \nLong Abstract\nA phylogenetical split 8- 6 Ma (million years ago) separated paninan ancestors that were unlike today's chimpanzees, and homininan ancestors that were unlike Homo sapiens today; neither had evolved into their modern physical and behavioural forms. Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. \nContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibiity of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan zones of bounded surprisal with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan small-world social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. \nThe vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with \"Homo informatio's\" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle foreshadowed by the nineteenth-century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.",

The outcomes of such analyses may shape the images (i.e., theories) that we as scientists have of the phenomena that we study. However, key conceptual issues tend to be overlooked in these analyses, which is especially problematic when the items are person descriptions espressed in the natural language. A correlation between judgments on two such items may reflect the influences of (a) a common substantive cause, (b) substantive target characteristics on another, (c) semantic redundancy, (d) the perceivers’ attitudes toward the targets, (e) the perceivers’ formal response styles, or (f) any mixture of these. We present a conceptual framework integrating all of these mechanisms and use it to connect formerly unrelated strands of theorizing with one another. A lack of awareness regarding the complexity involved may compromise the validity of interpretations of psychometric analyses.

This capability suggests a powerful social scientific application – the simulation of empirically realistic, culturally situated human subjects. Synthesizing recent research in artificial intelligence and computational social science, we outline a methodological foundation for simulating human subjects and their social interactions. We then identify nine characteristics of current models that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress.",

          "abstract": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing and have enormous potential for social scientific analysis. We explore the application of LLMs to supervised text classification. As a case study, we consider stance detection and examine variation in predictive accuracy across different architectures, training regimes, and task specifications. We compare ten models ranging in size from tens of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters and four distinct training regimes: prompt-based zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, fine-tuning using more training data, and instruction-tuning that combines prompting and training data. The largest models generally offer the best predictive performance even with little or no training examples, but fine-tuning smaller models is a competitive solution due to their relatively high accuracy and low cost. For complex prediction tasks, instruction-tuned open-weights models can perform well, rivaling state-of-the-art commercial models. We provide recommendations for the use of LLMs for text classification in sociological research and discuss the limitations and challenges related to the use of these technologies.",

          "authors": "Liberty Chee",
          "abstract": "After nearly half a century, domestic workers were again tabled on the agenda of the International Labour Conference in 2008. Three short years later, Conference delegates voted to establish the International Labour Organization's Convention on Domestic Work (C189). This article builds on the insight that the campaign to push for C189 was taken up by a feminist “velvet triangle”. These networks are usually comprised of women in social movements, femocrats, and academics. The informality of these alliances is due, in part, to the gendered marginality of an issue area, allowing for improvisation and agile coalitions. The article traces the origins of this triangle to bottom-up calls to develop measurement methodologies to make women's labour “visible” in the UN Conferences on Women, and later in discussions about informality, and domestic work. It then examines the relations among femocrats in various international institutions, academics, and the global trade unions in the co-production of knowledge about women's activities that were not counted and did not count in the “economy”. The article demonstrates how the demand for the valorisation of cooking, cleaning and caring, expressed itself through calls for the production of statistics. It attends to the under-explored effects of the “power of cognitive resources” in the literature. Finally, the article shows that the explicitly political project of the women's movements yielded not only a normative labour instrument, but advances in different fields of study. This case shows that the production of scientific knowledge, while still an overwhelmingly elite endeavour, need not always cater to elite demands.",

          "authors": "Nora Fink",
          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long been a challenge in developmental, educational, and cognitive neuroscience, demanding advances in both theoretical understanding and practical diagnostic approaches. In recent years, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive neuroimaging tool for examining children’s cortical hemodynamics during language and literacy tasks. Meanwhile, new machine learning (ML) methodologies have shown promise in extracting clinically relevant patterns from large, heterogeneous neuro-behavioral datasets. However, most applications of ML in clinical child populations have focused on well-known modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). Few studies leverage fNIRS data combined with extensive behavioral and demographic information, especially in children from diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere, we present a systematic supervised ML approach to classify ADHD in children aged 5–11. We rely on an openly available fNIRS dataset from University of Michigan’s Deep Blue Data repository, titled: Morphological and phonological processing in English monolingual, Chinese-English bilingual, and Spanish-English bilingual children: An fNIRS neuroimaging dataset. This dataset comprises 343 children, including English monolinguals, Chinese-English bilinguals, and Spanish-English bilinguals (1). It incorporates broad neuroimaging and behavioral measures of morphological and phonological awareness, reading proficiency, and demographic questionnaires. Our ML pipeline employs a range of algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—tuned via cross-validation for optimal performance. We highlight a final best model, SVC, which achieved a 0.625 macro F1 score in 5-fold cross-validation and revealed near-perfect performance for the majority class on the final test set. We provide in-depth classification metrics, confusion matrices, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We also integrate interpretive discussions of bilingualism, ADHD, morphological/phonological awareness, and neural data.\nThis paper is structured in line with guidelines for high-impact research: we begin with an Introduction summarizing ADHD, bilingual language development, and the utility of fNIRS. We then describe our Methods, including participant selection, the dataset’s language/reading tasks, and the full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning. Our Results section documents classification performance and the derived metrics. In the Discussion, we contextualize the findings and outline implications for early screening and interventions, bridging machine learning with children’s neurocognitive profiles. Finally, we draw our Conclusions on future directions for integrated neuroimaging and ML-based classification, especially for clinical subgroups in bilingual child populations.",

We analyze close to 3.4 million online news articles in 2018-2021 from 138 countries, jointly accounting for 94 percent of the world’s population. The empirical evidence highlights the importance of the discursive characteristics of the national climate change debates for the reception of the novel concept, but also that the effect of states’ affluence and climate vulnerability on reception of carbon neutrality is strongly non-linear.

          "abstract": "‘Borderization’ refers to the process of installing fences and other infrastructures of control and surveillance by the Russian security services along the de facto boundary between Georgia and South Ossetia. Georgian political discourse generally focuses on a territorial dimension of borderization and views it primarily as a physical demarcation of an already existing geopolitical condition, understood as the Russian occupation of Georgia’s sovereign territory. Borderization has dramatically curtailed mobility between the two sides of the de facto border. Georgian political discourse describes this aspect of borderization as Russia’s purposeful strategy to estrange Ossetians from Georgians. However, the narrow ethnic frame sidelines various other forms of immobility experienced by local residents. An expanded concept of mobility can offer a more nuanced understanding of borderization and illustrate overlooked geopolitical and geographical complexities. Through interviews with residents of Nikozi, Ergneti, and Ditsi, the article identifies four distinct forms of immobility resulting from borderization that shape how people and goods move inside the villages, across the de facto boundary, between the border strip and Tbilisi, and between the strip and Russia. The mobility perspective offers a complementary lens to understand the effects of the existing geopolitical condition on the local community’s security and welfare.",

          "authors": "Vincent August; Veza Clute; Cosima Adams",
          "abstract": "Climate obstruction is a key research approach to help explain why governments do not achieve climate mitigation goals. The article investigates the still underexplored phenomenon of climate obstruction in Europe and outside the familiar realm of science denial and denialist organizations. We analyze a public debate on a key policy in Germany where an accelerated transition to renewables in the heating sector was successfully obstructed. To investigate obstruction, we performed a framing analysis on the articles of two leading newspapers with strong stances against climate policies (n=142). We find that obstruction framing did not emphasize climate references, shifting the issue from the climate towards personal and collective wealth, liberty, and security. It highlighted costs and damages, excessive regulation, and procedural mistakes, attributed these problems mostly to the Green proponents of the policy initiative, and interpreted the policy and their proponents as an imminent threat. We therefore argue that climate obstruction primarily worked through a scare strategy. We identify four major frames and discuss differences to extant frame typologies from denialist contexts. In addition, we identify two distinct strands of obstruction: a more radical approach stressing state coercion, and a more moderate approach highlighting incompetence and neoliberal policy alternatives. We argue that strategic differentiation allows to address and broker different audiences. With these findings, we provide vital insights into how climate obstruction works in Germany and in wider public debates when science denial is not (yet) a viable strategy.",

Among the “technology masters”, we distinguish three families: those who remain at the service of the State and the established order, those who have exploited, consciously or not, the withdrawal of the neoliberal State to offer services and innovations formerly assumed by the public sector, and finally those who have consciously taken advantage of this same withdrawal and the recognition they enjoy in society to propose other models (free software, open source, crypto anarchism, technical alternatives, etc.).",

Zero-alcohol drinks (&lt;0.5% alcohol by volume) resemble and often share brands with alcoholic drinks, so may function as surrogate alcohol marketing. We examined whether exposure to zero-alcohol advertising was associated with adolescents’ attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nMethods: N=382 Australians aged 15 to 17 years completed an online survey where they viewed zero-alcohol advertisements from four parent alcohol brands and reported past exposure and liking of each advertisement, attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol products from the parent brand, general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol, self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising, prior consumption of alcohol and zero-alcohol, and demographics. Associations between exposure and liking, attitudes, and consumption intentions were examined using linear mixed effect models and linear regression. \nResults: In unadjusted models, attitudes toward and intentions to consume alcohol from the parent brand were associated with advertisment exposure (attitudes: B=0.55, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.37, p&lt;0.001) and liking (attitudes: B=1.45, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.70, p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for prior zero-alcohol and alcohol consumption, gender, and parent presence during survey completion, associations with liking remained significant (attitudes: B=1.42, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.66, p&lt;0.001). No associations were found between self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising and general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Findings that adolescents who see and like zero-alcohol advertisements have more favourable attitudes toward and stronger intentions to consume parent alcohol brands suggest these advertisements serve as surrogate marketing and should be included within alcohol advertising regulations.",

          "abstract": "Research on emotional stimuli in politics often overlooks how citizens use emotion when engaging politicians. We begin to address this gap in the literature by examining the relationship between frames, emotion, and sentiment in individual claimsmaking. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify sentiment and frames in 153,288 emails sent to Governor Jeb Bush about the Terri Schiavo case. We find that the religious frame increases the likelihood that an email is positive, while the legal and medical frames lower that likelihood. Then, we qualitatively analyze 999 randomly chosen emails from the corpus to understand how individuals use emotions in their claimsmaking. We find that individuals use emotion to modify frames in ways that signal their understanding of a target’s authority relative to other actors. Individuals used positive emotions with the religious frame to signal their approval of Bush’s actions. In contrast, individuals used negative emotions with the legal frame to convey their disapproval of other actors, such as Terri’s husband, who were seen as misusing their authority and endangering Terri’s life. We conclude with a discussion of how scholars might better understand the role of emotion in individual claimsmaking.",

          "abstract": "How are mothers and fathers with differing lengths of parental leave perceived as workers and parents, and how do these perceptions vary by gender and cultural context? We answer these questions using original preregistered survey experiments conducted in Germany, South Korea, and the United States—three countries with differing gender norms related to work and parenting. Specifically, we examine perceptions of employees who took either “short,” “medium-length” or “long” parental leaves, based on each country’s parental leave laws. Across all three countries, mothers and fathers who took longer leaves are seen as better parents than those who took shorter or no leave. However, for fathers in Germany and South Korea, this positive effect plateaus or declines after medium-length leave. The impact of leave-taking on perceptions of employees as workers is smaller and more complex: Longer leaves lead to declines in perceived work commitment for both genders. For fathers, however, other outcomes remain largely unchanged by the length of leave. For mothers in Germany and South Korea, by contrast, we find medium and long parental leaves lead to more favorable perceptions in terms of work relationships and overall assessment as workers. These findings suggest competing norms around work and parenting influence how individuals are evaluated based on their leave-taking behaviors, creating stronger incentives for mothers than fathers to take longer leaves in countries with stronger gender conservatism.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have long argued that the familial, demographic and socio-cultural conditions in historical Europe left little room for patriarchal bias compared to Asia. However, these claims have not been rigorously tested through large-scale, data-driven, comparative analyses and statistical modelling. This paper fills this gap by applying Gruber and Szołtysek’s (2016) Patriarchy Index to IPUMS-International census microdata from 857 regional populations in historical Europe and 21 Asian/North African countries after 1970 (93 million people). Our descriptive, spatial and multilevel regression approaches challenge the ‘patriarchal East’ vs. ‘liberated West’ dualism. We find that some historical European areas were more patriarchal than the contemporary Asian data, and several regions in both Europe and Asia show less pronounced patriarchal tendencies than predicted by the models. Finally, we show that Asia and historical Europe are remarkably similar in the mechanisms influencing patriarchy. Overall, our work provides ample evidence that the historical patterns of patriarchy in Europe are not unique.",

          "abstract": "Social science surveys regularly ask respondents to generate opinions or positions on issues deemed to be of political and social importance, such as confidence in government officials or federal spending priorities. Many theories assume interpersonal deliberation is a primary mechanism through which people develop positions on such issues, but it is unclear how often the issues captured by such questions become a topic of conversation. Using an original survey of 2,117 American adults, we quantify how often people report discussing the issues tapped by 88 questions in the General Social Survey’s core questionnaire, as well as how often respondents say they individually reflect on these issues, how important they believe them to be, and how sensitive they believe it would be to discuss those issues. We find the majority of respondents report discussing the majority of issues fewer than once or twice a year, with the modal response that respondents have never discussed an issue in the past year. At the same time, some topics—including religious beliefs and generic appraisals of political leaders—come up quite frequently, and a small number of respondents report frequently discussing most items. We consider the implications of these findings for theories of belief formation.",

In it, user volunteers were randomly assigned to jury-like committees to vote and comment on whether reported content violated platform rules. \nThe perceived legitimacy of similar systems has been studied in tightly controlled lab and survey experiments, but the causal effects of such jury-like moderation systems on user behavior in the real world have not been studied to the same extent. \nLeveraging random variation in Weibo case votes due to the assignment of more or less lenient `jurors', we show that, on average, social sanctioning and norm-setting through committee votes was associated with a large but brief decline in reported users' future posting of offensive terms. \nHowever, in line with prior work on the relative ineffectiveness of out-group sanctioning, we observe no such effect among women sanctioned by the largely male committees.\nThis study advances our understanding of the effects of institutionalized social sanctioning on social media user behavior, and the promises and potential shortcomings of crowdsourced moderation systems.",

          "abstract": "China’s 2016 Overseas NGO (ONGO) Law is part of a larger global trend of increased legal restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). A growing body of research analyzes the broad effects of this crackdown on INGOs, finding a divergence in formal de jure laws and the de facto implementation of those laws. The causes and mechanisms of this divergence remain less explored. Why do authoritarian governments allow—and often collaborate—with some INGOs while harshly regulating or expelling others? What determines the openness of the practical legal operating environment for INGOs? In this paper, we use the case of China to explore how political demands to both restrict and embrace INGOs have shaped the international nonprofit sector in the five years since the ONGO Law came into effect. We argue that in an effort to bolster regime stability, governments use civil society laws as policy tools to influence INGO behavior. We find that INGO issue areas, missions, and pre-existing relationships with local government officials influence the degree of operating space available for INGOs. We test this argument with a mixed methods research design, combining Bayesian analysis of administrative data from all formally registered INGOs with a comparative case study of two environmental INGOs. Our findings offer insights into the practical effects of INGO restrictions and the dynamics of closing civic space worldwide.",

This paper examines the conflict between Neo-Liberal and humanist approaches, and how these lead to conflicting approaches to coercive practices in outdoor programs. The source of the current situation will be shown to be the colonising of humane experiential outdoor practice by some early adventure leadership literature and its enduring beliefs. These beliefs centre on the individual being responsible for their situation and overlook the causes of their behaviour. A more supportive counter-belief is that individuals are doing their best and require a socially supportive environment to regain their developmental trajectory toward functional adulthood. Experiential outdoor practitioners are encouraged to adopt human rights-based approaches and view the temporary group as a lived experience of an ideal society.",

          "abstract": "In present times, gender-based violence (GBV) is a global scourge. It is highly prevalent in South Africa, where the rates of incidents are exorbitant, particularly those of sexual violence against women. The goal of this paper is to explore the implications of factors such as societal norms affected by the country’s unique historical circumstances that promote rising rates of gender-based violence, significant underreporting of these instances, sexual violence and the consequences for the survivors. The paper uses secondary data to study the intersectionality of gender, population group (race), socio-economic status, and geographical location. We further analyze the sociodemographic of GBV (particularly rape) victims and perpetrators to put the focus on better and more gender-responsive prevention strategies. The paper highlights the importance of paying attention to intimate partner violence (IPV) as this constitutes a highly significant percentage of the total cases of rape and femicide. The study shows that non-white women constitute the most vulnerable group to GBV. We conclude that proper mechanisms must be put in place which require the cooperation of the police, judicial, medical, social and other support services to properly tackle this violence which must account for every population group, especially the historically marginalized ones.",

However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks---via edge simplification and node consolidation---resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.",

          "abstract": "Research on emotional stimuli in politics often overlooks how citizens use emotion when engaging politicians. We begin to address this gap in the literature by examining the relationship between frames, emotion, and sentiment in individual claimsmaking. Our analysis proceeds in two steps. First, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify sentiment and frames in 153,288 emails sent to Governor Jeb Bush about the Terri Schiavo case. We find that the religious frame increases the likelihood that an email is positive, while the legal and medical frames lower that likelihood. Then, we qualitatively analyze 999 randomly chosen emails from the corpus to understand how individuals use emotions in their claimsmaking. We find that individuals use emotion to modify frames in ways that signal their understanding of a target’s authority relative to other actors. Individuals used positive emotions with the religious frame to signal their approval of Bush’s actions.

The study also investigates how this relationship varies across different social origins. Catalonia is a pertinent context due to its significant increase in inequality and unemployment during the 2008 Economic Crisis, positioning it among the most affected regions in Europe. The findings reveal that satisfaction with one’s social life matters for global life satisfaction, even after accounting for individual and macro characteristics. However, contrary to the initial expectations, the study demonstrates that satisfaction with one’s social life becomes less influential for global life satisfaction during the macroeconomic crisis, particularly among individuals from middle and low social origins. Furthermore, while a strong positive relationship exists between satisfaction with one’s social life and global life satisfaction during times of economic prosperity for all social groups, a robust negative relationship emerges in periods of macroeconomic crisis for individuals from high social origins. The article offers several potential explanations for these findings.",

Using high-quality, nationally representative time dairy data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we describe average time in total, routine, and non-routine housework among dual-earner couples from 2019 to 2022. We found an overall increase in housework time in 2020. Two new findings emerged. First, from 2019 to 2020, there was an exacerbation in gender housework gap among couples living without children, such that women increased approximately half-an-hour more housework than men daily. The gender housework gap among parents however remained similar. Second, such trends were relatively short-term and reversed in 2021 and 2022. We provide short explanations and call for more studies to use national time diary data to intentionally incorporate family diversity into studying the gendered consequences of disruptive events in the longer term.",

Participants often simplified neurobiological processes, associating dopamine primarily with well-being, motivation, and mood improvement (positive effects), and reward system dysregulation, addiction risk, and health issues like stress and apathy (negative effects). Physical activity and healthy eating were seen as key factors in dopamine increase. Lay conceptions, while differing from expert discourse, may shape a “neurochemical self,” reflecting a neoliberal ideology of self-regulation and productivity. Participants viewed dopamine knowledge as a means to control daily habits for a balanced life. While positive effects were prominent, negative effects were also frequently mentioned, emphasizing productivity and risk management within a capitalist context. Dopamine was both an asset to maximize and a risk to mitigate. This aligns with the view of pleasure as limited and controlled within neoliberal values. The study highlights how media simplification may lead to exaggerated perceptions of dopamine’s role in well-being.",

          "abstract": "Background: The latest military assault on Gaza by Israel, which began after 7 October 2023, has led to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, with tens of thousands killed, nearly two million displaced, and famine officially declared in 2024. The near-total siege cut off food, water, electricity, and medical supplies, while relentless bombardments destroyed critical infrastructure, rendering Gaza unliveable. Many donor nations have simultaneously provided humanitarian aid to Gaza while supplying military assistance to Israel, underscoring the structural hypocrisy in international responses to the catastrophe in Gaza. Methods: In this article, we introduce and develop the concept of justice-oriented counter-stories (JOCS) to critically examine how quantitative datasets on humanitarian aid flows can distort reality and obscure key disparities. Using aid to Gaza in 2023–2024 as a case study, we apply JOCS to identify biases in official reporting and make statistical adjustments to offer an alternative perspective. Results: Our justice-oriented analytical lens shows how the countries humanitarian aid rankings shift significantly when we factor in donor nations’ GDP, and the structural hypocrisy of offering humanitarian aid while simultaneously providing significant military assistance to Israel. Our paper also identifies some of the key methodological challenges in making such adjustments. Conclusion: We conclude by emphasising the broader implications of “justice-oriented counter-stories” for understanding not only aid flows, but social justice and the representation of social and environmental issues.",

Psychosocial factors are known to play a role in the recovery from pain following surgery, but positive psychosocial factors have received little attention in the literature. This study aims to address this gap by investigating parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as predictors of post-surgical pain recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. \nThis study uses data collected as part of a larger longitudinal project that involved administering questionnaires to adolescents and their parents over multiple timepoints. Adolescent participants aged 12 – 18 years old with a diagnosis of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, and scheduled for spinal fusion surgery, were recruited across four Belgian hospitals along with their parents. Structural Equation Modelling was used to investigate how parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism predicted post-surgical positive outcomes, including mood, quality of life and functional disability in adolescents. \nThe study comprised 94 adolescent-parent dyads. Findings indicate that parental optimism before surgery predicted increased adolescent mood following surgery. Adolescent positive affect before surgery predicted increased mood and decreased pain intensity following surgery, while adolescent optimism predicted increased quality of life. None of the optimism or positive affect variables were significantly related to adolescent functional disability following surgery. \nStudy findings identify parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as potential predictors of post-surgical recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. However, the multifaceted and complex nature of these relationships warrants further investigation.",

BrainWaves provides a framework for relevant and diverse research programmes into adolescent mental health and wellbeing that can translate into practice and policy. The research programme is a partnership with schools centred on establishing a large (n&gt;50,000) cohort and trials platform. Reported here is the BrainWaves cohort pilot study. This was designed as proof-of-concept for our recruitment and data capture pipelines, and for cost-modelling. A network of research schools was recruited and a computer-driven questionnaire administered. The eligible population was 16+ year olds who were attending the research schools. Of 41 research schools, 36 (88%) participated over one three-week and one four-week data collection period. From an eligible population of 33,531 young people, 16,010 (48%) attended the study lesson and created an account. Of the 16,010 (100%) who created an account, 15,444 (96%) consented to participate, 9,321 (60%) consented to linkage of research data with educational records, and 6,069 (39%) consented to linkage of research with school/college attendance data. Participants were aged 16-19 years, 59% female, and 76% White. Higher levels of anxiety and depression were found in girls than boys. Higher levels of media-based social networking were found in girls, whereas higher levels of media-based gaming were found in boys. Girls were more likely to report insufficient sleep whilst boys were more likely to report high levels of exercise. This study confirmed an ability to recruit at pace and scale. Whilst the response-rate does not indicate a representative sample, the demographics describe an inclusive and diverse sample. Data collected confirmed findings from previous studies indicating that the electronic data collection methods did not materially bias the findings. Initial cost-modelling suggests these data were collected for around £20 per participant.",

          "abstract": "An innovative course introduced digital twinning concepts to liberal arts students, aimed at enhancing technological literacy, critical thinking, and ethical awareness in an increasingly digital world. The course designed using Quality Matters rubrics and delivered through a competency-based education (CBE) model in an online, asynchronous format to 24 students in Fall 2024 with 96% student course complete rate. The curriculum offered a comprehensive introduction to key digital twinning concepts, applications, and their societal impacts. The flexible, self-paced structure accommodated diverse student populations with varying responsibilities. Pre-course survey revealed limited familiarity with digital twinning among participants. However, post-course survey responses demonstrated significant improvements, with students developing a nuanced understanding of the technology's complexities, including data privacy, ethical considerations, and accessibility challenges. The course successfully aligned with students' expectations for practical knowledge applicable to their careers, and the emphasis on the transformative potential of digital twinning across various fields, including healthcare, space, urban planning, defense, agriculture, and sustainability was the notable strength of the course.  Post-course surveys revealed strong positive outcomes, with 63% of students extremely likely to recommend the course, 55% expressing high enthusiasm for digital twinning's potential, and 90% reporting confidence in understanding its industrial impacts. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating digital twinning education into broader curricula, emphasizing its relevance to liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies in preparing students for the technological demands of various industries.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the legitimation strategies employed by organizations engaging in criminal activities to influence public opinion about the legitimacy of these criminal activities. These discursive strategies are used to justify criminal actions, such as corruption, fraud, or violence, within broader organizational and cultural contexts. Often involving moral neutralization and moral licensing techniques, these strategies allow organizations engaged in criminal activities to present themselves and their actions as virtuous or justified. Although these strategies can result in societal harm by undermining public support for law enforcement, little is known about what types of legitimation strategies exist, how they differ, and how they influence public opinion. Hence, this scoping review identifies and categorizes the legitimation strategies used by organizations engaged in criminal activities. By conducting a scoping review of 21 empirical studies, a four-dimensional typology of 10 legitimation strategies is developed, clustered by their association with distinct types of legitimacy. The findings propose five mechanisms whereby legitimation strategies impact public opinion. Understanding these strategies and mechanisms is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies to delegitimize criminal actions and enhance societal resilience. This study advances the fragmented discourse on legitimation processes of specifically criminal actions employed by organizations, integrating findings from various disciplines to inform theory and practice.",

          "authors": "Sam Crawley",
          "abstract": "The low salience of climate change – relative to issues such as the economy – means that politicians face limited public pressure to enact the necessary climate mitigation policies. Rhetoric from politicians about policies can sway public opinion, but it remains unclear how much political arguments can alter the public perception of an issue's salience. This study investigates the extent to which hypothetical party statements supporting or opposing a ban on exploration of new oil and gas fields influences opinions about this policy, and the salience of climate change. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment of 1650 participants in Australia and New Zealand show that political statements impact policy support and opinions of policy efficacy, but have little discernible effect on participants’ perceptions of climate change salience. These results suggest that the public issue salience of climate change is stable, potentially making it challenging for politicians to pursue transformational climate policies.",

          "authors": "Ana C. Gómez-Ugarte; Irena Chen; Ugofilippo Basellini; Enrique Acosta; Diego Alburez-Gutierrez",
          "abstract": "The Gaza War, triggered by the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in significant loss of life and intensified an ongoing humanitarian crisis. Despite increasing demand for accurate measures of conflict severity, mortality estimates remain challenging due to the inherent `statistical fog of war' surrounding ongoing conflicts. In particular, accurate quantification is hindered by uncertainties related to incomplete reporting and uncertain age-sex distributions of casualties. \nOfficial death tolls are likely influenced by damaged infrastructure, security disruptions, and political motivations, as well as the aggregated nature of available data. This complicates detailed demographic verification. Our study introduces a novel methodological approach---a Bayesian model incorporating novel priors---to explicitly account for measurement errors in mortality estimation by addressing reporting completeness and uncertainty in demographic distributions. \nApplying these methods to the ongoing Gaza War, we estimate sex- and age-specific mortality patterns and associated life expectancy (LE) losses. We find that LE in Gaza was 42.3 [39.4-45.0] in 2023 and 40.4 [37.5-43.0] in 2024, corresponding to LE losses of 34.4 [31.7-37.3] and 36.4 [33.8-39.3], respectively. To contextualize these estimates, we compare them with LE losses observed in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and all of Palestine between 2012 and 2019. Our estimates align with point estimates of previously published work, after adjusting the reporting priors to ignore underreporting. \nThe study provides a robust and reproducible framework for mortality estimation under conditions of data scarcity, applicable to current and future conflicts.",

          "abstract": "Using population reconstructions from linked civil certificates for the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands, for the period 1812-1913, I study the social gradient in maternal mortality. Maternal mortality is defined as deaths in the first 42 days after the birth of a child. Among the women – mother to at least one child and followed between age 20 and 45 – maternal mortality constitutes about one third of the total number of observed deaths. Maternal mortality is higher for upper class women in early 19th century Zeeland than for unskilled laborers. By the early 20th century, maternal mortality had become an uncommon event and social differences in its likelihood negligible. A comparison of the social gradient in maternal mortality to the social gradient in all mortality in the reproductive ages (age 20-45) in this period shows that the reverse social gradient in mortality is limited to maternal mortality – it is not found for all deaths in this period of life.",

          "authors": "Jose Pina-Sánchez; Melissa Hamilton; Peter WG Tennant",
          "abstract": "To minimise confounding bias and facilitate the identification of unwarranted disparities, sentencing researchers have traditionally sought to control for as many legal factors as possible. Over the past decade a growing number of researchers have questioned such approach, pointing at multiple legal factors are themselves subject to judicial discretion, so controlling for them leads to post-treatment bias. Here we use DAGs to provide a more formal and comprehensive assessment of the different types of bias that could be expected under different choice of controls. In addition, we put forward a new modelling framework to: i) facilitate the choice of controls under different definitions of sentencing disparities, and ii) reflect the model uncertainty stemming from the trade-off between confounding and post-treatment bias. We apply this framework to the estimation of race disparities in the US federal courts and gender disparities in the England and Wales magistrates' court. We find substantial model uncertainty for gender disparities and for race disparities affecting Hispanic offenders, rendering estimates of the latter inconclusive. Disparities against black offenders are more consistent, although, they are not strong enough to be seen as definitive evidence of racial discrimination.",

          "authors": "Alex Albright",
          "abstract": "Many jurisdictions in the United States have reduced the use of money bail, which requires people to pay money to leave jail pretrial. This policy reduces the amount of time arrestees spend in jail, at the risk that they will offend or fail to appear in court. This paper estimates the detention-misconduct trade-off by studying a program in Kentucky that automatically released low-level arrestees with no bail. The program reduced total hours in detention by 43%, while it increased court non-appearance by 3.3 percentage points and had a small (0.7 percentage point) and insignificant effect on pretrial rearrest. For each new court non-appearance, the arrested population was spared an additional 26 days in detention. The program’s effects operated through multiple channels: reducing the use of money bail, reducing the use of other bail types, and speeding up the release process. In the second part of the paper, I isolate the effects of eliminating money bail for low-level arrestees. For each new pretrial rearrest, I find that 10 people are spared longer jail stays by money bail elimination.",

In this study we review several common approaches to stochastic simulation for activity patterns across several different academic disciplines. Building off this literature, we propose another stochastic simulation algorithm, the Hierarchical Activity Simulation Procedure, that is rooted in the survival methods literature and directly models duration and activity selection. This is a highly flexible method and can accommodate joint activity structures (ie household or role-level effects) and is not particularly data intensive. This method produces very realistic time-use patterns, can accommodate a range of activities without too much additional computational complexity, and has implications for practitioners and time use researchers alike.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on human rights repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to protect legitimacy and curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw ire from the international community and can be counterproductive at achieving its aims. To avoid this, states employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. This is a significant argument, suggesting that previous research may undercount repression by only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented avenues of repression. The author recalls their experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

          "authors": "Mary Daly; Elizabeth Gosme; Holly Shorey; Merve Uzunalioglu",
          "abstract": "This report presents policy priorities for the enhancement of family resilience. It, first, provides a conceptual framework for how we should understand the functions of policy in regard to improving family resilience. Second, it reviews the current national and EU-level policy landscape. Third, it proposes a set of policy principles in three key areas that are considered essential to improve family resilience: better income support for families with children, closing the childcare gap and comprehensive family support services. The report is based on a wide-ranging comparative analysis of relevant data from Eurostat, OECD Family Database, Leave Network and MISSOC, a review of three key intiatives from the EU, the Work-Life Balance Directive, European Child Guarantee and European Care Strategy, and a review of relevant policies in the six rEUsilience countries. It is also informed by a 'road-testing' exercise which was undertaken through the Policy Lab, where family and policy experts developed and reviewed policy proposals. \n\nThe report seeks to provide guidance especially when reforming and introducing policies with respect to family resilience. The report emphasises the need for a holistic and comprehensive approach to empower families especially during the transitions over the lifecourse. Consequently, the report interprets the support from the state as a package consisting of income support, employment-related parenting leaves, childcare and family-oriented services. The policy priorities are informed by the aforementioned analyses which highlighted a range of 'incompletions' in existing policies in, first, recognising the changing needs of families as children grow older and, second, the additional support needs of particular families (especially low-income families, lone-parent families and families coping with illness or disability on the part of a child). The report offers 15 principles as a guide to undertake policy reform. These principles, which are generally similar across the three fields, relate to coverage (endorsing a universal approach), adequacy (in terms of amount and sufficiency of income and other forms of support), inclusion (recognition of additional needs) and the absence of gaps in provision.",

          "abstract": "Gender and socio-economic background are key factors influencing the timing of the transition to adulthood; however, their composite effect is difficult to identify, as gender differences are developed within the family context. Drawing on data from two waves (2009, 2016) of an Italian nationally representative survey, we use information on children of parents aged 50-75 (N= 28,244) to analyse gender differences in home-leaving age among higher- and lower-educated families. We compare estimates from Cox proportional hazards and sibling fixed-effects models. Our findings show that gender differences in higher-educated families are less marked than in lower-educated families; gender differences remain significant when we account for family characteristics shared by siblings. In Italy, parental education is associated with delays in home-leaving among daughters, not among sons. This study illustrates how sibling comparisons can help disentangle heterogeneity in life course transitions, and how families contribute to the reproduction of inequalities in demographic behaviours.",

          "authors": "Shakti Raj Shrestha; Leonardo Olivetti; Shivang Pandey; Koffi Worou; Elena Raffetti",
          "abstract": "There has been a significant increase in both the number of publications and number of citations in the last decade which can be easily accessed through online databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, ResearchGate. The large data set of scientific literature and respective authors in these platforms can be utilized to get a broad overview of academic discourse. This project aims to investigate the state of academia in the field of Natural Hazards and Climate Extremes using Google Scholar data. A comprehensive set of relevant tags (such as earthquake, volcano, natural hazards, climate extremes etc.) were used to filter the researchers. A threshold of 500 citations was applied to focus on the most influential academics in this field. We limited the analysis to the period 1990-2023 and subsequently stratified the obtained results by gender (as perceived by the authors) and country of affiliation of the researchers. Data for the number of publications was also collected for each of the researchers.\nAmong 2614 researchers identified, 77.2% are male, 22.6% female, and 0.2% could not be categorized into male or female. Male researchers, on average, received a larger median number of citations compared to women even though the gender citation gap in percentage has been decreasing over the last decade. Notably, regression analysis showed that there is a limited difference in number of citations per publication between the two genders. The data also shows that 78.5% of citations are attributed to researchers in high-income countries, 14.4% for those in middle-income countries, and 7.1% for those in low-income countries despite researchers in low- and middle-income countries publishing more papers per year, on average, than their counter parts in high-income countries. Researchers from high-income countries also get a larger number of citations per author, on average, even when controlling for number of publications. However, the citation gap between high-income and low- and middle-income countries has narrowed in recent years. Interestingly, the observed citation gap between researchers is more pronounced due to income group than gender. In conclusion, even though disasters affect poor countries and women disproportionately, the fact that the field of natural hazards and climate extremes is largely high-income country and male-dominated raises fundamental questions on the ontology and epistemology of the scientific knowledge that has been generated.",

          "abstract": "Given an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape and growing climate-related risks, this paper argues for strengthening the EU’s fiscal capacity for crisis prevention, preparedness and response, focusing on two fields: security and defence on one hand and natural catastrophes on the other.\n\nThe analysis highlights lessons from responses to COVID-19, including not only the benefits of joint financial instruments (e.g. NextGenerationEU and SURE) but also their shortcomings, such as their temporary nature, weak alignment with long-term resilience, and inadequate parliamentary oversight. The current EU budget framework remains rigid, prioritising mid-term investment while offering limited flexibility for emergency responses.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, the paper advocates for systematically integrating crisis preparedness and readiness considerations into EU budget and scaling up investments in defence and security, as well as in natural disaster prevention and response. Defence funding remains inadequate and fragmented, with insufficient EU-level contributions despite escalating security threats. Apart from repurposing cohesion funding towards security goals and better leveraging the spending power of national promotional banks, the paper proposes a permanent off-budget solution for defence financing to build a new European Security Funding Facility (ESeFF). Similarly, EU disaster relief funding is under-resourced. The EU Solidarity Fund and Civil Protection Mechanism require significant expansion, along with stronger incentives for climate adaptation. The introduction of a public-private climate catastrophe reinsurance scheme could help mitigate financial risks.",

          "abstract": "A legally binding unilateral settlement option for dismissal disputes could streamline the dismissal process, but concerns persist about the potential overuse of dismissals. To assess this claim, we develop a model of employment adjustment followed by negotiation under litigation threat, and show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, unilateral settlement can enhance total surplus and benefit workers with relatively high productivity when employment adjustment does not significantly hurt productivity. These results stem from a fundamental trade-off: employers must forgo potential worker output to avoid litigation costs, which alters the threat points of wage negotiations and dismissal decisions in favor of workers. Our findings suggest that properly designed unilateral settlement institutions can contribute to both stable employment, efficiency and distributional equity in labor markets beyond merely reducing litigation costs, particularly in contexts with high productivity retention rates.",

However, current and former servicemembers have different patterns of attraction and engagement with extremist ideologies and groups as compared with civilians. Servicemembers and veterans are more likely to be attracted to anti-government groups and causes that have been associated with violent acts, especially those espousing ideologies related to defending against perceived violations of the Constitution and/or Constitutional rights.

          "abstract": "This chapter examines the relationship between satisfaction with social life and overall subjective well-being in Spain. Despite increasing recognition of social life as a key determinant of well-being, direct empirical research on its influence remains scarce, particularly in Southern Europe, where much of the existing evidence is anecdotal. Unlike concepts such as social capital, social support, and relational support, satisfaction with social life captures the intrinsic value of social interactions rather than their instrumental utility. It reflects an individual's subjective appraisal of their overall social relationships, encompassing not only close ties but also broader interactions with acquaintances, neighbours, and peripheral contacts. Drawing on data from the first wave of the Global Flourishing Study (2020–2022), this chapter investigates how social life satisfaction contributes to both cognitive and affective well-being. Spanish findings are contextualized within a comparative framework, including high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries. The results highlight that subjective evaluations of social life play a crucial role in shaping overall well-being, surpassing the influence of individual characteristics. Furthermore, the significance of social life satisfaction for both cognitive and affective well-being increases with socioeconomic development, positioning Spain alongside upper-middle-income countries with collectivistic and Latin cultural orientations. An analysis of heterogeneity within Spain reveals no substantial variations across gender, social background, or regions. However, significant age-related differences emerge, with the importance of social life satisfaction on overall well-being—particularly affective well-being—increasing with age. The chapter concludes by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outlining directions for future research, including methodological considerations.",

Using linked register data, labor market biographies, and the Swedish Level of Living Survey, we construct a multidimensional measure of peripheral labor market status—including temporary and part-time contracts, excessive job mobility, and unemployment spells. While contemporary labor market theories suggest increasing segmentation and declining job quality for peripheral workers, our findings provide only modest support for this view. Associations between peripheral status and poor job quality — particularly in terms of work autonomy and physical hazards — are generally weak and largely accounted for by  prior job conditions. Evidence for increasing divergence over time is limited, suggesting that labor market polarization in terms of job conditions along contractual divides may be less pronounced than often assumed.",

          "authors": "Philipp Lausberg; Eulalia Rubio; REGROUP project",
          "abstract": "Given an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape and growing climate-related risks, this paper argues for strengthening the EU’s fiscal capacity for crisis prevention, preparedness and response, focusing on two fields: security and defence on one hand and natural catastrophes on the other.\n\nThe analysis highlights lessons from responses to COVID-19, including not only the benefits of joint financial instruments (e.g. NextGenerationEU and SURE) but also their shortcomings, such as their temporary nature, weak alignment with long-term resilience, and inadequate parliamentary oversight. The current EU budget framework remains rigid, prioritising mid-term investment while offering limited flexibility for emergency responses.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, the paper advocates for systematically integrating crisis preparedness and readiness considerations into EU budget and scaling up investments in defence and security, as well as in natural disaster prevention and response. Defence funding remains inadequate and fragmented, with insufficient EU-level contributions despite escalating security threats. Apart from repurposing cohesion funding towards security goals and better leveraging the spending power of national promotional banks, the paper proposes a permanent off-budget solution for defence financing to build a new European Security Funding Facility (ESeFF). Similarly, EU disaster relief funding is under-resourced. The EU Solidarity Fund and Civil Protection Mechanism require significant expansion, along with stronger incentives for climate adaptation. The introduction of a public-private climate catastrophe reinsurance scheme could help mitigate financial risks.",

          "authors": "Michael Crenshaw",
          "abstract": "Cultural imperialism has existed for ages before antiquarians were able to trace a country’s heritage through historic objects. The amount of history lost to stolen archives, looted archaeological sites, and displaced objects has disrupted empirical evidence of the past, severely impacting the heritage, identity, and education of a country. Increased emphasis on historical literacy during the 21st century has heightened awareness surrounding illicit cultural trade, its environmental and cultural impact, as well as the shifting political dynamics at play. The US, whose museum institutions have largely benefited from the sale and exchange of stolen objects, began raiding private collections and archives holding stolen objects, leaving the world of art trade weary in the face of legal prosecution. In turn, the black market for cultural property has grown massively during the last 50 years, linked to large crime organizations and terrorism. This review examines existing research concerning history and global impact of illicit trade of cultural property, the political motives which both fuel and cease the movement of illicit trade, and highlight the important work of government and independent repatriation organizations. Concluding this review, I will provide new directions to take this research, emphasizing the importance of filling knowledge gaps within illicit cultural trade.",

          "abstract": "Nature markets are proliferating rapidly around the world, yet it is underacknowledged that they have been practiced in various forms for decades. A large body of scientific research has shown that nature markets regularly do not achieve their environmental objectives, and provides generalisable lessons to support their ongoing improvement. The scale of the biodiversity crisis and the enduring popularity of nature markets means it is now critical to stop reproducing the same mistakes. Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five ‘golden rules’ which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a simple checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks. Lastly, we outline critical evidence-based actions that can be taken to push nature markets towards greater integrity.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "We argue that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.7% of the returns. The models assuming independence of the two returns show similar power in predicting T-bill returns, which can significantly simplify the formulas. We also find that the inclusion of a risk constant over maturity, which has a small value of several basis points, significantly reduces the prediction errors. The risk and the risk-free rate is the gateway to corporate the risk of various assets in the country.",

          "title": "Address Challenges Markowitz (1952) Faces: A New Measure of Asset Risk",
          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

          "abstract": "A legally binding unilateral settlement option for dismissal disputes could streamline the dismissal process, but concerns persist about the potential overuse of dismissals. To assess this claim, we develop a model of employment adjustment followed by negotiation under litigation threat, and show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, unilateral settlement can enhance total surplus and benefit workers with relatively high productivity when employment adjustment does not significantly hurt productivity. These results stem from a fundamental trade-off: employers must forgo potential worker output to avoid litigation costs, which alters the threat points of wage negotiations and dismissal decisions in favor of workers. Our findings suggest that properly designed unilateral settlement institutions can contribute to both stable employment, efficiency and distributional equity in labor markets beyond merely reducing litigation costs, particularly in contexts with high productivity retention rates.",

          "abstract": "Political connections provide substantial benefits to firms. We emphasize the ownership of firms as an important channel through which political connections operate and identify a resulting link between political turnover and turnover in the ownership of firms: Political turnover prompts newly politically connected individuals to take, and newly disconnected individuals to cede, ownership of firms. This pattern should be more pronounced in countries with weaker property rights, among firms with publicly recorded owners, and among firms with more immobile assets. Moreover, firms that experience changes to ownership during periods of political turnover should have elevated political connections and therefore pay less taxes and earn higher profits. Analyses of the ownership structure of firms in 87 countries are consistent with the theory. Because politically connected owners allow firms to compensate for other vulnerabilities, the theory also explains mixed findings in prior work on the consequences of asset immobility.",
