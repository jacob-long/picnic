          "title": "The Need for Equivalence Testing in Economics",
          "authors": "Jack Fitzgerald",
          "abstract": "Equivalence testing can provide statistically significant evidence that economic relationships are practically negligible. I demonstrate its necessity in a large-scale reanalysis of estimates defending 135 null claims made in 81 recent articles from top economics journals. 36-63% of estimates defending the average null claim fail lenient equivalence tests. In a prediction platform survey, researchers accurately predict that equivalence testing failure rates will significantly exceed levels which they deem acceptable. Obtaining equivalence testing failure rates that these researchers deem acceptable requires arguing that nearly 75% of published estimates in economics are practically equal to zero. These results imply that Type II error rates are unacceptably high throughout economics, and that many null findings in economics reflect low power rather than truly negligible relationships. I provide economists with guidelines and commands in Stata and R for conducting credible equivalence testing and practical significance testing in future research.",

          "abstract": "The increasing number of article submissions to scientific journals, and the decreasing acceptance of reviewer invitations, creates a considerable problem for editors and the scientific system in general. Here we review the literature and discuss the five most commonly cited reasons for reviewers to decline invitations. We also present potential solutions for each of the five reasons, based both on the literature and on discussions and experiences of colleagues. It is clear that the reviewing process needs to be substantially improved and updated.  We also make some suggestions that may help editors do their jobs while the peer review system is overhauled.",

          "authors": "Anja Collazo; Meggie Danziger; Timothy M. Errington; Clarissa França Dias Carneiro; Ulf Toelch",
          "abstract": "In recent years, preclinical replication studies have been conducted to assess reproducibility rates of preclinical research. A crucial aspect of such studies are sample size choices. In replication studies, only sufficiently high animal numbers will result in reliable conclusions. This is offset by ethical constraints inherent to animal experimentation that demand animal numbers to be at a minimum. To develop guidance on how to balance the diametrically opposed goals, we analyzed sample size choices in three large-scale preclinical replication projects that assessed preclinical reproducibility. We identified conceptually different choices regarding replication sample sizes across projects. To explore the consequences of these choices, we conducted simulations based on data from the three preclinical replication projects. Here, the declaration of replication success depended strongly on different approaches to sample size planning. Through incorporating uncertainty of exploratory experiments into sample size planning, reliability of replication studies increased markedly. We discuss how sample size planning informed by the uncertainty of exploratory effect sizes will benefit testing specific hypotheses through replications in preclinical research settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: Risk of bias assessment tools like ROBINS-I have been developed to identify biases in non-randomized studies of interventions. However, additional factors related to study design, reporting, external validity, statistical precision and other factors not accounted for in risk of bias assessment tools could affect the trustworthiness of non-randomized studies of interventions.\nObjectives: To identify factors, beyond risk of bias (covered by existing tools e.g., ROBINS-I), that could influence the trustworthiness of non-randomized studies of interventions. \nDesign: Scoping review\nData sources and searches: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for publications that explicitly discussed trustworthiness of non-randomized studies of interventions, published between 2014 and April 2024.\nStudy selection: A single reviewer screened the titles and abstracts, and the full texts, against the eligibility criteria and a second reviewer conducted quality control for 10% of titles and abstracts and of full-texts.\nData extraction: A single reviewer extracted data on the study characteristics and the factors that can influence trustworthiness. All extractions were verified by a second reviewer.\nData synthesis: We employed deductive and inductive thematic analysis using NVIVO 14.\nResults: After screening 6471 titles and abstracts, we identified 48 eligible reports. We identified 35 factors influencing the trustworthiness of non-randomized studies of interventions, grouped into 16 domains and six themes. The themes were: 1) Open Science, 2) Research Question, 3) Study Methodology, 4) Data Source, 5) Findings and Interpretation, and 6) Oversight. \nConclusion: There are many factors beyond the traditional bias domains that can guide efforts to assess and improve non-randomized studies of interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background\nEvidence synthesis for whole medical systems is challenging. This paper reviews, and provides a framework for, evidence synthesis of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) systems incorporating context and complexity. There are currently no systematic reviews that comprehensively evaluate homeopathy as a patient-centered whole medical system in accordance with contemporary scientific standards. A systematic review program on the effects of homeopathic preparations in various clinical indications is used as a practical illustration of the proposed framework.\nProposed solution\nA systems perspective considers the patient as a complex system of interconnected regulative subsystems embedded in a complex environment, and disease as a dysregulation of the dynamic adaptive state of the organism. Most TCIM systems, including homeopathy, aim to stimulate regulative systems and their functions to regain homeostasis, rather than to structurally change something within the organism. The consequences of these principles for the approach to evidence synthesis are explored, and its implementation is illustrated by the systematic review program on the effects and effectiveness of homeopathy.\nResults\nA systems perspective requires taking into account a plurality of evidence sources, including in particular ‘real-world’ clinical data, which is why the systematic review program will include non-randomized prospective comparative studies (NRSIs) as well as RCTs. A patient advocate will be involved during the entire research program and input from patients with living experience with homeopathy for the clinical indication concerned will be incorporated in each of the systematic reviews. \nDiscussion\nRCT and NRSI evidence on homeopathic preparations for a range of clinical indications will be synthesised. A limitation, from a complex systems perspective, is that the implication of these findings will still need to be framed within the broader context of the existing state of knowledge.  An ‘evidence eco-system’, that includes complementary sources of information, will be required to inform decisions. \nConclusions\nEvidence synthesis of TCIM systems can move beyond conventional approaches by framing evidence within its complexity and context, together with real-world data and patient perspectives. This approach entails methodological challenges and will require gap analyses to guide future research and improve applicability for public health and patient care.",

          "abstract": "Visual content (e.g., graphs) can serve as potent misinformation. Across two experiments (total N = 478), we examined how misleading graphs affect belief in false claims, and whether these impacts can be reduced by an inoculation—a pre-emptive intervention that explained misleading data-visualisation techniques. Participants received the inoculation or no intervention, then rated their belief in accurate and misleading headlines, half of which were accompanied by a supporting graph. Graphs consistently boosted belief in misleading headlines but had inconsistent effects on accurate headlines. An inoculation focusing on multiple misleading visualisation techniques was ineffective at reducing the impact of misleading graphs, instead inducing general scepticism. A single-technique inoculation focusing on dual axes reduced the influence of misleading graphs using that technique; this benefit did not, however, transfer to graphs using cherry-picking. Findings demonstrate that graphs can boost false beliefs and suggest that a specific technique-focused inoculation can reduce this impact.",

          "authors": "Kara Kedrick; Kyana Burhite; Iris Vilares; Paul Schrater",
          "abstract": "The scope of knowledge is constantly evolving, due to such factors as environmental changes, cultural evolution, and scientific discovery. Consequently, we are frequently confronted with gaps in our knowledge, compelling us to seek information from available sources. Sometimes the information we seek is easy to find; other times it has yet to be established by others, requiring us to creatively come up with an original perspective. Yet, little is known about how our foraging strategies change depending on the ease with which the information we seek is readily available. We investigated how the need to generate new ideas influences the rate at which individuals explore or exploit existing information. Participants (N = 138)   answered questions either fully answerable (low-creativity condition) or not fully answerable (high-creativity condition) with information they foraged for on Wikipedia. We created knowledge networks from the foraged information, wherein Wikipedia pages were nodes. The edges linked pairs of Wikipedia pages when they were visited by the participant either sequentially or within the same condition, and were weighted based on the semantic similarity between the pair of pages. This approach allowed us to measure exploration (jumping between disparate pages) and exploitation (viewing closely related pages). In the high-creativity condition, participants were more likely to trade-off between exploration (lower average edge weights) and exploitation  (higher average clustering coefficients). This trade-off was associated with responses that were more novel, diverging further from the Wikipedia text, compared to less novel responses. These findings reveal how foraging strategies differ in creative versus non-creative contexts, and provide insight into the processes that underlie learning and scientific discovery.",

          "authors": "Béatrice Sternberg; Dora Bianchi; Lisa De Luca; Liliyana Mbeve; VERONICA BENET-MARTINEZ",
          "abstract": "Religious and sexual identities are often perceived as conflicting, creating challenges for religious lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

          "abstract": "Advances in synthetic biology and tissue engineering are empowering the design of neural constructs from first principles. This transition toward invention as an approach to discovery invites a critical re-engagement with the field of cybernetics, which despite being underrealized in its time due to technological constraints, continues to shape how we think about control, adaptation, and intelligence. Confronting the inefficiencies of artificial intelligence (AI), investigators have turned to the remarkable learning capacities, robustness, and energy efficiency of living cognitive systems as biocomputers and organic controllers. Here, we consider the design, assembly, and programmability of synthetic biological intelligences as well as their utility as platforms to study minimal cognition within a cybernetics framework. We also consider system architecture, tissue dimensionality, embodiment, organism-environment distinctions, and hybrid robots in the context of an emerging field of diverse intelligence.",

          "authors": "Amanda Seyler; Roxy O'Rourke; Nhu Huynh; Christie Burton; Paul Arnold; Theodore Cheung; Jennifer Crosbie",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Qualitative methods offer rich insights into human experience, yet the expanding volume of textual data presents analytic challenges. Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), may help researchers organize and interpret qualitative data while maintaining depth and accuracy. It is important to assess the validity and practical suitability of LLMs for qualitative analysis. This systematic review evaluated the extent to which LLMs, specifically generative transformer models such as ChatGPT, can identify themes and patterns consistent with human analysts. Methods: Studies published up to June 2025 were retrieved from PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies directly compared LLM- and human-generated outputs derived from thematic, narrative, or discourse analyses. Results: Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Most used versions of ChatGPT (70.8%), while others utilized Gemini (8.3%), Claude (4.2%), among others. Comparative analyses spanned diverse disciplines, though standardized protocols for conducting LLM-assisted qualitative analysis were lacking. Overall, LLM performance relative to human analysts was rated as moderate to high. Among those studies reporting quantitative indexes, the median % agreement score was 0.80 (range: 0.19-1.00), median Cohen’s Kappa was 0.74 (range 0.38-0.82), and median Cosine coefficient was 0.58 (range: 0.47-0.80), with stronger alignment for semantic or descriptive themes and lower accuracy for interpretive, context-dependent themes. Discussion: Findings provide support for LLMs as complementary tools in qualitative data analysis. Rather than replacing human interpretation, LLMs may serve as efficient aids for data organization and inter-rater comparison to support, but not substitute, qualitative engagement.",

          "abstract": "Recognizing the importance of affect to well-being, a growing number of low-barrier online interventions aim to reduce negative affect and promote positive mood. This broad class of interventions, named positive activity interventions (PAIs), was developed with the intent to enhance positive emotions, meaning, and connectedness, among other positive states. Recent reviews of the PAI literature highlight that many studies are underpowered and lack pre-registration, raising concerns about the validity of their findings. Furthermore, existing research has focused primarily on self-focused PAIs and assumes treatment effect homogeneity, despite research on happiness and well-being highlighting the importance of social connection and person-activity fit. In the current study, we extend past research by conducting a pre-registered field experiment with a large sample (n = 6,411) to compare the mood-boosting effects of five social PAIs and an active control. We found that four of the five PAIs improved mood valence compared to the active control, but there were no differences between the five activities in terms of change to mood intensity or bearability. We found support for the person-fit hypothesis but not for the person-activity fit moderation hypothesis, suggesting that PAI delivery for mood improvement can be standardized and more cost-effective than previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "Psychometrics involves the development and evaluation of mathematical models that connect the observable behaviors of persons to attributes. Because psychometric models produce numeric quantities that are typically assigned to persons for some purpose, psychometrics is sometimes characterized as a scientific discipline concerned with the practice of psychological measurement. The historical roots of psychometrics come from an interest in the quantitative study of individual differences. Technological advance through the first quarter of the 21st century has led to the development and evaluation of increasingly complex and specialized mathematical models. There can be significant syntactical barriers to understanding these models, making it easy to lose sight of philosophical questions and debates about the meaning and interpretation of the latent variables these models contain. In this entry these debates are brought to the surface and future possibilities for the field of psychometrics as it evolves are considered.",

          "abstract": "We study the effects of political victory and defeat on subjective wellbeing using the case of the UK referendum on EU membership, where the UK voted on 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union. Using longitudinal UK panel data from 2009-2023, we compare Leave and Remain supporters across three phases of the referendum process: anticipation, negotiation, and implementation. Directly before and following the outcome of the vote, Leave voters reported relatively higher wellbeing compared to Remain voters, with this wellbeing advantage being especially prominent after the formal implementation of the referendum in 2020. Differences are observed across indicators of both psychological and economic wellbeing. The effects are particularly pronounced among men, older adults, low-income individuals, the self-employed, and those with local minority political views. The findings suggest that in polarized democracies, psychological and economic wellbeing are shaped not only by objective financial realities but also by political identity and emotional attachment.",

          "abstract": "Academia suffers from various equity issues. One such issue is gender inequality in authorship, where many studies show that women are less represented compared to men. Due to authorship differences across disciplines, the goal of this study is to provide a current overview of the gender distribution of authorship within music psychology. A total of 3,373 papers published between 2000 and 2025 across five core music psychology journals were analysed with respect to author gender and authorship role (first, last, solo, and coauthor). In addition, we explored gender patterns related to citations, open-access publishing, and keywords. Overall, women authors were in the minority, accounting for 40.2% of all authors. However, the distribution of authorship roles diverged notably from this overall proportion: women were more likely to be first authors (odds ratio, OR = 1.41), equally likely to be solo authors (OR = 1.11) or coauthors (OR = 1.00), but less likely to be last authors (OR = 0.73). These patterns have become more pronounced over the past 15 years. No substantial gender differences in citation counts were observed. Analyses of geographical variation revealed clear country and continental differences, potentially reflecting both the status of women and the historical development of the discipline in particular regions. Finally, an examination of keywords suggested broad thematic preferences differing by gender. Although this work overall shows that the field of music psychology is more balanced than some other (STEM) fields, it provides a picture to inspire discussions and initiatives to further promote fairness and equity in academia.",

          "authors": "Athulya Aravind; Karissa A Sanchez; Kristen Syrett",
          "abstract": "When asked to count using basic-level noun descriptions (e.g. fork), children often count both whole objects and 'partial objects' (e.g., a broken fork-piece) as one unit, diverging systematically from adults. We test one class of explanations for this ‘over-counting’ behavior: that children apply nouns to objects more permissively than adults, and then count those objects they have labeled with the noun. In a two-task study, we examined how categorization of a partial object under a count noun related to numerical evaluations of sets that included that object, including cases where the numerical expressions involved fractions. Adults categorized and counted partial objects conservatively, often excluding them from the category and counting them, at most, for a fractional share (1/2). Children were more permissive in both tasks: they frequently accepted partial objects as noun category members and counted them on par with wholes (as |1|). Strikingly, children’s numerical judgments were often incongruous with their categorization: they sometimes rejected a partial object as a category member, but still counted it as |1|. We argue that while children are indeed more flexible in their noun application, their counting behavior calls for a different account. We propose that children lack the numerical capacities to represent and reason over fractional amounts, and default to a natural number scale even when adults use a finer-grained measurement scale. Children may recognize that the partial fork contributes some non-zero amount to a sum, but the only way they can add it to that sum is as |1|.",

          "authors": "Youmi Suk; Weicong Lyu",
          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and  demonstrate how our approach differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study. We further illustrate its application to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam and a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding with broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

People endorsing more\nsexuality myths also accepted fewer sexuality facts, endorsed more myths in other domains,\nand had a stronger conspiracy mentality. While virtually uncorrelated with sexual satisfaction\nand risk behavior, sexuality myth endorsement was associated with less confident sexual\ncommunication and, in the public, lower life satisfaction and fewer safer sex practices.\nParticipants demonstrated limited self-insight into their susceptibility to sexuality myths.\nTaken together, our findings highlight the need for psychological research on sexuality myths,\nthe mechanisms behind them, and their consequences—research that should go beyond highly\neducated and young populations.",

This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate whether pre-stroke cognitive reserve moderates the relationship between executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms in long-term stroke survivors. We hypothesized that higher post-stroke executive dysfunction scores would be associated with higher depressive symptom scores, and that greater pre-stroke cognitive reserve would attenuate this association. \n\nMethod: This study utilized data from the OX-CHRONIC study, involving 105 remotely-assessed long-term stroke survivors at approximately 4.57 years post-stroke. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and executive dysfunction was assessed using the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), OCS-Plus, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Hayling Sentence Completion Test, and Backwards Digit Span. Cognitive Reserve was measured using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), including education, working activity, and leisure activity subscales. Multiple regression models evaluated the moderating effect of Cognitive Reserve on executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms.\n\nResults: Higher executive dysfunction scores were significantly associated with higher depressive symptom scores (ρ = -.32, p = .003). Cognitive Reserve moderated this relationship, with higher levels of pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve strengthening the relationship between executive functioning and depressive symptoms (interaction term: β = -0.04, p = .01). Exploratory analyses revealed that the education subscale of CRIq significantly moderated this relationship (β = -0.06, p = .002), while working and leisure activities did not.\n\nConclusions: Pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve, particularly educational attainment, may strengthen executive function’s protective effect on depressive symptoms in long-term stroke. This underscores the importance of fostering cognitively stimulating activities throughout the lifespan to enhance resilience against post-stroke cognitive and emotional challenges.",

          "abstract": "The climate crisis necessitates urgent collaboration on an unprecedented scale. To stave off disaster, individuals must address polarizing climate issues across deep social and ideological divides to take collective action. Drawing on social perspective taking theory, we investigate the effects of a “common ground” strategy–i.e., first acknowledging compelling aspects of respondents’ opinions on a proposed climate solution before disagreeing. Across four online experiments (N=1,839), participants exposed to this strategy reported enhanced relationship-relevant outcomes—including greater perceived similarity, fairness, and mutual perspective taking—compared to those who faced immediate disagreement. These findings demonstrate the power of perspective-taking communication and suggest a practical, scalable strategy for fostering constructive engagement across ideological divides. Effortfully taking another’s perspective appears promising as a strategy to establish a sense of common ground with those holding opposing points of view. The resulting relational benefits enhance the prospects for continued collaboration across differences—precisely what will be required to address the climate crisis.",

          "abstract": "Background \nAdolescents are a notoriously hard-to-engage audience in digital health communication. Many strategies have aimed to increase communication effectiveness by personalising what is said, but have largely neglected how it is said. Addressing this gap, we introduce an innovative approach to personalised health communication: automated AI-based linguistic tailoring. Using large language model style transfer, we mimic adolescents’ individual communication style to test if linguistically tailored health messages promote attitude change and healthier dietary behaviour. \n\nMethods \nWe conducted a preregistered 2-week randomised controlled trial with 587 adolescents (aged 13–16) in the UK and Ireland. Participants were allocated to one of four arms: no health messages (passive control), non-tailored health messages (active control), tailored health messages, or both message types presented in counterbalanced order in weeks 1 and 2. This enabled between-subject and within-subject comparisons. The primary outcome was plant-based lunch choice  (yes/no); secondary outcomes assessed evaluations of the messages and their source. \n\nFindings \nAdolescents receiving health messages (tailored or not) increasingly chose plant-based lunches more often over time than those receiving no messages (OR = 1.06, 95% CrI [1.02, 1.09]; pd = 1.000; BF₁₀ = 35.39). This effect was similar for tailored and non-tailored conditions (OR = 1.01, 95% CrI [0.98, 1.05]; pd = .731; BF₁₀ = 0.12). However, exploratory analyses indicated higher ratings of relevance (BF₁₀ = 3.50), personalisation (BF₁₀ = 4.93), and source liking (BF₁₀ = 3.38) for linguistic tailoring in the second week of the intervention. \n\nInterpretation \nFact-based dietary health messages effectively promoted plant-based lunch choices, although this behavioural effect seemed driven more by content than by style. However, with repeated exposure, linguistic tailoring enhanced several message and source evaluations, indicating promise for future AI-driven personalised health campaigns and youth communication.",

          "abstract": "To advance work on subjective well-being (SWB), this study developed a psychometrically optimized measure of life satisfaction/quality (the Satisfaction and Quality of Life Scale; SQLS) to overcome the limitations of existing measures (the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL), and the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)). This study conceptualized life satisfaction/quality as subjective global evaluations of one’s life, including perceived quality, satisfaction, and happiness. This conceptualization allowed life satisfaction/quality to vary over time for a broader range of individuals (including differently-abled individuals). An online sample of 2271 individuals completed a survey and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were used to create the 10-item and 5-item SQLS scales. The IRT findings demonstrated that the SQLS offered markedly higher information for discriminating individual differences than existing scales, translating into higher precision and power (larger effect sizes) for detecting between-group differences. EFA and CFA analyses in separate sample halves supported the single factor structure of the SQLS. IRT parameter invariance analyses and CFA-based measurement invariance analyses suggested stringent invariance of the SQLS across gender, age, sexual orientation, race, education level, and income groups, outperforming the SWLS. Furthermore, the SQLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency of the across 37 more focused demographic groups. The SQLS scales demonstrated robust convergent validity and discriminant validity with 22 conceptual boundary constructs. Bifactor models highlighted the advantages of the SQLS at an item level, with all of its items showing strong trait loadings on a global factor and markedly lower divergent loadings on a scale-specific factor. Finally, the SQLS demonstrated significantly larger Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) effect sizes for detecting improvement in life satisfaction than existing scales, suggesting that it is markedly more responsive to detecting improvement over time. Implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Morphological knowledge serves as a powerful heuristic for vocabulary growth and contributes significantly to the speed and efficiency of reading. While research has long sought to explain how the knowledge of derivational morphology is acquired, previous approaches have struggled to capture the nuanced and complex ways in which derivational morphemes are used in written language, particularly that these morphemes contribute to meaning in a graded manner and that noise introduced by misleading forms (e.g., deliver) can impede learning. Our approach builds on earlier insights but moves beyond them by combining a large-scale analysis of vocabulary used in 1,200 popular books with computational modelling to explore how learning of derivational affixes may occur from text containing naturally occurring noise. We use a compositional distributional semantic model to investigate what can be learned about the meanings of individual English prefixes and suffixes through reading and evaluate the model’s performance against data from 120 adults in a lexical processing task. Our findings demonstrate that, despite the presence of noise, natural text contains sufficient structure to support the extraction of core affix semantics, and that readers are attuned to the complex patterns that shape affix use in the wild. This work contributes a new dimension to a more principled and psychologically grounded account of morpheme learning, and we discuss both this contribution and the broader insights it offers for language research.",

          "authors": "Reiner Vinicius Perozzo; Felipe Flores Kupske",
          "abstract": "This article aims to present a historiographic reflection on the trajectory of speech sounds in linguistic studies, from the earliest systematic records to more\ncontemporary approaches. The starting point is the work of Panini, whose Sanskrit grammar represents one of the earliest known attempts at a systematic description of linguistic sounds. The analysis continues with the 19th-century Neogrammarians, who established a scientific model of sound change and laying the groundwork for what is now recognized as historical phonology. At the turn of the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure’s contribution redefined the role of sound in linguistic theory by integrating it into the linguistic sign within a relational and structural system. The article then examines the contributions of Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle, who introduced the notion of acoustically based distinctive features, developing a phonological model strongly supported by the spectrographic analysis of speech. This model was reinterpreted by Chomsky and Halle from an articulatory perspective, within the framework of generative phonology. This way, sound came to be conceived as a set of abstract articulatory features capable of explaining both phonological regularities and constraints in natural languages. This paper also considers contributions from speech perception schools, such as the psychoacoustic theory, the motor theory, and the direct realist theory. These perspectives investigate speech sounds based on mental, motor, and gestural dimensions, emphasizing the relationship between perceived sounds, the articulatory movements that generate them, and the sensory mechanisms involved in their decoding. The final part of the text highlights gestural proposals that conceptualize the speech sound as an acoustic-articulatory gesture and seek to overcome traditional divisions between phonetics and phonology. The discussion emphasizes the role of gestural borders in\nthe symbolic projection of sounds, the importance of the auditory-acoustic link, and the processes of gestural realignment and reconfiguration through which phonological regularities become grammaticalized. As a major contribution, the article also introduces a perspective that incorporates pragmatic and contextual elements into the perception of sounds, proposing a view of speech sounds as embodied indices, socially situated and symbolically charged. Ultimately, sound is portrayed as a omplex phenomenon that articulates physical, social, perceptual, and indexical dimensions of verbal language.",

          "abstract": "Organizational support theory suggests that human resource practices are important antecedents of perceived organizational support which, in turn, influences employees’ orientation toward their organization and their work behavior, including further engagement with human resource practices. Based on organizational support theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesized positive and reciprocal within-person relations between work flexibilization and perceived organizational support. We tested these hypotheses using 30 waves of longitudinal data collected between July 2020 and December 2022 from n = 1,000 full-time employees in Germany. Using an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR), results suggest that higher levels of work flexibilization are associated with subsequently higher levels of perceived organizational support, and vice versa. These results suggest a dynamic and reciprocal within- person process wherein positive deviations from one’s average trajectory of work flexibilization (perceived organizational support) are subsequently related to higher levels of perceived organizational support (work flexibilization). These findings imply a virtuous cycle where work flexibilization leads to more favorable perceptions of organizational support which, in turn, leads to an increase in employees’ use of work flexibilization. However, such positive effects may be short-lived (i.e., lasting between approximately 15- and 20-months), likely diminishing in strength over time.",

To synthesize the evidence, we convened over 120 researchers with diverse perspectives to evaluate 26 commonly cited claims using a Delphi process. A large majority agree that: Adolescent mental health has declined in several Western countries; heavy smartphone and social media use can cause sleep problems; such use correlates with attention problems and behavioural addiction; among girls, social media use may be associated with body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, exposure to mental disorders, harassment and predation. Most other claims were judged to have insufficient evidence due to limited, inconsistent, or non-causal data. Researchers also raised broader concerns, including challenges in measuring mental health and establishing causality, geographic bias in existing evidence, and the need for policies that account for diverse risks and avoid unintended harms.

          "abstract": "Science has long struggled with unsuccessful replications and reproductions, a challenge that raises questions about the robustness and credibility of research findings. One potential contributing factor is selective reporting or nonpublication of certain results based on their direction or strength, leading to publication bias. To better understand its extent and risk factors, we examined 178 successful study submissions to two German probabilistic panels (GESIS Panel, SOEP-IS), fielded between 2013 and 2021, and compared the hypotheses and exploratory analyses stated in the original study submissions with their presentation in subsequent publications. Using a coding scheme, we extracted information on the submissions, publications, and authors, and investigated which characteristics are associated with publication bias. Experimental study design, third-party funding, preregistration of hypotheses, and economic studies were the strongest and most stable predictors of lower risk of publication bias across multiple outcomes: publication likelihood, test and hit rate of hypotheses. The study highlights the complexity and multi-faceted nature of publication bias in the social, economic, and behavioral sciences, and shows that researchers (e.g., preregistration), funding agencies (e.g., incentives), and journals (e.g., peer review) play distinct roles in shaping publication bias. It thereby points to areas for reform in the research and publication process.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in cognitive science is whether cognitive control recruits domain-general or domain-specific processes. A useful paradigm to study this is the congruency sequence effect, which reflects the reduced impact of congruency after an incongruent trial. Many studies examined the congruency sequence effect across task in order to investigate domain generality. However, differences in how task dissimilarity was manipulated led to different conclusions about the nature of adaptive control. Therefore, we conducted a systematic, preregistered meta-analysis of 174 experiments (229 effect sizes). On average, the cross-task congruency sequence effect (Hedges’ gz = 0.252) decreased as task dissimilarity increased, with some factors influencing adaptive control more than others. Especially when tasks used a different response modality or conflict arose from different irrelevant stimulus dimensions, we observed a decreased cross-task congruency sequence effect, suggesting adaptive control is both action-oriented and involves distractor suppression. Notably, however, when tasks shared the same conflict type, larger congruency sequence effects were observed when stimulus and response sets were distinct rather than partially overlapping. Together, these findings refine current theories by pointing to a central role for the different motor modalities, distractor suppression, and shared versus separate task representations, moving beyond a simple domain-general versus domain-specific distinction.\n\nKeywords: meta analysis, conflict adaptation, congruency sequence effect, domain generality, cognitive control",

          "abstract": "Observing others’ actions and imagining oneself performing the same actions (motor imagery) have been linked in the literature in several ways. They have been shown to have overlapping neural representations, both seem to relate to one's ability to move, and both have been shown to positively affect movement rehabilitation. Whether these overlaps reflect a direct functional relationship between motor imagery and the ability to derive relevant information from observed kinematics (action understanding) has not yet been investigated. A previous study found that individuals with low self-reported motor imagery vividness exhibit weaker motor system engagement during action observation than those with typical imagery vividness. The present study provides the first behavioural test of the relationships between motor and general visual imagery vividness and a quantifiable behavioural measure of action understanding - specifically, the ability to judge the weight of objects based on observing someone else lift them. To test the research question across the full imagery spectrum, our recruitment strategy included a high proportion of individuals with very low imagery vividness (often referred to as ‘aphantasia’).  An online sample (N = 392) completed a weight judgement task alongside a matched speed judgement control task. Neither motor imagery vividness (Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2) nor general visual imagery vividness (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) predicted action understanding, with a Bayesian analysis suggesting moderate to strong evidence against any relationship. Overall, our findings suggest that self-reported motor and general visual imagery vividness are functionally independent from action understanding of manual interactions.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on cultural models of agency suggests that intrinsic motivation, such as passion, is a stronger predictor of performance in individualistic contexts (e.g., the United States) than in collectivistic contexts (e.g., China). Much less is known, however, about cultural differences in the perceived value of intrinsic motivation, which may more directly shape daily social processes surrounding motivation. The present research examined cross-cultural differences in the perceived importance of intrinsic motivation for both predicting others’ behavior and influencing others’ behavior. Counterintuitive patterns emerged. Faculty members in Chinese and Japanese higher education institutions ranked passion as a more important evaluative criterion in student selection than did their counterparts in American institutions; across 24 societies, country-level individualism negatively predicted teachers’ self-reported practices of upregulating their students’ intrinsic motivation, as indexed by self-efficacy, value, and interest. These findings suggest that, despite its lower observed value in predicting performance in collectivistic than in individualistic contexts, intrinsic motivation is nevertheless perceived to be more important for both predicting and influencing others’ behavior in collectivistic contexts. Rather than negating previous evidence on cultural differences in the predictive value of intrinsic motivation, our results offer a complementary picture of cultural differences in its perceived value and call for more nuanced interpretations of the roles that passion, interest, and other forms of intrinsic motivation play in collectivistic societies.",

Here we report two experiments with 62 Norwegian children attending Grade 2 and 141 in Grade 5 using a modified version of the visual world paradigm with masked flanked visual word targets. Compared to a baseline condition with no flankers, we found that the presence of flanking words or unfamiliar-font strings strongly interfered with lexical activation of the foveated target word; in contrast, strings of repeated symbols had no effect. The results were very similar for the two grades, except that the more advanced readers also exhibited an interaction of flanking condition with target word frequency, specifically, smaller frequency effects when flanked by words. The findings indicate that adjacent stimuli are to some extent simultaneously processed along with the foveated word and strongly interfere with it, from the earliest stages and throughout reading development. We propose that management of interference from adjacent words is a major factor modulating the development and expression of reading skill.",

Cognitive Bias Modification for Appraisals (CBM-APP) aims to train patients to make more functional trauma-related appraisals and has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms. However, little is known about how this training affects the functional interrelations among symptoms and cognitive appraisals. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involving 77 adult patients diagnosed with PTSD (CBM-APP: n = 37; control training: n = 40), we applied cross-sectional network analysis to examine changes in the structure and centrality of associations among PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, hyperarousal) and trauma-related cognitive measures. To capture multiple levels of cognitive processing, we included responses during a scenario task (reflective, idiosyncratic, spontaneous appraisals) and the Implicit Association Test (automatic self-associations). Four Gaussian Graphical Models were estimated (pre-/post-training × CBM-APP vs. control group). While overall network connectivity did not differ significantly across networks, descriptive patterns indicated that Alterations in Cognition and Mood emerged as the most central node in both groups at post-training assessment. Further, in the CBM-APP group, the centrality of implicit trauma-related associations decreased pre- to post-training, suggesting potential decoupling of automatic negative self-associations from symptom activation. Given the small sample and moderate network stability, findings are preliminary but suggest that CBM-APP may influence the relational structure of PTSD symptoms and cognitions, offering insight into putative mechanisms of cognitive therapeutic change.",

          "authors": "Marie Jakob; Raphael Hartmann; Karl Christoph Klauer; Constantin Gregor Meyer-Grant",
          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) is a highly influential modeling framework for studying decisions under uncertainty, allowing researchers to disentangle two central components of judgment: Discriminability, the ability to accurately distinguish signal from noise, and response bias, the tendency to favor one type of judgment over the other. The present work compares two approaches for analyzing hierarchically-structured SDT data: The commonly-used two-step approach, which is based on independent individual-level SDT estimates, and a maximum likelihood mixed-effects SDT approach, which uses generalized linear mixed models to estimate individual-level parameters based on a joint population distribution. Across three simulation studies, we demonstrate that the two-step approach produces substantial distortions in both single- and multilevel estimates of discriminability, response criterion and differences therein. These distortions depend in complex ways on the true population means, true population differences, the numbers of trials and participants, and dependencies among individual parameters. Crucially, they also lead to inflated Type I error rates for tests of condition differences in both SDT parameters. In contrast, mixed-effects SDT models yielded effectively unbiased parameter recovery, maintained nominal Type I error rates across a broad range of simulated conditions, and provided higher statistical power for detecting differences in discriminability and response criterion. To facilitate the adoption of this approach,we provide an easy-to-use R package called mesdt and an accompanying tutorial.",

Many qualitative studies have characterized these interactions as agency negotiations, yet our understanding of how users negotiate agency with algorithms remains limited. To advance theorizing on user-algorithm interactions, we leverage Principal–Agent Theory—an economic perspective on negotiation scenarios—for interactive communication between users (principals) and algorithmic recommender systems (agents). We explicate the potential of Principal-Agent Theory for the case of short-video apps (e.g., TikTok). Using dyadic agent-based modeling, we examine two widely discussed phenomena: perceptions of responsive algorithms that ‘know’ users, and users’ attempts to curate content by ‘training’ recommenders. By combining a rational choice perspective with computational modeling, we offer a blueprint for critically examining the dynamics of agency in algorithmic media, with implications for further domains such as well-being, privacy, and media governance.",

The symptoms overlap with multiple mental disorders, such as panic disorder, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In assessing emetophobia, cut-offs for the German SPOVI are missing.\nMethod: A total of 145 participants (M = 30.43, SD = 10.35, range: 18-62) were assessed regarding levels of emetophobia, health anxiety, symptoms of panic disorder, and disgust sensitivity. \nResults: Forty-five (31%) participants reported to meet DSM-5 criteria of emetophobia. The single-factor solution fit the data best and showed good reliability and validity. Higher SPOVI 2.0 levels were associated with higher symptoms of panic disorder and higher disgust sensitivity. A cut-off of 23.5 differentiated well between participants meeting diagnostic criteria of emetophobia and these who did not.\nConclusion: The SPOVI 2.0 is a valid and reliable measure to assess symptoms of emetophobia in German samples.",

Responsibility judgments are affected not only by what actually happened, but also by what could have happened if things had turned out differently. Here, we look at how replaceability -- the ease with which a person could have been replaced by someone else -- affects responsibility. We develop the counterfactual replacement model, which runs simulations of alternative scenarios to determine the probability that the outcome would have differed if the person of interest had been replaced. The model predicts that a person is held more responsible, the more difficult it would have been to replace them. To test the model's predictions, we design a paradigm that quantitatively varies replaceability by manipulating the number of replacements and the probability with which each replacement would have been available. Across three experiments featuring increasingly complex scenarios, we show that the model explains participants' responsibility judgments well in both social and physical settings, and better than alternative models that rely only on features of what actually happened.",

          "abstract": "Museums are increasingly shifting from passive spaces of display to active sites of learning where knowledge is co-created through material and social engagement. This chapter examines how models and modelling can serve as powerful mediators of understanding in museum education, bridging conceptual knowledge and embodied experience. We first synthesise key theoretical traditions, i.e. experience-based learning, constructionism, tinkering, makerspaces, object-based, model-based learning, etc., to clarify how these approaches conceptualise modelling as a form of “learning by making.” Despite widespread assumptions about its benefits, empirical research on modelling in museums remains largely qualitative, case-based, and fragmented, leaving causal mechanisms underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a Factorial Mixed methods (FM) paradigm, an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental design with qualitative inquiry “in the wild” of real museum contexts. This paradigm allows for controlled, systematic testing of educational variables while preserving ecological validity. We illustrate the FM approach through a field experiment at Steno Museum involving 152 eighth-grade students participating in astronomy workshops. Using a 2×2 factorial design, we varied two key factors, physical modelling and social interaction, to examine their individual and combined effects on learning, engagement, and enjoyment. The results showed that both factors independently enhanced learning and that their combination produced an additive effect, yielding greater outcomes than either factor alone. Qualitative observations further revealed how collaborative model-building fostered deeper conceptual reflection, creativity, and embodied understanding. Together, these findings provide rare causal evidence that modelling and social collaboration jointly enhance learning in museum settings. The chapter concludes by outlining how the FM paradigm can advance a more generalisable, experimentally grounded science of modelling across museums and disciplines.",

          "authors": "Ryuhei Yasuda; Kyoshiro Sasaki",
          "abstract": "Sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling that one’s actions cause environmental changes. A previous study showed that SoA is enhanced when keypress-triggered motion stimuli move faster, suggesting that SoA depends on the extent of action outcomes. We examined whether the numerical magnitude of action outcomes similarly affects SoA. Participants pressed a key, which triggered the presentation of dots (Experiments 1–2) or digit values (Experiment 3), and then rated their SoA on a 10-point scale. Results showed that SoA ratings increased with greater numerical magnitude. However, Experiment 4, using an intentional binding paradigm, found that the interval between the keypress and dot onset was perceived as longer when more dots were presented. This contradicts Experiments 1–3 and suggests the observed SoA enhancement might stem from response bias (e.g., higher numerical magnitude of the outcomes leading to higher values in the rating/estimating phase). To test this, Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 2 with a reversed rating scale (1 = strongest, 10 = weakest) and again found higher scores with greater magnitude, supporting the response bias account. In contrast, the effect of motion speed was unaffected by rating direction, suggesting a genuine influence on SoA. These findings highlight the importance of carefully distinguishing true effects from mere response biases when evaluating how outcome magnitude influences SoA.",

          "abstract": "Dignity is central to how we treat each other. Whereas philosophical theories argue that violating someone’s dignity distinctively involves humiliation, it is unknown how people actually identify violations of dignity, casting doubt on whether dignity is a distinct value that can meaningfully guide action. Here, we propose a new hypothesis, where violations are recognised as dignity-related when they target attributes that are stigmatised and that victims plausibly and immutably hold. Participants (N = 277) performed a novel task; they rated a set of textual vignettes describing a ‘perpetrator’ making offensive remarks to a ‘victim’ on how well each offensive remark corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. Before rating, participants were informed (across 3 within-subject conditions) whether the attribute targeted by the offence was immutable, improvable, or absent. After completing the main ratings, participants also reported how stigmatised the offence-targeted attributes are in their society. Our hypotheses, methods, and analyses were preregistered. Comparing across within-subject conditions, we found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that the plausibility and immutability increase how much the violations relate to dignity. Using Bayesian general linear mixed models, we also found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that perceptions of the offence-targeted attributes as stigmatised predict increases in dignity-relatedness. These findings are first to provide empirical anchors for a distinct ethics of dignity. Our implications include evidence-based actionable guidelines for treating people with dignity that can be used to promote ethical practice in organisations and service industries.",

          "authors": "Sepehrdad Rahimian",
          "abstract": "Despite notable empirical advances, the science of consciousness lacks firm conceptual footing. Competing theories not only disagree on mechanisms but also define consciousness in mutually incompatible ways, and criteria for evaluating theoretical success remain vague. I argue that this situation arises from a lack of pragmatic pressure within the field. Theories are rewarded for offering ever more elaborate explanations of “consciousness-as-such” rather than for solving concrete, real-world problems. This paper proposes a pragmatic shift. Rather than beginning with metaphysical commitments about what consciousness truly is, scientific inquiry should focus on developing models that demonstrably advance well-defined objectives. Such an approach does not deny the possibility that consciousness includes aspects beyond scientific access; it takes a neutral stance toward that possibility, holding that scientific practice must be guided by problems with pragmatic relevance and clear criteria of success. Drawing on analogies from stock-market trading and examples from the history of science, I suggest that scientific progress does not require a single, final ontology. Newtonian mechanics and relativity, for instance, present incompatible pictures of space and time, yet both function effectively within their domains. Likewise, consciousness research can proceed under an ontologically pluralist framework, enabling genuine scientific progress rather than endless theoretical disputes.",

          "abstract": "Health policy is motivated by a variety of factors including moral concerns, values and convictions. Policymakers are motivated to consider how constituents and those directly impacted by policies will react to the policies they enact. Thus, it is advantageous for policymakers to understand the psychological processes that shape constituents’ reactions toward health policies. We outline how and when policymakers and constituents are motivated to empathize, moralize, and compromise on divisive health policies, such as opioid-related policies, by considering the motivational frameworks of empathy and the plurality of moral values that inform attitudes. We offer insight for policymakers balancing tradeoffs between different moral values and concerns, suggesting that policymakers should consider cultivating an active dialogue around the relevant moral emotions felt by both supporters and opponents. For example, when considering syringe services programs, supporters and opponents may both be motivated by the moral concern of harm––as supporters may see services as preventing infections and keeping people healthy, while opponents may see services as promoting drug use and in turn, harmful health outcomes. We suggest that such a morally pluralistic effort will (1) highlight moral alignment amongst supporters to cultivate collective resolve and (2) acknowledge the competing moral concerns of opponents so that they feel understood and in turn, feel more willing to understand competing perspectives. While leaning into moral emotions may feel like a turn toward divisiveness, we suggest that acknowledging the plurality of moral values at stake sets the foundation for support and compromise.",

          "abstract": "Prominent theories of visual search state that goal-relevant information is maintained in working memory (WM) to guide attention to relevant, searched-for items. Prioritization from WM is sufficiently strong to direct attention towards items that are irrelevant to current search goals. These ‘incidental capture’ results have typically been observed when remembering color or shape stimuli, but, in principle, should similarly occur using other strong guiding features such as motion. However, recent work suggests that neural representations of remembered motion directions are transformed into spatial coordinates. If so, then remembered stimuli which can easily be spatially recoded (e.g., remembered motion direction) should not interfere with visual search when feature-matching distractors are present any more than interference caused by a salient distractor that does not match the contents of WM. We replicated the traditional incidental capture finding for color: distractors matching the remembered color captured attention more than feature singletons. In contrast, when participants were required to remember a motion direction, capture was equal across distractor conditions: salient distractors captured attention, but no additional capture was observed when the remembered motion direction matched the distracting motion direction. Intriguingly, responses were faster when the search target was at a location that neural studies predict would be prioritized if remembered motion was spatially recoded. Our results indicate that some features in WM are more likely to impact attentional processing than others and that this difference in attentional capture between feature dimensions may emerge due to the ability to reformat memory representations.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a marker of deficient socioemotional processing linked to severe conduct problems. Although resting-state studies implicate altered large-scale network organization in CU traits, few have comprehensively examined connectivity both within and between the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks and none have done so across development in large samples. Methods. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,868, 48% female), we examined associations between CU traits and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between the DMN, FPN, and SN with repeated timepoints (4) across youth spanning 9 to 18 years-old. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess main effects of CU traits along with moderators of age and sex, and sensitivity analyses included covariates for co-occurring psychopathology. Results. CU traits were associated with reduced within-DMN rsFC. No interactions between CU traits and sex were found, but an interaction between CU traits and age emerged, showing a negative association between CU traits and DMN-SN rsFC was evident in mid-to-late adolescence, with higher-CU youth showing an age-related decline in DMN-SN rsFC. Conclusions. These findings suggest youth with elevated CU traits exhibit atypical development of resting-state connectivity in networks crucial for empathy and salience processing. Specifically, youth with elevated CU traits showed persistent DMN hypoconnectivity and a later-emerging but accelerated age-related segregation of DMN-SN connectivity during adolescence. This pattern may reflect delayed yet ultimately exaggerated differentiation of socioaffective networks, highlighting adolescence as a developmental window for interventions targeting socioemotional functioning.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the proposed regulatory changes by the College of Psychologists and Behaviour Analysts of Ontario (CPBAO), which seek to modernize entry-to-practice standards for psychologists and psychological associates in the province. The analysis places Ontario’s changing regulatory environment within the broader Canadian context, comparing provincial standards, training pathways, and workforce availability. Using empirical data, stakeholder feedback, and consensus reports, this manuscript examines evidence to test three implied hypotheses of the proposed changes: 1) they will increase the number of psychologists in Ontario, 2) they will improve access to psychological services, and 3) they will not elevate the risk to public safety as practitioner competence will remain the same. Findings suggest that lowering entry standards and shifting from external accreditation to a college-approved process are unlikely to significantly increase access to psychologists. Evidence does not support the view that competence will remain unchanged among trainees from programs that substantially deviate from accredited models. Removing evaluative regulations may allow some less-prepared individuals into practice. An evidence-based, data-driven approach grounded in transparent consultation and continuous evaluation is recommended to ensure that regulatory changes genuinely improve access to competent psychological care across both Ontario and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains limited by reliance on cognitive symptoms that appear only after significant neurodegeneration has occurred. Although the traditional memory-first model assumes that early pathology begins in medial temporal lobe structures, growing evidence shows that initial decline often emerges in distributed association cortices that support sensory processing, perceptual integration, motor planning, timing precision, executive control, and affective regulation. These findings motivate the AD Spectrum Hypothesis, which proposes that early AD manifests through heterogeneous combinations of sensory, perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional changes rather than a uniform trajectory of episodic memory loss. To evaluate whether existing behavioral tasks capture this multidomain variability, we reviewed studies comparing healthy controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with early AD using the Sensation, Perception, Action, Cognition, Emotion (SPACE) framework. Across modalities, MCI and early AD showed graded impairments in anticipatory motor control, gait dynamics, speech acoustics, visuomotor organization, fine-motor timing, perceptual stability, and emotional modulation. These findings indicate that early AD affects multiple functional systems and is most sensitively detected by tasks that engage several SPACE domains simultaneously. Based on this evidence, we propose a multidomain behavioral battery as a promising noninvasive approach for improving early detection of AD.",

Controlled sleep manipulations, such as restricted and extended sleep, were included in the protocol to challenge the devices’ algorithms under varied levels of difficulty. Performance evaluation followed a standardised framework incorporating both epoch-by-epoch and discrepancy analyses to assess multi-class sleep-staging performance and agreement across key sleep parameters. Epoch-by-epoch accuracy  and  Cohen’s κ  were  as  follows:  sleep² -Polar  VS  =  83.7%  (κ  =  0.76), sleep²-Polar H10 = 84.04% (κ = 0.76), Oura Ring 3 = 72.5% (κ = 0.59), Apple Watch Series 9 = 72.3% (κ = 0.56), Fitbit Charge 6 = 66.16% (κ = 0.47), Garmin Vivoactive 6 &amp; Venu 3 = 63.4% (κ = 0.41), WHOOP 4 = 65.15% (κ = 0.48), and Circul+ = 55.59% (κ = 0.33). Discrepancy analysis revealed systematic and proportional biases across CST devices: most wrist-worn devices overestimated sleep time and underestimated wake after sleep onset, with error magnitude increasing drastically in atypical nights characterised by fragmented, restricted, or extended sleep. Cardiac-derived arm- and chest-band sleep² derived sleep metrics showed minor deviation from PSG, whereas Oura devices exhibited moderate but variable levels of bias. Overall, these findings reveal substantial variability across CST and highlight the importance of standardised bench marking to support the scientific and clinical use of wearable-derived sleep macrostructure.",

We evaluated probability nomograms and machine learning (ML) algorithms (logistic regression, LASSO, SVM, random forest) on accuracy, calibration, and generalizability for predicting current ODD or CD diagnoses. \n\nMethod: Youth aged 5–18 receiving outpatient care were recruited from academic (n=622) and community (n=506) clinics. Predictors included demographics, comorbid diagnoses, mood and behavioral indicators. The criterion was K-SADS diagnoses of ODD/CD. Models were trained in the academic sample, using the community sample for external validation. AUC quantified accuracy, Spiegelhalter's z indexed calibration, and cross-site performance measured generalizability. \n\nResults: For ODD prediction, the nomogram selected CBCL Aggression as the strongest predictor and reached AUC≈.70 in both samples. ML models achieved good discrimination (AUC≈.86) with good-to-moderate calibration in the academic sample, deteriorating to fair accuracy with severe miscalibration in the community setting. For CD prediction, the nomogram built on CBCL Rule-Breaking showed good accuracy (AUC≈.82) in both samples.

          "abstract": "Prior research has shown that drawing, tracing, and describing at encoding are beneficial strategies for improving subsequent visual object recognition. It is unclear whether these strategies are also beneficial for the binding of object features in visual memory and how their benefits may vary with age. In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding. For both groups, tracing was not beneficial for feature binding. Overall, these results show that the optimal learning strategy depends on the way the information will be tested and the learner population.",

          "authors": "Hynek Cígler",
          "abstract": "Reversed publication bias—the idea that politically sensitive findings may be selectively suppressed in favor of null effects—has recently gained attention in public and online discussions. Roth et al.’s (2015) meta-analysis of the association between intelligence and school grades (ρ = .54) has been frequently cited as supposed evidence, because its funnel plots appear to show larger correlations in studies with smaller sampling error. However, this study demonstrates that the pattern is entirely spurious. Reanalysis of the original data reveals that the asymmetry arises from the use of the conditional standard error of the correlation coefficient, which depends on the observed value of r and mechanically induces funnel-plot skew. When more appropriate methods, such as Fisher’s z-transformation with unconditional standard errors, are applied, the asymmetry disappears and Egger’s test becomes nonsignificant, t(238) = −1.41, p = .160. A complementary simulation study further confirms that conditional-error weighting can generate strong false signals of reversed publication bias and inflate total effect-size estimates even when no bias is present. Overall, these findings provide no evidence for reversed publication bias in research on intelligence and school grades. Using conditional standard errors of raw correlation coefficients in meta-analyses should be completely avoided.",

          "authors": "Robin Carhart-Harris",
          "abstract": "Introduced in 2014 and revised in 2018, the entropic brain hypothesis has accrued a wealth of supportive evidence. The hypothesis states that— along a dimension of breadth of conscious experience— ‘expansive states’ reliably exhibit increased brain entropy whereas the inverse applies for states of no or reduced consciousness. Examples of expansive states include those of expert meditation, flicker light stimulation, the near-death experience, atypical breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep, the pre-ictal aura, unmedicated early psychosis and psychedelic drug states. Example states of no or reduced consciousness with low brain entropy, include disorders of consciousness, deep sleep, the anesthetized state, seizure, post-stroke, ageing, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disorders. It is shown here that the entropic brain has convergent, correlative, predictive, discriminative and external validity. Regarding its predictive validity, increased brain entropy under psilocybin predicts subsequent improvements in mental health (improved well-being 1-month post-dose). Regarding its discriminative validity, changes in brain entropy selectively index the breadth of subjective experience versus alternative dimensions, such as arousal. Regarding portability/external validity, an entropy (temperature) function is used in generative artificial intelligence. In conclusion, the entropic brain is proving to be a useful model of conscious states.",

          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making—where users retain responsibility for the final decision but receive input from algorithms prior to or during the judgment process—has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

          "authors": "Elle Liemandt; Meghann Johnson; Megan Smith; David Scott Yeager",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ romantic relationships are consistently rated as some of their most stressful experiences, ranging from breakups to decoding subtle cues on social media. Most adolescents turn to friends (74%) as well as parents (69%) for help. In parallel, nearly 75% of U.S. teens have experimented with Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs). Here we report a preregistered [osf.io/md2ek], randomized experiment (N=404 adolescents aged 13-17) to compare the quality of relationship advice from parents against that generated by LLMs. In a within-subjects, repeated-measures design, participants read three realistic dating conflict scenarios, each drawn from a popular relationship advice application, and then read advice about how to respond. The advice was randomly assigned (and counter-balanced) to either an LLM or a parent. The LLM-provided advice was split into two sources: a fine-tuned LLM (AskElle) that was trained to provide relationship advice or an off-the-shelf LLM (either ChatGPT or Gemini). Participants then rated the responses for help with coping, likelihood of implementation, and trustworthiness. Data were analyzed using a random-intercept model estimated with a Bayesian, machine-learning method (stochtree). The LLMs outperformed parents’ advice by approximately 0.3 standard deviations across the primary outcomes, all pr(ATE&gt;0)&gt;.99. The fine-tuned LLM was just as effective as the off-the-shelf LLMs, when averaging across the three trials. Secondary analyses (see Figure 1) showed that participants preferred the off-the-shelf LLMs when they were the first piece of advice they saw, pr(Diff)&gt;.99. But they strongly preferred the fine-tuned LLM when it was third or after repeated exposure. Once participants could directly compare all three sources, they overwhelmingly preferred the fine-tuned LLM’s advice, pr(Diff)&gt;.99 over both parents and off-the-shelf LLMs. Thus in real-world contexts, with repeated consultation of an AI tool, generic advice from an LLM is likely to become less effective with adolescents seeking more attuned relationship advice. Qualitative, natural-language analyses identified elements of the advice that were most and least successful. Parents’ language tended to diminish adolescents’ feelings, dismissing their relationship problems as temporary and superficial. Off-the-shelf LLMs were overly accommodating and affirming, sometimes reinforcing more extreme appraisals and possibly entrenching young people in harmful patterns of rumination. The highest-performing answers validated participants’ feelings while challenging their appraisals of the situation, leading teens to a more optimistic appraisal, accompanied by clear action steps with example scripts.",

          "abstract": "Higher education is widely believed to have a liberalizing effect on students, yet empirical findings are mixed. In two studies (total N = 483,885), we investigated the “diploma divide” in the United States. In the past half-century, we found that adults with more education have consistently held more left-leaning views on social but not economic issues. Before the 2010s, however, there were no meaningful, educational differences in the degree to which people identified as liberal versus conservative. In the years since, college graduates have increasingly identified as liberal, while those with some or no college education remained steady. Moreover, in the mid-1990s, students did not come to identify as more left-leaning during their time in higher education. However, they have increasingly done so in the years since. Such within-person changes differ across fields of study, demographics, and other individual characteristics, but are minimally related to the kinds of institutions that students attend. Overall, these findings reveal a striking change in the relationship between higher education and political identity. They also undermine sweeping claims about liberalizing effects of education, calling instead for fine-grained theories about how, when, and for whom attending higher education affects which aspects of ideology.",

          "abstract": "Conversation requires rapid and efficient language processing, which in turn depends on a high degree of automatization. Yet, it remains unclear how such automatization develops in languages that are typically not used for spoken communication, such as Latin. In an online learning experiment, we examined how time pressure and strict linear reading influence sentence processing in Latin. Two groups of participants received identical training materials but differed in these two factors during the learning phase. The results showed that time pressure facilitated automatization in the retrieval and evaluation of linguistic cues (subject animacy and argument order), but it also made it more difficult to override automatized routines when processing semantically unacceptable sentences containing animacy violations. In addition, strict linear reading enhanced incremental and predictive processing, particularly for verb initial sentences. These findings indicate that time pressure and linear reading support the development of efficient processing routines in Latin, highlighting their potential role in optimizing second language learning strategies even for non spoken languages.",

Specifically, utilizing data from 443 bilingual participants from 11 diverse L1 backgrounds reading 12 English (L2) texts, we investigated 1) the stability of individual reading strategies across texts, 2) cross-linguistic influences of the first language (L1), 3) correspondences between L1 and L2 eye-movement behavior, and 4) the relationship between global reading strategies, L2 comprehension, and L2 proficiency. The analyses that employed the scasim method to quantify scanpath (dis)similarity, that is, how similar global reading strategies are within and between participants and across languages, revealed that individual L2 reading behavior was consistent across L2 texts, but L1 scanpaths did not reliably predict L2 scanpaths. L1 background left a weak but detectable imprint on L2 scanpaths. Finally, global L2 reading behavior was significantly associated with L2 comprehension accuracy and proficiency, with more typical scanpaths linked to better comprehension and higher proficiency. We discuss the results in relation to traditional word-level analyses in L2 reading and emphasize the added value of a scanpath-based approach for assessing global reading behavior cross-linguistically.",

These emotions are theorized to originate from the interplay between early parent-infant interactions and personal temperamental predisposition. However, little is known about their early ontogeny. In this preregistered longitudinal study, we examined the developmental and socialization factors contributing to the emergence of self-conscious emotions: focusing on infants’ reactions to social exposure, a known elicitor of these emotions. Infants participated in a social exposure task, in which they were lavishly complimented in four situations at six-months (N=103) and 15-months (N=77). At the six-month measurement, mother–infant dyads also engaged in two interaction tasks coded for mind-mindedness and positive affective synchrony, and mothers reported on infant temperament. Self-conscious emotional reactions were indexed through coy smiling – a smile accompanied by head and/or gaze aversion. Results showed strong evidence for an effect of time, with six-month-olds displaying more coy smiles than 15-month-olds. Higher negative temperament predicted fewer coy smiles across both measurements. No effects of mind-mindedness or positive affective synchrony were found. These findings suggest that the first self-conscious emotions emerge early in infancy and may be initially shaped primarily by temperamental predispositions, rather than socialization.",

          "authors": "Johanna Funk; Florian Hintz",
          "abstract": "Adults acquire new words, including written and spoken forms across the lifespan. Learning novel words is a dynamic process that progresses from initial familiarization through consolidation towards lexicalization. These processes exhibit substantial interindividual variability. In this study, we leverage this variability to investigate the mechanisms that characterize different learning stages, focusing on the distinct contributions of domain-specific linguistic and domain-general skills.\nAcross three sessions distributed over three weeks, 140 native German participants learned Mandarin Chinese spoken and written (Pinyin) word forms and were tested on the retention of the new knowledge. Additionally, participants completed nine tests assessing linguistic experience, processing speed, auditory and visual short-term memory, and nonverbal reasoning.\nStructural equation modeling, including latent growth curve analysis, revealed that the acquisition and linking of word forms was primarily shaped by domain-general skills: Processing speed supported word form learning at all stages, while auditory short-term memory supported initial but not later learning. A weaker association to linguistic experience was observed in exploratory network analyses with links between receptive vocabulary at all and spelling at initial stages of learning.\nThese findings highlight that learning is conditioned by how fast and efficient incoming information are processed, and that initial learning is constrained by short-term memory capacity. Consistent with the Complementary Learning Systems account, this points towards distinct stages of learning with effortful and controlled processing at early familiarization stages, and more automatic processing at later consolidation-associated stages. The findings suggest that learners may benefit from tailoring initial input to individual memory capacity.",

This illusory shift can be as large as the distance the frame moves, making it one of the most significant position shift illusions. The frame effect persists under many variations of the frame’s shape and motion trajectories, suggesting a position encoding mechanism that relies on relative location rather than motion. With one exception (the double-drift), motion-induced position shifts produce similar effects on saccadic eye movements and perception. Here, we compare the effect of a moving frame on perception and on saccades across spatial and temporal variations of the frame and the probe. The first experiment showed that saccades targeting the probes were displaced by only about a third of the shift seen for the perception of the probe. A second experiment showed that this difference was constant across a large range of frame speeds. These results add novel evidence in support of dissociable position representations for perception and action.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

Negative moral behaviors led to stronger inferences of low ability than negative ability behaviors led to inferences of immorality (i.e., asymmetric Horn effect). No asymmetry emerged for positive behaviors (i.e., symmetric Halo effects). Experiments 2a-2b confirmed the asymmetric Horn effect and showed it was stronger for extreme versus moderate negative behaviors. Experiment 3 showed that immoral behaviors elicited more perceived threat than unable behaviors, which partly explained the asymmetric horn effect.

Cognitive Control Training (CCT), particularly the internet-delivered adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (aPASAT), has shown promise in preventing relapse, yet its health economic value has not been evaluated. This study assessed the cost-utility of adding aPASAT to treatment as usual (TAU) for adults in remission from major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nMethods\n\nA Markov state-transition model simulated a hypothetical cohort of Belgian adults aged 18-65 years in remission from MDD over a five-year time horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Model parameters were mainly derived from published literature. Outcomes included incremental costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and incremental monetary benefit (INMB). Uncertainty was evaluated using one-way sensitivity, two-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5,000 simulations), and multiple deterministic scenario analyses.\n\nResults\n\nIn the base case, aPASAT + TAU dominated TAU alone, yielding additional QALYs (Δ = 2192) and lower healthcare costs (Δ = –€77.38M), resulting in an INMB of €182.6M at a €48,000 per QALY threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 99.9% probability of cost-effectiveness. Scenario analyses varying adherence, coverage, remission prevalence, and time horizon consistently confirmed cost savings and improved health outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nInternet-delivered CCT using the aPASAT appears to be a cost-effective strategy for preventing MDD relapse. Its low-cost and fully unguided format supports scalable integration into stepped, prevention-oriented mental healthcare systems.",

Despite this, quantitative research on this population remains extremely scarce, with less than a handful of studies looking at the impact of post-migration stressors. This critical review examines the existing literature to identify a methodological gap where current quantitative approaches fail to capture the structural and psychosocial hardships documented in qualitative research, such as retraumatizing asylum processes, intersectional discrimination, and exclusion from both home and host communities. To address this, the article proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating Minority Stress Theory with the taxonomy of Social Identity Threat. This model delineates both distal and proximal stressors mapped with SOGIE refugee experiences. It concludes by outlining measurable domains aligned with best practices for scale development, providing a foundational framework for future quantitative research to validate these stressors and improve culturally sensitive mental health care for SOGIE refugees.",

IV is enabled by an instrument – a third variable that affects the outcome only through its influence on the hypothesized cause. One way to study causal effects in psychology is thus the random assignment of an intervention that drives change in the cause of interest but is otherwise unrelated to the outcome, followed by IV analysis to produce a valid causal effect. Moreover, IV regression models can be estimated straightforwardly as structural equation models (SEMs). Based on open data from a recently published study in the economics literature, this tutorial outlines the use of SEM to estimate the causal effect of a behavior of interest, exercise, on an outcome of interest, academic performance, enabled by an instrument –  a randomly-distributed free gym card – that constitutes a random, non-binding manipulation of exercise. The role of covariates in IV is discussed, and R code is provided for all analyses.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been identified as a technological revolution for the next decade (Kelly et al., 2023), with the potential to improve human life in several domains. The present study analyses the factors influencing AI acceptance in adults. A quantitative synthesis based on Kelly et al. (2023) was conducted using one-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling (OSMASEM; Jak et al., 2021).\nA total of 40 studies comprising 36,403 subjects were included, yielding 43 correlation matrices and 110 correlation coefficients. The OSMASEM results support a dual-pathway model to AI acceptance: perceived usefulness (PU) is a strong predictor of trust in AI (TR) (β31 = .75, p &lt; .001), which in turn predicts behavioral intention (BI) (β53 = .43, p &lt; .001). Concurrently, performance expectancy (PE) predicts attitudes towards AI (ATT) (β42 = .75, p &lt; .001), which also predicts BI (β54 = .40, p &lt; .001). TR and ATT mediate positive relationships between PU (β51 = .32, p &lt; .001) and BI, and between PE (β52 = .30, p &lt; .001) and BI.\nThis review contributes to understanding the factors influencing AI acceptance. In practical terms, these findings emphasize the importance of internal factors such as TR and ATT, alongside conventional acceptance factors (PU, PE). The need for further research in this area is highlighted, with the recommendation to employ specific AI acceptance models.\nThese results suggest that while core cognitive evaluations (PU, PE) remain crucial, their influence is channeled through more proximal affective and relational constructs (TR, ATT) indicating a potential evolution from traditional technology acceptance frameworks when applied to AI.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered experiment examined the feasibility of administering psychological scales in two novel dichotomous touchscreen-focused response formats inspired by the swipe-based interface known from dating apps: the textual Swipe scale and the Swipe-Video scale using short AI-avatar videos. We compared them to a standard dichotomous Likert scale in an online US sample (N = 602). A strict measurement invariance was established across all the administration methods. The influence of the administration methods on internal consistency, criterion validity, and nonresponse rates was nonsignificant. Swipe-Video was much slower than both other methods; the textual Swipe scale was only slightly slower than the Likert format. Respondents’ ratings of enjoyment, ease-of-use, and intention-to-use did not differ significantly across methods. Overall, swipe-based dichotomous formats – including the AI video-based administration – appear viable alternatives to a standard dichotomous Likert scale leading to equivalent scale scores, albeit with longer completion times, particularly for video administration.",

          "abstract": "Adult aging is associated with a decline in memory for the specific details of past experiences, but the reasons for these declines remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we consider the potential of computational process models of memory to reveal mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory specificity. We define empirical benchmarks in the most widely used tasks for studying age differences in memory -- recognition and free recall. We then systematically review two broad classes of process models -- global matching and retrieved context models -- that are well-suited to explaining these benchmarks. We discuss and at times illustrate through simulations how age differences in memory specificity can arise from different mechanisms in these models, such as reductions in encoding fidelity, cue-selectivity of retrieval, contextual reinstatement, or retrieval monitoring. These models hold great promise for uncovering the latent mechanisms of age-related memory change, but several explanatory shortcomings must be addressed for a more comprehensive theory to emerge. Because process models often incorporate simplifying shortcuts, they risk advancing descriptive rather than mechanistic explanations for age differences in memory. Furthermore, models that have identified multiple processes of age-related memory impairment have left unaddressed the ways in which these processes affect each other.  By illuminating these and other challenges in current process models, our review aims to stimulate future advances that can dramatically reshape our understanding of the processes of age-related changes in memory specificity.",

Guided by theories of femmephobia and dirty femininity, we explored cisgender men’s perceptions of menstruation in the workplace in three European countries: Croatia, Germany, and Italy. Semi-structured interviews with 21 cisgender men workers were thematically analyzed, uncovering pervasive beliefs and attitudes that sustain and reproduce menstrual stigma. Participants mostly characterized menstruation as taboo and irrelevant to the workplace. They felt disinterested and even uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain private and hidden, especially at work. They acknowledged that menstruating colleagues were framed as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing misogynist and femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation. To promote inclusive workspaces, interventions should foster dialogue and build empathy.",

For the Attitude scale, a two-factor solution emerged, distinguish-ing Enthusiastic and Cautious Attitudes. Both Attitude subscales demonstrated good model fit and reliability. Latent correlations revealed expected associations: Knowledge and Use were moderately positively correlated; Enthusiastic Attitudes were strongly associated with Use, while a moderately strong correlation was observed between Cautious Attitudes and Knowledge. Exploratory analyses indicated higher Enthusiastic Attitudes in boys and higher Knowledge, Use, and Cautious Attitudes scores in older students.

          "abstract": "Research on the underrepresentation of women in academia and other professions indicates that women may be underrepresented in fields associated with intrinsic aptitude (or “brilliance”) because women are stereotyped as not possessing brilliance. At the same time, women may be less likely to pursue careers in such fields because few women are in them, highlighting the importance of understanding the role of gender representation. Across four studies (N = 1680), we found that people have knowledge of the male-female breakdown of employees for a broad range of occupations (Study 1) and that current gender demographics predict interest and belonging in hypothetical advertised employment (Studies 2-4). The effect of gender demographics was robust, even prioritized over messaging about ability, particularly among women (Study 2 &amp; 3), and scaling parametrically according to the ratio of male and female employees (Study 4). Especially among women, professions with more females elicited greater interest and feelings of belonging than those with more males, even when those professions were associated with brilliance. These findings suggest that altering beliefs about brilliance for success in specific professions, though important, may be insufficient for increasing female representation in fields where women are underrepresented. Instead, increasing future female representation may benefit from increasing the presence of more women now.",

          "abstract": "Most parents lie to their children. Parental lying has been linked to parent-child relationship quality and children’s social and moral development, underscoring the importance of accurately measuring this behavior. Existing instruments primarily assess prevalence, rely on a narrow conceptualization of parental lying, and their psychometric properties remain understudied. This study therefore introduces the Parental Lying Scenarios Scale (PLSS), a 40 item self-report instrument measure of parental lying prevalence and frequency across a broad range of parental lies. We assess its test-retest reliability, convergent and predictive validity, and factor structure. \nData were collected from Dutch parents of children aged 5-12 years (n = 247 for test-retest reliability and factor analysis; n = 316 for validity analyses). The PLSS demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and evidence for convergent and predictive validity. Exploratory Factor Analyses at two timepoints consistently identified two distinct factors: lying to influence children’s behavior and lying to shape children’s knowledge or emotions.\nThis study provides initial support for the PLSS as a reliable and conceptually meaningful instrument for capturing a broader range of parental lying. The PLSS thereby offers a promising methodological foundation for future research on the antecedents and socio-moral implications of parental lying for both parents and children.",

          "abstract": "Background: Phantom Phone Signals (PPS) are false perceptions that a smartphone has vibrated or made a sound. PPS are typically non-distressing, non-disruptive hallucinations. Increased PPS likelihood is linked to frequent and problematic phone use, mood, anxiety and hallucination-proneness. This study aimed to investigate the role of resilience, delusion-proneness, and metacognition on PPS.\nMethod: This online, self-report, questionnaire study included 265 participants (mean age: 19.74; 84.2% female, no experience of psychosis). Participants completed the Phantom Phone Experiences and Appraisal Scale (PPEAS) to assess PPS, along with the Problematic Use of Mobile Phone Scale (PUMP), Resilience Scale (RS-14), Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ), Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI-21), and Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale (MSAS).\nResults: PPS were prevalent, with 86.8% of participants reporting at least one phantom phone experience. These experiences were generally infrequent, non-distressing, and non-disruptive, as reflected in low PPEAS Composite Impact Scores (M = 4.25, SD = 3.66). PPS were significantly correlated with Problematic phone use (r = .345), hallucination-proneness (r = .321) and delusional ideation (r =.226), but not resilience or metacognition. Regression analyses indicated that higher MUSEQ and higher PUMP scores were associated with higher odds of experiencing more PPS and explained 18% variance in PPEAS Composite Impact Scores. This direct relationship was not mediated or moderated by resilience or metacognition.\nConclusion: PPS are highly prevalent amongst university students and are primarily a benign experience influenced by problematic phone use and hallucination-proneness. Behavioural interventions may be the most effective approach for reducing PPS where required.",

          "abstract": "Faced with the severe consequences of climate change, organizations are increasingly adopting formal environmental management practices (e.g., ISO 14000) to reduce their ecological footprint. Yet, given the complexity of environmental challenges, voluntary “green” behaviors of employees play a crucial complementary role. These behaviors can be considered as organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE), defined as discretionary, unrewarded individual behaviors contributing to organizations’ environmental management. Empirical research over the past 15 years has addressed the conceptualization, antecedents, and outcomes of OCBE, however, a systematic integration of these findings is still lacking. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review synthesizes evidence from 151 articles across seven databases, offering a comprehensive overview of conceptual and methodological approaches to OCBE. We further summarize extant evidence on antecedents, mediators, moderators, and consequences of OCBE at the individual, team, leadership, organizational, and societal level. Where possible, we meta-analytically aggregate empirical findings. This review culminates in an integrative OCBE framework, outlines future research avenues, discusses methodological limitations, and provides practical recommendations for employees, supervisors, and human resource managers.",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in extended reality (XR) and data modelling present new opportunities for adaptive simulation solutions, which can measure and respond to individual neuropsychological states. However, questions remain about the optimal metrics for real-time data capture and the applicability of these solutions for enhancing user experiences. The present research examined a novel form of adaptive XR, called “prediction-based attention computing” (PbAC), which tailors simulations based on computational models of the brain and, thus, the dynamic sensorimotor processes theorised to underpin human perception and learning. Specifically, this study aimed to demonstrate whether PbAC can adaptively capture users’ internal state predictions and modulate associated neuropsychological responses. To test this, we used an XR-based racquetball paradigm, in which participants were tasked with intercepting virtual balls that emerged from different starting locations. For PbAC conditions, in-situ eye tracking data assessments were utilised to index participant’s prior beliefs and manipulate levels of expectedness (i.e., prediction error) on each trial. Various measures of predictive sensorimotor behaviour were then extracted and compared with data from probability-controlled and matched-order control conditions. Results showed that sensorimotor responses were affected by the expectedness of XR stimuli, and that clear, prediction-related biases emerged within PbAC conditions. The novel computing software also provoked marked surprisal responses on trials designed to elicit high levels of prediction error, and these surprisal effects were similar, or even greater than, those in our comparison conditions. Together, the findings provide proof of concept for PbAC and support its development within future research and technology innovations.",

          "authors": "Antti-Eero Lattula; Leonardo Weiss-Cohen; Christopher R Madan",
          "abstract": "Depending on how information is conveyed, people show different risk preferences. Odds and outcomes could be described (e.g., Option A [90%: £20, 10%: £8] and Option B [certain £18]), where people often overweight rare outcomes [10%: £8]. However, when odds and outcomes are learned through experience (sampling), people tend to underweight rare outcomes, a phenomenon known as the Description-Experience Gap. Previous studies demonstrating these effects have relied on numerical risk representations. However, risk communication could also be visual, using pictographs, which may lead to different preferences due to the integration of elements from both description- and experience-based paradigms and pattern recognition processes. Across two pre-registered experiments, we examined the D-E Gap across numerical and visual risk representations. Participants made risky choices under four within-subjects conditions: (1) Numeric Description—full numeric summary of each lottery; (2) Pictograph Description—lotteries represented with arranged icon arrays; (3) Numeric Sampling—numeric outcomes sampled sequentially; and (4) Pictograph Sampling—outcomes sampled sequentially from icon arrays. We observed a reduced D-E Gap with visual formats—primarily driven by the Pictograph Description. In Experiment 2, we further tested how variations in these conditions, related to attenuating memory reliance (via a visible history of past samples) and sampling effort (via automated sampling), accounted for the between-condition differences. Our results persisted despite these changes—providing new insights into how distinct cognitive processes relate to this risk preference behaviour. Exploratory analyses indicate that observing of all outcomes during sampling had a substantial effect on the magnitude of the D-E gap.",

          "authors": "Corinna Lorenz; Nicola Kristina Ferdinand",
          "abstract": "Understanding why some individuals are more prone to problematic risk-taking requires examining how they process feedback during escalating risk scenarios. Traditional laboratory paradigms fail to capture two critical\naspects of real-world risky behavior: the dynamic nature of risk escalation and the orthogonal manipulation of risk parameters. We addressed these limitations using an ERP-adapted Columbia Card Task (CCT), enabling precise temporal analysis of neural responses as risks accumulate within decision episodes. Twenty-five participants completed the CCT while we recorded EEG, measuring early outcome detection (FRN/RewP, 240-340ms) and later evaluative processing (P3b, 300-500ms). We systematically manipulated gain amounts, loss amounts, and loss probability while examining how individual risk propensity—measured through actual task behavior—predicted neural feedback processing patterns. Critically, rather risk-averse and rather riskprone individuals employed fundamentally different temporal adaptation strategies that emerged dynamically as risks escalated. During early outcome detection, risk-prone participants showed progressive sensitization to negative outcomes across feedback sequences, while risk-averse participants showed habituation. These opposing patterns reversed for positive outcomes. During later evaluation, risk-prone individuals selectively maintained working memory updating for positive outcomes despite accumulating losses, while risk-averse participants enhanced negative outcome processing. These context-dependent effects were most pronounced under specific high-stakes conditions: smaller gains and larger losses amplified group differences in early processing, while probability information revealed that risk-prone individuals showed enhanced neural responses to improbable positive outcomes—providing a mechanism for persistent risk engagement despite unfavorable\nodds. Behavioral results revealed that risk-prone individuals achieved higher efficiency without performance costs, suggesting these neural patterns reflect adaptive individual differences rather than pathological dysfunction. Our findings fundamentally reframe risk propensity as a dynamic regulatory process triggered by escalating risk, with direct implications for identifying vulnerable individuals before maladaptive patterns crystallize.",

Following the analytic template for outcome-wide designs, we conducted a series of country-specific weighted multivariate regression analyses where each Wave 2 outcome was regressed on Wave 1 forgivingness (controlling for Wave 1 sociodemographic and retrospectively recalled childhood variables). Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool country-specific estimates of association for the 56 main outcomes covering psychological, social, physical, volitional, and material dimensions of well-being. We found some evidence of association between forgivingness and higher well-being for both composite well-being indicators and numerous specific indicators across different domains of functioning (observed associations were mostly very small in magnitude). Associations were generally stronger and more consistent for some domains (e.g., psychological well-being) compared to others (e.g., physical health &amp; health behavior). Meta-analyzed estimates of association generally attenuated after using a more conservative analytic approach that additionally adjusted for principal components extracted from the Wave 1 outcomes treated as covariates. Country-specific results showed some cross-national variation. Our findings contribute novel population-level evidence on the potential benefits of forgivingness for different aspects of well-being.",

Neural systems must therefore integrate temporal with representational structure, linking the evolving input with the hierarchical units it instantiates. These operations give rise to two fundamental statistical dependencies in linguistic and neural data: covariance, the instantaneous shared structure across features or recording sites, and temporal dependence, the influence of past states on the present state. As experiments become more naturalistic, neuroimaging and electrophysiological data increasingly express both forms of structure, producing correlated variables and continuous temporal dependencies that complicate interpretation. Because statistical models handle covariance and temporal dependence differently, they support distinct kinds of inference about language-brain mapping. We introduce a Dual-Dependency Taxonomy that classifies modelling approaches by the dependencies they represent. This framework clarifies the linguistic-neural relationships each model family can reveal, the questions they cannot address, and the methodological implications that follow.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nArts on Prescription (AoP) programmes occur within primary care and community settings. The current study extended this to examine the impact of AoP, in secondary care, on patient wellbeing, social connection, and experiences of care.\nMethods:\nA mixed methods design was used. Quantitative data were collected with 61 patients referred to AoP at a UK Hospital, where they received outpatient treatment for cancer, chronic pain, weight management, breathlessness or neuromuscular conditions. Programme-level outcomes assessed wellbeing and loneliness. The immediate wellbeing impact of art workshops was assessed by tracking mood and loneliness. Qualitative data focused on experiences of AoP and were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups (n = 12) and analysed using thematic analysis.\nResults:\nWellbeing scores significantly increased across the programme, alongside reductions in loneliness. Art workshops increased relaxation, contentment, and social connection. The thematic analysis led to four themes: (1) Connection to others – feeling supported, inspired and understood; (2) Making space – providing calm, protected time, and mental respite; (3) Becoming – renewed confidence, and opening to new opportunities; and (4) Clinical implications – reframing relationships with the hospital, validating referrals, and supporting the management of health conditions.\nConclusions:\nAoP in secondary care demonstrates potential as an effective approach, replicating effects in primary care, including improved wellbeing and social connection. However, additional merits in the context of secondary care relate to the ‘hospital-patient’ relationship, and using art to manage health conditions. Embedding AoP within hospital settings may reduce burden on secondary services by supporting psychosocial needs alongside medical care.",

          "authors": "Jil Zippelius; Andreas Czaplicki; Ulrich Hegerl; Gerd Dieter Willmund; Hanna Reich",
          "abstract": "Background\nDepression remains a critical mental health issue in military contexts, where timely recognition and appropriate treatment are essential. Military general practitioners (GPs) in the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) serve as primary gatekeepers for mental health concerns. To strengthen depression management and suicide prevention, the community-based 4-level approach was adapted to the Bundeswehr context and implemented at eight military garrisons. This study explores military GPs’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of the 4-level approach.\nMethods\nSemistructured interviews were conducted with 17 military GPs across eight intervention garrisons, following a 4-hour training on depression recognition, treatment, and the use of digital tools. The interviews were based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF), combining deductive coding and inductive belief statement synthesis. Intercoder reliability was high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.96).\nResults\nEleven of fourteen TDF domains were relevant for implementation. The most significant domain was social influence, particularly concerning the stigma surrounding mental illness. Other key domains included environmental context and resources and professional identity. The key facilitators were a perceived reduction in stigma, active involvement of commanding officers, high clinical relevance of depression and a strong intention to apply the intervention content. The key barriers included persistent stigmatization, time constraints, work-related causes of depression and the variability in perceived relevance of depression across units. \nConclusion\nImplementation of the 4-level approach within the Bundeswehr is shaped by organizational, cultural, and contextual factors. Persistent stigma, high workload, and military-specific stressors impede effective implementation, whereas leadership engagement and the perceived clinical relevance of depression facilitate it. Despite training, some GPs appeared to hold a simplified view of the development of depression, which highlights the need for more tailored training to address misconceptions about depression and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Digital tools are seen as very useful but require better integration into routine clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "To enable a broad societal impact of science, people need to update their beliefs based on the best available evidence. Here we investigate the influences of external and internal factors on lay audiences' belief updating based on scientific evidence with a diverse sample of U.S. residents from which data was collected in May 2023. Participants were presented a series of fictitious hypotheses. For each hypothesis, we assessed their initial beliefs and subjective expertise, presented them fictitious study outcomes, and then assessed their beliefs again. Importantly, the outcomes' presentation format and ordering were manipulated. Participants exhibited more belief updating when study outcomes were presented simultaneously (all on one page) instead of sequentially (split up across different pages). While chronologically ordering outcomes given sequential presentation did not affect belief updating, participants weighted more recently presented outcomes more strongly. We further found that belief updating was less pronounced with increasing subjective expertise, and more pronounced with increasing trust in science and scientific literacy. These results provide practical implications for science communication and the consumption of scientific evidence.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian hypothesis testing via Bayes factors offers a principled alternative to classical p-value methods in meta-analysis, particularly suited to its cumulative and sequential nature. Unlike the commonly reported p-values in standard null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors naturally allow for quantifying support both for and against the existence of an effect, facilitate ongoing evidence monitoring, and maintain coherent long-run behavior as additional studies are incorporated. Recent theoretical developments further show how Bayes factors can flexibly control Type I error rates through connections to e-value theory. Despite these advantages, their use remains limited in the meta-analytic literature. This paper provides a critical overview of their theoretical properties, methodological considerations—such as prior sensitivity—and practical advantages for evidence synthesis. Two illustrative applications are provided: one on statistical learning in individuals with language impairments, and another on seroma incidence following post-operative exercise in breast cancer patients. New tools supporting these methods are available in the open-source R package BFpack.",

Although CLT has argued for a relationship between an episode’s proximity and the degree to which it is represented concretely, and level of detail within visual imagery is an important manifestation of concreteness, research within CLT has not considered level of detail of mental images as a key outcome variable. We adapted a methodological approach advanced by RMT to examine memories to the realm of imagined scenarios. In Studies 1 to 5, participants evaluated the level of detail of proximal and distal episodes. In Study 6 participants imagined episodes with high or low level of detail and rated their perceived psychological distance. We found that distance influences meta-cognitive assessments of level of detail and is influenced by a level of detail manipulation. We discuss the relevance of these findings for CLT, RMT, and prior work on meta-cognition, and consider the findings’ practical implications.",

Using longitudinal data from 911 infants in the Little in Norway study, cognitive and language abilities were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Longitudinal latent class analysis identified three subgroups: “Rapid learners” (23.5%), “Typical learners” (64.3%), and “Delayed learners” (12.2%). Multinomial logistic regressions tested whether early-life factors reflecting prenatal growth, parental socioeconomic status, parental mental health and stress, and mother-infant interactional quality predicted class membership. As expected, higher paternal education increased the likelihood of belonging to the “Rapid learners” class relative to the “Typical learners”, whereas better mother-child interactional quality distinguished “Rapid learners” from “Delayed learners”. By examining diverse prenatal, family, and social influences, including paternal characteristics often overlooked in prior research, this study provides new insights into the origins of individual differences in early cognitive and language development.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold growing potential for scaling the analysis of qualitative\ndata in the learning sciences. One essential step in qualitative analysis is coding verbal data.\nAlthough several approaches have been proposed for automating coding with LLMs, few\nappear well-suited to the needs of the learning sciences, where coding requires identifying\ndescriptive content categories and pedagogical functions of utterances, often implicit and\ndifficult to detect. To address this challenge, we provide the Theory–Prompt–Validation\n(TPV) approach, a three-step process comprising theory modeling, prompt engineering, and\nvalidation. This approach provides a blueprint for evidence-based application of LLMs for\ncontext-sensitive coding of verbal data. The TPV approach builds on existing methods while\nincorporating requirements specific to the learning sciences. We emphasize a theory-driven,\nevidence-based process, including validation analyses to verify that pragmatic functions are\naccurately captured in coding. To illustrate the TPV approach, we applied it to AI-student\ntutoring dialogues. We developed a theory-driven codebook and implemented it in a Python-\nbased script leveraging GPT-4o to segment utterances and assign codes automatically.\nIntercoder agreement between the LLM and a human coder was substantial (κ = .73, 95% CI\n[0.69,0.76]) and descriptively higher than between two human coders (κ = .69, 95% CI [0.66,\n0.73]). Validity analyses revealed theoretically meaningful patterns, such as positive effects\nwhen the code feedback was assigned more frequently. Our work demonstrates that LLM-\nbased coding can reliably and validly scale the analysis of verbal data, bridging the gap\nbetween time-intensive qualitative methods and large-scale, evidence-based educational\nresearch.",

Yet Autistic people with complex support needs (CSN) – including those who are minimally- or non-speaking, use augmentative and alternative communication, or require intensive daily support – remain disproportionately excluded from both neurodiversity discourse and participatory research. In this commentary, we clarify the relationship between the neurodiversity paradigm and Autistic people with CSN, addressing persistent misconceptions that the movement overlooks disability or minimizes support needs. Drawing on theoretical analysis, empirical evidence, and recent research experiences involving Autistic people with CSN, we argue that when applied rigorously, the neurodiversity paradigm offers a powerful framework for advancing autonomy, dignity, and inclusion for those with the most complex support needs. We examine structural, attitudinal, and methodological barriers that limit participation, and highlight emerging studies demonstrating that inclusive, co-produced research with Autistic people with CSN is both possible and beneficial. Finally, we offer four actionable recommendations to guide researchers in creating conditions that support meaningful involvement of Autistic people with CSN throughout the research process. Ensuring that participatory approaches include those historically excluded is not only an ethical imperative but essential for producing accurate, responsive, and socially just autism research.",

          "authors": "Daniel Spinoza-Martín; Gordon Pennycook",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Heightened maladaptive risk-taking associated with affective disorders has created a double burden for adolescents suffering from depression and anxiety. Yet, how and through what mechanism risk-taking and internalising symptoms covary across development remain poorly understood. This study examines the role of negative self-referential memory bias, which is proposed to modulate mental representations of past risk-taking experiences and so to influence future risk-taking. \n\nMethods: Data was drawn from the CogBIAS Longitudinal Study that assessed adolescent development across three waves (N = 504, Mage = 13.4). Risk-taking was measured with the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and self-referential memory bias was indexed as the proportion of endorsed negative relative to positive traits recalled on the Self-Referential Encoding Task. \n\nResults: Adolescent risk-taking increased across waves. Multigroup random-intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that greater memory bias at one wave predicted increases in risk-taking at the next wave in girls but decreases in risk-taking in boys. Decreases in male risk-taking in turn reinforced their negative memory bias. In contrast, internalising symptoms did not on their own, or in interaction with memory bias, predict risk-taking over time in this cohort. \n\nConclusion: Changes in memory bias may be a precursor of gender-atypical increases in risk aversion in male adolescents and heightened risk appetite in female adolescents. Risk-taking may serve as both an indicator and a potential intervention target in adolescents.",

We highlight problems resulting from neglected aspects of indicator\nsampling and investigate how item selection can help to resolve pervasive validity issues (e.g., poor\ncontent coverage, jingle-jangle fallacies). We discuss three stages of item selection: Stage 1, defining\nthe item universe, which requires a clear, non-overlapping delineation of psychological constructs; 2)\ncreating an initial item pool through comprehensive approaches such as cumulative item pools to\nensure full content coverage; and 3) compiling final scales using psychometric optimization\nprocedures such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We argue that traditional prioritization of high\ninternal consistency in Stage 3 leads to overly redundant and conceptually narrow scales and propose\nexpanded selection strategies aimed at maximizing content coverage and optimizing the nomological\nnet (convergent/discriminant validity). Overall, rigorous consideration of item selection is crucial for\nsignificantly enhancing the generalizability and validity of psychological assessment. We advocate for\nviewing item sampling as a strategic intervention for validity enhancement rather than a passive,\nritualistic filtering step.",

          "abstract": "The Bayesian Brain framework posits that the brain continuously updates its beliefs about a dynamic world by inferring hidden states, including multi-level volatility. The link between volatility and norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter which is imbalanced in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), warrants an investigation of the precise nature of volatility estimation in ADHD, which remains unexplored to date. Thus, the current study used a probabilistic associative learning (PAL) task to extract participant-specific belief trajectories and volatility estimates from adults with and without ADHD. We found only small evidence in favour of a difference in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility and even less evidence for differences in learning rate updates between adults with and without ADHD. Similarly, adults with and without ADHD showed comparable estimates for environmental volatility and response model parameters. Nonetheless, exploration revealed strong evidence for an increase in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility in adults with ADHD not currently taking ADHD medication. Furthermore, ADHD medication was associated with a decrease in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility, suggesting a causal relationship between the catecholaminergic imbalance in ADHD and cue-outcome tonic volatility processing. This provides crucial new evidence suggesting that the catecholaminergic imbalance in ADHD may specifically manifest as an altered processing of cue-outcome tonic volatility, offering a novel, computational target for understanding the disorder's neurobiology.",

The results suggest that attention may extend beyond the upcoming word (N+1), especially around the areas that are the most likely to comprise an inter-word space. Cross-linguistic comparisons between four different alphabetic languages further imply that the scope of attention during reading is not universal, and is instead dependent on, e.g., the average word length and other properties of individual orthographies. Furthermore, not all languages show linear effects, and instead reflect a combination of facilitation and disruption, depending on where in the visual field the orthographic overlap occurs and how high this overlap is.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol and cannabis co-use is the most common form of polysubstance use in the U.S. Some evidence suggests that there is an association between cannabis use and reducedalcohol consumption, however data on this topic are mixed. Further research is needed toelucidate the individual factors that determine whether cannabis substitutes for alcohol.\n\nMethod:  This study is an exploratory analysis of data from a within-subjects, crossover laboratory study on alcohol and cannabis co-administration. Participants completed two sessions: one in which they self-administered alcohol after using cannabis, and one in which they self-administered alcohol but did not use cannabis. We aim to compare behavioral phenotypes of individuals who self-administered less alcohol after cannabis (“substituters”;  n=23), more alcohol after cannabis (“complementers”; n=7), or the same amount of alcohol regardless of whether cannabis was used (“non-substituters”;  n=16). We utilized Welch’s ANOVAs and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare baseline group differences, drawing on domains from the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) framework. Wilcoxon tests were employed to test differences in laboratory self-administration measures between sessions for each group. \n\nResults: Substituters had significantly lower scores on measures corresponding to ANA domains of negative emotionality (BDI-II, DASS-Depression) and executive function (UPPS-P Lack of Premeditation) than non-substituters. Substituters endorsed higher positive cannabis expectancies than non-substituters, though expectancy differences did not reach significance. Conclusions: Individuals who use cannabis and alcohol and have lower levels of negative emotionality and impulsivity may be more likely to substitute cannabis for alcohol.

          "abstract": "Among the foundational questions for cognition is whether perceptual systems encode sensory input as continuous values or transform it into discrete mental representations. Speech—long a model system for probing the nature of perceptual representation—offers a critical testing ground. Yet the literature routinely conflates the content of representations (cue-based vs. category-based) with their granularity (continuous vs. discrete). Likewise, the well-known observation that incrementally varied stimuli often elicit graded behavioral responses, particularly when averaged across trials, is commonly taken as evidence for continuous internal representations. We challenge this assumption and synthesize the surrounding debate by introducing the Discrete Sampling (DS) framework, a novel theory under which listeners map continuous input into discrete, category-based internal states via a biologically plausible sampling procedure. We formalize a specific instantiation of DS computationally and demonstrate how it accounts for a wide range of core phenomena. We compare DS to a general class of continuous alternatives using data from 575 subjects across three experimental paradigms, with precise, differentiating predictions confirmed by the results. DS provides a single cognitive architecture for a parameter-independent derivation of binary and scalar categorization responses, concave reaction-time patterns centered on category boundaries, the joint modulation of categorization slope and processing speed by task demands and noise, and the distribution of inter-listener variability. We show how sampling from discrete categories can produce behavior traditionally taken to imply continuity, offering a unified reinterpretation of decades of evidence and reframing how uncertainty and apparent gradience are represented in perceptual and psychological systems more broadly.",

Current language background questionnaires identify patterns of language acquisition and use but rarely include variables thought to influence attrition. We ask whether the SLAQ shows evidence of construct and incremental validity.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The SLAQ was developed through extensive review of attrition research and expert feedback. It collects self-report data about acquisition environment, peak proficiency, attitude, motivation, period of disuse, and current contact. This paper compares SLAQ responses to responses from two existing language background questionnaires and evaluates its reliability and validity.\nData and Analysis: Participants completed either the LHQ (n = 36) or LEAP-Q (n = 22) and the SLAQ. Twenty-seven participants reported attrition of at least one language. Quantitative SLAQ items were analyzed using polychoric correlation matrices, item–total correlations, and descriptive statistics.\nFindings/Conclusions: Results indicate that existing questionnaires fail to capture attrition, with more than half of the attrited languages not mentioned in LHQ/LEAP-Q responses. Additionally, SLAQ items demonstrated minimal overlap and strong internal consistency. Thus, the SLAQ provides a comprehensive account of language experience that is tailored to attrition contexts.\nOriginality: This is the first validated background instrument for language attrition. Its branching design and short average completion time (7.7 minutes) make the SLAQ an unobtrusive addition to multilingualism research designs.\nSignificance/Implications: The SLAQ offers a standardized method for evaluating attrition, which contributes to cross-study comparability, improves participant classification, and supports more accurate models of multilingual experience. Its adoption has the potential to strengthen research on attrition, bilingualism, and language assessment practices.",

          "abstract": "Research on causal beliefs about mental health often overlooks the complex entanglement of biopsychosocial factors and the role of social causes in particular. To unpick perceptions of the interplay between these factors, we pre-registered a study in which a UK-representative lay sample rated the causal influence between 20 biopsychosocial causes (two biological, seven psychological, 11 social) linked to mental health and poverty. Psychological factors were more strongly perceived to be effects than causes, and were perceived to be causally influenced by both biological and social factors. Stronger between-category than within-category causes reveal a contrast between lay perceptions and network approaches to mental health symptoms, which typically emphasise connections between psychological factors independent of biological and social causes. Overall, we conclude that this sample appreciate the complex interplay between adverse biopsychosocial factors, but primarily view this as operating from biological and social factors to psychological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) is a national public health concern in the United States. The present study examined the efficacy of a mobile phone-based brief intervention aimed at reducing driving under the influence of cannabis among emerging adult cannabis users in the context of a randomized 3-group randomized clinical trial. \nDesign: Participants in this RCT were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a) a substance impaired-driving personalized feedback plus MI-style interactive text messaging intervention (PF + MIT), b) a substance impaired-driving personalized feedback only intervention (PF), and c) a substance information control condition (IC). \nSetting: Participants were recruited from a university in the Southeastern United States and within a 60-mile radius of campus. All interventions were delivered remotely via mobile phone. \nParticipants: 149 emerging adults who endorsed driving under the influence of cannabis at least three times in the past three months were enrolled in the RCT. \nIntervention and comparator: Participants in the PF + MIT condition (n = 45) received personalized feedback on substance-impaired driving plus a series of interactive, motivational interviewing-style text messages delivered by a trained graduate student over a single session. Participants in the PF condition (n = 50) received personalized feedback only. The control group (IC; n = 54) received standard, non-personalized substance use information. \nMeasurements: The primary outcome was the number of times driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) in the past 3 months, which was self-reported via mobile web survey during follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. The secondary outcome was the number of times driving after simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use (DUIAC) in the past 3 months. Analyses followed an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Cannabis-impaired driving (CID) is an increasing public health concern, particularly among emerging adults. Despite growing prevalence, little is known about episode-level patterns of use and impairment prior to driving. This study examined detailed features of recent and heaviest CID episodes to better understand high-risk driving contexts.\nMethod: Participants were 149 emerging adult cannabis users (ages 18–29) reporting ≥3 instances of driving after cannabis use in the past three months. Event-level data were collected via retrospective self-report of the most recent and heaviest CID occasions. Participants reported method of use, amount consumed, wait time before driving, subjective intoxication, driving distance, alcohol co-use, and presence of passengers. Paired-sample t-tests examined within-person differences between episodes.\nResults: Over 60% reported actively using cannabis while driving, and more than one-third reported driving after simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use. Passengers were present in 46% of most recent driving episodes and 35% of heaviest driving episodes. Subjective intoxication ratings were significantly higher during heaviest episodes (M = 6.96) compared to most recent episodes (M = 4.71, p &lt; .001), yet wait time before driving and distance driven did not differ.\nConclusions: Findings highlight high-risk contexts in CID, including simultaneous substance use and driving while intoxicated, often with passengers present. Event-level analysis offers a nuanced understanding of CID behaviors and underscores the need for prevention strategies that address situational risk factors.",

          "abstract": "Scalar implicatures (SIs) such as the inference from “some” to “but not all” are known to vary in processing cost. According to the Polarity Hypothesis (van Tiel et al., 2019; van Tiel and Pankratz, 2021), this cost depends on the polarity of the scalar term: SIs from positively polar expressions (e.g., “some”) are expected to be slower to compute than literal interpretations, while the reverse should hold for SIs from negatively polar expressions (e.g., the inference from “not all” to “but some”). We tested this prediction in a sentence--picture verification experiment with 538 English-speaking participants. Each participant judged whether sentences containing weak or strong scalar terms matched a corresponding picture, allowing us to measure response times as an index of processing effort. While our omnibus analysis found no reliable response–polarity–condition interaction, scale-specific analyses revealed mixed results: One pair of scales showed the predicted interaction, one showed a reversed effect, and two showed no effect. A meta-analysis combining our data with prior studies yielded moderate support for the Polarity Hypothesis. We conclude that polarity may influence the speed of scalar implicature processing, but that this effect is not robust across all scalar domains.",

          "abstract": "When using tests to assess individuals, precision of individual test scores is of great importance. Although it is generally known that different test scores are measured with varying precision, traditionally, measurement precision is quantified using a single value known as the standard error of measurement (SEM). In the practice of testing, the SEM is used as a one-size-fits-all measure for each test score. This practice emphasizes the need for a score-related precision estimate that shows which scores are precise and which scores lack precision. We discuss several score-related precision estimates based on classical test theory and item response theory, and provide open-source statistical software included in JASP that enables computation of these estimates. Using score-related precision estimates, decisions based on test scores are expected to show less bias than the common score-unrelated SEM.",

Numerous published studies have found that stereotype threat might lower mathematics test performance among women. However, many studies used suboptimal designs and analyses; the literature might be subject to publication bias; and the cross-cultural generalizability of the effect remains unknown. This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender. The current results fail to replicate the stereotype-threat effect by Johns et al.

A significant amount of VR research has been conducted by psychologists examining a variety of topics such as developing unique VR experiences for gaming and cinema, investigating social interactions in virtual environments, and how VR impacts cognition and perception. Previous research has aptly focused on the effects of VR use, but no studies have examined the foundational aspects of VR adoption by providing a comprehensive demographic overview. In this research we aspire to provide a nuanced understanding of the current landscape of VR users, thereby laying the groundwork for more contextually relevant and impactful investigations utilizing virtual reality. Across two studies, we recruited hundreds of VR users in Canada, The United States, and the United Kingdom to assess their demographic backgrounds (Sample A N = 638, Sample B N = 642). Males and females had similar response patterns regarding their VR experiences and participants reported using VR in a variety of contexts, such as solitarily or with friends or family. Participants from Sample A, who owned VR headsets, generally had longer and more enjoyable VR experiences than those in Sample B, with a notable finding that feelings of novelty persisted even with frequent VR use and headset ownership. The current research highlights several demographic indicators that are important to consider for sample selection or potentially controlled for in future VR research.",

          "abstract": "Indices of physiological arousal and sympathetic nervous system activity provide important information about pain that can supplement verbal reports. Numerous studies focus on electrodermal activity, which is easy to measure and can provide important insight on the relationship between pain and arousal through the quantification of skin-conductance response (SCR). Despite SCR’s value, there is no standard way to quantify SCR in response to noxious stimulation, and conclusions may vary depending on analytic approaches. We used a multiverse analysis to evaluate associations between SCR and pain across 8 studies of thermal pain (total n = 567). For each dataset, SCRs were quantified using five common analysis approaches (preprocessing only; manual scoring; automated scoring; model-based analysis; physiological pain classifier), leading to 18 distinct SCR measures. Associations with pain and temperature were strongest when automated scoring was combined with manual artifact detection, regardless of model comparison approach, study type, and whether pain was rated continuously or categorically. More specifically, Bayesian and model-based comparisons revealed the strongest associations with pain when the software Ledalab quantified the sum of amplitudes on each trial and we excluded trials with artifacts. We apply these findings across datasets both with and without psychological interventions to show that subjective pain statistically mediates associations between temperature and heat-evoked SCR, and that SCR is modulated by pain- predictive cues regardless of verbal instruction. This work advances a simple analysis pipeline that can be adopted in future pain studies to improve efficiency and reproducibility and aid the development of objective pain biomarkers.",

          "abstract": "Working parents constitute a substantial segment of the workforce. Nevertheless, misconceptions surrounding how parental role impacts working parents, particularly working mothers, have perpetuated stigma and workplace discrimination. To better understand the contributions of parents in professional contexts, we developed the construct of family-centered symbolic meaning of work (FCSMW), which captures individuals’ cognitive orientation to construe work meaning through its symbolic relevance to family. Specifically, it refers to individuals’ perception of their work as a vehicle for expressing their professional ethics and principles to their family and serving as role models. We then draw upon self-construal theory to theorize that, in comparison to non-parents, working parents are more likely to develop higher FCSMW. We further posit that the positive association between parental status and FCSMW is more pronounced for women than for men. Additionally, we argue that FCSMW positively correlates with employees’ display of exemplary behaviors at work, such as increased work effort and organizational citizenship behavior. Finally, we propose that the indirect effects of parental status on work outcomes via FCSMW are stronger for women than men. To assess our proposed model, we first developed and validated a scale for measuring FCSMW. We then tested our hypotheses using three sets of data: two multi source, field samples from China and one field sample from the U.S., all of which supported our hypotheses.",

Coding open-ended vignette responses indicated that adolescents’ explanations for social inequities are multifaceted, mixed, and interlinked. The vignette-based measure demonstrated reliability and validity, i.e., expected relations with quantitative CC scales. Those with more books in the household and girls (vs. boys) demonstrated more integratively complex attributions for social inequities, with the latter also providing more structural attributions.

          "abstract": "Autism diagnoses among adults have risen markedly over the past decade, with women increasingly identified later in life. Many autistic women remain undiagnosed until mid-late adulthood due to gendered diagnostic biases, camouflaging behaviours, and internalised coping strategies. Although existing research highlights grief and relief following diagnosis, little is known about how these emotions coexist and evolve over time. This study explores how autistic women diagnosed in mid-late adulthood make sense of their diagnosis and navigate the ‘in-between space' receiving an autism diagnosis and beyond. \nUsing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), semi-structured interviews were conducted with five (n =5) autistic women aged 38–76 years who received a clinical autism diagnosis after age 30. The first author, a late-diagnosed autistic researcher, adopted a reflexive, lived-experience approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and first analysed ideographically, generating individuals’ Personal Experiential Themes, and then at a sample level to obtain Group Experiential Themes. Three sample-level themes were identified: Identity Grief and Missed Opportunities, Relief as Permission and Empowerment, and Living in the Liminal Space. Participants described profound grief for lost or misunderstood identities alongside significant relief through validation and self-understanding. These emotions were not sequential but coexisted dynamically, reflecting an enduring state of liminality - a simultaneous experience of loss and liberation persisting years after diagnosis. Receiving an autism diagnosis in mid-late adulthood may create a sustained liminal identity state in which grief and relief coexist as interdependent processes rather than stages of adjustment. Post-diagnostic support should recognise this enduring complexity, validating the coexistence of contradictory emotions as a normal and meaningful part of identity reconstruction rather than a failure to adapt to an autism diagnosis.",

          "abstract": "Bias-based bullying describes bullying behavior in an intergroup context in which someone is bullied because of their membership of a particular group. This constitutes a significant health concern for children with socially devalued identities, characteristics, and attributes. Compared to interpersonal bullying, bias-based bullying is driven by processes of stigma and, therefore, strategies focusing on stigma reduction need to be incorporated in intervention development. Chapter 21 aims to support intervention developers, policymakers, school personnel, and other professionals by providing an overview of evidence-based behavior change methods, with examples of practical applications, for tackling bias-based bullying. The first part of the chapter explains bias-based bullying within the context of stigma theory. We utilize Bos et al.’s (2013) model of stigma as a framework to differentiate between public stigma, stigma-by-association, structural stigma, and self-stigma. A brief literature review illustrates how these stigma types apply to key actors involved in bias-based bullying in schools. We identify main determinants that facilitate or reduce bias-based bullying. Building on these determinants, the second part of the chapter presents an overview of relevant behavior change methods derived from stigma theory to address bias-based bullying. The chapter concludes with the recommendation that addressing bias-based bullying requires comprehensive stigma-focused interventions.",

Although the benefits of self-disclosure have been examined for three decades, several factors have been identified that may mediate its impact. The purpose of this study was to (a) conduct a systematic review of the literature on self-disclosure of stuttering, and (b) summarize the effects of self-disclosure to examine potential factors influencing its impact.\n\nMethod: A systematic review of studies examining self-disclosure of stuttering was conducted. Speaker- and observer-based outcome measures were examined with respect to six factors known or suspected to mediate the effects of self-disclosure: (1) gender of speaker/observer, (2) type of disclosure (i.e., apologetic, non-apologetic), (3) loci of disclosure, (4) age of speaker and/or observer, (5) frequency and/or severity of stuttering, and (6) familiarity with a person who stutters.\n\nResults: A total of 18 quantitative studies were included in the systematic review. Findings indicate an overall favorable impact of self-disclosure (15 of 18 studies [83.3%]). Non-apologetic self-disclosure statements, when included as a condition, were viewed more favorably than apologetic and/or no disclosure (12 of 13 studies [92.3%]). Gender effects varied across studies.  Loci, age, frequency/severity effects, and familiarity with a person who stutters were infrequently examined across studies.\n\nConclusions: Findings support incorporation of non-apologetic self-disclosure to mitigate stereotype threat in PWS.",

Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "authors": "Bence Bago; Zoe Alexandra Purcell",
          "abstract": "Collective climate action requires shared climate beliefs in line with the scientific consensus. However, climate discourse is flooded with fallacious information and people often fail to evaluate it correctly, accepting weak arguments and rejecting strong ones. Understanding these failures is critical for developing evidence-based interventions, yet it remains unclear whether they are driven by partisan identity protective tendencies, entrenched prior beliefs, or failures in logical reasoning. This opacity stems from a persistent empirical challenge: realistic climate argumentation inherently mixes these factors together, making it difficult to isolate their independent effects without sacrificing ecological validity. Across three preregistered studies (N = 3,000), we introduce a protocol that resolves this trade-off by orthogonally manipulating argument logicality and direction across realistic contexts. In neutral contexts, prior beliefs dominated judgments, with smaller effects of partisanship and logicality. Contrary to identity-protective accounts, embedding arguments in hostile partisan contexts did not increase partisan bias or impair logical reasoning. Instead, partisan attacks reduced reliance on prior beliefs, prompting participants to downgrade belief-consistent arguments. In a third study, minimal logic warnings—brief alerts indicating possible fallacies—enhanced discrimination between weak and strong arguments. These findings challenge single-factor accounts of climate argumentation, showing that argumentation is context sensitive and that this sensitivity can be exploited to improve climate argumentation by adding simple logic warnings that are effective, scalable, and politically neutral.",

Accurate saccadic targeting is crucial for efficient reading. This study examines whether children at the end of their first year at school target saccades toward the center of words, whether this behavior is influenced by reading proficiency, and whether children are able to rapidly adapt their eye movements to visual input.\nMethod: Seventy-four Russian-speaking first graders (37 girls and 37 boys; mean age = 7) read sentences composed of words of uniform (3, 4, or 5 letters) and nonuniform length (3-to-5 letters) while their eye movements were tracked. Children’s saccades and fixation locations were compared to a matched adult dataset from Parshina et al. (2024).\nResults: Results revealed that, unlike adults, children tended to land near the beginning of the word, with longer saccades and landing positions shifting slightly closer to the beginning of the word as word length increased. Children’s reading proficiency was associated with longer saccades and landing positions closer to the word center, suggesting that more fluent readers process words more efficiently, resembling adults. At the same time, children were able to quickly adapt their eye movements in uniform sentences. \nConclusion: These findings indicate that efficient saccadic targeting is shaped by reading experience rather than by maturation of the eye-movement system, and that at the end of their first year at school, children have not yet accumulated sufficient experience to fully resemble adult-like saccade targeting.",

          "abstract": "Education is increasingly dependent on digital tools. Children now learn skills like mathematics in an online environment, typically involving computerized feedback. To assess how this feedback relates to children’s performance, we here leverage big educational data (N=395 children, T=60,228 trials and N=347 children, T=54,000 trials). Using Bayesian feedback models fitted on dense trial-to-trial data from an adaptive mathematics learning platform, we show that, in 60% of children, performance on a given trial varies depending on the feedback on the previous trial. At the group level, children have a 13% higher probability of making a mistake on trials following negative than positive feedback. However, children showed substantial individual differences: some demonstrated large adverse effects of negative feedback, others showed large favorable effects of positive feedback, and again others more moderate effects, effects in the opposite direction, or no effects. These results emphasize the need to tailor the feedback to the individual.",

I then show that the way in which phenotypes emerged, via the evolution of the genetic code, translates straightforwardly to the emergence of consciousness, and also allows the intrinsic/subjective component of conscious experience to be clearly delineated and then distinctively characterized. I thereby introduce a novel conceptualization of consciousness: the RHiNoCERoS.",

          "authors": "Daniel Skorich",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I present 5 critiques of Self-Categorization Theory: (1) categorization into equivalence classes is neither sufficient nor necessary for perceiving groups as entities; (2) the boundary conditions on self-categorization (vs. categorization) are underspecified; (3) the person level is relatively underexamined; (4) meta-contrast is implausible as a basis for entity formation; and (5) comparative and correlational relations are overemphasized. I propose as resolutions to these critiques that: self-categorization is the categorization of intentional agents; persons and groups are holistic entities, perceptually triggered by cues to individual or collective intentionality, and cognitively represented as “conceptual atoms” with an associated object file; group phenomena have person equivalents and vice-versa; and relations between intentional entities and between intentional entities and their properties are represented propositionally in a “language of thought”. Taken together these resolutions result in an updated Self-Categorization Theory 2.0 (SCT2.0). I discuss this expanded theory in general terms, and then go into greater detail about the key mechanisms of salience, depersonalization, and prototypicality. I conclude with a brief discussion of the way in which SCT2.0 builds on the legacy of its predecessor.",

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322), participants evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while Study 2 (N = 451) examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found robust associations between values-similarity and friendship interest for openness and conservation values, with more limited effects for self-transcendence values and minimal effects for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

We set out to quantify the indirect genetic effects of parents’ genotypes on children’s ADHD traits as measured in early and mid-childhood. \nMethods: We analyzed data from genotyped trios of children, mothers, and fathers of European ancestry from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) birth cohort. Child ADHD data were available for analytic subsamples of 12,374 trios at age 5 (children 50.5% male), and 12,714 trios at age 8 (children 50.9% male). We quantified direct genetic effects of children’s genotype and indirect effects of mothers’ and fathers’ genotypes on children’s ADHD traits at each age. \nResults: At age 5, maternal indirect genetic effects explained roughly twice as much variance in children’s ADHD traits as did child direct genetic effects. At age 8, maternal indirect genetic effects and child direct genetic effects explained roughly equal portions of variance in child ADHD traits. However, issues with power were evident throughout analyses and precluded confident interpretation of indirect genetic effects. \nConclusions: We find tentative evidence for heritable parental traits exerting environmental effects on child ADHD traits in early and mid-childhood, suggesting that maternal genotypes exert indirect effects on children’s traits after accounting for the direct effects of children’s own genotype. However, future studies with larger samples are needed to enable clear inferences on the importance of indirect genetic effects for children’s ADHD traits.",

Parents reported on lying behaviour to their own children and parental control strategies. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that instrumental, but not child-oriented or parent-oriented, lying was related to higher levels of behavioural control. Our findings suggest that instrumental lying is more common in parents with a more demanding and strict parenting style.

          "abstract": "Objective: Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) has been linked to impaired mental health and academic functioning in young adults. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a 3-week mobile-based approach–avoidance task (AAT) training (PROTECTapp) for reducing PUI in university students. Method: Ninety-two participants (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated levels of PUI were randomized to the PROTECTapp intervention (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47). Primary outcomes were PUI severity and internet-related craving. Secondary outcomes included motivation to change, psychopathological symptoms and academic functioning. Participants were assessed at baseline and postintervention; the intervention group completed additional 3- and 12-week follow-ups. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated greater reductions in PUI following the PROTECTapp intervention compared to the waitlist (p = .003; d = -0.80, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.38]). No significant effects emerged for craving or broader psychological outcomes (ps &lt; .05), though favorable effects were observed on motivation to change (ambivalence: p = .020; d = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.17]; taking steps: p = .002; d = 0.45, [0.04, 0.87]). Satisfaction with the intervention was moderate (M = 18.32 of 32), and participants completed on average 35.52 training sessions. Adverse events were reported infrequent (7.1%). Conclusion: PROTECTapp is a promising mobile-based intervention to reduce PUI and enhance motivation to change in young adults. Its brevity, scalability, and safety profile highlight its potential as a low-threshold preventive or adjunctive intervention for young individuals at-risk.",

          "abstract": "The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.",

Study 1 used conceptual content analysis to identify common argument frames; Studies 2 and 3 experimentally tested their effects. Men found interpersonal ties arguments more persuasive than moral ones, but no more persuasive than economic arguments. Women, by contrast, evaluated persuasiveness based on their perceptions of men’s motivations, leading to a different and more complex pattern of responses.

          "abstract": "The self-voice plays a fundamental role in communication and identity, yet remains a relatively neglected topic in psychological science. As AI-generated and digitally manipulated voices become more common, understanding how individuals perceive and process their own voice is increasingly important. Disruptions in self-voice processing are implicated in several clinical conditions, including psychosis, autism, and personality disorders, highlighting the need for integrative models to explain self-voice across contexts. However, research faces two major challenges: a methodological one – replicating the bone-conducted acoustics that shape natural self-voice perception, and a conceptual one – a persistent bias toward treating the self-voice as purely auditory. To address these gaps, we propose a framework decomposing the self-voice into five interacting components: auditory, motor, memory, multisensory integration, and self-concept. We review the functional and neural basis of each component and suggest how they converge within distributed brain networks to support coherent self-voice processing. This integrative framework aims to advance theoretical and translational work by bridging psychology, neuroscience, clinical research, and voice technology in the context of emerging digital voice environments.",

We empirically assess this proposal using a survey study and field data from X’s Community Notes. As predicted, politically discordant false posts are flagged most often, and more politically motivated users flag more posts while exhibiting equal or higher flagging discernment (along with more political bias). These users also provision high-quality ratings without undermining system-level outcomes.

This study examined the value of machine learning in this context. We compared models trained on 30 days versus six months of behavioural data and explored whether incorporating self-reported survey responses enhanced performance.\nMethods: Customers from two Australian sports and race betting sites (N=1,470) completed a survey including the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and measures of employment, income, gambling satisfaction, number of gambling accounts, and estimated past-30-day expenditure. Survey responses were matched to participants’ account data provided by operators. We built a series of machine learning models to classify participants into risk groups (PGSI 1-7 [no-to-moderate-risk] vs. PGSI ≥8 [high-risk]), comparing performance across data windows (30 days vs. six months), and with or without survey variables.\nResults: Models using only behavioural data achieved adequate classification accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUROC]=0.74–0.75), with similar performance across 30-day and six-month data windows. The most predictive account-based variables were age, deposit intensity (deposits per active day), average stake size, and days since last bet. Combining behavioural data with self-reported variables substantially enhanced performance (AUROC=0.76–0.85). Two self-reported variables—number of gambling accounts held and gambling satisfaction—were primarily responsible for improvements.\nConclusions: Machine learning models can effectively detect at-risk customers on online sports and race betting sites using only 30 days of behavioural data. Performance can be improved by adding minimal, non-intrusive self-report measures.",

In a sample of 4,642 sibling pairs from UKB, we estimate the standardized within-family effect of the PGS to be δ=0.355 (SE 0.0218), indicating only slight attenuation of prediction ability within-family (δ/β=0.876, SE 0.050). We obtain similar results in a sample of 736 9-10-year-old European ancestry sibling pairs from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. After correcting for the reliability of the UK Biobank and ABCD phenotypes, the inverse-variance-weighted within-family association of the PGS with latent general ability is estimated at 0.448 (SE 0.025). Our PGS predicts higher educational attainment, occupational status, and family income within families, and retains good performance in non-European ancestry samples, with the correlation retaining 64% of its magnitude in the African American subset of the ABCD cohort, in line with expectations. In UKB siblings, higher scores correlate with better self‑reported health and lower risk of multiple cardiometabolic diseases. Our study shows that it is possible to attain powerful within-family prediction of GCA using a PGS, enabling future research to clarify how cognitive ability influences health-related outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Arousal and wakefulness regulation (AWR) is increasingly recognised as a transdiagnostic mechanism underlying psychiatric disorders, including major depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania, and post-COVID syndromes. Despite its clinical relevance, no psychometrically robust self-report instrument exists to assess AWR. This article introduces the 14-item Arousal and Wakefulness Regulation Scale (AWRS), a self-report measure capturing behavioural correlates of neurobiological processes governing arousal and wakefulness.  The scale was developed and validated in two large, population-representative German samples (NStudy 1 = 432; NStudy 2 = 859, ages 18–67). Following systematic item generation informed by literature review, existing instruments and expert consultation, exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a dominant general factor (ωHg = 0.79) alongside three specific factors: (1) inner tension and exhaustion, (2) daytime AWR impairment and (3) nocturnal AWR impairment, with good model fit (χ²(63) = 434.53, p &lt; .001; CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.089). The AWRS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.92, ω = 0.95) and strong construct validity through substantial correlations with established measures of sleepiness, fatigue, depressive symptoms and rumination (r = 0.44 - 0.77). AWRS total scores ranged from 14 to 70 (M = 39.31, SD = 13.00) and were normally distributed. Younger adults reported significantly higher AWR scores than older adults, indicating greater dysregulation of arousal and wakefulness. The AWRS combines a psychometrically robust global score with domain-specific subscales, enabling rapid identification of specific AWR domains requiring targeted intervention.",

          "abstract": "Traditional measurement approaches assume that metacognitive features like perspective-taking, open-mindedness, or intellectual humility manifest as stable dispositions. Focusing on intellectual humility (IH)—recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge and fallibility—we proposed an alternative situated approach, testing it across diverse populations: English- and Spanish-speaking North Americans (N=633) and adults from 136 rural Honduran villages (N=2,567). Participants recalled three recent disagreements from their lives–one freely chosen, one where they were wrong, one where they were right—and reported specific epistemic behaviors (e.g., careful listening, considering others’ views) through binary-chained probes to avoid numeric rating scales. This method revealed coherence of the IH construct across cultures, while varying substantially across situations. Most variance (74-81%) occurred within (vs. between) people across situations: heightened when recalling being wrong versus right and, in Honduras, when disagreeing with higher-status partners. Situational effects also fully explained gender differences in the Honduran sample. The situated approach showed efficiency outside Western and educated contexts and helps overcome the humility paradox—when least intellectually humble overclaim their humility while more humble individuals underestimate it. We discuss how the methodological principles we apply here—focus on behavioral expression of target characteristics in specific situations (vs. self-reports of one’s abstract tendencies), sampling from actual experiences (vs. hypothetical scenarios), decomposing numerical scales into binary-chain prompts to increase accessibility across diverse populations, and explicitly modelling intra-individual variability—offers a framework for assessing other metacognitive and self-regulatory constructs across diverse populations, beyond abstract dispositional self-views dominating psychological literature.",

          "abstract": "Pointing fingers are among the most common hand gestures in early modern painting. Art historians have\nlong assumed that they directly guide the viewer’s gaze toward key elements. However, this assumption\nhas never been tested empirically. To investigate how depicted pointing gestures influence eye movements,\nwe digitally removed the pointed forefingers from 15 paintings (16th–17th century) and compared the perception\nof these edited versions with the originals. While pointing fingers attract few direct fixations, their\nfleeting perception significantly reshapes how other elements are viewed. Semantically related areas—such\nas the targets of pointing gestures and the faces of pointing characters—receive increased direct attention.\nAlso, our novel areas of interest dwell time correlation method reveals that viewers establish different semantic\nconnections between characters and objects when pointing gestures are present. In the second phase of the\nstudy, open-ended interviews revealed that interpretations of the original paintings differ from those of the\nedited versions. These results underscore the central role of depicted pointing gestures. They reshape the\nnarrative connections between elements, ultimately leading to different interpretations. Among all the artworks\nwe analyzed, Caravaggio’s and Raphael’s compositions were the most affected by the removal of\npointing gestures. This confirms that the effectiveness of pointing gestures in art also depends on individual\nartistic approaches and the artist’s mastery in guiding the viewer’s attention.",

          "authors": "Christopher Khudari; Monika Waszczuk; Justin D. Tubbs",
          "abstract": "Background: Family history is a well-established transdiagnostic risk factor for psychiatric disorders, while perceived social support is a protective factor. However, it remains unclear whether social support buffers the risk conferred by family history across a range of psychiatric conditions within a single, large cohort.\n\nMethods: We used data from the NIH All of Us Research Program (N=276,261; age M=56.97, SD=16.97; 61.4% female). Logistic regression analyses examined family history of disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar-disorder, schizophrenia), social support, and electronic health records.\n\nResults: Family history of a matched disorder was the strongest predictor for each diagnosis (ORs from 1.45 95% CI [1.41, 1.50] for depression to 2.69 95% CI [2.27, 3.16] for PTSD); significant cross-disorder effects supported a transdiagnostic model. Higher social support was associated with lower odds (ORs from 0.942 95% CI [0.932, 0.953] for bipolar to 0.986 95% CI [0.980, 0.991] for anxiety). A significant interaction was found for depression (OR=0.981 95% CI [0.965, 0.997]) and anxiety (OR=0.979 95% CI [0.960, 0.999]), where higher social support buffered familial risk.\n\nConclusions: While family history and low social support are broad risk factors, the protective buffering effect of social support on familial risk appears to be specific to depression and anxiety. Clinical assessments should incorporate family history, and interventions bolstering social support may be effective for preventing these disorders in at-risk individuals.",

          "abstract": "As psychedelic use increases, understanding how demographic and behavioral factors influence the effects of psychedelics is essential for both research and public health. This cross-sectional retrospective study examined 365 people who currently use psilocybin, analyzing differences in acute experiences, psychological outcomes, and substance co-use patterns. Participants were categorized into young (18-25), middle-aged (26–54), and older (55-77) adults. Results showed that younger participants reported significantly more adverse experiences while older adults had milder effects. Despite differences in adverse experiences, age did not significantly impact mystical experiences, psychological insight, or psychological outcomes. Polysubstance use patterns also varied by age, as younger adults were more likely to co-use nicotine with psilocybin. Cannabis co-use specifically was associated with greater perceived improvements in quality of life, anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse, suggesting potential synergies between psilocybin and THC. These findings emphasize that age and cannabis co-use may modulate aspects of psilocybin’s acute effects and therapeutic outcomes. Given the increasing legalization and accessibility of psychedelics, future research should further investigate mechanisms underlying individual differences and assess the impact of polysubstance use with psychedelics.",

          "abstract": "Real-world memories often include our internal thoughts and feelings, yet memory research has largely centered on experimentally controlled external stimuli. As a result, it remains underexplored how such internal experiences are preserved or transformed in naturalistic autobiographical recall, and whether they serve functional roles. To address this gap, we analyzed a large-scale dataset of autobiographical narratives in which crowdsourced participants recalled a specific memorable life event twice, several weeks apart, and rated their memories along multiple dimensions. We combined manual annotation with natural language processing to identify and analyze individual memory details, categorized as either observable external experiences or subjective internal experiences. We found that internal experiences were more prone to omission and semantic distortion over time compared to external ones. However, those with higher emotional intensity and stronger semantic connections to external event features were more likely to be retained. Memories richer in internal experiences were also judged as more important, and semantically precise reinstatement of internal experiences across recalls predicted increased importance over time. Together, these findings show that although memories of internal thoughts and feelings are relatively fragile, they nonetheless play a meaningful role in shaping the subjective significance of autobiographical memory.",

We demonstrate this using a new method of ‘attentional transplants’.  In Experiment 1, 50 online ‘donors’ viewed scenes through a cursor-controlled window and rated how aesthetically pleasing each was.  100 new ‘recipients’ then viewed the same scenes through a window which passively replayed the viewing pattern of either the donor who liked the scene best, or the donor who liked it least.  Recipients gave substantially higher ratings to a scene when they saw it via the viewing pattern of the donor who liked (vs. disliked) the scene.  In subsequent experiments, we replicated this effect, and found that attention patterns which drive greater liking allow better prediction of upcoming visual information.  We conclude that disagreements in aesthetic preferences are partly caused by differences in how we attend.",

          "abstract": "When recalling events from the personal past, older adults typically produce fewer episodic details than younger adults. However, this pattern is often assessed in interview-style studies in which participants recall events to younger adult experimenters, raising the possibility that the older adults shape autobiographical recall to accommodate the knowledge of a younger listener. Here, we investigated this question by having younger (n=76) and older adults (n=80) initially recall personal events with no audience in mind, before recalling these again to target listeners who were either younger or older adults. Notably, when the listener was an older adult, there was no age-related episodic memory decline. Moreover, although both groups downshifted episodic details when recalling to a different-aged listener, older adults also varied the similarity across their retellings and incorporated more listener-specific information at recall, indicating greater flexibility. These findings demonstrate how the social context can mitigate memory changes across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Rationale: Loneliness is being increasingly recognised as a public health concern with serious adverse consequences. Given its prevalence, it is important to understand what kind of strategies are effective for reducing loneliness and for whom.\nObjective: This umbrella review provides a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of loneliness interventions to date, summarising evidence from 79 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. \nMethod: A systematic search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on loneliness interventions was conducted using PsychINFO and MEDLINE in November 2024. Only studies focusing specifically on loneliness were included. No exclusion criteria on target group, intervention type or study design were applied to get the broadest possible evidence base. \nResults: The evidence on the effectiveness of loneliness interventions is mixed, with some intervention types working better than others. In line with the existing literature, we find that psychological interventions show the strongest and most consistent effects in alleviating loneliness across population groups. Providing social support or promoting social connection also show some positive impact, though their effects are generally weaker than those of psychological approaches. Interestingly, multicomponent interventions yield consistently positive results across studies but have mostly been conducted with samples of older adults. A number of limitations of the existing literature were noted, including some methodological weaknesses as well as low geographical and demographic heterogeneity. \nPolicy implications: These findings enhance our understanding of which interventions to alleviate loneliness have the strongest potential and for whom, thus are of importance to policy-makers and practitioners focusing on this issue.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCannabis use is highly prevalent worldwide. Craving, a key feature of cannabis use disorder, drives continued and problematic cannabis use. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that people who use cannabis exhibit heightened neural reactivity during exposure to cannabis cues, which were associated with self-reported cannabis craving and use problems. However, to date, long-term changes in neural cannabis cue-reactivity have not yet been examined. \nMethods\nThe aim of this longitudinal study was to preliminairily investigate how neural cannabis cue-reactivity changes over time in adults who use cannabis regularly. Cannabis-related behavioral measures and neural reactivity to cannabis cues versus neutral cues were measured at baseline and 1-year follow-up in fourteen adults who use cannabis on a near-daily basis (age 22.4 ± 3.9 years, interval 367.1 ± 74.6 days) and sixteen non-using controls (age 22.2 ± 2.7 years, interval 353.8 ± 85.7 days). \nResults\nThe cannabis group exhibited significant reductions in neural cannabis cue-reactivity over time in default mode regions compared to controls, along with significant decreases in cannabis use disorder symptoms. Within the cannabis group, changes in cue-reactivity across default mode, frontal, visual, and limbic regions were associated with changes in self-reported cannabis craving, related problems, and withdrawal symptoms.\nConclusions\nLongitudinal reductions in neural cannabis-cue reactivity in the cannabis group track with improvements in cannabis use disorder symptoms. This suggests that neural cue-reactivity may be a meaningful biomarker of symptom change over time and could be used to monitor progress or treatment response in cannabis use disorder.",

Building on recent theories that emphasize the interdependence of fictional characters, this study introduces a network-based framework for explaining storytelling success. We conceptualize narratives as networks composed of characters and their interactions and apply large-scale computational analysis to over 10,000 novels and 1,000 movie screenplays. Across these two studies, structural features of the narrative character networks, including lower clustering, shorter path lengths, and higher modularity, explain greater popularity and audience ratings. These findings demonstrate that storytelling success is shaped by how characters are structurally connected and organized. By formalizing story architecture as a measurable network, we provide a scalable framework for advancing media entertainment theory, linking cognitive models of graph learning with the structural organization of stories at scale.",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions are becoming an increasingly important part of psychological care, especially as technology continues to shape how people communicate and access support. These tools can help individuals receive mental health support even when distance, stigma, or limited services make traditional therapy difficult to access. This narrative review summarises current evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions for conditions such as depression, anxiety, sleep problems, stress, and trauma. It also describes common intervention types, including internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT), mobile mental health apps, teletherapy, self-help programs, and AI-based conversational agents.\n\nResearch generally shows that guided iCBT and teletherapy can be as effective as in-person treatment for mild to moderate symptoms, while digital CBT for insomnia has some of the strongest clinical support. At the same time, challenges remain, including privacy concerns, high dropout rates, unequal access to technology, and the need for stronger scientific evaluation. The review highlights opportunities to improve digital mental health care, such as better integration with existing health systems, more cultural adaptation, and ethical frameworks for the use of artificial intelligence. With thoughtful development and responsible implementation, digital mental health interventions have the potential to expand access to effective support and improve global mental health outcomes.\n\nKeywords: digital mental health, iCBT, mental health apps, teletherapy, artificial intelligence, sleep, anxiety, depression, narrative review",

Caregivers with poor mental health were associated with greater child externalizing problems, and parenting stress was associated with problems across all categories (responsibility, internalizing, and externalizing).

          "abstract": "The ability to process visual objects as symbols is fundamental to the interpretation of depictions such as maps, graphs, diagrams, and animations. We outline a cognitive mechanism that may underlie the interpretation of depictions and present three eye-tracking and looking-time experiments (n = 192) indicating that this ability is already in place in 15-month-old infants. Experiment 1 showed that infants can assign arbitrary shapes (e.g., a triangle) to familiar discourse referents (e.g., a duck) based on labeling (e.g., “Look, a duck!”). Experiment 2 showed that infants do not generalize these mappings to a new speaker. This rules out the alternative hypothesis that infants interpret such labeling events literally. Experiment 3 revealed that infants are sensitive to the conceptual identity of the referent. After being told that one shape stands for an agent (e.g., a duck) and another for a object (e.g., a cup), infants distinguished congruent trials, in which the agent symbol moved towards the object symbol, from incongruent trials with the opposite movement pattern. This rules out the alternative hypothesis that infants interpret the labeling events as referential pacts. To our knowledge, this is the earliest evidence for a general symbol concept in infancy. This concept underlies the ability to use arbitrary objects to communicate and may constitute a foundational element of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "The feeling of psychological ownership, the belief that something belongs to you, strengthens both satisfaction and commitment in professional settings. Doctoral study often mirrors the demands and responsibilities of employment. However, it can differ in terms of its emphasis on self-directed work, extended timeframes of projects and, for many, a substantial personal stake in the outcomes. Such differences may critically shape the ways psychological ownership impacts PhD students. This study investigated two distinct targets of ownership among PhD students: ownership of the doctoral programme and ownership of the research. Participants were a sample of 127 PhD students (range 22-66, Mage = 34.39, SD = 9.53; males = 25, females = 100, prefer not to say = 2) recruited from 98 universities worldwide. They completed a survey measuring psychological ownership, programme satisfaction, and affective commitment at both the programme and research levels. At the programme level, belonging and control emerged as the strongest antecedents of ownership and satisfaction, while satisfaction was the primary predictor of commitment. In contrast, at the research level, ownership significantly predicted satisfaction, and ownership and satisfaction independently predicted commitment. These results suggest that ownership processes operate differently across collective (programme) and individual (research) contexts. That is, belonging and control are central for programme level satisfaction, whereas agency over one's research project directly supports satisfaction and commitment. The findings extend psychological ownership theory to doctoral education and underscore the value of fostering both programme belonging and research ownership as pathways to strengthen doctoral student satisfaction, motivation and retention.",

          "abstract": "Objects in scenes follow a hierarchical organization, with “scenes” at the top level, followed by “phrases —clusters of objects that share spatial and functional proximity. Within these phrases, “anchor” objects help predict the identity and location of smaller, dependent “local” objects. Previous research has shown that this hierarchy is reflected in the mental representations of objects in adults. The current study examined whether children’s object representations already reflect this hierarchy. We implemented an odd-one-out task with 36 object images to collect pairwise similarity ratings from children aged 5-10 years. Two different groups of children received different similarity judgment instructions: One group received no explicit definition of similarity, while the other was told to base similarity on actions typically performed with the objects. We created a priori and data-driven scene hierarchy measures to evaluate how well they aligned with children’s similarity judgments. Results showed that children’s representations were clearly structured at the scene level, as indicated by strong effects in both hierarchy measures. In contrast, we found no reliable phrase-level effects, and only a small data-driven object-type effect, suggesting that finer-grained relational structure is still emerging during this age period. Scene-level structure strengthened with age, whereas phrase- and object-type levels showed no age-related change. Importantly, similarity patterns were highly comparable across both tasks, suggesting that children’s object representations by default are action-based. These results suggest that children organize objects along the scene level of the hierarchy incorporating actions related to the objects in their representations, while finer-grained representations continue to develop throughout early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Adopted children are at higher risk of being exposed to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and consequently developing complex trauma. Abuse and neglect in early childhood have been shown to impact emotion regulation.  Given that cognitive processes underpin regulatory success, the extent of neurocognitive influence on emotion regulation is examined in a sample of forty-five adopted children (aged 6-12 years) with developmental trauma presentation. The children underwent a cognitive assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale – Fifth Edition (WISC-V), which measured general ability and cognitive proficiency. In addition, teachers rated the childrens’ emotion regulation within a classroom environment. A multilinear regression model revealed that lower cognitive proficiency was associated with more difficulties with emotion regulation. In an exploratory follow-up, findings suggested that only slower processing speed was associated with more difficulties with emotion regulation. Lower cognitive processing speed may be linked to changes in attention, as cognitive resources might be allocated to manage psychological distress or unpleasant internal experiences. Implications for school include recommendations, including the provision of psychoeducation to support staff with the understanding of learning and other needs of children who are adopted and present with developmental trauma, such as building positive relationships and creating safe environments. Moreover, teachers might consider amending instructions for children who present with processing difficulties provide them with strategies to support their individual learning and development of emotion regulation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Globally, people underestimate others’ support for climate action—a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. This misperception is seen as a major barrier to collective climate engagement, and correcting it is viewed as a way to boost action. However, little is known about whether pluralistic ignorance actually occurs regarding consequential behavior, what mechanisms underlie it, and whether correcting it changes actual behavior. Across five preregistered experiments (total N = 5,081), we replicated underestimation of broad support, but found that pluralistic ignorance reverses for rare, consequential behaviors: Participants overestimated the proportion of others donating or engaging politically for climate action. We further show that rational, general cognitive processes involved in estimating proportions can account for both under- and overestimations. Finally, correcting these misperceptions partly affected self-reported donation willingness, but not actual donations. These findings suggest that pluralistic ignorance in the climate domain may be more intricate and less consequential than previously thought.",

          "abstract": "Background – suicide bereavement can have profound effects on mental health. It is unclear, however, how suicide in ones community is related to mental health, and whether specific communities, such as socially fragmented or economically deprived one, are affected differently.\n\nMethods – the current register-based study used an longitudinal cohort design (n=702,589) utilizing Dutch national registry data. Communities were identified using address registers to obtain postcode data. Community suicide exposure obtained from death registers was based on number of suicides in postcode during the follow up period. Mental healthcare usage was obtained from basic and specialized mental healthcare registers. We adjusted all association for socioeconomic neighborhood charactersitics. As moderators, we investigated community social fragmentation, proportion of non-Dutch residents, residential density and proportion of low income households.\n\nResults – more community suicide was associated with lower mental healthcare usage (log hazard ratio = -0.37 [95%CI = -0.37, -0.37]). A dose-response like relationship was observed for communities with higher categories of suicide rates and less mental healthcare usage. Socially fragmented communities and those with more migrant residents were least likely to use mental healthcare after high community suicide rates.\n\nConclusions – communities which experience high suicide rates, especially socially fragmentted and migrant ones, could potentially benefit from more mental healthcare usage to prevent further suicides.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between attachment styles and spatial navigation\n abilities in college students. While spatial orientation is crucial for human survival and\n environmental navigation, the influence of early attachment relationships on spatial\n skills remains understudied. We hypothesized that secure attachment would correlate\n with superior spatial navigation due to enhanced emotional stability and environmental\n exploration. Conversely, anxious-ambivalent attachment was expected to predict\n poorer navigation skills, as individuals may prioritize relationships over spatial\n engagement. Avoidant attachment was predicted to show minimal effects or potential\n advantages in autonomous spatial tasks, with anxiety mediating the attachment-spatial\n performance relationship. We have recruited 290 college students (208 females, M age\n = 21 years) who completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), Depression\n Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS 21), Familiarity and Spatial Cognitive Style scale (FSCS),\n and Computerized Ecological Navigational Battery (LBS). Regression analyses\n explored connections between attachment dimensions, anxiety, and spatial abilities.\n Results revealed that secure attachment positively correlated with self-perceived\n navigation skills, while anxious-ambivalent dimensions (Need for Approval,\n Preoccupation with Relationships) negatively associated with self-reported abilities.\n Avoidant traits showed complex patterns with different spatial strategies. Objective\n performance assessments, through LBS, demonstrated that insecure attachment\n dimensions negatively influenced navigation efficiency, with anxiety partially mediating\n these relationships.

These findings support integrating attachment theory with cognitive research,\n suggesting that early relational experiences influence long-term spatial cognitive\n development and environmental interaction.",

Self-Reflective Resilience-Recovery Activity Promotion Training is an intervention that aims to improve coping efforts and recovery activity practice by asking EMS personnel to provide written responses to open-ended questions prompting reflection on these topics. The current study identifies linguistic patterns that characterize EMS personnel who did vs. did not experience mental health benefits in response to the intervention. \nMethod: We recruited 37 emergency medical service providers (95% White, 54% male) who completed the intervention for 8 days. We performed an N-gram analysis and a market basket analysis (techniques that identify word association rules) to find linguistic features differentiating personnel experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety symptom reductions (treatment-responders) vs. providers not experiencing reductions (treatment non-responders). For each group, we examined the most frequently occurring N-grams and the top 10 MBA based upon lift, support, and confidence metrics.\nResults: Treatment responders described a diverse set of coping strategies (e.g., “breaths-deep”, “management-anger”). Non-responders described a narrower set of strategies focused on self-restriction (e.g., “discipline-control”, “discipline-self”). \nConclusions: Findings suggest that modifying the intervention to encourage adoption of a broader array of coping responses might improve its efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is growing concern that smartphones and social media (S/SM) are disrupting adolescent sleep, wellbeing and cognition. However, there is a lack of causal evidence from robust S/SM interventions to inform actionable solutions.\n\nMethods: To assess the acceptability of a total 21-day S/SM detox we conducted a preregistered (https://osf.io/79zd2) pilot randomised control trial (RCT) with eighty-two 13-18-year-olds from UK schools. They were randomly assigned to: total S/SM ban (N=26), total S/SM ban with access to a “brick” phone (N=26) or a business-as-usual control (N=30). Pre-and post-intervention measures of sleep, wellbeing, and cognition were collected via surveys, wearables, and cognitive tasks.  \n\nResults: Retention was high, with 13% attrition across all groups. Ban conditions showed tentative improvements in sleep duration, sleepiness, depression, perceived stress, and working memory at 21-days post-intervention relative to the control group, however these changes were not maintained at a two-month follow-up. 50% of participants expressed mixed/negative feelings in open questions about their experiences of the ban, including boredom, functional reliance on smartphones, and “fear of missing out”; 83% nonetheless endorsed the need for government action, including restrictions, guidance and education.\n\nConclusions: Digital detoxes in adolescents appear feasible as a route to causal evidence and their potential to act as tools for promoting digital health should be examined. Nevertheless, complete abstinence can pose challenges such as functional reliance and reduced connection. Fully powered RCTs should ascertain whether more targeted interventions (e.g., limiting bed-time use) are as or more effective.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with nearly 5 billion users worldwide. Its ubiquity has sparked concerns about the potential effects on sleep, particularly among young people. Previous research has generally shown that greater social media engagement is associated with poorer sleep outcomes, such as later bedtimes and longer sleep onset latency. However, most evidence is cross-sectional, limiting causal claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal studies published in the last five years examining the impact of social media use on subsequent sleep in young people. In accordance with cross-sectional findings, the majority of studies (~70%) provide evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use, including at bedtime. However, methodological limitations, such as heavy reliance on self-reports and non-validated measures of social media use and sleep, restrict the strength of these conclusions. Future studies should employ validated measures and move beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how content, patterns of problematic use, and the timing of use influence sleep longitudinally. It will also be important to consider bidirectional pathways and interactions with other key variables such as neurodiversity, socioeconomic status and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are often viewed as a means to externally attribute ingroup sufferings by blaming them on the actions of powerful groups. Building on this assumption, we tested the hypothesis that the threat induced by facing an internal (vs. external) attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings would result in increased endorsement of an alternative, conspiracy attribution. We also examined how being confronted with an internal attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings impacts people’s sympathy for the author of a conspiracy attribution. In five preregistered experiments (Ntotal = 2,695), being confronted with an internal attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings did not increase the endorsement of conspiracy attributions (BF01 = 37.88, very strong evidence for the null), sympathy for the conspiracy advocate (BF01 = 4.38, some evidence for the null), or self-reported agreement with them (BF01 = 17.70, strong evidence for the null). A potential explanation for these results is the social stigma surrounding conspiracy beliefs – which may result in participants being reluctant to endorse conspiracy attributions. In contrast, stable propensities to internally attribute inequalities (political orientation in Study 1, meritocracy beliefs in Studies 2–3) were negatively associated with all three dependent variables.",

          "abstract": "Peer exclusion is linked to adverse outcomes, including reduced mood and unmet psychological needs. While the 2D Cyberball paradigm is widely used to simulate peer exclusion, its limited ecological validity has raised concerns. Therefore, this study compared the 2D Cyberball paradigm with a newly developed 3D Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm simulating peer exclusion in a classroom conversation.\nSeventy-six children (aged 8–12) and seventy-four adolescents (aged 13–16) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Participants experienced both paradigms in two separate sessions. Mood and psychological needs were assessed before and after each paradigm. Moderator variables included paradigm features, social support, and previous rejection experiences. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted.\nBoth paradigms led to a decrease in positive mood and psychological needs and an increase in negative mood. However, stronger negative effects emerged after the 2D Cyberball paradigm. The 3D VR paradigm was perceived as more realistic and immersive, and its effects remained consistent across levels of the moderator variables, indicating robustness in responses. Adolescents showed stronger emotional and motivational reactions than children in the 3D VR condition, but not in the 2D Cyberball condition, suggesting greater developmental sensitivity of the immersive simulation.\nOverall, results confirm that the 3D VR paradigm effectively simulates peer exclusion while offering higher ecological validity than the 2D version. Although the 2D Cyberball paradigm elicited more intense negative effects, the 3D VR paradigm better captured naturalistic and age-related differences in peer exclusion experiences, thereby providing a more developmentally appropriate and ecologically valid research tool.",

Unlike music, which varies across cultures, musicality encompasses universal traits that enable engagement with music, even among non-musicians. This shift in research perspective, from studying music to studying musicality, is reflected in key works, such as The Origins of Music (Wallin et al., 2000) and The Origins of Musicality (Honing, 2018). While cross-cultural studies of music’s structural elements have yielded valuable insights, they remain limited in distinguishing the contributions of culture and biology. Investigating musicality directly allows for disentangling these influences and exploring shared traits with other species, providing a clearer understanding of the biological, cultural, and environmental foundations of the human capacity for music.",

          "abstract": "The divergence point analysis using bootstrapping (DPA-B) has become an increasingly popular approach for analysing visual world paradigm data.  However, several researcher degrees of freedom must be considered, and the impact of these decisions has not been systematically in-vestigated.  We examine the influence of five degrees of freedom: (1) region of interest size, (2) inclusion/exclusion of incorrectly answered trials, (3) bin size, (4) significance window length, and (5) bootstrap iteration number.  We illustrate these effects using two datasets collected from human participants. Because this data does not have a known divergence time, we additionally present a publicly available data simulator that allows users to specify a true divergence time, thus allowing us to more directly assess the impact of these degrees of freedom on DPA-B outcomes.  Across both empirical and simulated data, we found that bin size and significance window length exerted the strongest influence, with 50 ms bins and a 200 ms significance window length producing the most stable and interpretable results.  Additionally, we found that the DPA-B tends to overestimate divergence times; however, this bias was consistent across conditions, preserving its utility for cross condition comparisons. Based on our findings, we offer empirically grounded recommenda-tions for DPA-B implementation and emphasise the importance of transparent reporting, coupled with post-hoc flexibility tailored to individual datasets.  Together, these results provide practical guidance to improve the quality, reproducibility, and comparability of research employing DPA-B.",

Previous studies examining the effects of prior knowledge used single-event stimuli while neglecting the repetitive nature of everyday experience and the potential of repetition to generate knowledge structures. In the current study, we used the repeated event paradigm to investigate the interaction between the effects of prior knowledge and repetition on event memory. In Experiment 1, we validated three sets of stimuli in which we manipulated prior knowledge. Participants viewed and later recalled four instances of a repeated event (e.g., four variations of a story). As predicted, participants recalled more correct details and rated their level of understanding higher for instances where prior knowledge was high than low. In Experiment 2, we extended the examination by comparing the effect of prior knowledge on recall of a single event and instances of a repeated event. We replicated findings from previous research (typically using high prior knowledge stimuli): participants recalled more correct details of a single event compared to the final instance of a repeated event, and contrary to our expectations, this pattern was consistent across prior knowledge conditions. Exploratory comparison of recall between the single event and the first instance of a repeated event showed a small and nonsignificant difference. Findings of this study inform us about the underlying processes that impact recall of instances of repeated events for different levels of prior knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Active inference is a domain-general theory of brain functioning which reconceptualizes the perception-action interface in terms of a common process of minimization of sensory prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2010). Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little explicit attention in speech motor control. This is despite speech providing a critical test-case, arguably being one of the most crucial and intricate of human sensorimotor functions. The application of active inference to speech motor control can allow crosspollination of decades of work from neighbouring disciplines, and could highlight where speech motor control mechanisms may be similar to, or differ from, those in other motor control domains, by establishing mechanistic explanation in common terms. We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework of auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.",

The propositions are: (1) civic identity development is dynamic, (2) long-term development is rooted in short-term processes and accelerated by conscious or intentional processes, and (3) civic identity encompasses subjective personal and social contents.

Therefore, a systematic literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for experiments testing interventions that could potentially reduce conspiracy beliefs. The present Bayesian three-level meta-analysis with 273 effect sizes from 56 samples (N = 27,996) provides the first comprehensive overview of factors affecting intervention effectiveness, including sample characteristics, intervention design and conspiracy belief features. Although the average intervention effect was small (g = 0.16, 95% CR [0.12, 0.20]), individual effect sizes exhibited substantial variability. Interventions adopting several evidence-based recommendations, such as fact-checking conspiracy claims, tailoring intervention content to specific beliefs and avoiding single-item measures of conspiracy beliefs, can potentially achieve effects exceeding g = 0.3. These findings advance theoretical models on the role of sender, message and recipient characteristics in combating harmful conspiracy beliefs. At the same time, extensive sensitivity analyses revealed that various bias sources might lead to under- or overestimation of certain effects. Furthermore, although study-level risk of bias scores (RoB 2 tool) were unrelated to intervention effectiveness, 82% of the available studies were at high risk of bias. The identified limitations and research gaps, such as the prevalence of underpowered studies and the scarcity of research on long-term intervention effects, provide clear directions for strengthening future intervention research.",

          "abstract": "Attentional flexibility, the ability to switch between external and internal information, is characterized by an internal shielding benefit, as reflected behaviorally by an asymmetric switch cost in the Switching Attention Task (SAT). However, besides internal shielding, other processes such as reconfiguration (i.e., a preparatory attentional component) might also contribute to attentional flexibility. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we ran three behavioral experiments based on the SAT and used a drift diffusion model (DDM) enabling to disentangle reconfiguration from shielding, which are reflected in the non-decision time and drift rate, respectively. In Experiment 1, we manipulated reconfiguration by varying the cue-stimulus interval (CSI; short, intermediate, or long). Internal shielding, which was visible only at the intermediate CSI, was impaired at both the short and long ones, suggesting that modulating preparation time affects internal shielding during attentional flexibility. In Experiments 2 and 3, we reduced the stimulus set size either proportionately or disproportionately for external and internal attention to vary working-memory load and hence internal shielding. With a proportionate reduction of the two set sizes, internal shielding decreased. Moreover, external attention showed enhanced shielding when a smaller set size was used for it compared to internal attention, whereas reconfiguration prevailed when internal attention was less heavily taxed compared to external attention. Together, these findings suggest that both reconfiguration and internal shielding contribute to attentional flexibility, but their weights vary depending on the strength of the competition between internal and external attention.",

          "abstract": "Digital media are pervasive and offer various short-term rewards, yet they may undermine the achievement of long-term goals by fostering procrastination—the irrational delay of intended tasks. Research documents that media users try to avoid procrastination through digital disconnection, the voluntary and temporary reduction of digital media use. We examine the effectiveness of such disconnection strategies. Combining theoretical perspectives on psychological processes of self-regulation and digital disconnection, our study investigates whether goal conflicts and trait self-control make using disconnection more likely and whether disconnection is in turn associated with less procrastination. In an experience sampling study with N = 237 young adult participants and T = 12,408 observations, we find that in situations in which participants experience stronger goal conflicts they are more likely to engage in digital disconnection and that individuals who experience higher goal conflict are more likely to disconnect. Additionally, those with higher trait self-control disconnected more. Most notably, disconnection was associated with lower procrastination on the within-person level: In situations with more disconnection, procrastination was lower. Exploratory analyses find that this effect also persisted to the following situation. Our results show that engaging in digital disconnection can be an effective self-regulatory strategy to reduce procrastination.",

          "abstract": "We present articulatory data regarding how Tokyo Japanese speakers produce consonantal length contrasts. Six speakers produced fifteen mimetic items across bilabial, alveolar, palatal, and dorsal places as singletons and geminates. Data was recorded using Electromagnetic Articulography. Analyses focused on intra-gestural timing, kinematics, and inter-gestural timing properties. Geminate production shows a modestly longer closing phase but a much longer plateau phase duration, with no difference in release phases. Dynamic Time Warping analyses also localize temporal expansion to the plateau. Kinematically, geminates exhibit greater constriction amplitude, reduced peak velocity, and lower stiffness. Inter-gesturally, vowel–to–target and vowel–to–vowel lags increase, leading to increased acoustic duration of preceding vowels, while vowel–to–closure lags remain stable. Linear Discriminant Analyses reveal that temporal cues outperform spatial ones in classification. Based on these findings, we propose possible phonological accounts, including a unified gestural account: a local prosodic temporal modulation ($\\mu_{T}$) prolongs activation, yielding plateau extension and emergent spatial strengthening, parsimoniously explaining gemination across articulators.",

          "authors": "Rose Seneviratne; Matt Garner; Emma Claire Palmer-Cooper",
          "abstract": "Objectives: To examine how mindfulness, metacognition, resilience, and creativity influence psychological distress in young adults and test two alternative pathway models. \nMethods: Cross-sectional structural equation modelling (SEM) tested two models in N = 841 non-clinical young adults aged 18 to 30. Psychological distress was operationalised as a latent factor using anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). Mindfulness facets (FFMQ), metacognition (MSAS-18), resilience (ER89), and creativity (RDCA) were modelled as predictors or mediators depending on the model. Fit was assessed with standard indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR).\nResults: The model in which metacognition, resilience, and creativity related to lower psychological distress indirectly via mindfulness facets showed better fit than the reversed ordering (R2 = .54). Acting with awareness (β = -.29), nonjudging (β = -.39), and nonreactivity (β = -.20) uniquely predicted lower distress; observing showed a small positive association (β = .08). Resilience showed both a direct effect and indirect associations via increased awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity. Metacognition showed indirect associations via increased awareness and nonreactivity. Creativity showed bivalent indirect associations: higher distress via increased observing and lower distress via nonreactivity.\nConclusions: In young adults, attitudinal mindfulness facets, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity, showed the most consistent links with lower distress and appeared to carry the effects of metacognition, resilience, and creativity. The dual pathway of creativity suggests context-sensitive implications for mental health intervention design. Findings support prioritising these facets alongside careful integration of metacognition, resilience, and creativity when designing prevention and therapeutic strategies for this population.",

          "abstract": "Violating linear regression assumptions, specifically homoskedasticity, can noticeably influence the validity of null hypothesis significance tests on regression coefficients. Commercial software like SPSS already includes many tests for assumption violations, and robust inference alternatives can be applied just as easily. Hence, it may seem reasonable to first test linear regression assumptions, and then, depending on the outcome, decide whether a robust inference method is used instead of the classical method that relies on assumptions being met. This simulation study evaluates the performance of such a two-step decision process in scenarios where neither, one, or both the homoskedasticity and normality assumptions are violated. Additionally, we assess the general performance of four inference methods (classical, HC4, pairs bootstrap and wild bootstrap) as well as tests of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk, skewness, and z-kurtosis tests) and of homoskedasticity assumptions (Breusch-Pagan, Modified Breusch-Pagan, White’s, and the F-test) that are available in SPSS. We find that, if the goal is to generally detect deviations from normality, homoskedasticity, or a combination of both, the z-kurtosis test performs most consistently but has low power in small samples. Further, in small samples, we cannot recommend the typical two-step approach due to inflated type I error rates, whereas in large samples it provides no benefit over choosing a robust inference method without a prior assumption check. Thus, we can generally not recommend the typical two-step approach to inference in linear regression problems.",

          "abstract": "In the past decade, different computational models have been developed for face recognition. Despite their widespread use in cognitive neuroscience studies, it is not well understood whether their excellent recognition performance means that they “see” faces like humans do. Here, we collected a large dataset of human similarity judgments across a diverse set of faces, and shared it publicly. We examined whether state-of-the-art recognition models mimic how humans subjectively perceive faces. We observed that models with superior recognition ability often diverged from humans’ subjective similarity judgments, i.e., how they rated faces as similar or dissimilar to each other. Models with high, but not superior, recognition performance are often best aligned with these ratings. Although these models may not explicitly maintain the same similarity relations, we tested whether such information may still exist within them, potentially allowing them to be transformed into a more human-like form. Therefore, we computationally derived such a transformation function for each of the models. Models with superior recognition benefited the least from the transformation, suggesting a deep structural mismatch with human perception. Furthermore, the transformation generally reduced recognition performance, except in low-tier recognition models, where it slightly boosted their recognition ability instead. Overall, our results indicate that, in computational models, there exists a trade-off between the ability to recognize faces and their semblance to human-like perception. This may inform future work on developing more human-like computational models for face recognition.",

          "abstract": "Executive Functions (EFs) are higher-order cognitive skills that enable individuals to regulate impulses, retain information, filter out distractions, and shift attention in response to changing demands. Various measures have been developed to assess these functions in toddlers across different contexts. However, convergence between these measures has not yet been established. Nor has it been verified whether these measures work in similar ways amongst children more-likely to experience EF difficulties, such as children at elevated likelihood for autism or ADHD or already showing autistic traits. Here, we measure associations between performance-based scores (from a battery of 5 EF tasks), parent ratings of EFs using Early Executive Functions Questionnaire Cognitive EF (EEFQ-CEF) and emotion-regulation (EEFQ-Regulation) scores, and observer-report of Self-Regulation scores (Adapted Toddler Self-Regulation Assessment) in a neurodiverse sample of 110 toddlers aged 20 months. Additionally, we investigate whether these associations are moderated by likelihood of autism/ADHD, or elevated autistic traits. Correlational analyses reveal positive moderate associations between all scores, except for performance-based EF and EEFQ-Regulation (r=.01). Moderation analyses indicate the association between EEFQ-CEF and EEFQ-Regulation is stronger for children with low levels of autistic traits than those with high levels. No other associations were significantly moderated by autistic traits. These results demonstrate that toddler EF can be captured with moderate consistency across different evaluative contexts (parent-rating, child performance, and researcher observations) and populations (neurodivergent or neurotypical), and that (parent-reported) day-to-day emotion regulation does not link with performance on structured tasks, but is associated with day-to-day cognitive EF, particularly amongst neurotypical toddlers.",

          "abstract": "Background. Research on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often relies on nomothetic (group-level) data to infer idiographic (person-level) processes, limiting its clinical relevance. While idiographic studies do capture individual dynamics, they lack a theoretical framework that enables generalization beyond single cases. This study aimed at bridging this gap by operationalizing Ehlers and Clark’s cognitive model of PTSD within an idiographic network framework.\n\nMethod. In Study 1, a large simulation analysis determined the minimum data requirements for reliably testing model-derived hypotheses. Study 2 applied this approach to intensive longitudinal data from trauma-exposed individuals. Fifty-five participants (31 diagnosed with PTSD, 24 with clinical-level symptoms) provided personalized items reflecting higher-order components of the model—negative appraisals, trauma memory, triggers, sense of current threat, and maladaptive strategies. A subsample of 41 individuals (23 diagnosed, 18 clinical-level symptoms) completed a 3-week Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), yielding 2,594 observations (M=63.2 ± 32.1 per participant over 22.8 ± 10.6 days). We applied various nested network algorithms to explore dynamic PTSD mechanisms.\n\nResults. We found strong empirical support for the Cognitive Model’s core assumptions, particularly the central role of sense of current threat and its robust associations with trauma memory, negative appraisals, matching triggers, and maladaptive strategies. Cluster analyses of individual networks revealed four common PTSD formulation profiles: threat reactivity, cognitive, re-experiencing, and trigger-threat subtype.\n\nConclusions. These findings demonstrate how idiographic network analysis can extend beyond single-case formulations to identify reproducible clinical patterns. Integrating theoretically grounded constructs with individualized data collection offers a scalable path toward bridging research and practice in PTSD.",

Nature-based Programmes (NbPs) are increasingly promoted as alternative or supplementary interventions for Mental Health and Wellbeing (MHWB), but evidence in secondary schools is under-explored. \n\nAim: In this scoping review, we map existing NbPs in secondary school contexts; identify reported outcomes for mental health, wellbeing, and learning; and assess evidence quality for NbPs in secondary-school provision. \n\nMethods: We followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines (protocol: https://osf.io/qczas), searching five databases and the grey literature. Eligible studies reported school-based NbPs for students aged 10–18. The review process included screening, data extraction, and appraisal (using MMAT), and was co-produced with policymakers, educators, and young people. \n\nResults: From 17,723 records, 22 studies were included. NbPs encompassed school gardening, outdoor education, conservation, forest pedagogy, recreation in nature, and passive nature engagements. Most NbPs were delivered weekly on school grounds or in local greenspaces. Reported MHWB outcomes included reduced anxiety and stress, improved self-esteem and resilience, enhanced prosocial behaviour and school connectedness, and enhanced nature connectedness. Evidence for academic outcomes was mixed, with modest gains in science engagement and arithmetic but little evidence of broader academic performance benefits. Overall study quality was moderate, with small samples, limited use of control groups, and heterogeneity in outcome metrics. \n\nConclusion: NbPs show promise for supporting adolescent MHWB in secondary schools, with school and nature connectedness emerging as potential mediators. However, evidence for cognitive and academic gains remains limited. In future, robust, UK-based Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) with standardised outcome measures are needed to assess efficacy of NbPs.",

          "abstract": "Reading requires the coordinated operation of perception, memory, and sequential decision-making under tight cognitive and temporal constraints. Yet a unified computational account explaining how these processes jointly shape eye movements and comprehension has remained elusive. Here we show that human reading behavior emerges from a resource-rational control mechanism in which readers allocate fixations to maximize expected gains in understanding while minimizing effort and time. We develop a hierarchical control model that formalizes reading as sequential information sampling under limited visual and memory resources. Implemented as a multi-level partially observable Markov decision process trained with deep reinforcement learning, the model links high-level comprehension with low-level eye-movement control within a single optimization framework. Across independent datasets and a new experiment involving time pressure, the model reproduces canonical behavioral patterns—including effects of word length, frequency, predictability, skipping, regressions, and coherence—while capturing adaptive changes in gaze and comprehension. These findings demonstrate that many canonical properties of reading arise from boundedly optimal information gathering and support a computationally unified account in which memory, perception, and control interact to guide intelligent behavior.",

Across two experiments, we investigated the roles of retrieval practice, motor enactment, and iconicity in American Sign Language (ASL) vocabulary learning among hearing adults, using both holistic and fine-grained phonological scoring. Critically, we observe a selective interaction between retrieval practice and enactment in the handshape dimension: testing improved handshape accuracy only when learners physically enacted the signs, suggesting that motorically complex articulators require the combined support of retrieval-based reinforcement and procedural motor rehearsal. In contrast, dimensions with lower motoric complexity (e.g., location, movement, orientation) showed additive or independent contributions of retrieval and enactment. Together, these findings show that retrieval practice extends to visual–manual language learning, but its effectiveness varies by phonological complexity and motor demands. The results highlight the importance of considering embodied processes in theories of retrieval-based learning and offer practical implications for optimizing sign language pedagogy.",

Dozens of dispositional aggressiveness scales exist with their own idiosyncratic factor structures, but they can be distilled down into six factors: Relational, Angry, Violent, Retaliatory, Intimate, and Alcohol. Yet it remains unknown how this comprehensive factor structure might change or remain stable at relatively high levels of aggressiveness — knowledge with considerable relevance to the study of personality pathology. To examine this, I used factor mixture modeling on self-report data from 1,447 diverse undergraduates from a Minority Serving Institution, which combined the person-centered and variable centered approaches of profile and factor analyses. Analyses revealed three latent profiles that were initially characterized by high (~14% of sample), medium (~41%), or low (~45%) levels of all six aggressiveness factors. Looking at the profile-specific factor solutions, five of the six original factors re-emerged with considerable similarity across profiles. These factors exhibited profile-specific configurations and correlations that support a reactive-to-proactive shift, in which more aggressive profiles were characterized less by angry responses to provocation and more by antagonistic tendencies that were less contingent on environmental inputs.",

Conceived by David Lykken, the MTFS initiated a 35-year collaboration between Matt McGue and Bill Iacono, who together built the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (MCTFR). The behavioral disinhibition model posited that a heritable psychobiological liability expressed as the failure to conform to normative behavior and deficits in self-regulation underlies the co-occurrence, family transmission, and early onset of substance use problems and externalizing psychopathology. MCTFR longitudinal investigations spanning childhood through adulthood and twin, adoption, family, and genome-wide association studies support the genetic basis of behavioral disinhibition and its associations with numerous impulse control problems. Heritability of externalizing peaks in late adolescence, while there is consistent evidence for shared environmental influences on child antisocial behavior and early adolescent problem behaviors. Environmental adversity amplifies genetic vulnerability, driving an adolescent onset of substance use problems while behavioral disinhibition is key to their persistence. We also present an updated behavioral disinhibition model that spans childhood through young adulthood and report novel cotwin control analyses of 1382 twin pairs finding that heavy substance use has robust casual non-familial effects that contribute to greater antisocial behavior and a more disinhibited personality structure in adulthood. Genetic and shared environmental influences on behavioral disinhibition and the non-familial effects of heavy substance use create a system of person-environment transactions that maintain stable developmental trajectories and changes in adjustment across young adulthood.",

Among these, self-referential stimuli automatically capture attentional resources and are hypothesized to interfere with concurrent temporal processing. We investigated whether temporal expertise, developed through extensive musical training, provides a cognitive buffer against this interference. Using a temporal bisection task with novel visual and auditory stimuli arbitrarily associated with the self or another person, we compared trained and untrained participants (total N = 136). Our results showed that self-association selectively attenuates temporal precision only in the untrained group, while participants with extensive musical training maintained stable precision. Crucially, no effect on perceptual bias was observed in either condition. These results demonstrate that the temporal impact of high-level cognitive factors is not universal, confirming that extensive musical training confers robust resilience to top-down influences in duration perception.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have long debated the evolutionary functions of music and language. The Music and Social Bonding hypothesis proposes that music is particularly effective for strengthening cohesion in large groups because acoustic features that characterise song facilitate synchrony and promote social bonding. Ozaki and colleagues (2024) showed that singing exhibited a higher pitch, a slower temporal rate, and higher pitch stability, but their reliance on experienced musicians and a solo-singing format limited generalizability of their findings. This Registered Report compared singing with speaking within a single experimental paradigm, examining the relationship between group singing and conversation in Aotearoa New Zealand among 23 English-speaking participants. We analysed three acoustic features (pitch height, pitch stability, and temporal rate) and explored pre- and post-experiment changes in self-reported social bonding. Relative to conversation, singing showed higher pitch (d = 0.81, P = .0007, n=20), slower temporal rate (d = 1.14, P &lt; 1x10-9, n=20), and more stable pitch (d = 0.23, P = .006, n=20), replicating Ozaki et al.’s (2024) acoustic findings in a New Zealand English group context. Exploratory analyses suggested that social bonding increased more after singing (49% increase, n=8) than after conversation (26%, n=7) or lyric recitation (4%, n=8), though these results are tentative pending comparison with more global data. Our findings add support for acoustic and behavioral differences between song and speech, and highlight directions for future large-scale tests of the Music and Social Bonding hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Language processing relies on a distributed network of white-matter pathways connecting frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of cortex. While the arcuate fasciculus in the left hemisphere connecting the posterior inferior frontal gyrus to the posterior temporal cortex is considered universal across languages and modalities (i.e., spoken vs. signed), little is known about how other language-related pathways in both hemispheres adapt in deaf individuals who use a sign language. Here, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to characterize the macro- and microstructural properties of fiber pathways in the core and extended language network in 24 early deaf signers and a control group of 24 hearing non-signers. Automated fiber quantification revealed no macrostructural group differences in left-hemispheric pathways, including the canonical left arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, deaf signers manifested increased streamline counts in the right posterior arcuate fasciculus connecting posterior temporal and parietal regions. Moreover, microstructural group differences were observed in several right-hemispheric tracts, including the right arcuate and right superior longitudinal fasciculus, as well as bilateral uncinate fasciculus. These data suggest that most language-relevant left-hemispheric pathways develop in a similar fashion regardless of the modality of language use, while several right-hemispheric tracts exhibit structural alterations potentially reflecting modality-specific processing demands associated with sign language. In sum, our findings highlight the crucial role that right-hemispheric structures play in processing a visuo-spatial language and, at the same time, indicate that the typical development of left-hemispheric language-relevant pathways does not depend on acquiring and using a spoken language.",

          "abstract": "Mindfulness is increasingly recognized for its mental health benefits, with evidence supporting efficacy across clinical and non-clinical contexts. However, little research has explored deeper psychological and even existential transformations related to advanced meditation, which meditative traditions regard as essential to actualize the most profound states of well-being. Given the global mental health crisis and the urgent demand for innovative interventions, there is an increasing need for research into the mental health implications of advanced meditation. 28 advanced meditators participated in semi-structured phenomenological interviews focused on their meditation experiences and mental health. A content-driven, inductive thematic analysis was conducted to identify core themes. Saturation was tracked, interrater reliability assessed, and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines followed. Participants reported profound psychological changes spanning emotional, cognitive, interpersonal, and existential domains. Six major positive themes emerged: (1) vast improvements in baseline well-being; (2) consistently strong and prevalent positive attitudes; (3) increased positive affect; (4) enhanced mental and perceptual clarity, attentional stability, and cognitive balance; (5) positive shifts in life orientation; and (6) transformative changes in mental health conditions. Many described existential insights arising through the resolution of psychological difficulties, leading to reduced suffering and deeper meaning. Additional themes included synergistic effects between meditation, psychotherapy, and psychedelics. This study provides initial empirical evidence that advanced meditation supports profound psychological transformation, including reduced suffering and enhanced well-being across multiple domains, and sets the stage for multidisciplinary empirical work. Advanced meditation and meditative development may thus serve as powerful mechanisms for healing and flourishing.",

          "abstract": "Clinical neuropsychology as a field was fundamentally informed by Canadians almost a century ago and has seen significant growth over the past twenty years globally. While doctoral-level training has been the most common and expected training route to become a clinical neuropsychologist in Canada, there is no current uniform pathway. With regulatory changes in the practice of clinical psychology occurring across Canada, there is no consensus or standard on the regulation and training of clinical neuropsychologists. Different models of clinical neuropsychology training are summarized from around the world as well as the status of clinical (neuro)psychologists within the Canadian health care system. The challenges present in practice-based training models inherent with master’s degree training are outlined for the Canadian context, including lack of regulatory structure and supervisor availability. Overall, this paper argues for the need for a unified Canadian clinical neuropsychology training pathway for both educational and regulatory bodies that be used for future generations of trainees and trainers, and ease movement of practitioners across the country and globally.",

          "authors": "Kathleen Medriano; Joachim Vandekerckhove",
          "abstract": "Diffusion processes are commonly used in the modeling of time series that exhibit stationarity and Markovianity. However, those two properties do not guarantee that a diffusive process is sufficient for the time series. In this paper, we develop a test for the sufficiency of a diffusion process for an observed time series. To develop the test we capitalize on the Kramers--Moyal (KM) expansion: a Taylor expansion of the integral form of the master equation that describes Markov continuous-time processes. In the idealized case, if the observed data indeed arise from a true diffusion process, then the KM expansion should truncate naturally after the second term. In theory, this means that any higher-order (&gt;= 3) KM coefficients should be zero. However, in practice, the discrete nature of measurement introduces artificial higher-order KM coefficients, even when the underlying process is truly diffusive. Nonetheless, for genuinely diffusive systems, it is expected that the sampling distribution of a statistic associated with higher-order coefficients will be different than non-diffusive ones. This is a viable avenue for testing the appropriateness of a diffusion model given an observed time series. We take advantage of this and propose a meaningful statistic that could inform whether or not a diffusion model is sufficient for a given time series. We then build a test that involves reconstructing the diffusion equation to generate surrogate paths, yielding a bootstrap distribution against which the observed statistic could be compared. We evaluate the sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed test in Monte Carlo studies.",

          "abstract": "Odors are often considered to be particularly powerful at evoking memories. We hypothesized that the emotional relevance of olfactory stimuli grants them privileged access to memory traces. Using a virtual-reality protocol, we examined the influence of emotional characteristics of different sensory cues on episodic retrieval, predicting stronger effects for odors, than for music or faces. This approach allowed us to disentangle, within episodic memory, cue recognition from associative retrieval, and to assess how pleasantness, emotional intensity, and reward value modulate these processes. \nOur findings reveal that episodic memory retrieval depends on a complex interaction between both the sensory modality and the emotional characteristics of the cues. Music recognition was almost perfect and specifically favored by both music reward value and emotional intensity. Critically, only odors reliably supported the retrieval of associated contextual details, underscoring their privileged role in associative memory. The subjective reward value of odors emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of successful retrieval. Cue pleasantness had a modality unspecific effect, with both cue unpleasantness and pleasantness (vs neutral) enhancing the whole episodic memory process across modalities. These results suggest that reward-related processes, rather than general valence, underpin the distinctive power of olfaction on episodic memory, positioning it as a privileged and unique gateway into autobiographical memories.",

Temporal trends were analysed using multilevel Bayesian regression. The protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/U38Z4). We identified 64 reviews (16 of which included a meta-analysis), all of which were rated as 'critically low' quality using the AMSTAR-2 criteria. Methodological shortcomings included absent protocol registration, inadequate risk of bias assessment, and failure to assess publication bias. Mean R-AMSTAR adherence was 43.8% (range 11-66%). Adherence increased by 1.08% per year across the study period (population-level average marginal effect from the mixed-effects logistic model (95% CI [0.59, 1.58]), indicating robust methodological improvement over time.

          "authors": "Pavo Orepic; Ana Pinheiro",
          "abstract": "The self-voice plays a fundamental role in communication and identity, yet remains a relatively neglected topic in psychological science. As AI-generated and digitally manipulated voices become more common, understanding how individuals perceive and process their own voice is increasingly important. Disruptions in self-voice processing are implicated in several clinical conditions, including psychosis, autism, and personality disorders, highlighting the need for integrative models to explain self-voice across contexts. However, research faces two major challenges: a methodological one – replicating the bone-conducted acoustics that shape natural self-voice perception, and a conceptual one – a persistent bias toward treating the self-voice as purely auditory. To address these gaps, we propose a framework decomposing the self-voice into five interacting components: auditory, motor, memory, multisensory integration, and self-concept. We review the functional and neural basis of each component and suggest how they converge within distributed brain networks to support coherent self-voice processing. This integrative framework aims to advance theoretical and translational work by bridging psychology, neuroscience, clinical research, and voice technology in the context of emerging digital voice environments.",

We propose a conceptual model, which we call the mental illness self-labeling model, that can be used to study the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling. We begin by reviewing existing literature on self-labeling, including sociological research on modified labeling theory, and how it can be leveraged to support the conceptual approach we propose. We then outline the proposed model, articulating how self-labeling can cause beliefs about mental illnesses to be internalized, and how subsequent changes in psychological mediators (such as perceived control, self-blame, and others) can have downstream effects on clinical outcomes. Our model provides a conceptual framework and methodological toolkit for researchers interested in investigating the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling.",

This article introduces the swipe Approach–Avoidance Task (swipeAAT), a novel smartphone-based task that uses swipe gestures to assess spontaneous approach–avoidance tendencies toward conventional and alternative foods. Across two preregistered online studies (N = 297), the swipeAAT was administered alongside a mobile Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT) and several self-report measures targeting attitudes, experiences, and intentions regarding meat-, insect-, and legume-based foods. The swipeAAT showed acceptable to good internal consistency across Studies 1 and 2. The swipeAAT and the BIAT scores were uncorrelated, suggesting that the two paradigms capture distinct facets of spontaneous reactions. Similarly, correlations with self-reported measures were absent, likely reflecting differences in task modality (verbal versus visuo-motor) and the constructs assessed. These findings support the swipeAAT as a reliable, scalable mobile instrument for assessing approach–avoidance tendencies toward food, offering a practical approach for large-scale research on consumer attitudes and sustainable food choices.",

          "abstract": "Background. Adults increasingly self-identify as autistic without a formal diagnosis, yet little research has systematically investigated (a) the unique characteristics, experiences, and needs of self-identifying adults and (b) their preferences regarding diagnosis. Understanding the unique needs and preferences of self-identifying adults is necessary to better support them. Method. We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study of autistic adults who either self-identified as autistic (n = 147) or had a formal autism diagnosis (n = 115), recruited via the survey platform Prolific. Participants were compared on (a) demographic characteristics, (b) autistic traits and experiences, (c) psychosocial outcomes, (d) support needs, and (e) beliefs about autism. Moreover, self-identifying participants were asked whether they want a diagnosis, why or why not, and what barriers they face. Results. Self-identifying autistic adults were similar to diagnosed adults in autistic traits, including diagnostic traits (&gt;93% of both groups scored ≥ 14 on the RAADS-14). However, self-identifying autistic adults differed from diagnosed adults in significant ways. Self-identifying adults were more likely to be cisgender female (53.5% versus 27.0%), experienced worse mental well-being (ds = -0.41), were more likely to experience unmet support needs (71.4% versus 47.0%), and faced unique barriers to receiving support (most frequently a lack of resources). The majority (68.7%) of self-identifying adults wanted a formal diagnosis, but faced barriers in doing so. Self-identifying adults named a number of reasons for wanting a diagnosis (e.g., validation, access to certain services), but also grounds for hesitation (e.g., fear of stigma and discrimination). Conclusion. Adults who self-identify as autistic are similar to diagnosed adults in their autistic traits, but face more barriers to accessing services and may be uniquely vulnerable to experiencing adverse psychosocial outcomes. Psychosocial outcomes in self-identifying autistic adults may be improved by increasing access to diagnosis and/or psychosocial services.",

          "abstract": "Unbiased estimation and hypothesis testing in General Linear Models requires several conditions to be met, such as adherence  to statistical assumptions and absence of influential data points. This study examined the extent to which researchers in psychology attend to these sources of bias when presented with analytic tasks. We recruited 188 psychology researchers who completed two data analytic scenarios. Researchers' analytic scripts and descriptions were subsequently coded based on their level of attentiveness to issues with non-normal model errors, heteroscedasticity, outliers, and influential cases. We found that for all categories, researchers either performed no checks for potential issues or performed checks that were insufficient to detect the issue at hand. Researchers who teach research methods were more likely to perform the correct checks than non-teaching faculty, post-doctoral researchers and Ph.D. students, however this difference was small and the highest posterior density intervals overlapped  substantially. We discuss the implications of routinely neglecting violated assumptions and influential cases, and present the case for more frequent application of robust statistical methods to supplement or replace ordinary least squares general linear models.",

          "abstract": "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, which is frequently applied in psychology, assumes constant variance of errors across predictor levels. This assumption is known as homoscedasticity, while its violation is referred to as heteroscedasticity. In categorical predictors, heteroscedasticity can be quantified by calculating the ratio of variances across groups. For continuous predictors, diagnostic residual plots are often used to assess whether the assumption had been met, but there is currently no measure that can quantify the amount of heteroscedasticity in an interpretable way. In this study, we have developed and evaluated a measure that constructs a quantile LOWESS interval (QLI) around the residuals and estimates the linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic change in the width of this interval as a function of the predictor or the fitted values. Further, we evaluated simple linear models under different patterns of heteroscedasticity in a simulation in order to provide benchmark values of QLI estimates associated with inadequate control over false-positive results, loss of power, and loss of coverage probability of confidence intervals. The QLI method provided consistent estimates of trends for models with 60 or more cases, and this was true across variance patterns. We discuss QLI-generated estimates in relation to performance of OLS linear models. Finally, we present an example of how to apply the QLI method to quantify heteroscedasticity and how to interpret the estimates it provides, focusing on the  implications for the OLS analysis.",

Participants who engaged with climate science as a result of this intervention showed a shift in beliefs towards alignment with the scientific consensus.

While social and sensory cues such as odors and music have been shown to influence encoding and retrieval, the role of tactile information remains unclear. In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of affective touch on face memory. 57 healthy adults (40 women) completed the Cambridge Face Memory Tests and the Social Touch Questionnaire to assess general face recognition ability and attitudes toward social touch. During encoding, participants viewed neutral faces while receiving either static, dynamic, or no touch from a hidden experimenter and rated each face’s attractiveness and trustworthiness. Recognition was tested two days later. Outcome measures included recognition accuracy, metacognitive sensitivity (i.e., the ability of confidence ratings to distinguish between correct and incorrect responses), and judgments of attractiveness and trustworthiness. No significant differences emerged between touch conditions, and neither face recognition ability nor attitudes toward touch moderated these effects. Bayesian analyses provided moderate to strong evidence that brief social touch during encoding does not influence face memory or social evaluations. These findings suggest that brief touch in a laboratory context exerts minimal effects and that meaningful social context may be required for touch to impact memory processes.",

However, prospective relationships with ED symptoms beyond early adolescence are unknown. \n\nMethods: Data were from n=6909 participants from the Twins Early Development Study. At 10 years, parents reported on children’s appetitive traits and their feeding practices. Twins self-reported on weight and shape preoccupation at 16 years, and on binge-eating symptoms, body pre-occupation and ED diagnoses at 21 years. Regression analyses (generalised linear, ordinal linear and binary logistic) were adjusted for clustering of families, sex, gestational age, socioeconomic position, age at outcome assessment and additionally adjusted for child BMI at 10 years.  \n\nResults: Higher food enjoyment in childhood was associated with higher binge-eating (B=0.13; 95%CI=0.04, 0.22) and body preoccupation symptoms (females only, B=0.64; 95%CI= 0.13, 1.16) in early adulthood. Greater satiety responsiveness was associated with lower body preoccupation (B=-0.70; -0.99, -0.41). Slower eating was associated with less body preoccupation and fewer binge-eating symptoms.

          "authors": "Philipp K. Masur; Douglas A. Parry",
          "abstract": "Social media constitute norm-rich environments in which user behavior is shaped by continuous exposure to others’ actions and reactions. Self-disclosure seems especially responsive to such cues, making it important to understand how online contexts encourage or discourage sharing. While prior research shows that descriptive and injunctive norms guide disclosure, the relative impact of behavioral prevalence, reinforcement signals such as likes and comments, and relational similarity has not been clearly established. This paper addresses this gap by examining how distinct normative cues shape both visual and written disclosure online. In two preregistered experiments (n1 = 590, n2 = 1,337), we let participants use a simulated but ecologically valid social media platform, allowing us to independently manipulate disclosure prevalence as well as reinforcement via likes and comments. Results show that prevalence of visual disclosure consistently increased descriptive and injunctive norms, which in turn raised disclosure intentions. Written disclosure influenced norm perceptions but not disclosure intentions, suggesting modality-specific dynamics. Similarity decreased reliance on prevalence for norm inference but strengthened the motivational pull of norms once formed. Surprisingly, reinforcement cues had no effect on these dynamics. These findings refine social norm theory by distinguishing norm inference from adoption and highlight prevalence as a stable normative driver. Practically, they raise concerns about vulnerability to visible peer behaviors and the spread of risky online trends.",

          "authors": "Chris Robert Harrison Brown",
          "abstract": "When stimuli are retained in visual working memory (VWM), external stimuli which overlap this representation capture attention when performing a visual task. It has not been determined whether this mechanism can partly account for attentional capture by categories of real-world affective stimuli. Across five dual-task visual search and VWM change detection experiments (4/5 pre-registered; total N = 119) participants had to detect the change in either positive (kitten) or threat-related (spider) animal exemplars, whilst performing an intervening visual search task with peripheral distractors from these affective categories. Affective stimulus associations were confirmed by self-reported arousal and valence ratings in all samples, and confirmed in an independent sample (n = 82). It was hypothesised that threat-related and positive distractors would capture attention more, versus a neutral (bird or no distractor) baseline, when matching the contents of VWM. Experiments 1 - 3, however, found no evidence of increased capture by VWM-matching affective stimuli, though there was cumulative evidence of goal-independent capture by threat-related distractors. When, however, the trial structure became unpredictable, requiring constant preparation for the VWM task response (Experiment 4), or advanced action preparation to the VWM task was enabled (Experiment 5), then VWM-matching threat-related distractors caused greater attentional capture. This VWM-driven capture, however, was not found for positive distractors in any experiments. The results probe the boundary conditions when VWM contents drive attentional capture by entirely task-irrelevant affective categories, and suggests that background memory representations may not influence attention unconditionally, and instead may depend partly on their current prioritisation.",

          "authors": "Alejandro Galvez-Pol; Micah Allen; Lucas NARANJO; James Kilner",
          "abstract": "Perception and action form a feedback loop through which organisms gather information to guide behaviour. Yet many theories still treat perception as a passive process, disconnected from the movements that shape sensory input and the bodily rhythms that sustain life. Here we advance a framework that integrates active sensing, defined as voluntary control of sensing through movement, with interoceptive physiology and links both to the architecture of action-perception coupling in active inference. We propose that cardiac and respiratory cycles modulate sensory precision and motor readiness, creating rhythmic windows during which perception and action may be most effective. Drawing on active inference, Bayesian, information, and control theories, we outline how interoceptive signals shape decisions about when to look, touch, or move, that is, the policies governing sensing and action. Within this view, agents exploit bodily rhythms through active sensing, gathering sensory data during phases of the cardiorespiratory cycle that favour perceptual precision and adjusting the timing of sensing and action when these cycles enter suppressive phases. Because respiration is partly voluntary, it provides a means to fine-tune these dynamics and align sensing with favourable physiological states. We further formalise how interoceptive and exteroceptive information interact under limited processing capacity to modulate inferences about the environment. Together, these principles establish interoception as a component of active sensing and position cognition as an embodied, temporally coordinated process emerging from the joint dynamics of brain, body, and environment.",

To properly understand these disparities, we need to investigate health behavior within the context of daily life and the various interconnected daily goals. This will help us understand how health fits into the lives of people with low socioeconomic position (SEP) and how it shapes and is shaped by their daily goals and priorities. Therefore, we will explore the daily goals and goal prioritization of people with low SEP, and the role and meaning of health and health-related goals in people’s everyday lives. Methods. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n=20) with adults living in (Dutch) neighborhoods characterized by lower SEP. The qualitative data was analyzed thematically and inductively. Results. Participants viewed health as important and emphasized rest and mental well-being in their daily goals and health perceptions. Their daily goals focused on short-term needs and they experienced little agency in setting daily priorities. Daily responsibilities, financial constraints, and conflicting needs made both priority setting and healthy behavior difficult. Conclusion. To address health disparities, health interventions should contextualize health within the realities of daily life and emphasize mental well-being, rest, relaxation, which are key building blocks of health among people with low SEP.",

          "abstract": "Interleaved practice, which systematically mixes different categories, tends to enhance mathematical learning. However, less is known about its long-term effects, particularly for delays beyond 30 days, and about the potential benefit of providing additional instructional support to encourage comparison and abstraction processes during interleaved practice. Therefore, this study investigated two promising approaches: starting with blocked practice before transitioning to interleaved practice (blocked-to-interleaved practice, B2I) and self-explanation prompts. A total of 238 third graders participated in an experimental classroom study on three subtraction strategies (stepwise, compensation, and indirect addition). After instruction on strategy execution and application conditions, students completed a practice phase targeting both execution and problem-strategy associations. The study followed a 3 x 2 between-subjects design (blocked vs. B2I vs. interleaved x self-explanation vs. additional practice). Data were collected before, immediately after, and at 8 and 16 weeks after the intervention. Both interleaved conditions outperformed blocked practice in terms of flexibility, adaptivity, and conditional strategy knowledge (CSK), with effects lasting up to 16 weeks. Although no direct benefit on accuracy emerged at any measurement point, serial mediation analyses indicated that interleaving improved accuracy indirectly via CSK and adaptivity. Neither initial blocking nor self-explanation prompts yielded additional benefits over pure interleaving. Self-explanation quality positively predicted short-term adaptivity, accuracy, and CSK, and remained a predictor of CSK at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. These findings indicate that interleaving promotes lasting adaptive expertise in elementary school mathematics but suggest no benefit from adding a blocked phase or self-explanation prompts under deductive instruction conditions.",

          "abstract": "Beat perception—the ability to extract a regular pulse from rhythmic sequences—is a foundational component of human musicality and a key mechanism supporting synchronization, dance, and collective music-making. Research across neuroscience, developmental psychology, and comparative cognition demonstrates that beat processing exhibits four defining characteristics: it is near-universal across human cultures, emerges spontaneously in early development, engages domain-specific predictive timing mechanisms, and appears largely species-specific. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that newborns, and even late-gestation fetuses, respond to rhythmic regularities using predictive neural processes that cannot be explained by simple interval timing or statistical learning alone. Across infancy and childhood, these early predispositions are progressively refined through auditory experience, motor development, and musical enculturation, ultimately supporting the flexible, hierarchical beat-based timing seen in adults. Comparative studies reveal that while non-human primates and other species can detect isochrony or local temporal violations, they typically fail to induce a beat, highlighting a dissociation between evolutionarily conserved timing abilities and the specialized predictive mechanisms characteristic of humans. Together, findings from phylogeny and ontogeny suggest that beat perception reflects an early-emerging, biologically prepared capacity that is further shaped by experience. Understanding its developmental and evolutionary bases offers crucial insight into the origins of human musicality and the neural architecture supporting temporal prediction.",

          "authors": "Sthita Pragyan Pujari; Matteo Grassi",
          "abstract": "Health systems and populations have expanded rapidly, but the number of human caregivers including doctors, nurses and allied staff has not scaled proportionally. As a result many clinicians are overwhelmed by paperwork, administrative duties, continuous form-filling, record updates, billing and bureaucracy. They often feel less like healers and more like clerks constantly pushing data instead of delivering care. Traditional digital intake forms and static patient-engagement tools attempt to reduce this burden but frequently fall short because of low adherence and fragmented data.\n\nThis study evaluates the impact of shifting from passive enrollment through static intake forms to a dynamic multi-modal conversational framework, Hana, an integrated conversational health-agent system that leverages AI to conduct multi-turn interactions with patients. We used a two-phase design with a multinational cohort of 1000 patients. Phase 1 established baseline engagement with a detailed digital intake form plus standard templated reminders delivered via an electronic health record system. We quantified non-completion rates, fragmented engagement (time spent across multiple sessions), and data sufficiency obtained via the passive static intake method. One week later Phase 2 transitioned these same patients to the Hana conversational flow. The system deployed SMS scheduling and up to three short intake calls (or chat/voice-based interactions) performing multi-turn dialogues to clarify missing information. Hana’s architecture used a Data Science agent to analyze Phase 1 data so that the Health Coach agent could avoid redundant questions, thereby adhering to the principle of low user burden (P3).\n\nResults show that Hana’s interactive conversational approach significantly increased data completeness and patient adherence compared to the static intake baseline. The final pre-assessment reports generated by a specialized Domain Expert agent, which integrated and reasoned over diverse multimodal personal health data collected across both phases, were rated by clinical experts as superior in both comprehensiveness (93% preference) and clinical significance with high usefulness for clinical care. This work demonstrates that a specialized integrated AI architecture that proactively engages patients in conversation not only automates data collection but dramatically improves data quality. It addresses a critical bottleneck in digital patient intake and supports the potential for conversational health-agent systems to complement, not replace, final assessment by the consulting therapist or psychologist.",

Prior research has relied on lottery tasks with limited ecological validity. This study introduces the Parking Task, a user-friendly, customizable video game designed to model real-life adaptive decision making, focusing on strategy selection. Across three studies, participants navigated a one-way road, selecting parking spots while minimizing time loss. Spot availability followed either a geometric distribution (closer spots less likely, farther spots costlier in time) or a Bernoulli distribution (free and occupied spots uniformly distributed). Numeracy was assessed using the Berlin Numeracy Test, Symbolic-number Mapping Task, and Subjective Numeracy Scale. Experiment 1 examined how environmental changes (stable vs. modified) and numeracy predicted adaptive decision making. Experiment 2 tested whether distribution order affected performance, assessed test–retest reliability, and the relationship between Parking Task performance and lottery-based tasks. Experiment 3 investigated how goal instructions influenced parking time and satisfaction. Results showed that higher numeracy, measured by the Berlin Numeracy Test and Symbolic-number Mapping Task, was linked to more adaptive strategy selection and greater time savings when environments shifted from geometric to Bernoulli distributions. The task demonstrated good test–retest reliability, and better Parking Task performance was related to higher payoff sensitivity and adaptive behavior in monetary lotteries. Instructional framing affected performance: participants instructed not to be late parked earlier and reported higher satisfaction compared to those instructed to save time. Overall, the findings support the Parking Task as a valid and reliable tool for studying adaptive decision making in dynamic settings.",

The loss-framed message resulted in higher perceived severity of climate change (β = 0.07, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the gain-framed message. This effect is driven by emotions: loss-framed messages primarily elicit anxiety (β = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001), while gain-framed messages boost hope (β = -0.86, p &lt; 0.001). However, framing had a minimal effect on information-seeking intention (β = 0.03, p &lt; 0.001) and did not alter actual information-seeking behaviour.

          "abstract": "The memory measurement model (M3) is a flexible modeling framework designed to measure parameters associated with different processes in working memory. It assumes that memory representations receive different levels of activation at retrieval, which arise from the sum of the strengths of item and binding memory. Transforming the activation of representations in different response categories into their respective recall probabilities then allows to estimate the contributions of different memory processes to working memory performance. So far, parameter recovery was reported only for group-level parameters of the M3. In contrast to experimental research, individual differences research focuses on variation in subject parameters. Adequate recovery of individual subject parameters is a requirement for valid measurement of these parameters. To address this gap, we ran a parameter recovery simulation to assess subject-level parameter recovery dependent on different experimental design choices. Our Bayesian hierarchical M3 implementation recovers subject parameters acceptably to very well. Based on the results, we recommend that researchers should ensure that participants select not-presented lures (i.e., items not in the memory set) at least sometimes (&gt; 2 %) and collect around 150 - 250 retrieval responses per subject. When these conditions are met, the simple and complex span models specified in the M3 framework exhibit robust parameter recovery and low estimation bias, as well as satisfying reliability. In contrast, M3 parameters modeling free time effects such as extended encoding and removal processes showed inferior parameter recovery, estimation bias and reliability. These challenges primarily arose from the substantial amount of data required to achieve sufficiently precise parameter estimates.",

          "abstract": "Our cognitive system must manage two opposing demands: staying focused on one task (stability) and switching between tasks when needed (flexibility). Traditionally, a trade-off has been assumed between these two control modes. Recent studies questioned this idea. However, they do not consider that experimental manipulations can influence stability and flexibility at different levels of information processing and that a trade-off may only exist within the same level. We introduce a novel paradigm designed to investigate flexibility and stability at different levels of information processing (task vs. stimulus level). Participants switched between two categorization tasks while ignoring distractors. Distractors either came from the same (within-task) or the alternative task (between-task) and were either response-congruent or incongruent. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants categorized words superimposed on distractor images representing the generic response categories (task level interference). In Experiment 3, they categorized letters or digits flanked by distractor letters or digits (stimulus level interference). Reduced interference from between-task distractors compared to within-task distractors in Experiments 1 and 2 show shielding at the task level. At the stimulus level (Experiment 3) both distractor-types interfered to the same extent, indicating that the shielding against between-task distractors got bypassed by the automatic retrieval of learnt stimulus-response associations. Across all three experiments, shielding against between-task distractors in the previous trial improved subsequent performance, when the task repeated (i.e. it improved stability), but impaired performance, when the task switched (i.e. it impaired flexibility). This finding supports a trade-off between flexibility and stability at the task level.",

          "abstract": "Interventions addressing cognitive impairments after traumatic brain injury (TBI) often rely on survivors’ relatively preserved capacity to learn, initiate, and consistently use rehabilitation strategies, along with the ability to apply strategies in various contexts. The cognitive functions required for such active engagement in rehabilitation are commonly impaired after TBI, consequently limiting the benefits of many existing cognitive rehabilitation approaches. Environmental approaches, which involve manipulating the environment to support cognition and function, may benefit TBI survivors, as they require minimal active involvement of the user to set up and initiate their use. Although these approaches are recommended by experts and frequently used, their effectiveness and components are largely unknown. We conducted a systematic review, searching seven databases for randomised controlled trials of adults with TBI who received environmental interventions for cognitive or related functional outcomes, compared to any control. Two reviewers independently undertook screening and data extraction following a standardised protocol. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Instruments. Ten studies were included in the review. Environmental intervention approaches included prompting, trained communication partners, feedback, and sensory stimulation. Interventions involving prompting and trained communication partners had the highest level of evidence for their effectiveness. Key methodological limitations included insufficient blinding to group allocation, randomisation concealment, reliability of outcome measurement, and lack of baseline similarity between groups. Whilst a number of environmental approaches demonstrate potential for improving the daily functioning of individuals with TBI, further research is needed.",

Using three prompting conditions across eight LLMs from four major providers, we generated AI items and evaluated them through expert review, AI-psychometric analyses, and lexical diversity metrics. The findings highlight both the potential and limitations of AIG. Many AI-generated items were clear, concise, and theoretically meaningful, and for the novel construct, some items captured nuanced facets beyond the researcher’s initial conceptualization. At the same time, other items were overly general or tapped unintended dimensions, underscoring the need for careful human screening.  Prompt engineering was the strongest determinant of item quality, requiring deliberate design to avoid reproducing existing scale items and to achieve the desired balance of specificity and conciseness. Overall, AIG appears to be a useful tool for early-stage scale development when paired with thoughtful prompt design and human oversight.",

Accurate measurement of depression in this population is a crucial step toward effective research, diagnosis, and intervention. Although rating scales for children and adolescents are widely used by researchers, clinicians, and large-scale surveys, their heterogeneity in developing contexts has been largely overlooked. To fill the gap, we analyzed the content of 27 Chinese depression scales and self-report data from four commonly used scales (N = 12,764). Our content analysis identified 84 unique symptoms across the 27 scales and low rate of overlap (mean = 0.19, range: 0.09–0.25), suggesting that instruments often assumed to be comparable capture distinct symptom domains. Moreover, few scales included cultural- or age-specific symptoms, suggesting a lack of cultural- or age-adaptation. Analyses of self-report data showed that the four scales produced different detection rates and each identified unique cases. Exploratory Graph Analysis revealed that their items clustered into three distinct symptom communities rather than a unified construct. These findings indicate that depression scales for children and adolescents are not interchangeable and highlight the need for harmonization efforts. Achieving a balance between standardization and contextual adaptation is essential for improving the validity and comparability of depression measurement in global mental health research.",

          "abstract": "The complexity of adult health decision-making extends far beyond traditional delayed gratification paradigms, requiring sophisticated theoretical frameworks that capture how individuals navigate competing desires in health-risk contexts. This study introduces the Health Risk Behaviors Gratification Control Inventory (HeRBs GCI), a theoretically grounded instrument that operationalizes gratification control as the capacity to regulate immediate impulses in anticipation of both positive outcomes and negative consequence avoidance. Through systematic psychometric development and validation with 442 emerging adults, the inventory reveals a robust four-factor structure encompassing alcohol use, smoking, substance abuse, and risky sexual practices, while demonstrating that certain health behaviors, such as eating and physical activity, operate through distinct regulatory mechanisms. The findings advance self-regulation theory by providing empirical support for domain-specific rather than generalized trait-based approaches to self-control, while offering compelling evidence for behavioral syndrome perspectives that emphasize shared vulnerabilities across related risk behaviors.",

          "title": "From Museum to Workshop: A Pragmatist Intervention in Science of Consciousness",
          "authors": "Sepehrdad Rahimian",
          "abstract": "Despite notable empirical advances, the science of consciousness lacks firm conceptual footing. Competing theories not only disagree on mechanisms but also define consciousness in mutually incompatible ways, and criteria for evaluating theoretical success remain vague. I argue that this situation arises from a lack of pragmatic pressure within the field. Theories are rewarded for offering ever more elaborate explanations of “consciousness-as-such” rather than for solving concrete, real-world problems. This paper proposes a pragmatic shift. Rather than beginning with metaphysical commitments about what consciousness truly is, scientific inquiry should focus on developing models that demonstrably advance well-defined objectives. Such an approach does not deny the possibility that consciousness includes aspects beyond scientific access; it takes a neutral stance toward that possibility, holding that scientific practice must be guided by problems with pragmatic relevance and clear criteria of success. Drawing on analogies from stock-market trading and examples from the history of science, I suggest that scientific progress does not require a single, final ontology. Newtonian mechanics and relativity, for instance, present incompatible pictures of space and time, yet both function effectively within their domains. Likewise, consciousness research can proceed under an ontologically pluralist framework, enabling genuine scientific progress rather than endless theoretical disputes.",

          "abstract": "Early vocabulary development predicts later cognitive functioning and school success. We sought to examine how processing differences across several skills that contribute to early word learning relate to variability in children’s vocabulary development. Building on recent direct measures of early vocabulary and language learning processes, we collected data from 166 children between 15- to 27-months in a single eyetracking task measuring lexical speed of processing, comprehension, novelty bias, word mapping and new word retention. We found clear differences in responding across the different measures and robust patterns of developmental change. Children’s comprehension grew over development, and across word classes they showed clearly distinct looking patterns, reflecting fundamental differences in word type processing and more efficient noun recognition compared to adjectives and verbs. Speed of processing and online comprehension showed strong relationships with concurrent vocabulary, similar to previous reports. Children also showed a strong improvement in referent selection over development, but as found in previous literature, they did not show evidence of retaining new word-object mappings formed on earlier trials of the task. Data driven classification found two robust clusters of children. One group showed faster speed of lexical processing, better comprehension and were better at linking new nouns to novel objects. Numerically, this group had the highest parent-reported concurrent productive vocabulary scores. Data are discussed in relation to similar work in the literature, what concurrent measurement of multiple word learning processes reveals about the system of multiple processes supporting early vocabulary development, and children’s individual trajectories of word learning.",

To address this bias, we developed a paper-based implicit measure to evaluate the intellectual image of PE. The test adapts the FUMIE test (Mori et al., 2008), a paper-and-pencil version of the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., 1998), suitable for group use in schools. In Study 1, 52 university students rated 100 two-kanji Japanese words as “intellectual,” “non-intellectual,” or “neutral.” Based on high agreement, we selected 20 intellectual and 10 non-intellectual words to construct the iFUMIE test. In Study 2, we evaluated its reliability and validity using the target words “understanding” and “ignorance,” with 51 students. Results confirmed the test’s usability in measuring implicit intellectual associations. The iFUMIE offers a foundation for future research assessing the effects of instructional efforts designed to enhance the perceived intellectual value of PE.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) explain and predict human choices and response times in a way that maps more directly to cognitive processes than traditional analyses. For example, EAMs can separate the speed-accuracy trade-off from processing capacity. However, little guidance is available regarding how to use EAMs to instantiate cognitive process theories, which often involve complex mappings of parameters to experimental designs. This tutorial illustrates how to embed such theories using the R package EMC2. We show how the effects of cognitive processes can be estimated by mapping EAM parameters to experimental designs using an augmented linear model language. We demonstrate with two examples. The first instantiates a theory of prospective memory. The second instantiates a theory of how humans integrate advice from automated decision aids into their choices. We then show how to combine these two different theories in a unified framework. We conclude by discussing further directions for theory embedding, including non-linear mappings from stimulus values to EAM parameters and the incorporation of trial-by-trial dynamics.",

Building on the results of pilot experiments from three countries (n = 894), we plan to conduct a global field experiment to measure the causal impact of reducing social media usage for two weeks across 23 countries (projected n &gt; 8,000). We will then test how social media reduction influences four main outcomes: news knowledge, exposure to online hostility, intergroup attitudes, and well-being. We will also explore how the effects of social media reduction vary across world regions, focusing on three theoretically-informed country-level moderators: income level, inequality, and democratic strength. This large-scale, high-powered field experiment, and the global dataset resulting from it, will offer rare causal evidence to inform ongoing debates about the impact of social media and how it varies around the world.",

          "abstract": "Older adults tend to miss cues to others’ untrustworthiness and are disproportionally vulnerable to suboptimal social decisions. One overlooked mechanism of age-related change in interpersonal trust decisions is interoception, the perception of one’s own bodily signals. Interoception is important for well-calibrated trust decisions because somatic signals, or “gut-based” affective responses, can help inform who is trustworthy versus ill-intentioned. This study examined how individuals’ interoceptive accuracy and their interoceptive metacognitive ability moderated associations between age and interpersonal trust perceptions. During an in-lab session, 135 participants (aged 18–83) completed an interpersonal trust task and a heartbeat detection (HBD) task to measure their interoceptive accuracy (measured as d’) and interoceptive metacognition (measured as metacognitive sensitivity and metacognitive efficiency). We found that, as age increased, participants were more likely to rate normatively untrustworthy facial stimuli as more trustworthy, and this effect was stronger for those with lower interoceptive accuracy. We also found that among those with high interoceptive metacognition, older participants were more likely to rate normatively untrustworthy stimuli as more trustworthy, and trustworthy stimuli as more untrustworthy. Results from this study suggest bodily cues may provide information about others’ trustworthiness, and at older age, those who do not perceive their own bodily signals accurately are also likely to make errors in interpersonal decisions. As adults develop, better interoceptive metacognition may reflect a tendency to discount affective responses during decision making.",

In sex comparisons in morality, what improvements can be made regarding participant recruitment and reflexivity; morality stimuli, measures, and analyses; and interpretation of findings?\nEligible studies were those that pre-planned examining sex/gender differences in any of the five themes.

The patterns of sex differences in morality are explored through vote-counting (beware of its flaws). Critical appraisal is the review’s central focus.\nAmong 771 records screened, 27 (32 studies) were included. In moral reasoning/judgment and behavior, the sexes scored similarly overall, whereas reported differences favored females. In moral emotions, females scored higher than males overall, whereas some studies found them similar. The critical question’s three components are expanded into eight subsections, through which several implicit research assumptions directing sex comparisons in morality are critiqued.\nKeywords: moral psychology, sex differences, gender differences, critical systematic review",

This preregistered randomized controlled trial (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EJ89T; Silverman et al., 2025) tested the effectiveness of HW compared to a symptom tracking (ST) control condition. Method: A nonclinical community sample of U.S. adults with at least mild anxiety and depression symptoms (N=340; Mage=33.04 years, 57.4% women, 60.6% White, 14.7% Black, 11.2% Asian, 10.9% Multiracial, 22.1% Hispanic/Latine) were randomly assigned to complete three weekly interpretation bias exercises and once weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (HW), or three weekly depression and anxiety symptom surveys (ST) for four weeks. Results: A priori benchmarks for retention, adherence and satisfaction were achieved: 77.8% of HW participants were still using the app in Week 4, 43.7% achieved perfect adherence, and app usability and acceptability were rated positively. As hypothesized, HW was superior to ST at improving negative and benign interpretation biases (Word-Sentence Association Paradigm) and functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment Scale); and HW (vs. ST) participants reported significantly greater global improvement (Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Improvement Self-Report) and subjective engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale) at post-intervention. Unexpectedly, while depression and anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) improved significantly, these changes were not unique to HW. Conclusions: HW is an engaging and scalable intervention that may be effective for improving overall severity and functioning. Further validation of effectiveness for specific symptom domains is needed.",

          "abstract": "Filtering is a cognitive mechanism that regulates how information is encoded into working memory. It minimizes the retention of irrelevant information while facilitating the maintenance of task-relevant information. While prior studies have examined the filtering of task-irrelevant distractors, it remains unclear whether information that needs to be briefly processed—but not maintained—can be partially filtered out. To address this, we developed a novel complex-span task involving three conditions: a pre-cue condition, where stimuli are identified as memory items or distractors before they are processed thus allowing for filtering; a retro-cue condition, where this information is given only after processing, preventing filtering; and a control condition without distractors. Across three experiments, memory performance in the pre-cue condition was comparable to the retro-cue condition but worse than the control condition. Additionally, using the Memory Measurement Model (Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019), we estimated the memory strength of distractors and found the same strength of distractors retained in working memory in both pre- and retro-cue conditions. These findings suggest that information requiring processing cannot be selectively filtered out during encoding into working memory.",

ARFID symptoms often emerge early, yet there is limited research on possible early life feeding and growth factors associated with the disorder.  \n\nMethods: We used data from Gemini, a British prospective birth cohort study with parent-reported ARFID symptoms measured at 12-13 years (n=968). Exposures of interest (measured in the first year of life) included appetite, infant milk-feeding, parental concern about their child’s weight, parental feeding practices (pressure and restriction) and infant growth (e.g., weight-for age z scores, weight gain trajectories). Logistic regressions (adjusted for clustering of twins in families) examined associations with later ARFID symptoms and linear mixed models compared weight gain trajectories between the suspected ARFID and non-ARFID participants. \n\nResults: Appetite, specifically early slower feeding (OR=1.47, 95%CI= 1.13, 1.90) and sensitivity to satiety (OR = 1.35, 95%CI= 1.03, 1.77) were associated with increased odds of later ARFID symptoms. Infants whose parents were concerned about their child’s weight had higher odds of ARFID symptoms (OR= 1.76, 95%CI = 1.15, 2.70). Having a higher weight at birth, three, six, nine and twelve months was associated with 12-20% lower odds of ARFID symptoms and trajectory analyses suggest that children with ARFID symptoms may have a slower weight gain trajectory compared to children without ARFID symptoms. \n\nConclusion: Findings indicate that poor appetite (especially slower feeding and getting full more quickly) and weight stagnancy in infancy may be potential risk factors for later ARFID symptoms, some of which (e.g. poor appetite) may play a role in the disorder’s development.",

Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

Here we integrate anatomical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence demonstrating that this pathway specializes in processing dynamic social cues such as facial expressions, eye gaze, and body movements. This third pathway supports social perception by computing the actions and intentions of other people.

Prior studies using ecological momentary assessment (EMA; Knouse, Ziegler, et al., 2023; Knouse et al., 2025) found that avoidant automatic thoughts (AAT), spontaneously arising thoughts about delaying the starting or ending of an activity, were associated with task avoidance and inattention in the moment. In these studies, people with more severe self-reported ADHD symptoms also experienced more frequent AAT. We replicated and extended these prior studies in a sample of college students diagnosed with ADHD compared to those not diagnosed. 97 undergraduate students (45 diagnosed with ADHD and 52 with no ADHD diagnosis) completed baseline measures and 6 days of EMA up to 5 times per day. The median participant reported AAT at 41% of sampled moments and participants with ADHD reported a higher frequency of AAT compared to those not diagnosed (62% vs. 35% of moments, p &lt; .001). AAT in the moment predicted more intense inattention and task avoidance; however, ADHD did not strengthen these associations. Nonetheless, the more frequent experience of AAT for people with ADHD may be one mechanism leading to more frequent problematic avoidance and a potential target for cognitive-behavioral intervention.",

          "abstract": "The negative relationship between cognitive abilities and depression is well-established, but studies that focus on the mental health of individuals with exceptional cognitive abilities specifically report mixed findings. Recent work revealed that measures of mental health might lack measurement invariance across the levels of cognitive abilities, which might explain these discrepancies. The aim of this study was to test the measurement invariance of the Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression (CES-D) scale across four cognitive abilities: crystallized knowledge, quantitative reasoning, verbal fluency, and working memory. Data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used. The analyzed sample consisted of 19,475 participants aged 50 years or older. The results showed that CES-D lacked measurement invariance across all four cognitive abilities measured. A prominent pattern emerged, with unstandardized factor loadings and item thresholds decreasing as cognitive abilities increased. This effect seems independent of response scale format but somewhat sensitive to reverse-scored items. The CES-D scores of individuals at different levels of cognitive abilities are not comparable, which may lead not only to incorrect inferences about the relationship between cognitive abilities and CES-D scores but also affect any other research using CES-D where the impact of cognitive abilities on the scales' observed scores is uncontrolled for. The pattern of decreasing item thresholds can also suggest that higher cognitive abilities potentially mask depression symptoms.",

          "title": "Shaping sacramental authority: ‘The power to bind and loose’ as a subject of discussion between the Byzantine Church hierarchy, monasticism, and the state (11th–12th centuries) (Конструирование сакраментального авторитета: «власть вязать и решить» как предмет согласования между византийской церковной иерархией, монашеством и государством (XI –XII вв.))",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the situation of growing attention to the practices of confession, which took place at the turn of the 10th–11th centuries and which lasted until the end of the 12th century. The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the statements by representatives of the Middle Byzantine canonical thought and discover methods (concepts, categories, hierarchical systems) by which they integrated the phenomenon of secret confession into a complex system of relationships in Byzantine society, and to evaluate their compatibility with the discourse of the time. The article consists of two parts which trace the situation during the 11th and 12th centuries, respectively. Each of these is further divided into two sections: in the first one the positions of the main authors of the period are described, while in the second they are analyzed and provided with historical contextualization. Part One compares historical narratives concerning the development of the institution of confession developed by three authors: St. Symeon the New Theologian, Patriarch John IV the Oxite of Antioch, and ex-chartophylax Nicephorus. It turns out that all three see the situation in a similar way, although they differ in their evaluation of it. The juxtaposition of these stories and their historical context allows us to conclude that the interests of the state and church authorities coincided on the issue of regulating confessional practices. This part serves as context for the subsequent assessment of the views of 12th-century authors. Part Two of the article describes and examines the phenomenon of a significant increase of the occurrence of the concept of “power” (ἐξουσία) in texts containing reflections on confession. The positions of key 12th-century church canonists are analyzed: Alexius Aristinus, John Zonaras, Theodore Balsamon, and Anonymous, the author of an unpublished commentary on Nomocanon contained in the Codex Sinaiticus 1117. Their ideas about how the “power to bind and loose” arises, exists, and is transmitted in the Church are reconstructed. The correlation of these ideas with the discussions of the 11th century allows us to assert that although Balsamon’s model was the most detailed, it also turned out to be the least organic to the views of its time, which predetermined its fate. In conclusion, a connection is made with the subsequent late Byzantine period, in which the ideas of the previous time were partly adopted and partly abandoned.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Nikolay Konstantinovich Antonov",
          "abstract": "The article continues the study of the principles of constructing the image of a priest in late Antiquity using the example of the “Apology” by St. Gregory the Theologian. It is demonstrated that the literary image of a priest is constructed by using images of other bearers of authority and is thought of as one of them: Gregory uses the topoi and vocabulary of political literature. The key image is that of the Platonic philosopher-ruler, as well as vocabulary from the monarchical rather than democratic tradition. The origin and tradition of using the formula “the art of arts and the science of sciences” (τέχνη τεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἐπιστημῶν), by which the author defines the priesthood, is studied. It is shown that in this way Gregory puts the priest in the place of the philosopher of the Platonic tradition. This is confirmed by an analysis of allusions to Plato’s Gorgias, which contains images of two universal power roles: the rhetorician and the philosopher. The comparison of caring for the soul with medicine, which originates in this dialogue, is further developed by Gregory, who incorporates into it provisions of the Christian gospel and describes principles of spiritual counseling that have no precedent in earlier writings. In addition, the author combines the functions of a rhetorician and a priest in the described image, thus making him a comprehensive leader of the church space, conceptualized by analogy with the polis. In conclusion, a comparison is made with the image of Pythagoras as described by Iamblichus, who, like the priest, combines a political dimension (rule of a community) with a soteriological perspective through varied types of influence on the soul: through public speech, individual communication, example, and a cult. The comparison allows us to see that the priest and the local Church are thought of by Gregory not as a separate new political space with its own power structure, but as its metaphorical projection, universal in defining identity, but not denying the existing political institutions.",

My proposed criteria of membership, durability, and territoriality (Moffett 2025a,b) were intended to get our discussions going.

          "title": "Rethinking Cognitive Biases: An Ecological Perspective on Adaptive Mismatches",
          "authors": "Pier Luigi Sacco",
          "abstract": "The study of cognitive biases has dominated behavioral economics and cognitive psychology for nearly half a century, proposing a view of human cognition as systematically flawed. This chapter presents a fundamental reconceptualization of cognitive biases through the lens of ecological rationality and developmental plasticity. Building on Oeberst and Imhoff's (2023) insight that many biases reflect belief-consistent information processing, we argue that these phenomena may be better understood as instances of adaptive mismatch—situations where cognitive strategies that were adaptive in their original environmental context produce suboptimal results when applied in novel environments. Rather than viewing these mismatches as products of fixed, evolutionarily-designed modules, we propose that they emerge from the flexible reassembly of basic cognitive capabilities through cultural learning processes, as suggested by the cognitive gadgets approach. This framework integrates several theoretical perspectives: the reconceptualization of decision-making as continuous environmental navigation rather than discrete choice; understanding cognitive strategies as ecologically rational adaptations to environmental structure; viewing mismatches as informative signals within a vector field of potential adaptations; and analyzing heuristics through the lens of predictive processing. We provide concrete examples from empirical research that demonstrate how seemingly irrational behaviors can be understood as adaptive responses to specific environmental structures. Our synthesis offers a theoretical integration across multiple research traditions while suggesting new approaches to research methodology and policy intervention. This ecological perspective not only provides a more nuanced account of why cognitive \"biases\" persist but also suggests more effective approaches to education, decision support, and public policy that work with, rather than against, the ecological design of human cognition.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "The newly introduced ‘sealing of public security violation records’ system under the revised Public Security Administration Punishment Law has sparked intense debate due to its implications for public safety expectations concerning highly sensitive activities such as drug-related offences, occupational access boundaries, and data governance risks. This paper refrains from making factual determinations regarding online allegations against any specific individuals or institutions. Instead, it adopts a ‘systemic security governance’ methodology to explore how the legislature can achieve risk containment, factual clarification, and institutional consolidation within the rule of law framework when significant societal doubts arise (including ‘indications of potential external undue influence during the legislative proposal stage’) and supporting regulations have yet to form a rigid closed-loop system. This paper proposes: guided by the normative benchmarks of scientific, democratic, and lawful legislation emphasised in Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, and framed by the risk management principles of coordinating people's security, political security, and institutional security as required by the overall national security outlook, the NPCSC should lawfully arrange for the temporary suspension of Article 136's key application provisions within a specified timeframe. concurrently initiating investigations into specific issues or specialised reviews. This would establish an auditable governance chain of ‘first contain risks, then investigate thoroughly, finally consolidate,’ thereby minimising systemic spillover costs to public safety, data security, and public trust without undermining institutional objectives.",

Si bien estudios internacionales han explorado el impacto de estas plataformas, en el Perú la investigación es aún escasa. El objetivo de este estudio es investigar si las variables género y edad están estadísticamente asociadas al consumo de noticias en las redes sociales. Empleando una muestra representativa de la población adulta en línea (N = 2005), este artículo se enfoca en seis plataformas: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, X —ex-Twitter—, TikTok y WhatsApp. El análisis descriptivo e inferencial, basado en la prueba estadística de chi-cuadrado de Rao-Scott, reveló diferencias significativas según el género en la mayoría de las plataformas examinadas, con los usuarios hombres prefiriendo YouTube y X para consumir noticias, y las mujeres inclinándose hacia TikTok e Instagram. El estudio también halló diferencias según la edad. Facebook y YouTube emergieron como las plataformas dominantes para acceder a noticias, particularmente entre los grupos de mayor edad, mientras que TikTok mostró una tendencia predominante entre los jóvenes de 18 a 29 años. Estos resultados subrayan la complejidad y el dinamismo de los repertorios mediáticos de consumo de noticias en la era digital y la importancia de considerar los factores demográficos como variables clave en el contexto del Perú.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Emil Eldarovich Otakulov",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the origin and development of the legend of Charlemagne’s journey to Jerusalem and Constantinople. Its roots lie in ninth-century Frankish historiography: authors transformed Charlemagne’s diplomatic exchanges with the East into a narrative centered on Caliph Harun al Rachid’s concession of jurisdiction over the holy sites in Jerusalem. The evolution of the Emperor’s image as an ecclesiastical benefactor and collector of relics further contributed to the legend, as sending ambassadors with gifts and meeting pilgrims were replaced by his independent pilgrimage to the Holy Land in search of Passion relics. Charlemagne’s acquisition of relics of the Passion became a politically significant symbol of the transfer of imperial dignity from the Greeks to the Franks, beginning with his imaginary journey to the East. As the idea of a crusading movement developed, the friendship between Harun and Charlemagne faded, and his pilgrimage assumed the characteristics of a military campaign imbued with crusading rhetoric. The sources recounting Charlemagne’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem were composed independently of one another, which precludes the possibility of a continuous development within a single tradition. However, in each case, the author’s perspective may have been shaped by a collective belief in the potential reality of such an occurrence, and adapted to specific contexts. Consequently, Charlemagne’s journey to the East and the liberation of Jerusalem came to be seen as part of a broader sequence of events, alongside emperor Heraclius’ victory over the Sasanian Empire and the First Crusade.\n\nВ статье рассматривается, как возникла и развивалась легенда о путешествии Карла Великого в Иерусалим и Константинополь. Ее истоки можно найти уже в каролингской историографии: авторы преобразовали упоминания о дипломатических отношениях с Востоком в передачу Гроба Господня франкскому императору. Становлению легенды также способствовало и развитие образа Карла как покровителя Церкви и собирателя реликвий, так как обмен послами и встречи паломников сменились его самостоятельным путешествием в Святую землю за реликвиями Страстей Господних. Перенос реликвий играл и важную политическую роль, символизируя преемственность империи на Западе. По мере развития идей крестоносного движения на Восток дружба Карла Великого с Харуном ар-Рашидом исчезла из истории, а его паломничество приобрело милитаристские мотивы в духе крестоносной риторики. Источники, повествующие о путешествии Карла Великого на Восток, были созданы обособленно друг от друга, что не позволяет утверждать о поступательном развитии этого сюжета в рамках единой традиции. Однако авторская позиция в каждом случае могла опираться на сформированное в народе представление о возможности такого события, отчего впоследствии этот сюжет даже вошел в историографию и встроился в череду исторических событий наряду с победой императора Ираклия над персами и Первым крестовым походом.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "Previous studies have established that abrupt and consequential periods of political uncertainty–or “eventful” times–impact political attitudes. But we still know little on whether events can affect political practices. I investigate how eventful times affect levels and socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in frequency of interpersonal political discussion, a consequential political practice and a high quality indicator of sustained political engagement. Drawing from citizen competence and social cognition studies, I hypothesize that events provoke political talk increases that will be moderate and unequalizing relative to SES for adults but large and equalizing for the young. I find empirical support for this expectation by evaluating differences between West Germany and France in political discussion changes before and during German Reunification. I develop and deploy an original quantitative indicator of eventfulness to show that this comparison meets difference-in-differences quasi-experimental conditions that tackles previously unaddressed validity issues related to history and ambiguous causal precedence.",

          "abstract": "How do voting laws impact elections? We highlight how laws targeting a specific group of citizens can have weak effects on turnout and vote shares but substantial effects on policy platforms, thereby influencing substantive representation even if there are no observable effects on participation. To parse these effects, we analyze a model of electoral competition with endogenous turnout and targeted voting costs. Each party anticipates the direct effect of raising one side's voting costs: discouraging targeted citizens from voting. Consequently, both platforms shift towards the untargeted group. These platform adjustments mobilize targeted citizens and demobilize the untargeted, muting the net impact on turnout and vote shares—consistent with empirical evidence for small electoral effects. Policy effects, however, hurt targeted citizens and their aligned party. The targeted group's size amplifies these effects. Our results address party competition, participation, representation, and normative and empirical evaluations of voting laws.",

          "abstract": "Using Brazilian municipal audit reports, I construct an automated corruption index that combines a dictionary of audit irregularities with principal component analysis. The index validates strongly against independent human coders, explaining 71–73 % of the variation in hand-coded corruption counts in samples where coders themselves exhibit high agreement, and the results are robust within these validation samples. The index behaves as theory predicts, correlating with municipal characteristics that prior research links to corruption. Supervised learning alternatives yield nearly identical municipal rankings (R2=0.98), confirming that the dictionary approach captures the same underlying construct. The method scales to the full audit corpus and offers advantages over both manual coding and Large Language Models (LLMs) in transparency, cost, and long-run replicability.",

          "authors": "Jan Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Economic historians increasingly stress that Europe’s early modern economic growth cannot be explained by changes in production alone. Demand-based accounts, notably Jan de Vries’ “Industrious Revolution,” describe a shift toward a “New Luxury” of inventiveness and style, set against older views of consumption driven by emulation. This article argues that such dichotomies obscure the coexistence of Old Luxury (rank and emulation) and New Luxury (innovation and novelty). Their interplay, rather than their succession, expanded consumption by allowing rank to be reaffirmed through innovation. Textile pattern books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exemplify this process. Produced by commercially driven publishers and marketed to women, they diffused design trends while accommodating a hierarchy-oriented moral order. The analysis of prefaces and dedications reveals that a prestige of industriousness was central; yet this did not replace the prestige of noble birth, but rather made it possible to shift distinctions by redefining rank through labor. In this sense, social hierarchy did not stand in the way of innovation through producer–consumer interaction but was, in fact, constitutive of it. However, as the analysis shows, this expansion required design as a luxury based on the virtues of knowledge and labor.",

          "authors": "Marco Mele; Alberto Costantiello; Fabio Anobile; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper evaluates the structural, environmental, and climatic factors influencing carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector (CBE) in 27 European Union member states from 2005 to 2023. This analysis uses panel data from the World Bank and four econometric models—Random Effects, Fixed Effects, Dynamic Panel GMM, and Weighted Least Squares—coupled with machine learning and clustering to provide a robust analysis of emissions. The econometric models show that all models support a negative relationship between agriculture, forestry, and fishing value added (AFFV) and forest area (FRST), suggesting that a robust rural economy and substantial natural carbon sinks are accompanied by lower emissions in the building sector. On the other hand, water stress (WSTR), PM2.5 pollution, heating and cooling degree days, and nitrous oxide emissions (N2OP) are found to significantly, yet positively, affect CBE. Tests of diagnostic analyses support Fixed Effects and Weighted Least Squares models, whereas results from GMM models are limited by instrument validity violations. In machine learning analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models are found to be most diagnostic, with all performance metrics being improved, establishing a prominent role for coal electricity, water stress, agricultural intensities, and climatic factors. Subsequently, a solution with 10 clusters, selected using Bayesian Information Criteria and silhouettes, identified a set of environmental and economic characteristics based on differences between low- and high-emission groups. High-emitting groups result from agricultural intensification, pollution, and low energy efficiency, while low-emitting groups are associated with renewable energy, low pollution, and a favorable climate. This analysis, hence, presents a multifaceted assessment of building sector emissions, with climatic, structural, and energy transition patterns as driving factors for meeting decarbonization targets for the European Union.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost, and that a GDP growth rate lower than the risk-free rate is actually negative. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that probably follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "authors": "Kyle Siler; Philippe Vincent-Lamarre; Vincent Larivière",
          "abstract": "Predatory publishing – for-profit academic publishers and journals publishing academic articles with inadequate quality control – is a professional and societal problem in modern science. Due to their illegitimacy and unprofessionalism, predatory publishers and journals are seldom indexed by major journal bibliographic indices, such as Scopus or the Web of Science. This lack of indexed metadata makes analyzing the predatory publishing market difficult. To fill this gap, we collected journal metadata of corpuses of six probable predatory publishers, comprised of 310,924 articles. We also collected metadata of four other publishers of higher – but contested – legitimacy, to compare with metadata of 54 million articles indexed in the Web of Science. Our research pinpoints precise geographic, institutional and disciplinary sites where probable predatory publishing occurs. Scholars affiliated with developing countries and lower-status institutions disproportionately publish in probable predatory journals. However, since academically central countries and high-status institutions are prolific publishers, they provide much of the money and articles that support the predatory publishing market, even if predatory publishing is a proportionately smaller problem in privileged institutions. Predatory publishing is a worldwide problem, with varying niches and consequences in different institutions and countries. Inequalities in resources and scientific reward structures influence intellectual choices of scholars throughout the world, including propensities for knowingly or naively publishing articles in predatory journals. Research integrity is an emerging axis of stratification in contemporary science.",

          "abstract": "Natural disasters span political boundaries, yet their devastating impacts vary widely across political jurisdictions. I argue that this is because of the differences in political incentives to uphold regulations concerning disaster preparedness. Turkey’s 2023 earthquake provides a rare empirical window to observe the cumulative effects of otherwise hidden political incentives. Leveraging the quasi-random shock of the earthquake, I employ a spatial regression discontinuity design along municipal boundaries in the earthquake region. I treat long-term party rule as the treatment and neighborhood-level destruction as the outcome. The analysis shows that neighborhoods governed by the same municipal party for more than 25 years experienced approximately 20\\% less destruction than their adjacent, politically contested counterparts. These findings translate into substantially lower exposure of hundreds of residents to known disaster risks. The results demonstrate that electoral competition without institutional brakes can deteriorate long-term policy outcomes. My paper underscores the importance of sharing accountability with technocratic oversight in policy areas requiring sustained infrastructural investment, such as disaster preparedness.",

          "abstract": "Abstract. Larger gaps in political engagement between individuals with high and low socioeconomic status (SES) are increasingly viewed as a threat to democratic quality. This paper investigates how such gaps in interpersonal political discussion have evolved in Western Europe over the last fifty years. While prior empirical work has often found these gaps to be stable, leading models of political behavior suggest they should have changed in response to rising economic inequality—though they differ on whether those changes were driven by increases or decreases in participation, and whether they were led by individuals at the top or bottom of the SES distribution. To evaluate these expectations, I analyze nearly one million survey responses from 843 Eurobarometer surveys conducted across 141 time points between 1973 and 2021. I find that SES gaps in political discussion followed an inverse quadratic trajectory: narrowing from the 1970s through the 1990s, and then widening again to levels comparable to those observed in the 1980s. Using Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) models, I identify economic inequality as the strongest predictor of this trend. Its effect, however, is negative—higher inequality is associated with narrower gaps in political discussion. The results also show that the evolution of these gaps was driven largely by shifts in political discussion among high-SES individuals, rather than disengagement among the less advantaged. Overall, the results do not suggest that economic inequality has driven increases in political discussion gaps. Instead, they point to the role that internet expansion and party fragmentation may have played in widening these gaps since the early 2000s.",

          "authors": "Tiziano Antognozzi; Alessandro Crociata; Pier Luigi Sacco",
          "abstract": "The global games industry engages nearly three billion players, yet instrumental applications of\ngames for behavioral change, from gamification to serious games, demonstrate a puzzling\ninconsistency between short-term engagement and long-term outcomes. While these interventions\nconsistently generate initial enthusiasm, meta-analyses reveal that behavioral effects typically\ndiminish beyond three months, with changes rarely persisting after interventions conclude. This\npattern contrasts markedly with games' demonstrable cultural influence as evident in community\nformation, identity development, and sustained engagement over years or decades. We propose that\nthis discrepancy reflects fundamental theoretical inadequacies in how behavioral interventions\nconceptualize games' influence on human behavior.\nDrawing on converging evidence from cultural economics, computational neuroscience, cognitive\nscience, and game studies, we develop a framework that reconceptualizes gameplay as cultural\nmeaning-making rather than behavioral conditioning. The framework articulates how sustainable\nbehavioral transformation emerges through dynamic interactions between four interrelated\ndimensions: games as designed cultural artifacts, play as evolved behavioral disposition, gameplay\nas situated embodied experience, and re-play as reflective cultural practice. Situating this\nframework within active inference and free energy principle perspectives provides computational\nprecision to these meaning-making processes, whereas cognitive gadget theory illuminates how\nplay serves as a foundational environment for constructing distinctively human cognitive capacities.\nCentral to our analysis is what we term the ludic dilemma, a tension between play's intrinsically\nmotivated, autotelic nature and attempts to instrumentalize it for predetermined behavioral\noutcomes. We suggest that this tension helps explain the persistent failures of mechanistic\ninterventions while pointing toward alternative approaches that preserve play's essential qualities\nand enable behavioral transformation through extended cultural processes. The framework\ngenerates testable predictions about temporal dynamics, cross-cultural variations, and\ndevelopmental trajectories that distinguish cultural meaning-making accounts from mechanistic\nalternatives, with implications for an understanding of cultural learning, behavioral change\ninterventions, and human cognitive evolution.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "How do historical events—emergent, intense, and collectively experienced instances of political contingency—generate sweeping bursts of political engagement immediately after they occur? Rational choice perspectives see this capacity as stemming from how events perform as purveyors of information for citizens with exogenous and invariant political identities. Available cultural approaches, by contrast, contend that events politicize by changing the meanings people use to navigate political life. Different as they are, both perspectives assume that events’ politicizing impact remains contained within the domain of political experience. But, since politics is rarely instantiated in everyday life, they cannot fully adequately explain how events generate sweeping political activation. I offer an alternative “spillover” approach to understanding how events produce immediate politicization. I argue that the locus of this influence is located events’ ability to generate semantic disruptions that allow political narratives to infiltrate the stories and identities that guide social action within social domains that have more routinary instantiation. I develop this argument by drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in São Paulo in the wake of the unexpectedly strong victory of right-wing extremist Jair Bolsonaro in the first round 2018 Brazilian presidential election. My observations in public spaces and moments of sociability between left-leaning citizens portray this moment as one characterized by “politicization without politics”. Bolsonaro’s surprising electoral showing intensified feelings of vulnerability, prompting political perceptual and behavioral shifts that were rooted in personal rather than explicitly personal domains of social experience. These spillovers to the personal domain produced an environment of political “engagement without action” where visible political behavior drastically decreased and political conversations and interactions in intimate places skyrocketed.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have established that abrupt and consequential periods of political uncertainty–or “eventful” times–impact political attitudes. But we still know little on whether events can affect political practices. I investigate how eventful times affect levels and socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in frequency of interpersonal political discussion, a consequential political practice and a high quality indicator of sustained political engagement. Drawing from citizen competence and social cognition studies, I hypothesize that events provoke political talk increases that will be moderate and unequalizing relative to SES for adults but large and equalizing for the young. I find empirical support for this expectation by evaluating differences between West Germany and France in political discussion changes before and during German Reunification. I develop and deploy an original quantitative indicator of eventfulness to show that this comparison meets difference-in-differences quasi-experimental conditions that tackles previously unaddressed validity issues related to history and ambiguous causal precedence.",

Further, we examine how a person’s responses compare to their perceptions of how other Americans evaluate racial claims. Using a series of survey experiments, we find that respondents privilege the information contained in genetic ancestry tests over and above other attributes, such as self-identification. We do not observe meaningful differences by race in the treatment effects, illustrating the shared nature of these schemas. However, we find a discordance between respondents’ beliefs and their perceptions of how other Americans would respond in similar settings, suggesting that the attributes that people themselves use in both classifications and to judge authenticity differ from their perceptions of the broader social ‘rules’ regarding race.",

The synthesis of both enables a precise and comprehensive examination of policy and implementation dimensions, yielding critical insights into the schemes’ designs and functioning, and their broader applicability. We find considerable heterogeneity among schemes indicating flexibility for decision-makers to adapt schemes to specific environmental targets at local scale, but that there is still significant room to enhance the role of farmers as key players in collective agri-environmental schemes. By integrating human expertise with the capabilities of large language models, our approach exemplifies how to balance and mitigate the limitations of each, enhancing both the reliability and transparency of the review process.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we build on Emory Bogardus’ classical sociology of distance to develop a relational framework for understanding attitudes related to democratic coexistence. Extending his insight into the political realm, we frame political social distance as the (dis)comfort citizens feel toward supporters of the party they would never vote for, as in-laws, friends, co-workers, or neighbors. Using original survey data from eight European democracies, we show that social trust consistently reduces distance toward political outgroups, while ideological orientation influences this disposition asymmetrically: respondents on the left exhibit higher political social distance than those on the right. Moreover, citizens who attach strong importance to democracy display greater distance toward opponents, a paradox we term democratic exclusivism, grounded in a moral rather than procedural conception of democracy. These findings have important implications for democratic quality, as they reveal both the social foundations that may enable peaceful democratic coexistence and the attitudinal barriers that may gradually weaken it.",

          "authors": "Ruth Eva Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "Parental partnership dissolution appears to hamper educational outcomes among children, but the question of whether this association reflects a causal effect versus selection mechanisms remains contested. By triangulating two quasi-experimental approaches: Children-of-Twins design (CoT) and adoption design, this study assesses the educational penalties of parental partnership dissolution in Norway. Administrative population registers are used to identify adoptees and a matched sample of non-adopted peers. For the CoT-design, these data are linked to the Norwegian Twin Registry, which includes adult twin pairs and their offspring. Both analyses rely on child cohorts born between 1986 and 2006. The CoT-design compares educational outcomes of offspring of twins, exploiting variation in dissolution within and between twin pairs, while the adoption analysis compares the association in adoptees versus a matched sample of non-adopted peers. Two key educational outcomes are analyzed: grade point average (GPA) at the end of compulsory schooling and high school completion. Results from CoT analyses show that parental dissolution is negatively associated with both GPA and high school completion. Yet, the association attenuates once shared family background and genetic factors are accounted for. The adoption design similarly shows a negative association for both adoptees and non-adoptees, but the notably weaker association among adoptees indicates that genetic confounding partly underlies the observed link. Taken together, the findings suggest that parental separation exerts an adverse effect on children’s educational outcomes, while selection mechanisms also account for a non-trivial share of the association.",

          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

Are there scientific cultures that transgress the epistemic dimension, e.g. in technosciences that combine an orientation towards better understanding with an ambition to intervene, control and create, or in so-called post-normal sciences (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1992) that combine an orientation towards better understanding with a mission to address societal problems? How do contemporary innovation regimes impact on scientific cultures and academic living spaces (Felt 2009)? These are the central questions I address in my ‘Rahmenschrift’ and the relating published texts.\nThe ‘Rahmenschrift’ starts with an outline of the initial introduction of the concept of ‘epistemic cultures’ within science and technology studies. It adds further approaches that became influential in our understanding of scientific cultures, like Becher’s (1989) investigation of ‘academic tribes and territories’, higher education research into campus cultures and academic socialisation processes or Lave and Wenger’s work on ‘communities of practice’ (Lave and Wenger 1991, Wenger 1999). This first part of the ‘Rahmenschrift’ ends with an overview of current scholarly discussions that focus on reconstructions of and critical reflections on change in epistemic cultures.\nIn the second part of the Rahmenschrift, I introduce my own engagement with the concept of epistemic cultures that goes back to my PhD project on disciplinary socialisation processes. I then move on to outline my reconstruction of ‘cultures of non-knowledge’ within expert controversies and explain how this research ignited my interest in more-than-epistemic cultures, namely techno-epistemic cultures and post-normal scientific cultures. In a short third part, I summarise the aspects that I see the most central for further developing our understanding of epistemic cultures and for applying this understanding to open questions in science and society.",

          "abstract": "This article revisits the Patriarchy Index (PI) a decade after its introduction, extending its scope to the United States around 1900 and situating it within the broader North Atlantic demographic regime. Using harmonized census microdata from IPUMS USA, NAPP, and Mosaic, we estimate PI values for the 1880 and 1910 U.S. censuses and compare them with contemporaneous European populations. The study provides the first systematic spatial mapping of family-based patriarchy in the United States, disaggregated by race and region, and identifies clusters and anomalies through spatial autocorrelation.\nResults show that U.S. counties at the turn of the twentieth century generally exhibited low levels of family patriarchy, with most values falling within the “low” range defined by earlier research. Yet beneath this pattern, significant internal variation emerges. Certain regions display PI values consistent with the Northwestern European model of weak family structure, while others—especially the South and West—register markedly higher scores, approaching those of Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Racial disaggregation reveals divergent trajectories: white households in parts of the South show moderately elevated PI values, whereas Black households tend to display lower scores, underscoring distinct family-driven gender dynamics.\nBy 1910, the overall trajectory was one of depatriarchalization, with high-PI zones retreating and low values consolidating across most regions. These findings complicate the assumption that the Northwestern European model was simply transplanted into the United States. American regional profiles position themselves between the lower tails of Eastern European values and those of Ireland and Central Europe, while remaining distinct from the “core” North Atlantic populations. Rather than a straightforward transatlantic transfer, the U.S. family system appears as a composite formation: selectively receptive to Northwestern European norms in some regions, while retaining or intensifying patriarchal structures in others.\nThe study underscores both the utility and the limitations of the PI framework. While effective in capturing family-based patriarchal structures in the period under investigation, the index becomes relatively insensitive once very low levels are reached and may not adequately reflect twentieth-century transformations. Future research should supplement the PI at least with dimensions of male and female wage labor to provide a more nuanced account of long-term depatriarchalization.",

The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

From its inception on September 9,2024, to November 12, 2025, the PH led 237 people to traverse 71 distinct routes, delivering a total of 324,186 kilojoules of movement energy to perceive the watercourses. This amount of energy is equivalent to 8 liters of gasoline, although covering the same distance with a motor vehicle would require 2,290 liters of gasoline.It is empirically demonstrated that the bicycle uses 286 times less energy per kilometer than a car to move within the urban site of São Paulo when choosing to pedal along paths that were once obvious but have been buried, obstructed, or erased as possible ways.",

Of the survey participants, 467 agreed to be contacted via text, email, or Zoom for continued post-orientation engagement, and the melt rate for contacted students was 1.93%. On the other hand, the institutional melt rate for all first-year students for that academic term was 21%. Non-resident students exhibited significantly higher melt rates, while first-generation status and race/ethnicity did not significantly predict melt. Behavioral factors such as cannabis use correlated with increased melt likelihood, while self-reported social engagement and financial concerns did not reach statistical significance. Qualitative findings revealed substantial student interest in mental health services, academic support, and logistical guidance, with transfer students expressing increased concerns about social integration. These findings underscore the importance of pre-matriculation support, tailored interventions for non-resident students, and proactive engagement to inform about financial and mental health resources.",

          "authors": "Scott Oatley; Dharmi Kapadia",
          "abstract": "Social class analysis has been a vital component of sociologists’ research agenda for many decades, informing our understanding of social inequalities. However, current measures of social class are, by their neo-Weberian design determined by employment status and occupation. Consequently, measures of social class that are determined by employment relations restrict sociological understandings of social class to concepts related to working life. The study of later life – research that focuses upon the study of ageing and its impacts – typically focuses on individuals that have left the world of work and have entered a retired or semi-retired portion of their lives. To apply current measures of social class to the study of later life presents several challenges. Sociologists are often forced to use a ‘legacy’ class measure that uses an individual’s last recorded occupation prior to retiring. This is problematic, as legacy occupation may not reflect an individual’s current social class location. This paper seeks to remedy these problems by adopting a Bourdieusian inspired framework based on Capitals, Assets, and Resources (CAR) to construct a relevant social class measure for the study of later life. First, we set a theoretical foundation for the construction of this new measure of social class in later life. Then, using multiple correspondence analysis and latent profile analysis, we identified a five-class model of social class for use in later life. Our five-class model constitutes a small but very privileged Elite; followed by an established middle and culturally engaged high earners which make up a decently sized middle class; most respondents fall into a traditional working class with the rest making up a sizeable precariat class. We find a stark composition of social class membership characterised by a sizeable Traditional Working Class and a large Precariat population with a small middle class and tiny but exceptionally privileged Elite. Our findings from formal statistical modelling on determinants of security, stability, and prospects in later life demonstrate that CAR based approaches present clear points of stratification across social classes. This clarity is possible without having to rely on legacy based measures that are tied to forms of employment relations. We also find evidence to support the use of both legacy and CAR based measures of social class in the analysis of later life.",

          "authors": "Selçuk Bedük; Anna Yong",
          "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study examines the trends and drivers of long-term childhood poverty in Britain. Using a life-course perspective, we track poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born between 1991 and 2017. Across these cohorts, on average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the post-1997 welfare reforms, and rose again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. These cross-cohort trends are primarily driven by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors rather than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in 1990s was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, whereas the post-austerity surge stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite deteriorating predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty is a major challenge in Britain and highlight the need to strenghten both redistribution and predistribution to address it.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "The workers of the world have not united. In three successive elections, white workers in the US voted for Donald Trump, many hoping that he would deport immigrant workers who were “taking their jobs.” A century earlier, US labor unions regularly disparaged and excluded Black and Asian workers from their ranks and later berated them as strikebreakers. In anti-oppression movements globally, infighting and backstabbing are rampant: western leftist coalitions have been coopted and pacified by centrist party machines while the center of mainstream politics shifts sharply to the right;  Third World revolutions have given way to despotic postcolonial governments that punch down at indigenous people, racial/ethnic minorities, women, and queer people; and once-victims of genocide have today become perpetrators. \nWhy is it so hard for oppressed peoples to come together in solidarity and sustain movements for change? What role do oppressed groups play in oppressing others, and what role can we all play in bringing forth emancipatory political alternatives? Questions like these have been raised by social psychologists and Marxist organizers, black feminists and social movement theorists. Answers, however, too often fail to make connections across academic literatures and levels of analysis. Some blame capitalist ideology, while others blame material conditions, and still others point to psychological predispositions. \nErich Fromm, I argue, offers a way out of the impasse. More than most, Fromm explored why and how people act contrary to rational self-interest. Why did the German masses choose Nazism over Marxian class solidarity? Why did the US populace allow itself to be taken in by mediocre consumerism? To answer both questions, Fromm suggests that our fundamental human need for relatedness leads us to seek social acceptance by conforming to the dominant character of our society. Individual personalities are brought into alignment with the wider character structure by way of social filters that inculcate some traits and suppress others. Unhealthy societies tend to produce similarly unhealthy relational patterns, which Fromm terms socially-patterned defects, while repressing more productive orientations. \nPutting Fromm—and those he influenced, like Paulo Freire and bell hooks—into conversation with Marx, Foucault, Collins, and others, I develop a model of complicity of the oppressed wherein marginalized people seek to elevate themselves by cooperating in the oppression of others. Insofar as capitalism fosters competition and filters out solidaristic tendencies, marginalized people tend to choose narrow self-advancement over broad movements for change. Complicity of the oppressed is a socially-patterned defect, a byproduct of intersecting oppressions that turn people against one another. The challenge, then, is to readjust our filters toward love and solidarity.",

It synthesizes research on the conditions under which mass mobilization contributes to democratic transitions, deepening, and consolidation, as well as when it facilitates authoritarian resurgence and democratic backsliding. The review covers key debates on tactics, class composition, organizational infrastructure, ideological framing, and regime type. It also analyzes the evolving role of civil society, digital media, and participatory institutions in both enabling and constraining democratic outcomes. While much of the earlier literature emphasized the democratizing potential of collective action, recent studies reveal a more ambivalent picture in which mass mobilization can bolster authoritarian incumbents or lead to fragmented political settlements. The essay concludes by outlining key directions for future research, including attention to discursive contestation, and the organizational strategies of both pro- and anti-democratic movements.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Despite the Third Reich's efforts to rewrite German history, post-WWII scholars and activists have worked valiantly to unearth the inspiring legacies of Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee (WhK) before Nazi takeover. But by lionizing Hirschfeld, these same scholars/activists have too often erased (1) WhK’s limitations, (2) other, less savory competitor groups like the masculinist Community of the Self-Possessed (GdE) and collaborationist Human Rights League (BfM), and (3) surprisingly generative critiques put forth by these latter groups. In a comparative-historical analysis of WhK, GdE, and BfM organizers, I suggest that fin-de-siècle German capitalism inculcated an illusory proximity to power that limited organizers' insights into bourgeois heteronormative German society and their precarious place within it. Despite criticizing some particulars, all of these activists nonetheless identified with and demonstrated adherence to classist models of normative Germanness by excluding other gender- and sexually-nonconforming people. WhK medicalists constructed themselves as upright, learned \"homosexual\" professionals against criminalized \"pseudohomosexual\" sex workers; GdE masculinists constructed their Hellenistic literary circle of enlightened \"homoerotic\" against crude, hypersexual, effeminate decadents. BfM homonormatives constructed themselves as respectable, everyday middle-class citizen-subjects against perverse, pathological, in-your-face activists. These attempts to gain inclusion at one another’s expense undermined their ability to work together and with other oppressed groups. Apart from a brief rapprochement, these competing groups constantly distinguished themselves from and denigrated one another. Hidden beneath this impulse is, to borrow from current discourse about Trump supporters, a sense of being “temporarily embarrassed elites\" that obscured friend from foe and obscured their extreme vulnerability to the coming storm of fascist reaction. I conclude by bringing the strengths and limitations of these three groups to bear on the current fascist, genocidal moment, suggesting that learning from their mistakes and capitalizing on their strengths is essential for bringing about a non-fascist movement, society, and world.",

          "abstract": "In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive mandate informed consent for behavioural advertising and use of tracking technologies. However, the ubiquity of consent banners and popups has led to widespread consent fatigue and questions regarding the effectiveness of these mechanisms in protecting users' data. In contrast, users in California and other US jurisdictions can utilize Global Privacy Control (GPC), a browser-based privacy signal that automatically broadcasts a legally binding opt-out request to websites. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, GPC can be adapted to the EU legal framework to mitigate consent fatigue and improve privacy protections for EU residents.\n\nWe analyse GPC as a technical specification standardized at the World Wide Web Consortium and examine its standing under current EU data protection law. Generally, GPC can be mapped to the various legal bases for processing under the GDPR. However, our evaluation also identifies friction between the GPC specification and EU data protection law as it stands. These discrepancies are resolvable and present an opportunity for EU legislators and regulators to interpret GPC in alignment with EU data protection requirements, particularly, considering the European Commission’s recent Digital Omnibus proposal. We conclude that while GPC is not a silver bullet, its adoption—supported by clear authoritative guidance and specification updates—can offer a pragmatic path toward more automated and effective data protection in the EU.",

          "authors": "Samadhi Lipari",
          "abstract": "It is no mystery that we are living in times of multiple ecological crises. Not only are phenomena such as climate change, widespread pollution, biodiversity loss, and soil artificialisation threatening irreversibly the ‘natural’ world. They imperil human society too, for human society is part of nature.\nTaking a historical materialist perspective, this thesis understands those crises as originating in capitalist social relations, which maximise the exploitation of both human labour and the ecosystems. The thesis maintains that mainstream responses to the crises are fully framed within the capitalist paradigm of perpetual and privatised ‘accumulation for accumulation’s sake’, only now legitimised through ‘green’ credentials. Building on theoretical and political approaches calling for the incorporation of an ‘ecological’ rationality within capitalist relations, these responses articulate faith in and commitment to the modernisation of productive cycles and governance systems, from which a more sustainable – ‘green’ – capitalist economy can apparently arise.\nDifferently, this thesis interprets such a ‘green’ turn as capitalism’s adaptation and expansion in the context of the ecological crises. The thesis deploys and innovates a range of historical materialist categories to analyse the relationship between the ‘green’ as an accumulation opportunity and its leveraging as a legitimation framework.\nEmpirically, the thesis investigates the accumulation of surplus value in and around renewable energy generation at the level of production areas, the enclosure and trans-formative processes it triggers, the class and factional cleavages it entails, and the regulatory mechanisms and legitimation narratives to which it is associated. Methodologically, it combines a comprehensive theoretical elaboration with case studies in southern Italy on wind energy and in eastern Germany on agricultural biogas.\nThe thesis maintains that under capitalism, renewable energy generation expands accumulation frontiers over not yet or ‘inefficiently’ commodified spaces and natures. This occurs through their privatisation and abstraction into fictitious capital –that is through their commodification and financialization. In contrast with marginalist approaches, this thesis reconciles the socially necessary labour time theory of value with political ecology. It rejects the assumption that privatised spaces and natures might ‘innately’ provide exchange value, maintaining that they serve as a collateral to capture –by way of rent- surplus value produced in society at a different point in time and space.\nSecondly, the thesis defines ‘green’ capitalism as a hegemonic project in the making. This is characterised by two dialectics: one tending to restructure the forces and relations of production; the other to re-build hegemonic narratives and apparatuses, around re-significations of the ‘green’ made compatible with sustained accumulation.",

          "abstract": "We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Such conflicts are often asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger normative constraints on acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game. This framework yields two outcomes—cyclic authoritarian resurgence through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist–authoritarian coalition excluding resistance—depending on confrontation responses. We demonstrate how an established dynamical framework with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions clarifies conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.",

We analyze more than 2,500 political prediction markets traded across the Iowa Electronic Markets, Kalshi, PredictIt, and Polymarket during the final five weeks of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign involving more than than two billion dollars in transactions to assess whether prices accurately and efficiently aggregate political information.  While 93\\% of PredictIt markets correctly predicted outcomes better than chance on the Election Night eve, the average accuracy was 78\\% on Kalshi and 67\\% on Polymarket among all active political markets. Even the most accurate markets showed little evidence of efficiency: prices for identical contracts diverged across exchanges, daily price changes were weakly correlated or negatively autocorrelated, and arbitrage opportunities peaked in the final two weeks before Election Day. Together, these findings challenge the view that prediction markets necessarily efficiently and accurately aggregate information about political outcomes and suggest that traders often react not only to political developments but also to the dynamics of the markets themselves.",

This paper tests the argument that segregation leads to White\nadvantage and, simultaneously, Black disadvantage. To do so, I link 1905-1920 birth cohorts in the 1940 Census\nto Social Security death records and use an instrumental-variable design leveraging variation in government\nfragmentation to estimate the effect of segregation on longevity. Estimates reveal a 10-point increase in\nsegregation reduced Black and White longevity by 0.44 and 0.29 years, respectively, with pronounced harms\nfor less-educated Whites.

The second Trump administration has systematized this violence through unprecedented expansion, dismantling of oversight, and concentration of executive authority. Drawing on government policy, administrative datasets, facility records, and case documentation, the analysis demonstrates how detention institutionalizes medical neglect, retaliation, solitary confinement, reproductive coercion, language exclusion, deathbed releases, and jurisdictional manipulation as routine administrative practice. Bilateral transfer agreements extend this system extraterritorially, outsourcing custody to sites of documented torture where U.S. officials create conditions meeting the legal definition of enforced disappearance. The article theorizes this configuration as extractive authoritarianism, a mode of governance where legal formalism enables capital accumulation through the exploitation of civil vulnerability. This framework advances critical socio-legal scholarship by demonstrating how procedural compliance produces structural violence within formally lawful systems. It reveals the persistence of detention’s harms across cycles of reform and establishes the necessity of abolitionist responses.",

Nesterenko (2023) looked beyond Donald Trump at the Republican Party at large and found a pattern of manipulative effect in Republican discourse supporting Russia in the Russian-Ukrainian war. This raises many important questions for researchers. What is the political motivation for Republicans to side with Russia against Ukraine? How did this come to be? To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of Russian speech manipulation strategies in Republican discourse. Continuous sampling of Republican discourse employed pattern analysis and purposive and random selection to establish a corpus of 10 quotes presented as a series of historical episodes forming a narrative with a plot. Pragmatic analysis and critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies consistent with Russian thinking of reflexive control connected across speakers and generations. The findings reject the “ideological asymmetry hypothesis” and support the novel “freedom grift hypothesis” which proposes conservatives’ unique susceptibility to political misrepresentations is the result of covert Russian information warfare. This exploratory study supports the need for further speech manipulation research of Republican discourse from a historical perspective as a matter of urgent global security.",

          "abstract": "By using mostly binary measures of individuals’ sex or gender category, most existing quantitative social science literature has underestimated variations in gender self-concepts among cisgender individuals as well as increasing transgender or non-binary identifications. Some recent mostly non-representative studies from the US, Germany and Sweden have proposed novel gradational measures based on self-rating of masculinity and femininity. We extend these studies by systematically exploring how gender identification and self-perceived (non-)conformity relate to gender socialisation and performance in different domains as well as to gender equality in political, economic and normative dimensions across European regions. We draw on European Social Survey data collected in 2023/24 and apply multi-level regression models for 37,587 individuals across 199 regions of 26 European countries. The results show the expected associations of gender identification and non-conformity with bodily characteristics and personality traits, regional gender regimes and partly with relationships but not with labour market- and care-related aspects. We find some systematic variation in these associations across gender regimes pointing to altered meanings of masculinity and femininity. On the whole, gradational measures of gender identification are promising to include in future quantitative studies to complement gender category and domain-specific beliefs but contextual comparisons require adjustments to improve comparability.",

I first document a negative relationship between being a seigneurial town and central state capacity in ancien-regime Spain. Next, I focus on the Kingdom of Granada after its conquest by Castile in 1492 to leverage on that the initial distribution of lordships was conditionally exogenous, with the results corroborating the negative effect of lordships on state capacity. I further show two additional important results. First, the effect is very persistent, with former lordships towns featuring less state capacity almost a century after the abolition of the seigneurial regime. Second, there is a non-monotonic effect on economic growth. Contrary to conventional wisdom, lordships towns did not underperform royal towns during the Ancien Régime. Yet, despite not having started with disadvantage, former seigneurial towns experienced lower population growth from the 1910s onwards, a period in which the Spanish state started to play a bigger investment role. Thus, towns with historically less state presence benefited less from state’s investments, lagging behind.",

          "authors": "Judith Bopp",
          "abstract": "In times of exacerbating agro-food crises, understanding farming through its constituting interrelated factors is a key element of crisis mitigation. The mostly linear approaches such as represented in the current agricultural discourses and by the agricultural sciences fall short in explaining the real-life complexities and overlapping crises experienced by small-scale farmers.\nBased on my recent qualitative fieldwork in Thailand, this paper aims to picture the complexities within which households' farming practices operate, and how these arise from a web of socio-cultural, political, economic, and ecological factors.\nBy pleading for relational approaches to farming such as those acknowledging its immanent human-ecology interaction, this paper suggests a novel \"health-nutrition-ecology\" nexus to guide enquiry into the intimate relations between ecology, livelihoods, and health and well-being. It is employed to gain understanding of small-farming households' situations, deep-rooted causes of these, and their resilience in facing crises. \nThe paper further pleads for a shift in existing technocratic agricultural discourses towards their inclusiveness of real-world narratives by small-scale farmers. These narratives can deliver insights for policies that aim at actual transformations of crisis-prone agro-food systems and could benefit both farmer livelihoods and farm ecologies.",

We propose a reliability metric that is easily interpretable and agnostic to the type of relation. The metric, which we call the anchor reliability coefficient (or relco), is found by creating a synthetic document-term matrix of simulated documents that sequentially shift more of their probability mass from relation-relevant anchor terms to randomly drawn words, and then regressing the documents' similarity to an induced relation by the inverse randomness rank of the documents. We validate the metric at the word-level with both expert- and crowd-sourced dictionaries and at the document-level with expert-annotated social media posts.",

This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious \ntrade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML \ntechniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. \nAnomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price\nper-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers \nare combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for \ncustoms review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than \ngeneral goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the \nmost significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in \nearly 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

This paper studies a ‘fly less’ cohort, overlooked by academic studies to date, offering a real-world case study for conceptualising net zero academic practices. A survey with open and closed questions was designed to analyse the experiences of ‘fly less’ HE staff and post-graduate research students at the University of Leeds (n=86), i.e. self-declared as purposefully reducing their flying for their employment or studies. This study reveals that, first, responsibility for flying less policies need to exist at different scales, weighted more firmly to higher institutional scales; second, flying related to academic fieldtrips and ‘internationalisation’ present major obstacles to fully decarbonizing HEIs; and third, in terms of personal and professional impact on staff and students, the benefits of flying less academic practices are likely to outweigh the harms. In the short-term, HE leadership must engage with whole-institution accountability and ‘hard’ policy interventions, such as carbon budgets. In the longer term, academics and HE leaders must innovate and creatively transition towards net zero academic practices in all areas, as part of degrowth transition that is ethical, participatory, planned and collective.",

          "abstract": "Public opinion towards migration increasingly shapes political discourse and policy agendas. Yet, traditional surveys lack spatial and temporal granularity needed to detect local variation and rapid shifts in sentiment. Leveraging a dataset of 925,000 tweets from 2013-2022, we examine how local contexts influence sentiment towards migration across Great Britain. Using natural language processing, we extract sentiment from tweets, linking them to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics at the district level. Our analysis reveals stark geographical divides: anti-migration sentiment is more prevalent in areas that are older, less diverse and with lower rates of higher education. We find an intensification of polarisation after the 2016 Brexit referendum, with rises in both pro- and anti-migration expression and identify short-term fluctuations in sentiment corresponding to real-world events. Contrary to group threat theory, we find no association between short-term migration and negative sentiment. Instead, long-term demographic factors – particularly the presence of migrants – are positively associated with sentiment, supporting contact-based explanations. By capturing both the structural and dynamic dimensions of migration sentiment, we advance understanding of how local contexts mediate public sentiment. These findings demonstrate the value of digital trace data in complementing surveys and offer a methodological blueprint for future research.",

          "abstract": "This paper theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the paper reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This paper conducts a systematic critical analysis of Professor Lao Dongyan of Tsinghua University's public discourse advocating for Zhao Hong of Peking University and supporting the ‘sealing system for public order offences such as drug use’. The analysis is grounded within the normative framework constituted by Marxist legal principles and Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law. The research aims to examine the consistency and tensions between her argumentative system and the Marxist legal stance, as well as the overall national security outlook. Methodologically, this study first abstractly reconstructs Professor Lao's core argumentative chains concerning record sealing, cyberspace governance, and criminal law restraint, delineating her premises, problem definitions, and reasoning pathways. Subsequently, employing a multi-level logical diagnostic approach, we conduct a dual examination of both form and substance at the levels of semantic premises, problem structures, and rules of inference. This analysis is normatively contrasted with Marxist jurisprudence's ‘people-centred approach,’ ‘class analysis,’ and ‘historical and structural perspectives,’ as well as Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law's comprehensive national security outlook and its tripartite framework of ‘security-development-rights.’ The findings indicate that while the argument offers valuable insights in clarifying the boundaries between public order offences and criminal acts, resisting over-criminalisation, and countering ‘public opinion trials,’ it exhibits several structural biases. These include: narrowing the concept of ‘the people’ to a specific rights-bearing group; simplifying the security-development-rights triad into a unidimensional opposition between ‘state power and individual rights’; overemphasising risks to rights, confounding factual and value judgements, and flattening heterogeneous critiques into a homogeneous discursive object. The conclusion posits that this logic system centred on ‘rights-risk-technological governance’ is only partially compatible with Marxist jurisprudence. Overall, it has yet to genuinely address the value hierarchy demanding ‘people's security as the purpose, political security as the foundation, and national interests as paramount.’ Therefore, in institutional debates concerning drug governance and internet governance, it is necessary to conduct substantive calibration and reconstruction of relevant theoretical discourses and institutional designs, while upholding the people's stance and the overall national security outlook.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, prominent politicians and commentators have attributed low and declining fertility to values associated with the political left, such as social liberalism, feminism, and secularism. Exploring how political orientation relates to childbearing can improve the understanding of the role values play in contemporary fertility patterns. Yet, empirical evidence on this relationship remains limited. This study examines how multiple dimensions of political orientation relate to the achieved number of children among individuals aged 40-79 in 16 Western European countries, using data from round 9 of the European Social Survey (collected in 2018-2020). A significant positive association between right-leaning self-placement on the left/right scale and fertility is found in Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Spain, whereas the association is non-significant in the other 12 countries. Social conservatism is positively associated with fertility in most countries, whereas economic egalitarianism, immigrant hostility, and pro-environmentalism are, in most cases, not significantly related to fertility. The strongest associations between party preference and fertility appear in Finland and Spain, where voters for right-wing parties tend to have more children than voters for left-wing parties. In half of the examined countries, voters for conservative or Christian democratic parties have significantly more children than voters from at least one leftist or liberal/centrist party family. However, several countries show no significant fertility differences by party preference. Overall, the findings highlight substantial variation in the relationship between political orientation and fertility, across countries and across different dimensions of political and value orientation.\n\nKeywords: political preferences, fertility, value orientation, social conservatism, nationalism, climate change, environment, European Social Survey",

Nine policy instruments stood out for their high perceived potential, feasibility, and independence from economic growth: phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, greening credit regulations, North-South technology transfer, carbon consumption taxes, long-term warranties, repair infrastructure, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, ecological education, and environmental justice-focused education. Perceptions of higher policy potential were closely associated with greater perceived feasibility and a degrowth orientation in respondents’ own work.

          "abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has the potential to improve farming efficiency globally, with decision support tools (DSTs) representing a particularly promising application. However, evidence from medical and financial domains reveals a user reluctance to accept AI-based recommendations, even when they outperform human alternatives. This is a phenomenon known as “algorithm aversion” (AA). This study is the first to examine this phenomenon in an agricultural setting. Drawing on survey data from a representative sample of 250 German farmers, we assessed farmers’ intention to use and their willingness-to-pay for DSTs for wheat fungicide application either based on AI or a human advisor. We implemented a novel Bayesian probabilistic programming workflow tailored to experimental studies, enabling a joint analysis that integrates an extended version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with an economic experiment. Our results indicate that AA plays an important role in farmers’ decision-making. For most farmers, an AI-based DST must outperform a human advisor by 11–30% to be considered equally valuable. Similarly, an AI-based DST with equivalent performance must be 21–56% less expensive than the human advisor to be preferred. These findings signify the importance of examining AA as a cognitive bias that may hinder the adoption of promising AI technologies in agriculture.",

          "abstract": "The fate of the energy transition hinges not only on the existence of well-crafted policies, but also on their successful implementation, oftentimes by conglomerates of local actors. Usually involving both public and private parties without clear hierarchies, local implementation of policy is a process of multi-stakeholder governance and often characterized by difficult collective decision-making due to different perceptions of challenges and priorities. A good example of this process is energy and heat planning, which involves several local stakeholders with different hierarchical structures. In this paper, we study the evaluation of challenges and success factors among municipalities and utilities in the context of heat planning in Germany. Based on a survey of 267 communal stakeholders, we find an effect of inversion in juxtaposing importance and difficulty ratings: While municipalities perceive factors such as effective communication, clearly defined responsibilities and concrete measures and projects as more important than their utility counterparts, utilities see them as more challenging. Such perceptual inversion has the potential to complicate collective goal-setting and decision-making and thus can slow down energy transition governance processes.",

Drawing on three complementary studies in Germany—including analyses of nationally representative survey data (Study 1), a dating app field experiment (Study 2), and a choice experiment conducted on a national probability sample (Study 3)—we find the following: Women and men in gender-atypical jobs are less likely to be partnered; having a gender-atypical job causally reduces dating success for moderately attractive individuals; and young, highly educated women anticipate these “occupational partnership penalties.” These results suggest that romantic considerations contribute to gender segregation in the workplace as occupational choices may not just be shaped by wages and interests but also by hidden social costs.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the vulnerabilities of traditional bureaucratic governance structures in responding effectively to rapid, large-scale crises. This paper presents a detailed case study of Rinascimento, an innovative urban recovery program launched in Bergamo, Italy—one of the epicenters of the early pandemic. It explores how an adhocratic governance model, characterized by :lexibility, decentralization, and cross-sector collaboration, was employed to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis. The program was implemented through a public-private-nonpro:it partnership involving the Municipality of Bergamo, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank, and CESVI, a local humanitarian NGO. Drawing on collaborative governance and network theories, the Rinascimento initiative combined emergency grants and impact investment loans to support nearly 4,500 small businesses and professionals. The paper analyzes the design and operational mechanisms of the adhocracy, its rapid decision-making capabilities, and its emphasis on real-time learning and adaptation. Empirical evaluation using key performance indicators demonstrates the program’s effectiveness in enhancing business resilience, reducing business mortality rates, and fostering economic regeneration. The :indings underscore the potential of adhocratic models in municipal crisis management and offer scalable insights for future governance frameworks addressing systemic shocks.",

Theories of assimilation neglect the state's role in shaping the relationship between structural assimilation (into host institutions) and cultural assimilation (adopting host society rather than origin markers). I argue that legalization enables simultaneous structural assimilation and cultural maintenance. Unauthorized status creates institutional barriers that stall structural assimilation, while deportation threat compels legal passing—concealing ethnic markers to avoid detection. Legalization reverses both dynamics, enabling institutional participation while removing enforcement costs of cultural expression. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, I examine DACA (2012) and IRCA (1986). Both policies improve structural assimilation: English ability, employment, and civic participation, while enabling cultural maintenance (reflected in naming distinctiveness). This effect is strongest in high-deportation counties, consistent with abandonment of legal passing. The findings suggest immigrants inherently value their culture: when enforcement threat is removed, choices reflect authentic preferences, challenging theories framing cultural maintenance as reactive or instrumental.",

Drawing on panel data collected before and after the overhaul's announcement, we show that citizens vary substantially in their conception of democracy, and that a thick conception not only predicts protesting against backsliding but also moderates the role of other key factors in mobilizing against democratic erosion.

          "abstract": "The newly revised Law of the People’s Republic of China on Penalties for Public Order Violations introduces a “system for sealing public order violation records,” with the inclusion of acts such as drug use triggering intense public debate. Zhao Hong, a researcher at Peking University Law School, has defended this system by arguing that drug use is an administrative rather than criminal offence, that sealing reflects a civilised tolerance for error and rehabilitation, and that contemporary governance should reject archaic “branding”-style stigmatisation. This article reconstructs Zhao’s core arguments and, drawing on Marxist legal theory, Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law and key anti-drug directives, formal logic and argumentation theory, as well as comparative Western experience with criminal record sealing/expungement, conducts a multidimensional critique. It finds that while his distinctions between public order versus criminal offences and sealing versus expungement are conceptually clarifying and broadly aligned with global trends of destigmatisation and social reintegration, his discourse reveals significant blind spots in class analysis, the people’s standpoint and holistic security thinking: it insufficiently exposes the class structures and inequalities behind drug problems, fails to fully address the tension between people’s security and individual rights, and inadequately internalises Xi Jinping’s requirements for zero tolerance in drug control, bottom-line thinking and the coordination of security and development. Logically, his reasoning overgeneralises from minor cases to a quasi-universal sealing regime and tends to answer public security anxieties by appealing to a moralised ideal of “modern rule of law civilisation,” thereby displacing rigorous risk assessment. From a comparative law perspective, Western jurisdictions more commonly adopt a refined “tiered–conditional–exceptional” model that excludes acts gravely endangering public safety from blanket sealing while relying on strict procedures and ex post review. The paper concludes that for China’s sealing regime for public security violations to embody socialist humanitarian concern while remaining consistent with the overall national security outlook and the practical logic of the “people’s war” on drugs, it must incorporate graded sealing, strict exceptions, procedural participation and dynamic assessment, and at the same time return, at the theoretical and discursive levels, to the people-centred and practice-oriented commitments of Marxist jurisprudence and Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law.",

          "title": "The politics of modelling",
          "authors": "Andrea Saltelli",
          "abstract": "Models are ruled by a politics whereby the epistemic authority borrowed from mathematics offers to modellers a considerable power to make their voice heard in the making, evaluating\nand monitoring of policy. This may lead to a misuse of models, in that they are used to de-politicize issues that are political. Paradoxically, this type of political use of models is at its greatest when models can be presented as apolitical, based on pure facts and their scientific manipulation, thus veiling the normative assumptions that necessarily underpin any given modelling activity. I illustrate\nwhat is peculiar or exceptional in the use of models with examples from various fields, including epidemiology, ecology, economics, and climate change, and reconnect this analysis with existing historical and sociological literature on quantification in general and models specifically. I also consider briefly what existing guidelines and checklists for responsible\nmodelling can and cannot do, cautioning about the medium- and long-term dangers associate with model misuse.",

          "title": "When Autocracies Dominate International Organizations: Evidence from the UN Committee on NGOs",
          "authors": "Christoph Steinert",
          "abstract": "Scholars have documented a global trend toward autocratization and demonstrated that autocracies increasingly use their influence to shape decisions in international organizations (IOs). But what happens when autocratic states become so influential that they dominate decision-making in IOs and which types of organizations are most prone to autocratic takeover?  The study presents a novel theory on autocratic influence in IOs, which argues that an interplay of IOs’ (i) thematic focus, (ii) membership composition, and (iii) decision rules explains the scale of autocratic influence. The theory further highlights how member selection processes within the UN’s regional groups can facilitate disproportionate autocratic representation. The study leverages evidence from two original datasets on the decisions of the UN Committee on NGOs between 1998 and 2024 to test whether the theorized conditions linked to autocratic influence can translate into autocratic dominance in practice. Multi-pronged evidence demonstrates that autocracies have effectively seized the UN Committee on NGOs and exploit it to systematically defer and reject the applications of liberal NGOs. A comparative analysis with the ECOSOC highlights that a disproportionate autocratic representation in the Committee’s membership is the key mechanism that explains autocratic dominance. The study contributes to our understanding of illiberal challenges to the liberal international order with a new theory, original data, and novel empirical evidence.",

          "title": "Moral Citizenship of Care in India: Testing the Boundary of a Western Theory of Philanthropy",
          "authors": "John CH Godfrey",
          "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that Paul Schervish and colleagues’ theoretical modelling of philanthropic behaviour is applicable outside its original US boundary. The research uses empirical data collected from interviews with elite Indian philanthropists to test whether this theory can be extended to Indian elite philanthropy. The paper initially proposes that the Schervish model is the most appropriate for this test of the theories currently developed for understanding the values, beliefs, and motives of elite philanthropists. Testing against the data from India found that it was a suitable model for understanding the philanthropic behaviour of the Indian elite, and could be considered by fundraisers and policy makers globally.",

          "title": "Responding to the Crises of Symbol and Subject in Modernity: Towards a Generative Nomos of Relational Presence",
          "authors": "Wanhong HUANG",
          "abstract": "Subjectivity constitutes a fundamental condition for human understanding and participation in the world. Its emergence, construction, presence, and transformation have long preoccupied philosophical inquiry. This paper examines the epistemological and ontological disintegration characteristic of late modernity, which is a condition in which the mediations that once sustained meaning and subjectivity lose coherence. We refer to this condition as the Symbolic Crisis: a rupture in the symbolic order's mediating function that fractures relationality at both the ontological and structural levels. The crisis appears in phenomena such as the erosion of trust, the weakening of shared meaning, and the growing separation between lived relation and symbolic representation. \n\nOur intervention centers on two concepts: relationality and generative presence. We introduce these as theoretical orientations: relationality provides an ontological foundation through which existence becomes apprehensible beyond the limits of symbolic articulation. Generative presence describes the epistemic and phenomenological process through which relational being becomes active in lived experience, even as the metaphysical subject remains structurally open. Through presence, relational beings bring forth meaning and allow existence to manifest within concrete situations. \n\nWithin this framework, law and justice appear as forms of symbolic mediation whose force emerges from the interplay between formal structures and the generativity expressed in interpretive and practical engagement. These structures, however, cannot address the Symbolic Crisis on their own, because the crisis originates in the widening separation between being and its mediation. The juridical movement reorients justice toward relational being and the ongoing processes through which its authority and meaning are produced and sustained. The extra juridical movement cultivates the formation and expressive realization of generative presence within relational existence. Together, these movements offer a pathway for reapproaching the subject and for restoring the resonance between being and meaning under contemporary conditions of symbolic fragmentation.",
