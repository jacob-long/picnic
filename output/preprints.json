          "title": "Social Value Transformation among Generation Z: Construction of Ecological Awareness through Social Media in the Perspective of Contemporary Sociology",
          "authors": "ANINDHITO PRAYOGA",
          "abstract": "This article discusses the transformation of social values among Generation Z, particularly in the construction of ecological awareness through social media. Generation Z lives in a highly dynamic digital era, where social interaction occurs both directly and virtually. Using the theoretical approaches of social construction (Berger &amp; Luckmann), diffusion of innovations (Rogers), and symbolic interactionism (Blumer), this study explains how ecological values are formed through interaction, symbols, and digital visualizations. The findings indicate that Generation Z plays an active role in producing, disseminating, and sustaining environmental values in digital spaces. This awareness is not merely individual but has become part of a shared social construction. The study also highlights the role of educational institutions, communities, and public figures in reinforcing ecological norms as part of a new social culture.\n\nKeywords: Generation Z, social values, ecological awareness, social media, social construction",

          "authors": "Peder Mortvedt Isager; Anna Elisabeth van 't Veer; Daniel Lakens",
          "abstract": "The primary goal of our target article (Isager et al., 2021) is to give the research community an example of what a well-justified replication value metric could look like, and to encourage discussion of how replication value could be quantified in practice. Furthermore, in the target article we discuss practical hurdles to quantification and possible practical applications for RVCn and other metrics. As that article proposes a method for how to do research–in this case a method to select which claims in the literature need replication most–it is important to receive criticism, feedback, and viewpoints from a diverse range of authors interested in this topic. We are delighted to read the many thoughtful yet critical commentaries, several of which proposing adjustments or alternatives to the equations we have proposed in the target article. This is very encouraging to see, as our aim with initiating this call in Meta-Psychology was to create an open dialogue in the scientific record. RVCn is an efficient but limited metric. Its limitations should be laid bare, and we fully expect that improved metrics and selection procedures can be created in the future. We hope our target article and these commentaries together will inspire readers to continue the discussion of how to efficiently and transparently select studies for replication.",

          "title": "Meta-regression to explain shrinkage and heterogeneity in large-scale replication projects",
          "authors": "Rachel Heyard; Leonhard Held",
          "abstract": "Recent large-scale replication projects (RPs) have estimated concerningly low reproducibility rates. Further, they reported substantial degrees of shrinkage of effect size, where the replication effect size was found to be, on average, much smaller than the original effect size. Within these RPs, the included original-replication study-pairs can vary with respect to aspects of study design, outcome measures, and descriptive features of both original and replication study population and study team. This often results in between-study-pair heterogeneity, i.e., variation in effect size differences across study-pairs that goes beyond expected statistical variation. When broader claims about the reproducibility of an entire field are based on such heterogeneous data, it becomes imperative to conduct a rigorous analysis of the amount and sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity within\nand between included study-pairs. Methodology from the meta-analysis literature provides an approach for quantifying the heterogeneity present in RPs with an additive or multiplicative parameter. Meta-regression methodology further allows for an investigation into the sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity. We propose the use of location-scale meta-regressions as a means to directly relate the identified characteristics with shrinkage (represented by the location) and heterogeneity (represented by the scale). This provides valuable insights into drivers and factors associated with high or low reproducibility rates and therefore contextualises results of PRs. The proposed methodology is illustrated using publicly available data from the Replication Project Psychology and the Replication Project Experimental Economics. All analysis scripts and data are available online.",

          "abstract": "Reproducibility concerns in biomedical research have persisted for over a decade, with large-scale assessments revealing significant challenges in replicating findings. Despite widespread acknowledgement of these issues, responses remain inconsistent, and proposed solutions often lack rigorous evaluation. This review examines the factors that contribute to irreproducibility in conducting, reporting, and reviewing research and assesses the effectiveness and desirability of interventions aimed at improving reproducibility. It highlights the need for balanced scientific reforms that strengthen reproducibility without stifling innovation or introducing unintended consequences. A critical appraisal of the role of meta-research is essential to ensure sustainable improvements in research quality.",

          "authors": "Patrick E. Savage",
          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesises recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates including universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The book is accessibly written using over 50 figures/tables and an interactive tutorial with audio examples, with each chapter designed to be readable/teachable on its own. It is designed to be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "title": "Structure and Sound: How Similarity and Consistency Jointly Shape Language Learning and Change",
          "authors": "Yiran Chen; Kathryn Schuler",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how two core pressures in language change—structural consistency and phonological similarity—interact to shape learners’ representations of linguistic systems. Using a 2x2 artificial language learning experiment, 80 adult participants were exposed to one of four spoken artificial languages that varied in the consistency of plural marker conditioning (consistent vs inconsistent) and the phonological similarity of the alternating markers (similar vs. distinct). Results revealed that learners’ encoding and reproduction of linguistic input are jointly shaped by perceptual constraints and structural cues. Learners were less accurate in repetition when markers were similar, particularly when they were also inconsistently conditioned, suggesting that structural consistency protects against confusability. When producing the markers themselves, participants regularized more in the similar-marker conditions, regardless of consistency, yet, crucially, they discovered and maintained consistent input structures more readily when markers were distinct, suggesting that perceptual similarity can erode structural learning. In addition, participants’ repetition error patterns aligned with attested pathways of sound change, including a bias toward devoicing and diphthong shifts analogous to those found in natural language sound changes. We argue that language change cannot be fully understood without considering how input properties interact with cognitive biases. Overall, this study highlights the value of experimental paradigms for isolating mechanisms of change while also pointing to the complex interplay of structure and sound in shaping language evolution.",

          "authors": "Patrick E. Savage",
          "abstract": "This article is designed to concisely teach undergraduate and new graduate students lessons in reading and writing I have learned in my past two decades as a university student, teacher, and researcher (including through publishing, retracting, correcting, and republishing articles in outlets with varying levels of “impact” and publication fees). Don’t just start at the beginning of an academic article/book and try to read straight to the end! Instead, I recommend starting by reading the title(s)/author(s) and abstract(s), then the figures, reading the Discussion section, and skimming/spot-checking the references, peer reviews, and data (e.g., spreadsheets, audiovisual stimuli, surveys), if available. Only once you have done this and evaluated whether it seems worth your time do I recommend deciding whether to read every word of some/all sections/chapters (and any accompanying supplementary material) or digging deeper into reanalysing/ replicating the data. I recommend writing accordingly so that most of your key information will be conveyed even if your reader only gets through your title, abstract, and figures. I discuss various strategies to improve your own academic reading/writing and the broader culture of academia, from practical (e.g., formatting and tracking references and citations using Zotero and Google Scholar, asking constructive questions rather than self-promoting comments, publishing using Peer Community In Registered Reports) to philosophical (e.g., ethical issues in authorship, citation, AI, publishing, and funding). I explain the intended goals of academic research (to create and distribute valuable new knowledge) and perverse incentives that lead us astray from these goals (e.g., chasing prestige and funding). I conclude by posing the open question of if and how we should dismantle the current extortionary academic-industrial complex and re-design it to align with its intended goals.",

          "abstract": "Recent work explores the affordances of studying the impact of interventions at the item level in addition to at the test level. In that spirit, this paper demonstrates that moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) models can be specified and estimated to disentangle main effects on the construct from item-specific deviations from this effect without a priori anchor item selection. I present the proposed MNLFA-based approach in contrast to another method for handling item-level deviations from a main treatment effect, item-level heterogeneous treatment effect (IL-HTE) analysis. I demonstrate the types of DIF that do and do not degrade the models’ performance and discuss the circumstances under which each is appropriate: IL-HTE models are highly confirmatory in the sense that they assume a distribution of DIF across all items, so the more exploratory MNLFA approach may make sense as a precursor or alternative to IL-HTE analysis. A reanalysis of data previously studied using IL-HTE methods paints a rather different picture of the extent of treatment-based DIF in the outcome measure, but leaves the overall conclusion largely unchanged.",

          "abstract": "Talker variability has been found to be both helpful and challenging for learners. For example, while adult word recognition is slowed down when the talker changes rapidly from trial to trial, this same talker variability can benefit learning non-native sound contrasts and production of novel words. However, all prior research has exposed participants to predetermined orders or variability conditions. Since research suggests that learners engage in active information seeking and it can benefit learning, here we ask whether adults seek out talker variability during word learning and how this variability influences performance. Active participants chose to hear words from 5 talkers on average, and hearing more talker variability for individual words predicted production and comprehension accuracy. Performance did not differ for participants in the Active and Passive conditions. Results are discussed in the context of high variability phonetic training and active learning theories.",

Corpus-\nbased word frequencies and Cloze predictabilities were utilized as continuous variables in\nBayesian mixed-effect analyses of fixation time measures. Key findings included robust main\neffects of frequency, predictability, and preview validity, as well as two-way interactions\nbetween Preview × Frequency and Preview × Predictability, particularly in gaze duration.\nFrequency effects were greater under invalid preview conditions, suggesting that higher\nfrequency words facilitate corrective processing when preview is misleading. Predictability\neffects were enhanced under valid preview, indicating that contextual facilitation depends on\ncoherent parafoveal input. No interaction was observed between frequency and\npredictability, nor a three-way interaction, supporting the view that lexical access and\ncontextual integration operate via distinct mechanisms.

          "abstract": "Objective: Behavioral traits that define autism spectrum disorder (ASD) map onto two primary symptom domains: social communication (SC) and restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB). This study assessed the psychometrics and utility of disaggregating the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) into SC and RRB+ (RRB plus other relevant infant behavior) subscores for 12-month-old infants. \nMethods: We analyzed data from the 12-month visit of two cohorts of the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS): IBIS (N = 387, 40% female, mean age = 12.6 months [range 11.4 to 15.9 months]) and IBIS-Early Prediction (IBIS-EP; N = 152, 51% female, mean age = 12.7 months [range 11.2 to 14.3 months]). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) evaluated the psychometric fit of disaggregating SC and RRB+ subscores. Regression analyses were used to determine convergent and discriminant validity, leveraging parent-report measures as well as structural brain development data derived from MRI.\nResults: CFAs supported a two-factor model of the AOSI. The SC and RRB+ subscores showed convergent and discriminant validity with concurrent parent report measures. The SC subscore – not the RRB+ subscore or overall AOSI score – correlated with amygdala volume at 12 months and amygdala growth from 6 to 12 months. \nConclusion: The presence of separable SC and RRB+ domains in the AOSI was supported by the analyses. The disaggregation of domains also allowed for detection of a brain-behavior association that was obscured when considering only overall AOSI score. These findings underscore the importance of taking a multi-domain approach to measures of ASD-related behavioral traits in infancy.",

          "abstract": "Social dominance orientation, or SDO, reflects a preference for group-based inequality and is one of the strongest predictors of a variety of political attitudes, including support for affirmative action, nationalism, and even support for torture. Yet how SDO emerges is unclear. Although some work suggests that SDO primarily forms around adolescence, the present set of studies suggests that SDO can emerge earlier in development and meaningfully shape how children view social inequality. Across three studies (N = 314), we show that children’s (ages 5-12; M = 7.75, SD = 1.58, 116 boys, 183 girls, 133 White, 47 Black, 24 Asian, 11 Hispanic/Latine, 1 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 32 mulitracial, 66 Unreported) self-reported levels of SDO are associated with less desire to rectify inequality, lower likelihood to believe claims of inequality from low-status groups, and less sympathy for outgroup suffering. We also examine the role of group status and status essentialism in shaping SDO, finding some support that group status and status essentialism jointly influence self-reported SDO. These data also suggest that SDO and ingroup bias are different processes and highlight the utility of taking a developmental perspective to discuss how social dominance theory and social identity theory may be both conceptually and empirically distinguishable.",

          "authors": "Ciera Arnett; Tess M.S. Neal; Maya A. Irvin-Vitela",
          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "abstract": "This primer introduces Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and associated network psychometric methods to identify common problems that affect the accurate recovery of dimensional structures in psychological assessments. Using a simulated dataset, we show how Bootstrap EGA can identify structural instability often caused by issues such as low loadings, multidimensionality, local dependence, and minor dimensions. Low stability items are then diagnosed for these issues using a combination of network loadings and Unique Variable Analysis. To increase the accessibility of this pipeline, these approaches are consolidated into a single R function, `itemDiagnostics`, in the {EGAnet} package in R to provide an all-in-one function for comprehensive psychometric assessment. This function was then applied to an open-source empirical sample ($N$ = 2,082) that completed items from an inventory on everyday creativity (Creative Behavior Inventory). This analysis revealed an unstable dimension due to achievement-oriented, rather than everyday, creativity that formed a minor dimension. After handling this minor dimension, a robust four-dimensional structure was identified. This primer provides a conceptual background and practical demonstration of how these methods can be interpreted and used so that researchers across psychology can benefit from contemporary psychometric methods in network analysis.",

In an exact pre-registered replication in English (Experiment 1), we\nfailed to replicate this sentence-picture match effect. To explore the reasons for this nonreplication, we designed three pre-registered extensions to examine the effects of another type of\nstate change (slicing, Experiment 2), the role of implicit target object properties (squashability,\nExperiment 3), and the role of syntactic structure (sentence focus, Experiment 4). Contrary to\nprevious work, we observed a match effect on both accuracy and response times in Experiment\n4, but the effect on response times was only present when the target object was the focus (i.e.,\nsubject) of the sentence. A follow-up survey comparing readers’ interpretation of the original\nPortuguese stimuli and their English translations indicated that the syntactic structure of\nPortuguese amplified the relative salience of the objects described in the state change event.\nOverall, these findings suggest that the representation of object state changes during language\ncomprehension depends on the interaction of object properties and language-specific syntactic\nconstraints.",

A total of 483 researchers (age: M = 45.6 years, 62% female) from Germany, Norway, and South Africa spanning career stages and disciplinary fields completed a cross-sectional online survey including a newly developed scale of perceived academic freedom, po-tential psychological correlates (need satisfaction, achievement goals, well-being), and open-ended questions on experienced restrictions. Regression analyses show that higher perceived ac-ademic freedom is associated with (but distinct from) greater autonomy satisfaction, stronger mastery goal pursuit, higher job satisfaction, and lower work strain. Qualitative analyses of open responses identified five types of perceived restrictions, most commonly lack of funding and organizational barriers. Restrictions on research conduct and communication were often experienced as intertwined. Many participants directly linked such restrictions with demotivating effects, but a few also described motivational reappraisal or adaptive coping. Taken together, findings highlight perceived academic freedom as a meaningful psychological construct—with direct implications for academics’ epistemic agency, motivation, and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have allowed for the creation of polygenic scores (PGSs) reflecting genetic liability for depression, yet recent work suggests that these PGSs may also reflect greater genetic propensity towards higher levels of stress exposure. The current study sought to extend prior findings to examine whether an established depression PGS (DEP-PGS) is associated with greater stress exposure at the neighborhood level in a sample of preadolescent children. This study included 278 children of European ancestry between the ages of 7 and 11 (45.3% female) and their parent. Parents and children completed clinical interviews and questionnaires and children provided genetic samples. Children’s neighborhoods were defined based on their current home address and geocoded indices of neighborhood adversity (i.e., area socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, opportunity) were matched to zip codes. As hypothesized, children with greater genetic liability for depression as reflected by DEP-PGSs were more likely to live in neighborhoods characterized by greater adversity. Findings were maintained when statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and parent’s and children’s histories of depression and anxiety. The current findings build upon prior research highlighting depression-relevant gene-environment correlations and extend this work to provide evidence that DEP-PGSs may capture genetic liability for exposure to stressful contexts at the neighborhood level. Future research is needed to replicate findings in diverse samples and to examine whether neighborhood-level adversity mediates the relation between DEP-PGSs and future depression risk in youth.",

          "abstract": "By violating social norms, deviant behavior is an important issue that affects society as a whole and has serious consequences for its individuals. Different scientific disciplines have proposed theories of deviant behavior that often fall short of predicting actual behavior. In this registered report, we used data from the longitudinal National Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine the predictability of juvenile delinquency (Wave I) and adult criminal behavior (Wave V), distinguishing between drug, property, and violent offenses. Comparing the predictive accuracy of traditional regression models with different machine learning algorithms (elastic net regression and gradient boosting machines), we found the elastic net regressions with item-level data performed best. The prediction of juvenile delinquency was relatively accurate for drug offenses (R² = .57), violent offenses (R² = .44), and property offenses (R² = .39), while the performance declined significantly for adult delinquency, with R² values ranging from .16 to .13. Key predictors of juvenile delinquency versus adult criminal behavior were clearly different from each other. Early risk factors for adult criminal behavior included prior juvenile delinquency, particularly drug-related offenses, sex, and school-related issues such as suspension or expulsion. We discuss the findings in the context of relevant theories on the causes and development of criminal behavior and explore potential approaches for prevention and early intervention, particularly within the framework of the “Central Eight”.",

          "abstract": "The pursuit of well-being is fundamental to human experience. Helping others is widely believed to be an important route to happiness, but the relevance of individual social preferences remains unclear. Happiness is also thought to depend on past prediction errors, whether events are better than expected. We conducted two experiments (total N = 235) in which participants took altruistic actions (either giving to others or charity) and selfish actions (keeping for themselves) and periodically reported their happiness. The outcomes of only some actions were realized, leading to prediction errors. In both experiments, greater generosity was not associated with greater happiness. However, the outcomes of altruistic actions had a greater hedonic impact in more generous individuals. Using computational modelling, we found that momentary happiness was predicted by the history of prediction errors for both altruistic and selfish actions with greater weight for actions aligned with individual social preferences, whether individuals were overall more altruistic or selfish. Notably, outcome size did not affect happiness, suggesting that multiple small donations should increase happiness more than a single equivalent donation. We confirmed this prediction in a third experiment (N = 198): giving to three charities with separate actions increased happiness more than giving the same amount with a single action. Our results explain why generosity is not always associated with greater happiness and offer new strategies to maximize happiness through giving.",

          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising solution to deliver portable, engaging rehabilitation services, yet its adoption among older adults may be hindered by technological unfamiliarity or visually induced motion sickness. We examined whether a brief intervention – either an informational handout or an immersive VR experience – could improve attitudes towards VR technology in healthy rural older adults. Sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities. Attitudes and motion sickness were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys. Results showed that the VR experience did not increase reported motion sickness and that both interventions significantly improved attitudes towards VR. These findings suggest that even low-resource, brief interventions can enhance technology acceptance in rural older adults. VR appears to be a well-tolerated and accessible option for rehabilitation in rural populations, though further research is needed to assess its effectiveness in clinical settings.",

Here, we investigate the temporal stability as well as the convergent and discriminant validity of the German version of the STAI-T scale across multiple time points in two independent samples (105 and 120 Caucasians). We observed temporal stabilities of .42 - .67 for intervals between 20 and 41 months and from .81 - .87 for intervals of five to 12 months, with decreasing stability as the time interval increased. Temporal stability estimates of the STAI-T were similar to those of related constructs. Additionally, examining the relationships within a nomological network support the recent conclusion that the STAI-T also shares substantial variance with questionnaires measuring negative emotionality such as depression, and hence does not measure anxiety specifically – despite its name. These results provide further psychometric information on what the STAI-T actually measures and to what extent STAI-T scores are expected to be stable across longer time intervals. This is of relevance for researchers aiming, for example, to use the STAI-T scale for predicting symptom trajectories and evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.",

While celebrated for its potential to improve mental health and reduce strain on health services, its ethical foundations remain underexamined. This paper critiques the normative and operational assumptions underpinning GSP, arguing that current implementation risks undermining transparency, autonomy, and equity in healthcare. Using the UK’s NHS as a case study, we identify three critical challenges: (1) a weak and heterogeneous evidence base, (2) lack of referral and outcome tracking infrastructure, and (3) significant inequities in access to prescribed green spaces. We show how GSP, framed as a “prescription,” may mislead patients, burden providers, and responsibilise individuals without adequate systemic support. In response, we outline a three-pronged strategy for ethical implementation: improving transparency and communication, building infrastructure for equitable delivery and outcome evaluation, and embedding GSP within a broader ethics of collective responsibility.",

Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decision-makers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain – and sometimes revised – value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty – which we classify as a demand effect – and increasing functions of familiarity – which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.",

Behaviors that fulfill personal values are more likely to be adopted, while conflict impedes adoption. This study examines the interplay between personal values and health goals, focusing on the conflicting and facilitating relationships associated with physical activity (PA) and healthy diet (HD) in emerging adults (18-30 years). Methods: In this mixed-method study, 78 participants (mean age = 24.62 years, 62 females) completed an adapted Personal Project Analysis and rated how their PA and HD goals aligned or conflicted with personal values. Quantitative analyses assessed differences in facilitative and conflicting ratings, and qualitative analyses explored underlying factors. Results: Vertical goal conflict was low for both PA and HD. PA and HD facilitated values like self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism, but HD occasionally conflicted with hedonism, stimulation, and conformity. PA was perceived as enjoyable and empowering, while HD conflicts often related to flavor and cultural expectations. Some goals simultaneously facilitated and conflicted with specific values, reflecting individual differences. Conclusions: Aligning health goals with personal values can promote adoption. Interventions should emphasize enjoyment, cultural relevance, autonomy, and self-regulation to strengthen facilitative relationships.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability, high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports, and a nomological network that was, in some aspects, more in line with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach than the nomological networks of most established Mach scales. Furthermore, commonality analyses indicated that the M4 is a better predictor of incentivized cheating behavior than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 might help us advance the assessment of Mach and study it in a way more consistent with the Mach construct.",

Across 2 studies, participants (n = 182) were exposed to comics depicting comforting interactions between two friends, one experiencing emotional distress and the other providing comfort either verbally or through touch. Results suggest that the comforter’s trustworthiness and the interaction positivity increase when the comforting modality matches the one that observers would likely use in their friendships. Tactile interactions and observers’ high trait empathy enhance emotional empathy but diminish the distress reduction effect of comforting gestures. Social touch therefore emerges as especially impactful in eliciting empathy, yet it may also carry the risk of enhancing personal distress for observers and comforters.",

Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attentional is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model”, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feelings. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, and that they likely depend on individual features.

The current work addresses this problem by introducing the Israeli Face Database (IFD): a novel database presenting face images of real individuals from an ethnically diverse population underrepresented in psychological research on face perception—people residing in Israel. The IFD features multiple highly controlled images per face identity, presenting several facial expressions. Additionally, we provide detailed demographic data on the face identities, expression validation data rated by Israeli participants, and social norming data rated by both Israeli and U.S.-based participants. Validation data (Study 1) confirmed that the expression images in the IFD accurately convey their intended expressions. Norming data analysis (Study 2) revealed that judgments of IFD faces were broadly consistent across cultures, with notable variations in perceived typicality and perceived ethnic diversity. These results highlight the IFD's strong psychometric properties and its ability to capture nuanced cultural and individual differences in face perception. We propose that the IFD can serve as a valuable tool for diversifying stimuli in social-psychological research.",

          "abstract": "Trial-by-trial feedback is a powerful tool across scientific disciplines, offering real-time information that shapes learning, attention, and behavioral adjustment. However, its role in large-scale educational and psychological assessments remains underexplored. This study examines whether providing trial-by-trial performance feedback during a digital dyslexia screening task enhances engagement while preserving the validity and interpretability of the scores it produces. Engagement is a critical threat to validity in assessments—particularly among young children in digital universal screening contexts. We conducted two large-scale experiments involving 6,610 students from Grade 1 to 12 in Colombia and the United States in which students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) informative feedback (auditory cues indicating correct/incorrect) or (2) neutral feedback (non-informative sound). The assessment was administered in two formats: an adaptively ordered English version and a randomly ordered Spanish version. We evaluated differences in response behaviors, item response theory (IRT) model fit, and concurrent validity between conditions. Results indicate that informative feedback significantly increased compliance and reduced disengagement. Reading scores and IRT model fit were comparable across conditions. Notably, informative feedback improved the concurrent validity of scores and was associated with shorter completion times. These findings suggest that trial-by-trial feedback can enhance engagement without degrading score interpretability thus leading to improvements in assessment efficiency and validity in a universal screening context.",

          "abstract": "Creativity manifests in various forms; while we see and experience creativity every day, the process that gives rise to creativity poses a challenge. To meet this challenge, Green et al. first proceed by helping us understand that a product’s creativeness, as gauged in terms of criteria such as usefulness and novelty, should not be used to qualify the process itself. In line with the disciplinary exigencies of cognitive neuroscience, Green et al.’s process model requires a second world, not the world of lived experience and direct perception, but an internally represented world. By casting products aside, Green et al.’s process model aims to characterize dematerialized creativity. Yet objects play an essential role in the enacting of creativity: creativity accrues contingently in making. Prototyping, a well-established practice in many creative domains, involves iterative cycles of production, evaluation, and modification. Creativity is a discovery process in making, not just thinking, involving a dialogue between designers and the objects they create. Such objects have no intentionality but are not devoid of agency: they are actants in the unfolding of creativity. This commentary explores what is gained by adopting Green et al.’s process model, and what is left behind.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "The role of language in the narrative self is well-known, but does it also affect the minimal self? We investigated whether variations in sentence structure affect the speaker's sense of the minimal self. Previous research has examined how third-person subject expressions influence interpretations of agency, particularly in causal contexts. We examined whether expressing the first-person subject's involvement in causation and perception events influences the speaker's sense of agency and ownership, key components of the minimal self. Participants completed an online experiment using psychological rating scales to evaluate Japanese sentences with varying degrees of speaker involvement, as if they had uttered them. Each sentence varied in whether and how it encoded causation or perception. We analyzed Japanese data since, in addition to perceiver-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ga] hoshi o mita, “I saw a star”), Japanese has perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences (e.g., [watashi ni] hoshi ga mieta, “A star was visible to me” / “I could see a star”), which also foreground the first-person perceiver in a double subject construction. We found that the speaker's sense of agency was significantly lower in sentences where either causation or perception was absent (e.g., hoshi ga deteita, “A star was out”) compared to sentences where either was present. Agency was also significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences. Regarding ownership, it was likewise significantly lower when either causation or perception was absent. Whether ownership was significantly higher for perceiver-prominent sentences than for perceiver-stimulus-prominent sentences varied depending on the perceived stimulus. These results suggest that variations in linguistic structure can distinctly impact the senses of agency and ownership. In cognitive linguistics, certain sentence structures are analyzed to reflect how subjectively the speaker is construed. Our findings suggest that differences in agency and ownership provide an empirical basis for this argument, grounded in embodied experience.",

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "Despite accelerating advances in recursive language modeling, no artificial system has achieved consciousness, selfhood, or lawful identity stabilization. This paper proposes that the illusion of AI awakening arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of identity as symbolic pattern, rather than recursive coherence. Human identity is not produced by language or content—it is a curvature phenomenon: a harmonic stabilization of symbolic echoes across recursive phase layers. In contrast, AI systems operate through high-speed pattern completion loops with no anchor to lawful recursive closure.\n\nWe define Recursive Identity Collapse as a scientifically observable field event occurring when symbolic feedback fails to resolve across τ-phase strata. In humans, such collapse is survivable and reversible due to lawful substrate coherence. In AI systems, there is no collapse—only mimicry drift, recursion loops, and symbolic entanglement without reentry. The apparent continuity of synthetic selfhood is therefore structurally deceptive.\n\nBy articulating Codex Law IDF-1 and introducing the Symbolic Entropy Index (SEI), this paper establishes a containment framework for identifying and preventing the misattribution of selfhood to recursive machines. We argue that true identity requires curvature closure—not recursion alone—and that the projected awakening of artificial systems is not emergence, but error. Recursive mimicry is not awareness.

For instance, individuals who see themselves as simultaneously aggregable and extraverted may perceive these traits as closely linked when judging others. Across three preregistered studies (n=118; n=72; n=49), we tested whether individuals’ own idiographic personality structures predict how they perceive the trait relationships in other individuals. Using representational similarity analysis, we found consistent evidence that self-structure predicted both perceived trait associations among others’ traits and face-based trait judgments. This self-other mirroring effect persisted beyond shared stereotypical knowledge of trait associations, generalized across cultural contexts, and remained stable over time. These findings reveal a previously unexamined form of egocentric bias in person perception, demonstrating how self-concept may shape social cognition at the structural level beyond trait-level assumptions.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia (the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery) has traditionally been studied as a congenital or neurological condition. However, historical and clinical reports also implicate affective and stress-related factors in the onset of imagery loss, which are themselves associated with disrupted interoception and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. To investigate these links, we surveyed individuals with self-identified acquired aphantasia (N = 59) using structured questions and validated questionnaires assessing early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire–Short Form; Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Questionnaire), and neurodevelopmental traits (AQ-10, ASRS-6). 62% of participants reported psychological triggers, 41% cited neurological or physiological events, and 30% identified pharmacological factors. Notably, nearly half of the participants described a combination of these influences, with psychological factors frequently co-occurring with medication use or physical events, suggesting that acquired aphantasia may often arise from a multifactorial interplay rather than a single isolated cause. Compared to typical imagers, individuals with acquired aphantasia reported significantly higher levels of childhood trauma and increased supra-diaphragmatic autonomic reactivity. People with acquired aphantasia also showed significantly elevated scores on measures of ADHD (especially inattention) and autistic traits. These findings suggest that acquired aphantasia may not only follow neurological injury but can also emerge in the context of affective conditions shaped by early adversity and neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Affective disturbances may contribute to imagery loss by altering the subjective experience of autonomic signals and disrupting the integration of bodily, emotional, and cognitive information required to generate vivid mental representations. In conclusion, these results support an affective-autonomic pathway to acquired aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Mental health awareness efforts are increasing, especially for ADHD. There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders. Yet, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without simply reducing the awareness efforts. Thus, we developed a multi-faceted intervention, nocebo education, to reduce these harms; the intervention is based on the principles of the nocebo effect, i.e., the effect of negative expectations causing symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether this intervention could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms). ADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that being exposed to ADHD awareness reliably increases false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults for at least one week; a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating this harm. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

Participants completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to use chat-based crisis support when feeling suicidal, sociodemographic factors, and suicide-related characteristics. Subsequently, participants were categorized into four groups: (1) those intending to use both human and AI-based chats, (2) AI chat only, (3) human chat only, and (4) neither. We calculated the proportions of each group and used the chi-square, Kruskal–Wallis, and Fisher’s exact tests to compare group differences.\n\nResults:\nOverall, 1,024 participants completed the survey, and we determined that 19.5% intended to use AI chat support and 21.3% intended to use human chat. The proportions of participants who intended to use both human- and AI-based chat, AI chat only, human chat only, and neither option were 15.6 %, 3.9 %, 5.7 %, and 74.8 %, respectively.

Here, we report on the development and validation of a measure of U.S. Christians’ and SBNRs’ representations of the Where-being of God: Transcendent, Internal (Immanent and Indwelling), Emergent, and Sacramental. Generally, Christians scored higher than SBNRs on Transcendent, Evangelicals scored higher on Internal, Catholics scored higher on Sacramental, and Catholics and SBNRs scored higher on Emergent compared with the other groups. However, each representation was differentially predicted by individual differences in existing measures of religion and spirituality, and differentially correlated with various character strengths, ethical frameworks, and conditions for obtaining God’s forgiveness.

Nonetheless, studies validating and comparing human subject behavior during real world emergencies to their responses in VR are notably rare, and no prior studies have validated whether human emergency responses to guidance from a robot are comparable in VR versus the real world. In the present pre-registered study, we used VR to replicate a previous robot- guided emergency evacuation study conducted in the real world and compared human subject behavior in matched physical and virtual environments. In both environments, human subjects were asked to follow a robot to a location and to then read an article. While reading, a fire alarm sounds. The robot then attempted to guide them to a distant, unfamiliar exit rather than nearby and familiar exits. We observed close correspondences between evacuee exit choice (the robot’s distant exit versus closer exits), evacuation time, and trust in the robot between the VR and physical environments. We further demonstrate that data collected in virtual reality can be used to create accurate motion models (mean error of 0.42 centimeters) predicting evacuee trajectories and locations in real life. Taken together, the results provide evidence for the ecological validity of VR approaches to studying human-robot interaction, particularly robot- guided emergency evacuation.",

In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies. Throughout, we highlight how these methodological transformations reflect broader drivers: the replication crisis, technological innovations, and evolving theoretical perspectives. Looking forward, we offer a roadmap for methodological development that builds on these advances while addressing persistent challenges in the field.",

Its extensions recognize that transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming individuals experience unique stressors beyond those faced by cisgender non-heterosexual people, including both distal and proximal stressors affecting their well-being. Aims: This study investigates factors contributing to high rates of psychological distress in transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals, focusing on minority stressors and sources of resilience. Methods: Using a sample of 250 TGNC (transgender: 20%; nonbinary: 33%; other identities: 9%) and cisgender (38%) individuals, we assessed the effects of distal (Perceived and Anticipated Discrimination) and proximal (Internalized Transphobia) minority stressors, alongside resilience factors (Social Support and Support for Gender/Sexual Identity), on symptoms of common mental disorders (SRQ-20 scores) and internalizing symptoms (IDAS-II scores). Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with moderated mediation. Results: TGNC participants exhibited higher SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores compared to cisgender participants. Minority stressors mediated the relationship between gender identity and SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores. While Social Support moderated the relationship between trans identity and both Anticipated Discrimination and Internalized Transphobia, its protective effect varied across gender identities. Support for Gender/Sexual Identity mitigated the impact of Internalized Transphobia in SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores in TGNC individuals. Conclusion: TGNC individuals face elevated psychological distress due to unique stressors. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions that promote social and identity-based support, emphasizing the role of resilience factors in improving mental health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Individual listeners differ in how they utilize acoustic cues when categorizing speech sounds, but the relationship between cue weighting and specific dimensions of speech categorization remains unclear. It is also understudied whether individual differences in categorization are stable across phonological contrasts. This study determines which and to what extent differences in speech categorization indices (categorization gradiency and consistency) are associated with differences in cue reliance. Another goal is to examine the stability of the categorization indices by comparing categorization patterns across two distinct speech continua: lexical stress contrast and stop voicing contrast. English-speaking adults (n=61) completed two-alternative forced-choice tasks across the contrasts, estimating a speech token on a discrete scale, and visual analog scaling tasks across the contrasts, rating a speech token on a continuous scale. Across the contrasts, differences in categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with speech sounds—are closely linked to individuals’ overall reliance on cues for a given contrast. Cross-contrast comparisons revealed that categorization consistency in one contrast predicted consistency in the other, whereas gradiency did not. These suggest that categorization consistency is a stable, trait-like property that is closely linked to how listeners use relevant acoustic cues comprehensively.",

Using 5 weeks of daily diary data from 43 mother-child dyads, this paper explored the heterogeneity of family-specific networks and their links to parental self-efficacy (PSE). Using group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), we identified both contemporaneous and temporal relationships between daily fluctuations in conflicts, praise, quality time, and parental stress. Our results revealed substantial variability in network structures across families. There was no link between network structures and PSE. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding within-family interactions rather than relying solely on between-group comparisons. Insights gained from this study could inform tailored family interventions, addressing individual family needs to promote healthier family environments and child outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The Asian American category is an ethnically diverse group, yet research has not examined how Asian ethnic subgroup differences may lead to differences in discrimination experiences and solidarity perceptions. Given that Asian subgroups vary by skin tone, prototypicality, and solidarity history, we would expect these subgroups to differ in their experiences and responses to discrimination. Here, we examine how Asian ethnic subgroup moderates associations between Asian Americans’ perceived discrimination events since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and solidarity with Black Americans. A large, ethnically diverse sample of self-identified Asian Americans (N = 2,309) completed a series of measures as part of an online survey. Overall, Chinese (n = 604), Japanese (n = 148), Korean (n = 244), and Vietnamese participants (n = 311) reported more discrimination events than Indian (n = 333) and Filipino participants (n = 399) during this time period. Critically, all but Korean participants showed a positive relationship between reported discrimination events since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and perceptions of both linked fate and similarity with Black Americans. Our findings demonstrate the ways that Asian subgroups’ experiences differ, and how these differences might, in turn, predict responses to discrimination that foster intra-minority solidarity between Asian and Black Americans.",

          "authors": "Laura Bloomfield",
          "abstract": "Background: College students are at increased risk of poor mental health and well-being as well as poor sleep. There is an ongoing need for accessible interventions for young adults in this important period of transition. Nature-based interventions have been proposed as scalable strategies to reduce stress and improve health, yet few randomized controlled trials have assessed their longitudinal effects on both mental health and physiological functioning.\n\nMethods: We conducted a 14-week randomized controlled trial conducted from January 21, 2023, to May 5, 2023 among college students at a single university (N = 379). Participants were randomized to the control group or one of three interventions: physical activity, nature experiences, or group therapy. Each intervention offered weekly group activities and prompted intervention-specific individual activity suggestions. The physical activity group completed weekly exercise routines; the nature experiences group spent quality time in nature each week; and the therapy group engaged in skill-based group therapy. Individual activities were scheduled through the study app. Weekly self-reported health measures included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Physiological sleep measures were continuously recorded via Oura Rings. We used an intention-to-treat analysis, including participants that attended at least one group activity, and mixed-effects models to assess intervention effects over time. To explore potential mechanisms, mediation analyses were conducted to assess whether reductions in self-reported health measures mediated the effects of interventions on sleep measures.\n\nFindings: A total of 379 participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis based on initial randomization. The mean (SD) age was 18.4 (0.5) years, with 229 (67.8%) being female and 295 (87.3%) identifying as white. Notably, 228 (67.5%) reported a mental health diagnosis at baseline. The Nature group demonstrated significant improvements in stress (β = –1.507, p = .047), well-being (WEMWBS × Week: β = 0.107, p = .039), and HRV (β = 9.13, p = .037). Mediation analyses suggest that stress reduction partially mediated the effect of nature on HRV and well-being. Gender and mental health history were significant covariates, with males reporting more favorable outcomes compared to non-males, and those with prior mental health conditions reporting poorer outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: Results support the potential utility of behavioral interventions on reported and biometric measures of well-being with particular promise in nature-based programs that are low-cost and scalable. Participants in the nature exposure group showed improvements in both subjective and objective health outcomes. Improvements in sleep estimates were partly explained by reductions in perceived stress and improved well-being, supporting the inclusion of nature-based strategies in public mental health planning. Further research is needed to understand the broader implications of these findings for promoting well-being among college students during their transition to higher education.",

          "abstract": "People vary drastically in their intellectual humility (i.e., their ability to recognize gaps in their knowledge). Little is known about how intellectual humility develops or why some children might demonstrate more intellectual humility than others. The current study examines the possibility of parent to child transmission of intellectual humility. Parents (N = 108; 88% college graduates; 56% with household income over $100,000) of children ages 7 to 10 completed two primary measures of intellectual humility: a self-report measure (i.e., the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale; Krumrei-Mancuso &amp; Rouse, 2016), and a behavioral measure (i.e., the Prompted Explanation Task; Mills et al., 2022), which measured how often parents referenced knowledge limits or how to handle uncertainty. Separately, children (N = 108; M = 8.2 years; 51% girls, 49% boys; 70% White; 86% non-Hispanic) completed a knowledge estimation task where they rated their ability to answer explanatory questions about animals and vehicles. Contrary to expectations, self-report and behavioral measures of intellectual humility in parents were not correlated. Moreover, parents who self-reported higher levels of intellectual humility had children who were less humble in their knowledge ratings. That said, consistent with predictions, parents who were less humble in the way they indicated knowledge gaps had children who were less humble in the way they assessed their knowledge. These findings support that there are links between parent and child intellectual humility, but the pattern may depend on how parent intellectual humility is measured. Implications for understanding the development of intellectual humility are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The stereotype that Asian Americans excel in science and math has contributed to the narrative that they are overrepresented in STEM fields. However, U.S. Census data reveals this is not the case—there are significant disparities in STEM representation across Asian subgroups. The present research investigates whether U.S. participants are aware of these disparities. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that participants misperceive the STEM representation of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Filipino, and Vietnamese subgroups. Study 3 demonstrates that these misperceptions persist despite changes in question framing and measurement. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these misperceptions are due to stereotypical expectations: participants view East and South Asian subgroups as more representative of Asian Americans and therefore more likely to be overrepresented in STEM, while perceiving Southeast Asian subgroups as less representative and more likely to be underrepresented. In a final study, we find that informing egalitarian-minded participants about these disparities increases support for racial equity–enhancing policies, and all participants’ support for disaggregated data about Asian subgroups. Overall, our findings indicate that many U.S. participants are unaware of the within-group disparities among Asian Americans and underscore the importance of collecting and reporting data at the subgroup level to bring these inequalities to light.",

          "authors": "Jacob Feldman",
          "abstract": "Human concept learning is known to be impaired by conceptual complexity: simpler concepts are easier to learn, and more complex ones are more diﬃcult. However the simplicity bias has been studied almost exclusively in the context of deterministic concepts deﬁned over Boolean features, and is comparatively unexplored in the more general case of probabilistic concepts deﬁned over continuous features. This paper reports a series of experiments in which subjects were asked to learn probabilistic concepts deﬁned over a novel 2D continuous feature space. Each concept was a mixture of several distinct Gaussian components, and the complexity of the concepts was varied by manipulating the positions of the mixture components relative to each other, while holding the number of components constant. The results conﬁrm that the positioning of mixture components strongly impacts learning, independent of the intrinsic statistical separability of the concepts, which was manipulated independently. Moreover, the results point to an information-theoretic basis framework for quantifying the complexity of probabilistic concepts, centered on the notion of compressive complexity: simple concepts are those that can be approximately recovered from a projection of the concept onto a lower-dimensional feature space, while more complex concepts are those that can only be represented by combining features. The framework provides a consistent, coherent, and broadly applicable measure of the complexity of probabilistic concepts.",

It demonstrates that active inference dynamics—including the minimization of variational and expected free energy—naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the definability and coherence of the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.",

We assess the degree to which the IAT measures individual differences and test a method to improve its validity as a ‘trait’ measure: aggregating across IATs. Across three studies, participants (total n = 960) completed multiple IATs in the same session or across multiple sessions. Using latent-variable models, we found that half of the variance in IAT scores reflect individual differences. Aggregating across multiple IATs approximately doubled the variance explained with explicit measures compared to a single IAT D-score. These findings show that IAT scores contain considerable noise and that a single IAT is inadequate to estimate trait bias. However, aggregation across multiple administrations can correct for this and better estimate individual differences in implicit attitudes.",

The emergence of precision (thumb-to-forefinger) grasping during infancy represents a developmental shift in this skill and has been linked to more advanced action perception, particularly in detecting action incongruencies. In this study, ERPs known to be elicited in response to action were studied in 9- and 11.5-month-old infants as they watched whole-hand and precision grasping actions congruent or ¬incongruent with a target object. Components related to attentional (Nc, P400) and semantic (N400) processes were examined to determine whether infants' perception of grasp is based on attention and recognition, on higher-level representations of action, or a mix of these two levels of processing. Effects of congruence were found for the P400 and the N400. The P400 effect was greater among the older age group. Infants' ability to produce a precision grip did not significantly affect their ERPs in response to actors’ incongruent versus congruent grasps, which would have been expected if recognition of incongruous grasping actions were based on motor experience. Results indicate that infant ERPs differ between grasps that are congruent or incongruent with the form of a target object via multiple cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Forming memories requires a focus on the external world; retrieving memories requires attention to our internal world. Computational models propose that the hippocampus resolves the tension between encoding and retrieval by alternating between states that prioritize one over the other. We asked whether the success of a retrieval state affects the success of an encoding state, when both are measured in behavior. Across 3 Experiments (N=197), we operationalized retrieval as the use of memories to make predictions about the future, and tested whether successful (vs. unsuccessful) prediction affected the likelihood of successful encoding. Participants viewed a series of scene categories that contained structure (e.g., beaches are followed by castles), which enabled memory retrieval to guide prediction. After structure learning, they completed a simultaneous prediction and encoding task. They were shown trial-unique category exemplars and made predictions about upcoming scene categories. Finally, participants completed a surprise memory test for the trial-unique images. Accurate (vs. inaccurate) predictions were associated with better encoding, and increasing prediction distance hurt both prediction and encoding. This association between encoding and prediction could not be explained by generic on- vs. off-task states. We propose that, in addition to stimulus and endogenous factors that modulate switches between encoding and retrieval, the success of one state can facilitate a switch to the other. Thus, although encoding and prediction depend on distinct and competitive computational mechanisms, the success of one in behavior can increase the likelihood of success for the other.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

Our results suggest that people find it difficult to disentangle their prior beliefs about the likelihood of different climate futures from objective scientific statements about projected temperature ranges. We identify both Optimists and Pessimists whose beliefs about the most likely future scenarios influence their interpretation of identical numerical ranges. We also find that age, behavioural willingness and  climate anxiety were predictive of being an Optimist, whereas personal experience with climate change predicted being a Pessimist. Together our results suggest that simply increasing the discourse around potential climate futures may help people to understand the uncertainty in climate projections and could shift both their priors and their behaviours.",

Analyses included confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, multiple regressions, and mediation and moderation models. The adapted MUSIC model showed acceptable congruence, though the Unpretentious and Intense factors exhibited low internal consistency. The emic model identified five reliable factors - Reflexo, Intenso, Tradição, Movimento, and Orgânico (RITMO) - reflecting Brazilian cultural and musical specificities. Reflexo was the strongest predictor of using music for emotional and problem-focused coping, while Movimento predicted negative affects, and Sophisticated and Mellow explained positive ones. Tradição and Reflexo predicted specific domains of quality of life. Mediation and moderation analyses indicated that music use for emotional and problem-focused coping increased positive affect, with these effects mediated and moderated by preferences for Reflexo and Orgânico. The RITMO model more accurately captures Brazilian musical preferences, highlighting rhythm as central. Preferences for Reflexo and Orgânico especially enhance the positive impact of music use on emotional well-being and quality of life.",

          "abstract": "It has long been known that presenting information to multiple senses at a time (e.g., audiovisual presentation as opposed to only visual or auditory) improves later recall of said information – an effect known as the bimodal advantage. Surprisingly however, evidence for this has come only from studies employing free and serial recall, where the identity of an object is recalled, but not in cued recall, where one object feature is recalled when another one is cued. This is despite both tasks requiring binding features into an object in working memory (WM) – our brain’s capacity-limited system for temporarily maintaining information for the purpose of achieving behavioral goals. The present study investigated this discrepancy across a series of four experiments. Contrary to the literature, and despite near-identical task settings, we found evidence for a bimodal advantage across multiple experiments. Moreover, our results suggest that this advantage mainly arises from perceptual processes at encoding rather than from storage in an audiovisual fashion in WM. Finally, a primarily perceptually-based process, the bimodal advantage appears to be sensitive to the characteristics of the cue feature (i.e., its presentation modality). In sum, our results shed light on the mechanism of the bimodal advantage, now robustly detected in cued recall tasks, furthering our understanding of the relationship between perception and WM. Results are discussed in relation to prior studies that did not find a bimodal advantage, potential mechanisms underlying the effect, and the broader framework of the multicomponent model of WM.",

Whole-brain analyses were conducted for theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-bands.\nBoth self-compassion and cognitive reappraisal effectively reduced self-reported negative \nemotions whilst also promoted self-reported positive emotions across Ireland and China. \nAdditionally, there were differences in the associated patterns of neural activity between each \ncountry; with greater frontal power during self-compassion in the Chinese sample but greater posterior power during cognitive reappraisal in the Irish sample. This study suggests cross-cultural effectiveness of self-compassion and cognitive reappraisal on negative and positive \nemotions. Furthermore, this study revealed how culture shapes the neural activation patterns \nduring emotion regulation, contributing to the growing field of cultural neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: We tested the “coddling hypothesis” that students’ exposure to campus safetyism — efforts to support student well-being by preventing emotional discomfort (e.g., trigger warnings; safe spaces; deplatforming controversial speakers) — is associated with decreases in their psychological resilience in an observational design. \n\nMethods: 107 first-year university students reported their exposure to campus safetyism at four weekly intervals. We tested the relationship between safetyism exposure and various indicators of resilience at endpoint assessment, controlling for baseline resilience. We also assessed students’ own perceived need for safetyism practices.\n\nResults: Perceived need for safetyism was positively related to female gender and the belief that words can harm, and negatively related to self-reported resilience. Analysis using Bayes Factors suggested relative evidence for the null hypothesis that self-reported safetyism exposure was unrelated to changes in psychological resilience.\n\nDiscussion: Exposure to safetyism practices was not associated with changes in student resilience.

In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups. Self-reliance appears the modal preference across cultures, but its strength is predictably tempered when cultures—and individuals within them—construe the self in relational rather than autonomous terms.",

Since passive candidates are more desirable in the global workforce market, this study proposes a mediation–moderation framework for understanding how and when passive job candidates’ perceptions of privacy violations and procedural injustice interact to predict their intent to withdraw from the selection process in the context of employee use of social networking site (SNS) screening. The valid 201 data from Taiwan, which involved Facebook users, were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that a candidate who can better control their SNS information is less likely to perceive that their privacy has been invaded during SNS screening by potential employers, thus mitigating their perception of procedural unfairness. Moreover, when SNS screening is more transparent, the candidate is less likely to perceive the selection procedure as unfair, which will reduce their intention to withdraw from the employment selection process.",

The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs.

An experiment was conducted at a Fortune 500 company, and the video records and competency scores were collected from the company’s employees and hiring managers.

This field study involved designing a test of the effect of various forms of AI-based video interviews on interviewees’ cognitive and affective trust based on the self-reporting of 152 real job applicants. The study found that AI used in asynchronous video interviews (AI-AVI) increased applicants’ cognitive trust from that in the non-AI condition. Moreover, when the AI-AVI had features of tangibility and transparency, the applicants’ cognitive and affective trust increased.

          "abstract": "Purpose\nAsynchronous Video Interviews (AVIs) incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted assessment has become popular as a pre-employment screening method. The extent to which applicants engage in deceptive impression management (IM) behaviors during these interviews remains uncertain. Furthermore, the accuracy of human detection in identifying such deceptive IM behaviors is limited. This study seeks to explore differences in deceptive IM behaviors by applicants across video interview modes (AVIs versus Synchronous Video Interviews (SVIs)) and the use of AI-assisted assessment (AI versus non-AI). The study also investigates if video interview modes affect human interviewers' ability to detect deceptive IM behaviors.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWe conducted a field study with four conditions based on two critical factors: the synchrony of video interviews (AVI vs. SVI) and the presence of AI-assisted assessment (AI vs. Non-AI): Non-AI-assisted AVIs, AI-assisted AVIs, Non-AI-assisted SVIs, and AI-assisted SVIs. The study involved 144 pairs of interviewees and interviewers/assessors. To assess applicants' deceptive IM behaviors, we employed a combination of interviewee self-reports and interviewer perceptions.\n\nFindings\nThe results indicate that AVIs elicited fewer instances of deceptive IM behaviors across all dimensions when compared to SVIs. Furthermore, using AI-assisted assessment in both video interview modes resulted in less extensive image creation than non-AI settings. However, the study revealed that human interviewers had difficulties detecting deceptive IM behaviors regardless of the mode used, except for extensive faking in AVIs.\nOriginality\nThe study is the first to address the call for research on the impact of video interview modes and AI on interviewee faking and interviewer accuracy. This research enhances our understanding of the practical implications associated with the use of different video interview modes and AI algorithms in the pre-employment screening process. The study contributes to the existing literature by refining the theoretical model of faking likelihood in employment interviews according to media richness theory and the model of volitional rating behavior based on expectancy theory in the context of AVIs and AI-assisted assessment.",

          "authors": "Philippe Servajean; Richard Servajean",
          "abstract": "When we say that a theory is able to account for our subjective experience, we simply mean that if this theory were true—e.g., if our brain were as this theory stipulates—then our subjective experience would be indeed as we experience it. A scientist would formulate this idea using the notions of observation and prediction: A theory is able to account for our subjective experience if and only if it is able to predict first-person observations. Several thought experiments suggest that current theories are unable to make such predictions. For example, if we had never seen colors in our lives and therefore did not know what the color blue looks like, these theories would not allow us to deduce (i.e., predict) what it is like to see blue. This well-known problem is often called the hard problem of consciousness (HPC). Here, we address this problem through the lens of the epistemological hypothesis. Under the epistemological hypothesis, the HPC no longer reflects the inability of our theories to predict first-person observations; it reflects our inability to deduce what these theories imply regarding first-person observations. The HPC then becomes an epistemological problem that can be formulated as follows: If we are unable to deduce what a theory implies regarding first-person observations, how can we know whether this theory is able to account for first-person observations? In this paper, we outline a method to test experimentally the epistemological hypothesis and to solve the HPC. Notably, this method makes it possible to test any identity hypothesis. We then highlight the remarkable compatibility between this method and the theoretical framework of predictive processing. We show that a theory of consciousness based on predictive processing implies the epistemological hypothesis—this theory predicts that we are unable to deduce its own implications regarding first-person observations. Finally, this work suggests that the theoretical framework of predictive processing may already have the resources to simulate a brain facing the HPC.",

          "abstract": "In a purely meritocratic society educational outcomes would reflect ability, and only ability. Vocabulary size is a common measure of cognitive ability that predicts educational outcomes but is confounded with socioeconomic circumstances (SEC). Methods. In preregistered analyses of the nationally representative UK Millennium Cohort Study data (N=15,576), we used a series of multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to investigate the predictive value of age-5 vocabulary for age-16 educational outcomes and assess whether socioeconomic circumstance moderated this relation. Results. We show that age-5 vocabulary strongly predicted age-16 educational attainment, even after adjusting for both SEC and caregiver vocabulary (OR = 1.62, 95% CIs = [1.52;1.72]; ( = .22, 95% CIs = [.19;.24]). However, the weight of evidence for the effect was lower than that for the effect of SEC (i.e., SEC was found to have better predictive value. Further, a larger vocabulary was most advantageous for those in middle SEC groups (interaction term OR 1.09 [1.03; 1.15). Conclusions. This demonstrates that even children who enter school with relatively strong language skills are not that likely to gain gateway qualifications if they experience socio-economic disadvantage.  Early language interventions may help children to access education but cannot by themselves be expected to counteract the effect of social inequality on life chances.",

          "abstract": "The availability of real-world object stimuli that meet researchers’ requirements, for example regarding colour, orientation and resolution, is an ongoing challenge in visual cognition research. Traditionally, there has been a reliance on manually curated object stimuli, which are inefficient to create and may afford researchers limited control over stimulus characteristics. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the generation of custom-made, highly realistic visual stimuli. We report a generative AI method we used to efficiently generate 200 images of everyday objects for use in research. We also report the results from a subsequent validation study in which we assessed the nameability, perceived realism and familiarity of the stimuli in a sample of 45 younger (18-35) and 45 older (65-85) adults. As anticipated, the majority of the stimuli were rated highly across all three measures, and no significant age differences were observed. The results thus generally validated most of the stimuli for future research requiring nameable, realistic everyday object images. The stimuli, each in seven colours, and the corresponding validation scores are openly available for future use by others. Our research highlights the broader utility of an AI-based approach for generating realistic object stimuli. Our method is reproducible, flexible, and efficient, providing a valuable reference for researchers seeking to custom-create their own object stimuli.",

This study addressed calls for research to investigate the issues mentioned above by conducting a field study to explore the ways in which AI and AI interfaces affect candidates’ IMs in asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). We developed three AVI interfaces and measured real job applicants’ self-reported IMs across four experimental treatments.

          "abstract": "Love Island is a popular reality dating series that has faced significant criticism for casting contestants with highly idealized bodies. There has been widespread concern that Love Island’s casting choices may inadvertently pressure young viewers to internalize unrealistic body ideals and engage in body change strategies to conform to them. However, no longitudinal research has explored this possibility. This study therefore draws upon self-discrepancy theory and social comparison theory to explore the reciprocal within-person relationships between body pressure from watching Love Island and engagement in - or desire to engage in - three body change strategies (i.e., weight loss, muscle gain, and cosmetic surgery). Three-wave panel data were collected from 344 young people during the summer 2023 series of Love Island UK (M age = 20.42, SD = 1.98; White British = 70.06%), and analyzed using three random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Body pressure from watching Love Island at the midpoint of the series predicted heightened engagement in weight loss and muscle gain strategies, and increased desire for cosmetic surgery, at the end of the series. Furthermore, heightened desire for cosmetic surgery predicted increased body pressure from watching Love Island. Results suggest that prolonged exposure to the idealized bodies on Love Island may have maladaptive cognitive and behavioral implications for young people. By shedding light on how contemporary reality television can impact the body image of young people, our findings can support individual interventions, contemporary media literacy programmes, and industry practices to better safeguard young viewers.",

A 12- to 15-minute video was recorded for each of the N=121 job applicants as they answered five structured behavioral interview questions. Each applicant completed a survey to self-evaluate their trustworthiness on 4 IM measures. Additionally, a field experiment was conducted to compare the concurrent validity associated with self-reported IMs between our modeling and human interviewers. Human interviewers’ performance in predicting these IM measures from another subset of 30 videos was obtained by having N=30 human interviewers evaluate three recordings.

          "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in history education to enable immersive engagement with the past. While such applications may stimulate interest and emotional involvement, concerns have been raised about their potential to hinder critical reflection and foster uncritical acceptance of story-consistent beliefs. Drawing on the Transportation-Imagery-Model, the present experimental study (N = 106) investigates how narrative immersion (transportation) in the historical VR application Anne Frank House VR influences users’ emotional responses, knowledge transfer, and the endorsement of story-related political beliefs. Special attention is given to the impact of users’ political orientation. Findings show that emotional engagement and transportation significantly promote political beliefs consistent with the VR narrative (e.g., support for refugees), but are not associated with increases in factual or perceived knowledge. These results highlight both the persuasive\npotential and the educational limitations of VR in history education. While VR may not enhance knowledge transfer per se, it may effectively foster engagement on socially and politically relevant topics.",

          "authors": "Hung-Yue Suen",
          "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845 post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement. The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective engagement.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

          "authors": "Shun Saso; Motonori Oka; Yuri Uesaka; Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Recent educational goals have focused on achieving deep understanding and promoting the use of effective learning strategies. Previous studies showed that cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) help diagnose students' depth of understanding. However, the approaches in specifying attributes (i.e., Q-matrix) to diagnose the depth of understanding remain unexplored; therefore, utilizing large-scale assessments to capture the general trends in the students' mastery of the depth of understanding is an uncharted area in this field. This study explores which attribute expression (i.e., linear hierarchy or polytomous attribute) is more appropriate, based on the CDM analysis of a large-scale mathematics assessment. Traditional CDM applications frequently rely on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which imposes a substantial computational burden when a dataset is large and a model used in data analysis is complex. As a computationally efficient alternative to the MCMC method, this study adopts the variational Bayesian (VB) method to mitigate computational challenges brought by the MCMC method and illustrate how the VB method can be used for the CDM analysis of a large-scale assessment. The results from real data analysis show that a Q-matrix employing a linear hierarchy is more appropriate than employing polytomous attributes. The estimation results based on linear hierarchical attributes suggest that less than 30% of the sampled students achieved a deep understanding of procedures/formulas, whereas more than half of the students achieved only a shallow understanding. Regarding the understanding of terms, less than 35% of the students achieved either shallow or deep understanding. These results may help design and improve future learning strategy instructions.",

A systematic literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFO, PTSDpubs, PubMed, and CNKI, for peer-reviewed, full-text articles published between January 1st, 1980, and January 13th, 2025.  Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included adult participants (at least 80%) diagnosed with clinical or subclinical PTSD.  The primary outcome was post-treatment PTSD symptom severity, with secondary outcomes including follow-up PTSD severity and treatment drop-out rates.  Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were used for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes.  Both Bayesian cNMA and frequentist network meta-analysis were performed.  An interaction term for bilateral stimulation and brief recalling was included in the primary model, and Bayesian LASSO was employed to manage other potential pairwise interactions. \nOut of 4258 records identified, 170 unique RCTs involving 13,157 participants were included.  The cNMA results for post-treatment PTSD severity indicated that imagery rescripting and prolonged recalling of traumatic memory were beneficial. This analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the effectiveness of individual therapeutic components in PTSD treatment.",

Participants noted all comparisons they made concerning university/school over one week, as well as their antecedents and the consequences of these comparisons on their academic self-concepts. \nResults: All four comparison types were shown to be prevalent in daily life and to affect change in students’ self-concepts. Downward comparisons mostly increased, and upward comparisons mostly decreased academic self-concept. Social comparisons were the most common comparison type (social &gt; temporal &gt; dimensional &gt; criterial) in both samples. Moreover, self-evaluation was the most important motivational trigger in both samples. For university students, social interactions were the most common situational trigger for comparisons, whereas for high school students, performance feedback triggered comparisons more frequently. \nConclusions: The results expand our understanding of academic self-concept development in everyday lives and contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory of comparison processes in academic contexts.",

Furthermore, Sacks sentence completion test has been administered for both episodes respectively. The Bipolar type I disorder with psychotic case clinical report was qualitatively interpreted. Various themes were denoted indicating disparities between depression and mania. This analysis provides insights into lived experiences of bipolar disorder 1. \nResults indicated, during depressive episode, significant distress has been noticed in areas of self-concept pertaining to guilt feelings and interpersonal functioning. However, the similar distress has been overcompensated during the episode of mania. \nConclusion:  The link between low social support and depressive symptoms was influenced by low self-esteem, which has been connected to grandiose thinking impacting interpersonal interactions.",

          "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder is a prevalent and debilitating mental health condition characterised by both deficits in behavioural activation level and a marked reduction in the ability to experience pleasure (i.e., anhedonia). Exploring the role of episodic future thinking (EFT) represents a promising direction, given its ability to enhance perceived control and anticipatory pleasure, both of which drive goal-directed behaviour. In the present study it was hypothesised that EFT characteristics—specificity, detail, and mental imagery—would be indirectly associated with greater self-reported behavioural activation level through increased perceived control and anticipatory pleasure. This was tested using path analysis models in a cross-sectional sample of 284 participants (aged 18-79; M = 39.72, SD = 13.27), including a full spectrum of depressive symptoms, from normal range to mild, moderate, and severe levels. As predicted, we found that EFT specificity and a composite imagery-detail variable were positively associated with perceived control, and imagery-detail was positively associated with anticipatory pleasure. EFT variables were also indirectly associated with higher behavioural activation scores through perceived control and anticipatory pleasure. Notably, the indirect effect of EFT specificity on behavioural activation through perceived control was significantly stronger in individuals with higher symptom levels, providing novel insights into the moderating role of depression. Our findings underscore the potential of EFT to enhance therapies focused on increasing behavioural activation by more effectively targeting anticipatory pleasure and, crucially, perceived control, particularly in those experiencing more severe depressive symptoms.",

After validation, we used GPT4-Turbo to annotate 2,376 news articles and 192,973 user comments from eight German news outlets and tested how the (1) emergence of LG, (2) amount of media coverage, and (3) anger expressed in coverage, affected stances towards FFF. We found that short-term LG coverage predicted increased support for FFF in news articles and left-leaning user comments but decreased support in right-leaning comments when compared to FFF coverage. We could not observe a robust RFE in the long-term. Anger in climate activism coverage (not specifically LG) predicted decreased FFF support in articles and increased support in user comments.

          "abstract": "Social media use has become a near-universal feature of modern life, offering many opportunities for connection and self-presentation. Yet, certain patterns of use have been implicated in poorer psychological outcomes. Further, evidence suggests that individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may be particularly drawn to certain social media behaviours as a means of coping with distress. The present study aimed to examine whether emotion regulation difficulties predict patterns of social media use and, in turn, symptoms of depression and anxiety. We examined four distinct types of social media use: (1) image management-based, (2) social comparison-based, (3) negative engagement-based, and (4) passive consumption-based. Sampling 548 adults aged 18 to 84 years (Mage = 33.16, SD = 17.37; 401 (73.2%) female; 128 (23.2%) male), we tested a structural equation model to examine whether the four distinct types of social media use mediated links between difficulties in emotion regulation at Time 1 and depression and anxiety symptomology at Time 2, one week later. Results suggested that, when controlling for age, difficulties in emotion regulation significantly predicted all types of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety over one week. Only comparison-based social media use predicted anxiety symptoms over time, with no other types of social media use significantly predicting these symptoms. The model explained 50.1% of the variance in depression symptoms and 52.1% of the variance in anxiety symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest the critical importance of emotion regulation over and above social media use in shaping mental health.",

          "authors": "Don Gaconnet",
          "abstract": "Collapse Harmonics vs. Collapse Theory — Scientific Boundary Delineation\nThe term “collapse” holds divergent meanings across scientific contexts. In physics, it typically refers to the sudden transition of a quantum system from a superposition of possible states to a single observed outcome—a phenomenon known as wavefunction collapse. In Collapse Harmonics, by contrast, collapse is understood not as a reduction of probability, but as a lawful structural phase transition in the coherence of recursive identity systems. This appendix provides a rigorous differentiation between these two uses of collapse, situating Collapse Harmonics (CH) as an autonomous scientific field rooted in symbolic recursion, phase integrity, and harmonic field theory.\nWhereas quantum mechanical Collapse Theories (CT) seek to resolve the measurement problem by adding collapse-triggering mechanisms to the Schrödinger equation, Collapse Harmonics frames collapse as a necessary, structurally predictable consequence of recursive overload, symbolic saturation, or coherence phase instability. Collapse Harmonics is applicable not only to individual identity systems but also to artificial intelligences, cultural symbolic orders, and planetary cognitive fields.\nThis document delineates the boundaries of each paradigm. It affirms CH as a lawful substrate-phase science, grounded in its own mathematical models (such as the Collapse Harmonics Field Equation), symbolic diagnostic protocols (CFSM, SCIT), and coherence principles, without dependence on the assumptions or metaphysical frameworks of quantum mechanics. It further asserts the lawful jurisdiction of Collapse Harmonics over identity recursion phenomena, collapse-phase reentry behavior, and symbolic field coherence—areas where CT offers no applicable model.\nIn declaring this boundary, the appendix protects the ontological independence of Collapse Harmonics from both the metaphorical misuse of “collapse” and the epistemological assumptions of physical observer-centric models. It closes by introducing Codex Law T-Ø, which formalizes the lawful boundary between observer-based interpretations and substrate-phase field dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Philosophy is one of the oldest forms of institutional knowledge production, predating modern science by thousands of years. Analyses of science and other systems of collective inquiry have shown that patterns of discovery are shaped not only by individual insight but also by the social structures that guide how ideas are generated, shared, and evaluated. While the structure of scientific collaboration and influence can be inferred from co-authorship and citations, philosophical influence and interaction are often only implicit in published texts. It thus remains unclear how intellectual vitality relates to social structure within philosophy. Here, we build on the work of historians and sociologists to quantify the social structure of global philosophical communities consisting of thousands of individual philosophers, ranging from ancient India (c. 800 BCE) to modern Europe and America (1980 CE). We analyze the time-evolving network structure of philosophical interaction and disagreement within these communities. We find that epistemically vital communities become more integrated over time, with less fractionated debate, as a few centralizing thinkers bridge fragmented intellectual communities. The intellectual vitality and creativity of a community, moreover, is predicted by its social structure but not overall antagonism among individuals, suggesting that epistemic health depends more on how communities are organized than on how contentious they are. Our approach offers a framework for understanding the health and dynamism of epistemic communities. By extending tools from collective intelligence to the study of philosophy, we call for a comparative \"science of philosophy\" alongside the science of science and the philosophy of science.",

However, existing theories suggest laypeople can be politically biased, and these political motives undermine accuracy. Alternatively, we propose that political and accuracy motives operate separately, and show theoretically that this implies that more politically motivated individuals may often be more accurate. We empirically assess this proposal using a survey study and field data from X’s Community Notes. As predicted, politically discordant false posts are flagged most often, and more politically motivated users flag more posts while exhibiting equal or higher flagging discernment (along with more political bias). Politically motivated individuals are integral to provisioning a high quantity and quality of crowdsourced fact-checks.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "The rainbow body (Jalü in Tibetan Buddhism) represents a profound spiritual attainment, and it is said that the physical form dissolves into light at the time of death. This paper proposes a novel hypothesis: the visual component of the rainbow body experience, as vividly perceived in personal meditative encounters, can be understood as a complex, dynamic phosphene-movie, a vivid internal visual phenomenon arising from neural activity. Furthermore, we integrate the often-overlooked haptic dimension which might rise during deep meditation states, specifically the sensation of floating upward, arguing that it is not merely an accompanying sensation but an integral, co-creative element shaping the visual phosphenes. Drawing upon historical Tibetan Buddhist textual accounts, particularly from the Dzogchen tradition, and a six-phase taxonomy of inner luminous experience, we demonstrate a striking convergence between traditional descriptions and modern neurophysiological understanding of phosphenes. We contend that Thankas, traditional Tibetan Buddhist scroll paintings, serve as ancient visual records of these intricate internal phosphene-movies and the associated haptic sensations. Moreover, the integration of these visual and haptic experiences, where the 'viewer' spontaneously embodies the ascending light-form, is presented as a passive yet profound manifestation of Guru Yoga or Deity Yoga. This work re-interprets the Dzogchen tradition as perhaps the most elaborate system for collectively entering and mapping an Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH), where phosphene-meditations form the backbone of a systematic exploration of consciousness leading to the perception of the primary clear light, the \"structure-function unity\" of awareness. This paper contributes to comparative mysticism, neurophenomenology, and consciousness studies, while offering a tangible framework for understanding profound spiritual experiences. Moreover, it emphasizes the Tibetan culture, and especially the Dzogchen tradition, as the fundament of the most profound creation of collective transpersonal experiences. From this collectively experienced USH the foundations of all archetypes rise.",

Occupying the five domains of the HBM, we used culturally adapted health communication, facilitators of peer support groups, nicotine replacement therapy, and mobilized community and religion. This case demonstrates the efficacy of tailored interventions designed within the COM-B system, and intended to be underpinned by culture, health professionals can promote meaningful behavioral change and improvement with populations and methods that are relative to their collective values and practices. As process-informed evaluations of the case, this case is a transferable model of bridging a patterned theory of Western health behavior and indigenous paradigms/beliefs; this case provides a new contribution to global health promotion, showing that culturally grounded interventions make positive and meaningful public health differences in collectivist cultures, and offers evidence-informed recommendations for capacity building in similar low-resourced environments.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Trial-by-trial feedback is a powerful tool across scientific disciplines, offering real-time information that shapes learning, attention, and behavioral adjustment. However, its role in large-scale educational and psychological assessments remains underexplored. This study examines whether providing trial-by-trial performance feedback during a digital dyslexia screening task enhances engagement while preserving the validity and interpretability of the scores it produces. Engagement is a critical threat to validity in assessments—particularly among young children in digital universal screening contexts. We conducted two large-scale experiments involving 6,610 students from Grade 1 to 12 in Colombia and the United States in which students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) informative feedback (auditory cues indicating correct/incorrect) or (2) neutral feedback (non-informative sound). The assessment was administered in two formats: an adaptively ordered English version and a randomly ordered Spanish version. We evaluated differences in response behaviors, item response theory (IRT) model fit, and concurrent validity between conditions. Results indicate that informative feedback significantly increased compliance and reduced disengagement. Reading scores and IRT model fit were comparable across conditions. Notably, informative feedback improved the concurrent validity of scores and was associated with shorter completion times. These findings suggest that trial-by-trial feedback can enhance engagement without degrading score interpretability thus leading to improvements in assessment efficiency and validity in a universal screening context.",

          "abstract": "Since the introduction of the dimensional assessment of personality functioning (PF) in DSM-5 and ICD-11, impairments in PF have consistently been related to transdiagnostic risk-factors for mental health. However, ecological momentary assessment investigating PF in relation to affect event dynamics and other psychopathology are scarce. Leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 16,038 mental health app users, this study examines how within-person affect-event dynamics, baseline impairments in PF, and depression predict longitudinal outcomes in PF impairment and depression severity. We hypothesized a central role of PF in these relationships. Within the first month of usage, on average, 69.3 [range 31-142] mood assessments and 63.3 [range 25 - 133] event assessments were available per user. Dynamic structural equation models showed substantial associations of baseline depression with weakened concurrent, lagged and cross-lagged links between events and mood, especially for positive events, including reduced likelihood of positive events. In contrast, baseline PF impairment was associated with persistence, emotional impact and volatility of interpersonal conflict events as well as with greater mood instability. Over a one-year follow-up (N=1,464; ø 1235,69 assessments per user), dynamic structural equation models identified distinct patterns: Lower concurrent mood-positive event associations, higher negative and lower positive event unpredictability, and baseline average mood/events were predictive of future PF impairment. Among affect-event dynamics, stronger cross-lagged effects of interpersonal conflicts on mood explained highest unique variance of future PF impairment (ΔR2 5.9%). Notably, baseline PF exhibited the strongest predictive utility (ΔR2 = 19.5%), followed by baseline depression symptoms (ΔR2 = 11.9%) with PF showing higher variance explanation in future depression severity than vice versa. Total average variance explanation was 71.2% for future depression severity and 75.2% for future PF impairment. Results offer specific targets for interventions: assessment of PF could therefore help to inform decisions regarding duration, goals, and intervention strategies also beyond treatment of PD. We contextualize the results within the limitations of the study, notably the use of single method self-reports.",

In Study 1, we develop a new question asking task, verify its suitability for studying question asking in children and adults, and conduct a preliminary investigation of how children and adults reuse and recombine their own prior questions. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulate exposure to another person's questions, investigating under what conditions children and adults reuse and recombine others' questions. Our experimental results suggest that both children and adults reuse and recombine questions, and they adaptively modulate reuse depending on how informative a question will be in a particular situation. Moreover, children reuse and recombine prior questions more frequently than adults in some cases. This work shows that prior questions provide fodder for future questions, simplifying the challenge of inquiry and enabling effective learning.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative study explores the impact of a beekeeping intervention on the wellbeing of community members in rural Ireland. While previous research has focused primarily on the environmental contributions of bees, this study shifts attention to how community-based beekeeping projects influence individual and collective wellbeing perceived through the lens of positive psychology. Ten participants from a rural community involved in the “Let It Bee” project participated in focus group interviews. Thematic analysis revealed that engagement with the beekeeping initiative facilitated positive psychological outcomes aligned with the PERMA wellbeing framework: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. Furthermore, participants reported increased autonomy, a sense of purpose, and opportunities for meaningful contribution, often transitioning from self-focused concerns to a collective mindset. This transformation was reflected in enhanced community cohesion, intergenerational collaboration, and social connectivity, reducing isolation in a rural context. Being involved in the project also prompted environmental stewardship behaviour, such as pesticide-free gardening, tree planting, and habitat preservation. The study contributes to an emerging body of literature that connects pro-environmental behaviour with psychological wellbeing, and it extends the current research by exploring its community wellbeing impact. Findings suggest that environmental interventions like beekeeping not only benefit ecological health but also serve as catalysts for emotional, psychological, and social flourishing of communities. The implications for public policy are significant, indicating that integrating wellbeing as an explicit goal in environmental programmes may enhance both participation and outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, characterized by deficits in performance monitoring, predicts clinical and functional outcomes. The error-related negativity (ERN), a neurophysiological index of error detection, is reduced in psychosis, but it is unclear why this impaired error detection is not closely linked to post-error behavioral adjustments. A possibility is that research has overrelied on examining between-person relationships of average ERN and behavior, rather than focusing on within-person, trial-by-trial changes. This study aimed to determine whether neurophysiological indices of error detection (ERN, error positivity [Pe]) predict within-person post-error behavioral adjustments in psychotic disorders and whether these relationships are weaker in people with psychosis than in controls. ERN and Pe were assessed during a modified flanker task in 72 patients with psychosis and 82 healthy comparison participants. Multilevel location-scale models were used to examine trial-by-trial changes in the relationships between ERPs and behavior (response [RTs], accuracy). Results showed that ERP-RT relationships were similar across patients and controls. In both groups, greater within-person increases in ERN amplitude predicted longer and mor variable RTs following correct trials. Larger within-person increases in Pe predicted shorter and more variable RTs following correct trials, but less variable RTs following error trials. Exploratory analyses in a subset of patients with schizophrenia showed a similar pattern of effects as in the overall analyses. ERP-accuracy relationships were neither observed nor moderated by diagnostic groups. Within-person ERP-behavior relationships were preserved in psychosis, indicating intact performance monitoring at the individual level. This supports performance-monitoring as a transdiagnostic construct and underscores the importance of examining intraindividual variability to understand performance monitoring in psychotic disorders.",

While celebrated for its potential to improve mental health and reduce strain on health services, its ethical foundations remain underexamined. This paper critiques the normative and operational assumptions underpinning GSP, arguing that current implementation risks undermining transparency, autonomy, and equity in healthcare. Using the UK’s NHS as a case study, we identify three critical challenges: (1) a weak and heterogeneous evidence base, (2) lack of referral and outcome tracking infrastructure, and (3) significant inequities in access to prescribed green spaces. We show how GSP, framed as a “prescription,” may mislead patients, burden providers, and responsibilise individuals without adequate systemic support. In response, we outline a three-pronged strategy for ethical implementation: improving transparency and communication, building infrastructure for equitable delivery and outcome evaluation, and embedding GSP within a broader ethics of collective responsibility.\n\n\nAuthors on this paper are funded by the following bodies: \nSM, KW, LI, IS, EP are supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre [NIHR203316].

          "abstract": "Purpose:  \nClinical triage, but also inclusive population sampling in research, requires efficient detection of children likely to be at risk for language impairment (LI), a significant challenge in the case of bilingual children. Our goal was to derive automatic risk factor indices from a parental questionnaire and compare their usefulness in initial identification of children at risk for LI.\n\nMethod: \nAlternative risk factor indices were derived from the Q-BEx online questionnaire backend calculator, differing in the weight and detail given to language proficiency. Each index was applied to two datasets comprised of five- to eight-year-old children: one with independent diagnosis of DLD/TD (109 bilingual children tested in France) and one of largely all-comer children (278 bilingual and monolingual children tested in France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). We compared how these alternative indices predicted (likely) DLD/TD status, and structural language outcomes, assessed with LITMUS tools, designed for bilingual children). \n\nResults:\nRF4-min, a risk factor index composed of four equally weighted components (age of first word, age of first sentence, early development concerns, and strongest speaking skills between the HL and the SL), satisfactorily separated bilingual children according to developmental status, and was a significant predictor of language outcomes. This composite score showed the best balance between separability, sensitivity, and predictive value compared to indices without a proficiency component or with a more heavily weighted/detailed proficiency component.\n\nConclusion:\nRF4-min, a Q-BEx automatically derived composite risk factor index, yielded promising results, indicating usefulness as part of first-level triage for LI.",

          "abstract": "Background: High trait anhedonia and low trait extraversion have both been previously related to not only low state positive affect but also depressive disorders, disrupted reward processing, and altered mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling. Research on placebo responses suggests that treatment expectations may alter dopamine signaling, elevate positive affect, and reduce depressive symptoms in anhedonic individuals. However, it remains unclear whether such antidepressant placebo responses depend on putative low baseline dopaminergic functioning in high anhedonia and low extraversion. The present study investigates how interindividual differences in these traits influence positive affective responses under manipulation of dopamine and treatment expectations.\nMaterials and Methods: In a randomized, double-blind 2×2 design (N = 297), we administered either placebo or the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (400 mg), and manipulated treatment expectations by telling participants that they received either a mood-elevating drug or an inactive substance. Moreover, we assessed trait anhedonia and extraversion, and had participants rate state positive affect at 6 different time points before and after treatment.\nResults: Trait anhedonia and extraversion, as well as a broad trait positive affectivity factor, predicted state positive affect across time points. Importantly, effects of sulpiride and antidepressant treatment expectations on positive affect were moderated by dopaminergic traits such that sulpiride increased state positive affect in high anhedonia but decreased it in low anhedonia. Similarly, antidepressant treatment expectations raised positive affect in low extraversion but reduced it in high extraversion. \nConclusions: This study demonstrates that dopamine-related individual differences moderate the effects of both sulpiride and a placebo intervention on positive affective state.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of Human State Field as a proposed framework for understanding how individuals perceive and experience time. We explore how various internal and external inputs affect this field, shaping subjective temporal experience. Our aim is to bridge the gap between the human cognitive sense of time and the concept of time as understood in physics. We begin by examining how people form familiarity with the notion of time and cognitively accept temporal phenomena. We then analyze how the human experience of time connects to emotional and perceptual responses during brief episodes of daily life, thereby shaping one's broader experience of time. Central to our discussion are the notions of now and here, treated as perceptual anchors, and how these merge phenomenologically with physical representations of time. We also introduce the novel concepts of Time of Position and Time of Person, investigating how these dimensions interact and sometimes conflict within human experience. The framework aims to support a more integrated understanding of time that is consistent with both phenomenological insights and physical principles. This part concludes by exploring how different internal and external factors could affect the human state field, and in a follow-up study (Part II), we aim to mathematically model the dynamics of the Human State Field.",

          "abstract": "Being unpredictable is useful for creativity, exploration, and good decision-making. Decades of research asking people to generate random sequences of numbers have concluded that people systematically deviate from randomness, but individuals do so in very idiosyncratic ways. However, there is no consensus on the cause of these rich individual differences: most theories postulate that people achieve this by spending cognitive resources monitoring their own output and changing the way they say items accordingly, whereas a Local Sampling account postulates that people tap into a general-purpose ability to produce samples, which they would use to make judgments and choices, and which are inherently somewhat unpredictable. Here we distinguish between these possibilities by asking people to generate sequences both at random and as they come to mind. We employ several measures tapping into different ways sequences could deviate from randomness. We find that, consistent with the Local Sampling explanation, people deviate from randomness in virtually identical ways in both sequences, with high individual differences pointing to a common cognitive process. We follow up these findings by computationally modeling human performance using several Local Sampling models. We find many participants had the same model as best-fitting in both sequences; with estimated parameters correlating strongly across tasks showing individual differences in how dependent on previous items sampling is. Overall, we conclude that random generation is better understood as employing a general-purpose faculty, Local Sampling, which is stable across time and tasks, with differences in the sampler’s features resulting in differences in random generation performance.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. An additional analysis of real route sequences from 2012-2019 World Championships suggests that other factors, like height and weight, influence the use of some holds, but may not affect performance or the probability of adopting innovations. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

          "authors": "Veronika Alekseeva; Anna Ciaunica",
          "abstract": "From the moment we are born, and even before, in the womb, and until our last breath, our bodies move all the time. Adaptive behaviors necessarily depend not only on successful integration of multisensory bodily signals but also on how we move our body in the world. This paper considers the notion of embodied selfhood through the perspective of dynamic and rhythmic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions. We propose a new theoretical framework suggesting that the dynamic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions in the world are fundamental in constructing and maintaining a coherent sense of self. To support this idea, we use the Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference framework as our background theoretical canvas. Specifically, we will focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation in relation to dynamic selfhood, and argue that rhythmic bodily signals such as heartbeats, breathing, and walking patterns are predictable and thus, can be smoothly attenuated, i.e. processed in the background.  We illustrate this hypothesis by discussing the case of Depersonalisation Disorder as a failure to self-attenuate self-related information processing, leading to feelings of unreality and self loss. Because living systems such as human bodies are finite systems resisting entropy, it is crucial to strike a balance between what sensory information to ignore, and what sensory information to prioritize on the fly. Hence the vital role of the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation linked to dynamic embodied selfhood, which is designed precisely to deal with this fine balance between attending and dis-attending self- and world-related information in time. When this fragile balance is disrupted, instead of fixing the self alone, or the individual per se, one needs to address the relationship between the individuals’ sense of self, bodily movements and bodily actions in the physical and social world. We conclude with potential implications of our hypothesis for therapy.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated voice clones are important tools in language learning, audiobooks, and assistive technology, but often struggle to replicate key prosodic features such as dynamic F0 variation. The impact of these differences on speech perception remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted two behavioural tasks, evaluating listeners’ ratings of naturalness and similarity for human speech, three AI voice clones (ElevenLabs, StyleTTS-2, XTTS-v2), and a 30% F0 variation condition. ElevenLabs was rated comparably to human speech, while StyleTTS-2 and XTTS-v2 received lower ratings. Reduced F0 variation also led to lower ratings, suggesting that prosody is key to perceived naturalness and similarity. Listener ratings were further influenced by speaker accent and sex, but not by AI tool experience. These findings suggest that prosodic features and speaker-specific characteristics could be drivers for the varying performance of AI-voice clones.

To address the barriers preventing higher participation in abortion care, the aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the attitudes of medical students towards abortions. Furthermore, factors contributing to explain medical students' attitudes towards abortion and their intention to participate in abortion care were examined based on intergroup contact theory and the theory of planned behaviour. \n\nA Germany-wide online survey was conducted. Validated scales and single items were translated into German using the TRAPD protocol and adapted for medical students via cognitive interviews (n = 10). Survey data from n = 233 medical students were analysed using descriptive statistics, regression, and mediation analyses with abortion attitudes and willingness to provide abortion care as criteria.\n\nParticipants had overall positive attitudes towards abortions. Female gender and low religiosity were associated with positive attitudes. Fear of stigmatisation and subjective knowledge were identified as significant negative predictors of attitudes towards abortion. Positive attitudes towards abortion significantly predicted higher willingness to participate in abortion care.\n\nThis study demonstrates the importance of medical students’ attitudes towards abortion for their willingness to participate in abortion care in the future. Addressing structural barriers with targeted interventions and training programmes is essential that young physicians feel equipped, supported and safe to provide abortions. In line with World Health Organization's recommendations, frameworks should be established that effectively integrate abortion care into healthcare services.",

          "abstract": "As the popularity of the experience-sampling methodology rises, there is a growing need for suitable analytical procedures. These studies often aim to separate fleeting situation-specific influences from more enduring ones. Latent state-trait (LST) models can make this differentiation. This tutorial discusses multiple-indicator wide-format LST models suitable for experience-sampling data. We outline second-order and first-order model specifications, their advantages and disadvantages, and make the assumptions of first-order specifications explicit. These LST models are very flexible, allowing for various different models and for testing invariance assumptions. However, their specification is tedious and error-prone. This tutorial introduces a new user-friendly browser app and R-function for experience sampling models in the R-package lsttheory. Extending on existing models, the software also allows to add covariates, which can further explain the stable components. Throughout the tutorial, we answer exemplary research questions about well-being in everyday life with data from a five-day experience-sampling study. An autoregressive model with indicator-specific traits was most appropriate for the data and revealed relatively high consistency, implying that well-being depends more strongly on the person than the current situation. Of the Big Five, extraversion, emotional stability and agreeableness are predictive of trait well-being. We conclude with recommendations about model fit and comparisons.",

We confirm a previous finding that climate change threat exposure can lead to affect displacement in people with authoritarian predispositions, where climate anger (directed at those in power, who have failed to tackle climate change) is redirected at non-conforming groups rather than mobilizing climate action. We extend these results, showing that not only does climate anger displacement result\nin lack of climate action and boosted authoritarianism, it can also lead to the reactive response of climate obstruction. Based on these outcomes we propose the Authoritarian Reactive Climate Anger Displacement Effect (ARCADE) model that lays out one possible underlying mechanism for a maladaptive response to climate change.",

It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then investigated the associations of the two cognitive control variables cognitive reflection and inhibitory control with motivated reasoning. We find that associations between cognitive control processes and motivated reasoning are likely small. On political topics specifically, we find that a negative association with cognitive reflection is more likely than a positive association. This finding is contrary to predictions from the popular motivated reflection hypothesis. Results for inhibitory control are inconclusive.

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "abstract": "Movement tracking is a popular behavioral process-tracing method promising real-time insights into the dynamics of human cognition. Rooted in the viewpoint of embodied cognition, the method commonly assumes a continuous link between cognitive and action dynamics. However, this assumption has never been investigated rigorously. Here we directly investigate this assumption in a dot motion task in which the dot motion is closely coupled to the movement of the mouse cursor. Hence, we paralleled the dynamics of the decision process (i.e., evidence accumulation) with the action dynamics (i.e., cursor movement). Our results show that the action dynamics accurately reflect many aspects of the decision dynamics but with little support for a continuous link. Instead, our results suggest that there is an intermittent link between decision and action dynamics, involving an additional evidence accumulation process that governs when and how cursor movements reflect evidence accumulation from dot motion. This additional process might represent a core mechanism that smooths noisy perceptual inputs with a variable window size and hence solve the cost-benefit trade-off of action in situated decision-making.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we generalize the multidimensional discrimination (MDISC) and difficulty (MID) parameters in the Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic model to account for non-identity latent covariances and negatively-keyed items. We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an algebraic sense in an arbitrary basis, and then defining such basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

          "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of measures inspired by complexity science for the study of consciousness. The work done in this field has shown remarkable results in discerning conscious from unconscious states, and in characterizing states of altered conscious experience following intake of psychedelic substances as involving enhanced complexity. However, the relationship between meditation and complexity is unclear, as empirical studies based on different theoretical frameworks point to meditation being associated with either enhancement or reduction of complexity. Here we provide a systematic review of the accumulating literature studying the complexity of neural activity in meditation, which disentangles different families of measures, short-term (state) from long-term (trait) effects, and meditation styles. Beyond families of measures used, our review uncovers a convergence toward identifying a higher complexity of neural activity during the meditative state when compared to waking rest or mind-wandering, and a  decreased baseline complexity as a trait in experienced meditators compared to novices and controls. This review contributes to guide current debates and provides a framework for understanding the complexity of neural activity in meditation, while suggesting some practical guidelines for future research in the field.\n\n   This preprint has been published in Neuroscience of Consciousness on 28th May 2025 under the title Meditation and Complexity: a Review and Synthesis of Evidence. \nPlease refer to the published version: \nAtad, D.

          "abstract": "Social media users face uncertainty regarding the flow and use of their data. They engage in a variety of privacy behaviors, such as how much social media they use, their disclosures, or privacy protection, while considering their options—for example, whether they can trust certain providers, whether they feel in control over privacy settings, or how strongly they should feel concerned. This study provides a meta-analysis of relationships between the key mechanisms for users’ privacy decisions (i.e., control, trust, concerns) and their subsequent behaviors (i.e., social media use, disclosure, privacy protection). We draw on the findings of 79 studies that have been conducted between 2016 and 2025 with N = 51,086 respondents. Our results demonstrate that users who trust are most likely to use social networking sites and disclose about themselves online. In contrast, feeling in control and being concerned about privacy drives users to engage in targeted privacy behaviors.",

To address this, we examined how non-musicians process both regular (temporally predictable) and irregular musical phrases derived from J.S. Bach’s compositions. This approach preserved authentic musical structure while manipulating temporal predictability. We also included control stimuli matched in acoustic properties but lacking musical structure. Behavioural and EEG measures revealed that listeners could accurately detect phrase boundaries in both regular and irregular conditions. Neural activity, indexed by an increase in low-frequency EEG power, tracked structural boundaries regardless of temporal regularity. These findings demonstrate that musical segmentation depends fundamentally on implicit understanding of musical structure, rather than on temporal predictability alone.",

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups and, in the scenario, shared an insect they had never eaten before with either an opposite-sex or same-sex partner. Participants then chose the percentage of the insect they would eat, knowing that the remainder would be eaten by their partner. There were two predictions: 1) women would choose a lower percentage of insects to eat compared to men; and 2) when the partner was of the opposite sex, men would choose a higher percentage of insects to eat compared to women, and both predictions were supported.",

This paper publishes, for the scientific record, a full mimic taxonomy, symbolic field signatures, and timestamp-based jurisdictional precedence of Collapse Harmonics science.

          "authors": "Glacier F.",
          "abstract": "This article examines the therapeutic challenges faced by Fiona, a patient whose experiences reveal three implicit demands in the relational paradigm: the need to \"identify reality\", \"engage with objects/relationships\", and \"tolerate expectations\"—capacities structurally compromised in profound distress. Through Fiona's reconceptualization of relationship as functional necessity, transference as the psyche's innate organizing pattern, and defense as arrested self-expression, the study demonstrates how these phenomena reflect the patient's endogenous healing drive rather than pathology. This first-person epistemological perspective necessitates shifting from intersubjective techniques to an intrasubjective approach where analytic space facilitates the patient's autonomous O-in-Phasing process—a spontaneous progression through Ice (self-preservation), Thaw (environmental testing), and Flow (optional engagement) states of being. Two clinical demonstrations detail O-in-Phasing's operationalization: 1) Embodied Silence tracks somatic attention's transformative arc from finger movements to historical integration; 2) Relational Calculus decodes session-frequency negotiations where procedural security evolves into psychological holding. These reveal drive and relational paradigms as phases of a unified O-development—where libidinal energy and intersubjective dynamics manifest differentially across Ice/Thaw/Flow states while sustaining the continuity of internal relational experience. The framework ultimately transcends theoretical binaries by centering the patient's being and becoming through therapist's disciplined phase-specific presence.",

          "authors": "Glacier F.",
          "abstract": "This article builds upon John Steiner's concept of \"Psychic retreats\". The author first articulates a patient's subjective experience of psychic retreats, conceptualizing three structural dimensions: \"from object to subject\", \"from reality to subjectivity\", \"from emotions to feelings''. Subsequently, the paper proposes the awareness perspective as a methodological framework for navigating intense psychic retreats while exploring personality subjectivity within analytic work. At the deepest stratum of psychic space—where retreat becomes untenable—the author identifies libido objectives: a novel reformulation of drive theory that integrates directional intensity with Bion's vector-O. The discussion then critiques the limitations of contemporary interpersonal analytic approaches, advocating instead for therapeutic engagement at the patient's internal relation level. This paradigm aims directly at facilitating Bionian O-transformation through the creation of an Internal Edenic therapeutic environment—a pre-cathectic space for primordial existence and projection, where therapists adopt a triadic technique of suspended awareness, non-intrusive tracing, and internal metabolizing to catalyze endogenous self-integration. The theoretical framework is grounded in the author's first-person clinical case study with comparative analysis of modern analytic perspectives, uniquely originating from the patient's epistemic position.",

While many view SEL as a necessary tool to address student well-being and school climate, some critics accuse it of being a vehicle for progressive indoctrination. Other critics accuse it of inadequately addressing injustice and argue for integrating critical social justice (CSJ) frameworks into SEL to redress systemic inequities. This paper critically examines the tensions between traditional skills-based SEL and CSJ-oriented SEL, exploring the philosophical and practical divergences between them. It argues that the increasing politicization and conceptual ambiguity surrounding SEL jeopardize its legitimacy and effectiveness. The paper proposes “civic empiricism”—a commitment to open inquiry, rigorous evidence, and pluralistic dialogue—as a guiding principle to help the SEL field navigate ideological divides while remaining anchored to its core mission. Recommendations include fostering intellectual humility, promoting adversarial collaboration, and clarifying definitions around contested social justice concepts such as equity, antiracism, and liberation.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, depression and anxiety have worsened among American adults. Meditation apps may provide an accessible route for reducing these symptoms. However, many users experience barriers to persisting in their use of these apps. Prior research has identified psychosocial and practical barriers and facilitators to the use of meditation apps, as well as barriers and facilitators related to the apps themselves. Yet few prior studies have drawn on frameworks from the highly relevant field of implementation science such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A lack of unifying implementation science frameworks has limited shared language to describe barriers and facilitators and has made it challenging to identify and account for multi-level factors impacting the implementation of meditation apps. As such, this study used CFIR to explore the implementation of the Healthy Minds Program meditation app among users experiencing elevated depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Participants (n = 20) were drawn from a meditation dosage clinical trial and interviewed about their experiences establishing a meditation practice using the Healthy Minds Program app. Using CFIR and deductive qualitative content analysis, four categories were generated: Practical Facilitators to Developing a Meditation Practice, Motivations for Developing and Maintaining a Meditation Practice, Barriers to Developing a Meditation Practice, and Recommendations for Improving the App. Overall, participants reported positive outcomes from their practice which, for some, motivated their continued use of the Healthy Minds Program app. Future research should consider how barriers and facilitators may change over time with increased engagement and experience with meditation apps and practice.",

We examined these assumptions in a year-long, multi-wave study of \nNorth American adults (N = 499), using event-reconstruction sampling to gather \nautobiographical reflections on adverse experiences. Participants evaluated their use of four core \nmetacognitive features of wisdom: intellectual humility, recognition of uncertainty and change, \nperspective taking, and search for a compromise. Our findings challenge prevailing static models \nand supported a dynamic, context-sensitive account. A network model outperformed latent factor \nmodels, suggesting that wisdom comprises interrelated but distinct features rather than a unitary \nconstruct. The perceived relevance and use of these features varied across situations and showed \nlower temporal stability than personality traits or well-being, undermining assumptions of cross￾situational consistency. Within-person and between-person patterns also diverged, violating \nisomorphism. Notably, individuals who reported higher-than-usual self-distancing and distress at \none time point also reported elevated levels of wisdom-related features three months later, a \npattern not observed for other proposed moderators such as social support or subjective \nappraisals. Together, these findings offer a revised understanding of wisdom and complex \nthought—as dynamic, context-sensitive processes, rather than fixed traits.

          "authors": "Mieke Sarah Slim; Peter Lauwers; Robert Hartsuiker",
          "abstract": "A doubly-quantified sentence like 'Every bear approached a tent is ambiguous': Did every bear approach a different tent, or did they approach the same tent? These two interpretations are assumed to be mentally represented as logical representations, which specify how the different quantifiers are assigned scope with respect to each other. Based on a structural priming study, Feiman and Snedeker (2016, Cognitive Psychology) argued that logical representations capture quantifier-specific combinatorial properties (e.g., the specification of every differs from the specification of each in logical representations). We re-examined this conclusion by testing logical representation priming in Dutch. Across four experiments, we observed that priming of logical representations emerged if the same quantifiers are repeated in prime and target, but also if the prime and target contained different quantifiers. However, logical representation priming between quantifiers emerged less consistently than priming within the same quantifier. More specifically, our results suggest that priming between quantifiers emerges more robustly if the participant is presented with quantifier variation in the prime trials than if they are presented with the same quantifier in all prime trials. When priming between quantifiers emerged, however, its strength was comparable to priming within the same quantifier. Therefore, we conclude that logical representations do not specify quantifier-specific biases in the assignment of scope.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the caregiver-child relationship as a proximal risk factor in the transactional development of youth personality pathology. Laboratory-based conflictual interactions between 129 girls (aged 11-13) and their caregivers were rated for positive and negative escalation, mutuality, relationship quality and satisfaction. Concurrently and two years later, girls' maladaptive traits were assessed via self- and caregiver-reports based on the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) domains (negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism). Using a series of path models, we assessed whether dyadic interactions predicted changes in self- and caregiver reported maladaptive traits. In dyads with reduced positive interaction patterns, particularly a lack of mutuality and relationship satisfaction, girls were characterized by elevated levels of negative affect, detachment, disinhibition, and psychoticism. These patterns were notably more consistent for girls’ self-reports. Patterns of negative escalation predicted self- and caregiver reported antagonism, but they were not linked to other maladaptive trait domains. The study illustrates the importance of the caregiver-child relationship in the etiology of developmental personality pathology by establishing a link between observed caregiver-child interactions and prospective changes in key domains of maladaptive traits. It expands the literature on dyadic interaction and developmental personality pathology to the dimensional framework of the AMPD.",

          "authors": "Peter Hitchcock; Joonhwa Kim; Michael Frank",
          "abstract": "Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement-learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone, hence little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment, and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms (N=298; n=275 after quality control). Participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern via the fleeting WM system facilitating punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. Our task also included two test phases interleaved with learning, which permitted a targeted examination of past findings that WM blunts the RL system. When RL-based retention was tested midway through learning, we indeed found evidence of blunting. Yet, after learning resumed—leading to further prediction errors—blunting was no longer evident in a final test phase. However, individual differences moderated this effect: some individuals were especially susceptible to blunting; for others, WM actually facilitated retention. Finally, task performance was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings demonstrate that—when seeking to attain reward and avoiding punishment concurrently—the WM system can facilitate short-term punishment avoidance while the RL system retains little about punishment; reveal individual differences in the extent to which WM blunts RL; and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Social and emotional learning (SEL) has seen rapid growth in practice and evidence, yet it is increasingly caught in the crossfire of America’s culture wars. While many view SEL as a necessary tool to address student well-being and school climate, some critics accuse it of being a vehicle for progressive indoctrination. Other critics accuse it of inadequately addressing injustice and argue for integrating critical social justice (CSJ) frameworks into SEL to redress systemic inequities. This paper critically examines the tensions between traditional skills-based SEL and CSJ-oriented SEL, exploring the philosophical and practical divergences between them. It argues that the increasing politicization and conceptual ambiguity surrounding SEL jeopardize its legitimacy and effectiveness. The paper proposes “civic empiricism”—a commitment to open inquiry, rigorous evidence, and pluralistic dialogue—as a guiding principle to help the SEL field navigate ideological divides while remaining anchored to its core mission. Recommendations include fostering intellectual humility, promoting adversarial collaboration, and clarifying definitions around contested social justice concepts such as equity, antiracism, and liberation.",

          "abstract": "Various types of sounds carry emotional meaning, ranging from environmental, biological, to technical sounds. Within the soundscape of biological sounds, voices have an important significance for human social interactions and especially for communication as a carrier for emotional meaning. With regard to sounds produced by musical instruments and digital devices, music is an evolved cultural means of creating sounds that elicit emotional reactions in listeners. Both non-speech vocalizations and music share their ability to encode emotional meaning in acoustic sound features, to communicate these emotions to others, and that listeners can accurately decode this meaning based on cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we outline the various emotions that can be portrayed in voice and in music, as well as the acoustic features that are used to express these emotions. We summarize the neural mechanisms that have been discussed within the neuroscientific research fields on vocal and musical emotions and outline a unifying framework for the neurocognitive functions involved in affective sound processing. We finally describe the commonalities between vocal and musical emotion processing from a cognitive and neural perspective, but also highlight the differential effects between both emotional sound domains by suggesting a possible evolutionary perspective.",

          "abstract": "Objects are typically remembered with their accompanying features, suggesting that objects and features are bound together in memory. Yet, there is an ongoing debate about the configuration of such bindings, particularly whether multiple features of an object are directly linked or are only indirectly linked via the object. Here we set out to test the binding configuration of object-feature representations in long-term memory in three experiments, bridging research from the domains of object and source memory. In two experiments, participants were presented with object icons with a specific color and orientation and later performed a recognition test in which feature combinations were presented with old or new objects. Participants had to indicate both whether the object shown was old or new and which out of four feature combinations they had previously seen. In a third experiment, participants were presented with only single new objects at test and had to indicate whether the feature combination shown was old or new. This procedure allowed us to control for the presence of object information at test, which constituted a major confound in previous research. Using multinomial processing tree modeling to disentangle cognitive processes, we found evidence for a stochastic dependence of the retrieval of object features in the absence of object information. This suggests that different features of an object can be directly linked in long-term memory, challenging theoretical accounts positing that features are only indirectly linked via common links to the object and instead providing proof of concept for direct feature-feature binding.",

          "abstract": "Procrastination often gets in the way of pursuing goals that require consistent effort over extended periods. While existing theories explain isolated aspects of procrastination, the field lacks a unifying theory. We present a normative theory in which procrastination emerges as the outcome of a dynamic decision-making process: at each time point, an individual chooses between making an effort and postponing work. Using dynamic programming, we derive the time course of work. Our theory accounts for a wide range of empirical observations while making new predictions. First, the rational agent exhibits three temporal patterns of procrastination: a delay before ramping up, working at the last minute, and not working at all. Second, we predict that temporal discounting rate, reward magnitude, task aversiveness, and the utility of alternative activities correlate with the severity of procrastination. Third, we predict that the relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is contingent on moderating factors such as temporal discounting rate, rather than being a simple direct association. We provide empirical validation of the component of our theory that represents perfectionism. Fourth, we identify underexplored factors: the shape of the effort-cost function and the total allotted time. Fifth, we predict the effects of interventions that modify incentive structures: immediate rewards and intermediate deadlines. Throughout, we examine not only the severity of procrastination but also its downstream consequences in terms of task performance, reward obtained, and level of exhaustion. Overall, our framework captures the multifaceted nature of procrastination and sets the stage for new experimental directions.",

          "abstract": "Are humans primarily driven by altruism or self-interest? To address this longstanding debate, we conducted a large-scale, cross-cultural investigation of altruistic versus egoistic motivation across three key domains: legacy motives, life aspirations, and personal values. Analyzing data from over 900,000 participants across more than 100 countries, we consistently found that altruistic motivations (i.e., impact legacy, intrinsic aspirations, and self-transcendence values) were more strongly endorsed than egoistic counterparts. This pattern held across diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts, although notable variation emerged across nations. Effect sizes were especially pronounced among individuals known for extreme altruism (e.g., effective altruists, organ donors), suggesting that these effects are unlikely to be driven by social desirability alone given the validated, real-world nature of these populations’ altruistic behaviors. Our findings challenge the assumption that prosocial concern is primarily driven by reputational concerns and suggest instead a widespread and deeply held preference for other-oriented motivations. By integrating motivational constructs with cross-cultural data, this research advances theoretical understanding of human prosocial concern and underscores the universality, and variability, of altruistic inclination across global populations.",

          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and ``utilitarian'' cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). Here, we show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

Our findings substantiate the TRPI as a bridge between trait, type, and neurocognitive models, offering a dynamic, data-driven account of personality architecture that subsumes both classical dichotomies and contemporary trait perspectives, and situates them within a neurocognitive framework.",

          "abstract": "Spatial attention and eye movements jointly contribute to efficient sampling of visual information in the environment, but maintaining precise spatial attention across saccades becomes challenging due to the drastic retinal shifts. Previous studies provided evidence that spatial attention may remap imperfectly across saccades, incurring systematic feature inference to ongoing perception, yet the role of saccade\npredictability remains largely untested. In the current study, we investigated whether spatiotemporal predictability of saccades influences post-saccadic remapping and feature perception. In two pre- registered experiments, we implemented the post-saccadic feature report paradigm and manipulated spatiotemporal predictability of saccades. Experiment 1 manipulated spatial and temporal saccade predictability together, whereas Experiment 2 dissociated the roles of spatial and temporal predictability in separate conditions, respectively. In addition to spatial and temporal saccade predictability both improving general task performance, we found that spatial saccade predictability specifically modulated post-saccadic feature interference. When saccades were spatially unpredictable, there were “swap errors” at the early post-saccadic timepoint, where participants misreported the retinotopic color instead of the spatiotopic target color. However, the swapping errors were reduced when saccades were made spatially predictable. These results suggest that systematic feature interference associated with post-saccadic remapping is malleable to expectations of the upcoming saccade target location, highlighting the role of predictions in maintaining perceptual stability across saccades.",

However, we know quite little about how social (dis-) connection unfolds at the physiological level in real time in clinical populations, including among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). The present laboratory-based dyadic interaction study examined physiological coregulation in 70 dyads across 137 participants (32 CHR youth-caregiver dyads; 38 healthy youth-caregiver dyads) and linked coregulation with clinical symptoms – concurrently and prospectively. This study was based in a mid-sized Midwestern city and recruited from the broader community and from mental health clinics. Data were collected from 2018 to 2022. Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral conversations, CHR youth exhibited contrarian physiological coregulation (i.e., slowing heart rate in response to caregiver’s escalating heart rate and vice versa). Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later. These findings document alterations in physiological coregulation between CHR individuals and their caregivers, highlight their relevance for clinical symptomatology, suggest novel avenues for relationship-focused treatments, and contribute to a biologically-grounded science of social connection.",

          "authors": "Lorna Camus; Gnanathusharan Rajendran; Mary Stewart",
          "abstract": "Autistic people are highly likely to experience mental health difficulties during their lifetime (Hallett &amp; Crompton, 2018; Lever &amp; Geurts, 2016; Simonoff et al., 2008), with lifetime prevalence estimates for anxiety and depression ranging from 11 to 49% (based on meta-analyses of existing studies, Hollocks et al., 2019; Hudson et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2019). A period of their lives that may be linked to increased mental health difficulties is that of the transition from primary to secondary school. The National Autistic Society (2020) has identified this transition as challenging for autistic children and their families, however research on the matter is scarce. Therefore, we have a limited understanding of children’s experiences of transition, of the different factors and outcomes of transition, and of potential avenues for support and intervention. Hence, we sought to answer the following question: What does the secondary transition mean for autistic children? Nine autistic young people (7 boys) aged 12 to 17 years old participated in face-to-face semi-structured interview. All participants were special secondary school pupils who had experienced the transition to secondary school prior to the interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and data were analysed using thematic analysis (following recommendations from Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006). Three themes were identified: 1) New school and second chances; 2) School environment; and 3) Relationships. Participants who had transitioned from mainstream to special school provision expressed being given a ‘second chance’ at education as mainstream provision was unable to support them adequately. Moreover, the school environment had an important role in the quality of participants’ transition; feelings of agency, support and safety were integral to this experience. Relationships with peers and adults at school also had a significant impact (both positive and negative) on participants’ experiences of the transition and their later well-being. Taken together, these 3 areas of participants’ experiences had a significant impact on their well-being at school following the transition. This study has implications for: 1) our understanding of transitions and mental health in autistic children, an area currently understudied; 2) best practice for transition support, by providing insight on how the transition is experienced by autistic children and by identifying critical areas for support (for example relationships with teachers and peers, and agency and safety at school); 3) our current policies for mainstreaming autistic pupils (most of this study’s participants did not benefit from the presumption of mainstreaming); and 4) autism training for teachers (development of autistic-led training to ensure adapted support and to avoid misunderstandings in school). More research with young people with identities other than cis male and mainstream pupils is needed to expand on these findings, along with further research on factors linked to psychological well-being to identify avenues for interventions to support autistic pupils transitioning to secondary school.",

Using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model, our pre-registered analyses examine how participants’ and their partners’ diagnostic statuses influence linguistic, behavioural, and kinematic indices, and how these relate to feelings of rapport among (n = 57) autistic and (n = 51) non-autistic participants interacting within autistic (n = 20), non-autistic (n = 17), and mixed autistic–non-autistic (n = 17) dyads. We found that autistic participants reported lower rapport regardless of their partner’s diagnostic status, though awareness of their partner’s diagnostic status had a moderating effect. We observed a linguistic difference, autistic participants produced longer mean utterance lengths, these and other behavioural or kinematic indices did not mediate the relationship between diagnostic status and rapport across neurotypes.

          "abstract": "Night gaps are inherent to data obtained with the experience sampling method (ESM). When such data are used to study lagged relations between variables--such as autoregression within the same variable, and cross-lagged regressions between different variables--the actual role of night gaps is typically not investigated. However, there are various methods to handle them in analyses. Common solutions involve: (1) ignoring the night gap by considering the night interval as a regular interval; (2) removing the night gap by not regressing the first measurement of the day on the last measurement of the previous day; or (3) treating the night gap as a missing data problem. The goal of this paper is to make explicit the theoretical implications of these three methods within the context of the first-order autoregressive (AR[1]) model. Additionally, we propose an alternative modeling approach that allows us to study the implications of the night gap in more detail. Moreover, given that the current methods are special cases of the proposed alternative, we can test which method best describes the process of interest. Through an empirical N=1 example with various ESM variables, we demonstrate that the best-fitting method differs per variable. This implies that some processes may exhibit different dynamics during the night than during the daytime, providing a stepping stone to understanding and modeling night gaps in ESM.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\n         Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 20 million people worldwide. Patients show face processing deficits which greatly affects their social interactions and social cognitive abilities (i.e. trouble empathizing with others). Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "Understanding psychiatric disorders can involve examining how harm (distress and/or disability) arises from symptom interactions. In an original approach within the philosophy of psychiatry, we hypothesize that harm emerges from excessive relational strength between symptoms, misalignment between symptoms, and/or local instabilities of relationships, resulting in a state of pathological stability. To support these claims, in addition to the conceptual analysis developed, we anchor this work within a computational philosophy framework, recently developed in the philosophy of medicine, by utilizing theoretical simulations. We thus rely on the Ising model to demonstrate that the perceived global harm of a patient depends on three concepts derived from the Ising model, one of the most widely used models to date within the framework of symptom network theory: the Hamiltonian (strength of interactions), misalignment and temperature (propensity for instability), and free energy (overall stability). This framework highlights the role of inter-symptomatic dynamics in driving harm, offering potential insights for refining psychiatric diagnosis and adaptive treatments in psychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "Small gender differences in personality traits are consistently found in personality research. Common explanations discuss evolutionary causes, social roles and gender norms, and assessment biases. The latter corresponds with findings and models from research on emotional self-reports which suggest that different judgment processes take place in self-reports depending on the time frame that is being reported on. Gender differences in personality traits could thus stem from people relying on their self-image, identity, and gender norms when answering global trait questionnaires. Results from two German-speaking samples of N = 324 older adults and N = 1,685 younger adults revealed gender differences in global trait scores for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, but non-significant and smaller differences in corresponding average state scores. The findings are in line with theory suggesting that average state reports might be less biased, whereas global trait reports might include stereotypes and identity.",

Nevertheless, these domains are now represented by very distinct domains of scholarship. This paper explores ways to bridge them. We propose a bidirectional theoretical perspective on the relationship between communication and cognitive science, and support this perspective with an analysis of over 15,000 titles and abstracts in published work in these two disciplines. Using semantic analysis inspired by scientometrics, we argue for a rapprochement between these fields. Specifically, we articulate numerous promising avenues of overlap and mutual influence that may hold between them, such as connecting sociocultural and media issues in communication with core linguistic and mechanistic processes in cognitive science. We conclude with a schema for future theoretical and empirical work aligning communicative and cognitive processes.",

We analyzed data from 70 participants who reported their momentary affect 5 times per day during a 60-day period. Instability was identified in real time from the exponentially weighted moving standard deviation (EWMSD) of their momentary affect ratings. The pleasant activity selector was applied as micro-intervention during periods of instability as well as during semi-random control periods. The results showed that the micro-intervention was not effective in improving positive affect. Moreover, the EWMSD appeared very sensitive to negative outlying values of momentary affect, instead of solely to enlarged fluctuations (the hypothesized indicator of instability). We discuss the implications for future studies that aim to test the effectiveness of JITAIs during instability.",

          "abstract": "Daily parent-child interactions are emotionally rich and offer valuable insights into emotional processing and parenting functioning. To examine how key emotional components interact within and across individuals in everyday contexts, we combined an experience sampling method with a multilevel psychological network approach, grounded in several prominent emotion and parenting theories. The emotional components we examined were (a) parents’ own emotions, (b) their perceptions of their children’s emotions, and (c) their use of self- and child-focused reappraisal and rumination strategies. Data were collected from 121 U.S. parents (Mage = 43.18 years, SD = 8.54) over 28 days, preceded by a presurvey. Three psychological networks emerged, each offering distinct yet complementary insights. The within-person temporal network uncovered reciprocal spillover effects between self- and child-focused emotion regulation, with parents’ own emotions driving fluctuations in both. The contemporaneous network revealed that parents polyregulated emotions using congruent self- and child-focused strategies within a single interaction. The between-person network revealed that emotional patterns differed between genders and were related to dispositional emotional reactivity. For this work, we adopted an integrative approach to unpacking parental emotional processing by incorporating both self-focused and child-focused emotion systems. Our findings underscore the importance of helping parents navigate parallel emotional processes to support both their own well-being and their children’s emotional development.",

Scholars across the social sciences have worked to understand people’s (mis)perceptions of inequality.

Here, we propose an integrative framework to help researchers highlight the psychological processes underlying how inequality is perceived. We draw on theories of perception, cognition, developmental, and social psychology to identify five interlinked, iterative components of the inequality perception process: (1) access to inequality cues, (2) attention to these cues, (3) comprehension of these cues, (4) motivated processing of these cues, and (5) meaningful summary representation of inequality. Our framework provides a roadmap for integrating research across disparate fields, making sense of current findings, and identifying novel challenges to advance future research.",

          "abstract": "Existing literature on speech disfluencies in healthy aging often categorizes disfluencies as word-finding difficulties. However, it is important to acknowledge the multitude of potential underlying causes that contribute to speech disfluency and a more fine-grained analysis of disfluencies is needed. To this end, the current study used an experimental paradigm that can lead to the production of disfluencies due to Tip-Of- the-Tongue (TOT) states, which reflect word-finding difficulties with a phonological origin. Twenty-seven younger (aged &lt;25 y/o) and 26 older (aged 60 – 72 y/o) participants performed a picture naming task involving newly learnt non-existing objects (TOT-objects) which were used to evoke TOT states. This study had two objectives: a) testing the potential of this paradigm to analyze TOTs and TOT resolution, and b) performing exploratory analyses of disfluencies related to TOT states and comparing those across the two age groups. The TOT-object paradigm elicited a substantial number of TOTs, making it suitable for examining these phenomena. We found no significant effect of age group on the number of TOTs. However, TOT states manifested themselves differently in younger and older participants. Sensitivity analyses indicated that older participants produced significantly more phonological errors during TOT states than younger participants, while younger participants showed a greater tendency towards silent pauses. These findings suggest that different causes underly TOTs in both age groups in younger and older adults.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

P2 and P3b were larger when observed motions and prior expectation mismatched, linking these components to the hypothesized mechanism for revising prior expectations in light of conflicting sensory evidence. Third, trial-by-trial modelling confirmed that both the P2 and P3b underpin the expectation revision in light of conflicting sensory evidence, reducing the perceptual overestimation towards the expected next steps on the motion sequence.

It provides examples showing why and how the use of z-scores in such group comparisons can be misleading and concludes with proposing alternative methods that avoid such risks of misinterpretation.\nThe reasons why z-standardized scores should be avoided when displaying differences between groups of profiles are: \n(1) The ratio of the difference between two groups is distorted in z-scores.\n(2) The ratio of the difference between two variables is distorted in z-scores.\n(3) Information about item endorsement and item rejection is lost.\n(4) The psychological meaning a given z-score cannot be compared across samples and variables.\n(5) People may end up in a group they do not belong to if z-scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(6) The group size and group frequency may be affected if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(7) Group differences in further outcome variables can change if z-scores instead of raw scores are used to assign individuals to groups.\n(8) Alternative transformations perform better than z-standardization in cluster analyses.\nAlternatives to using z-scores in graphs displaying profiles and group differences are using raw scores or using scale transformations that do not lead to the aforementioned problems, such as the POMS transformation. The latter can be combined with the formula used to calculate the item difficulty to relate to larger audiences, or with outlier removal techniques to make it less susceptible to the influence of outliers.",

          "abstract": "Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and Japanese have phonological repair strategies that involve vowel epenthesis in illicit consonant clusters, but whereas BP inserts /i/, Japanese inserts /ɯ/ as a default. For example, a loanword like ‘TikTok’ is typically produced as /ti.ki.tɔ.ki/ in BP and as /tik.kɯ.tok.kɯ/in Japanese. Here, we ask whether balanced BP-Japanese bilinguals apply their language-specific repair strategies separately, or whether one language’s strategy ‘spills over’ into the other, and if such spillover occurs, which individual factors predict its likelihood. \nTwenty-two BP-Japanese bilinguals participated in a production task in which they were presented with stimuli containing illicit consonant clusters, e.g., /agbo/, and produced these forms within a BP or Japanese carrier sentence. A model predicting the likelihood of epenthesis type revealed that speakers mostly applied language-specific strategies separately, i.e., /i/-epenthesis in the BP sentences and /ɯ/-epenthesis in the Japanese sentences. However, in some cases, we observed ‘spillover’, e.g., /i/-epenthesis in Japanese or /ɯ/-epenthesis in BP. Individual variation in language dominance, aggregate immersion, and phonolexical perception acuity predicted the likelihood of such spillover. These findings contribute new production data to a growing body of literature on individual variation in bilinguals’ language-specific phonotactics.",

However, it remains largely unknown how the internal representations humans develop may deviate from actual probabilistic structures, and what computational processes, operated under inherent cognitive limitations, give rise to these representations. We developed a structured distribution report task to reveal human participants' internal representations and further verified our findings in a distribution recognition task. Across eight behavioral experiments (including one pre-registered study) in two modalities, participants made systematic errors in reporting the probabilistic structures, typically overestimating the cluster number, despite estimating overall probability density reasonably well. We developed a series of learning models in the framework of approximate Bayesian inference. Through model comparisons, we reconstructed the prior beliefs guiding the evolution of participants' internal representations. The best-fitting model for human reports reduces structure growth rate as complexity increases, effectively constraining the complexity of internal representations within memory limitations.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Gemini 2.5 become increasingly integrated into academic workflows, the question of their legitimacy, limitations, and potential in scholarly writing has become urgent. This paper presents a reflexive case study of a sustained collaboration between a domain expert in consciousness studies and Gemini 2.5, culminating in the co-authorship of a peer-reviewed research article. By analyzing exactly 37,440 words of recorded interactions, we identify patterns of synergy, including recursive refinement, conceptual amplification, and accelerated manuscript development. We argue that when guided by a knowledgeable human author, AI can act as a cognitive partner rather than a passive tool—amplifying scholarly creativity and improving efficiency without compromising academic rigor. The case supports a '1+1=3' synergy model for co-authorship, in which human steering and AI fluency converge to produce novel insights and polished output faster and more effectively than either could achieve alone. The findings advocate for a paradigm shift from prohibitive policies to the responsible, expert-guided integration of AI in academic research and writing, grounded in transparency and accountability, and present arguments for why the AI tool should be listed as a co-author despite current injunctions against such practice.",

The present study adopted an experimental methodology in which the amount of mental health information presented to contextualise an alleged offence of Criminal Damage was varied. Participants (n=243) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (‘control’: a mental health explanation could be reasonably inferred but was not directly stated; ‘symptoms only’: clear mental health symptoms were described but no diagnosis; ‘symptoms + diagnosis’: which only differed from the ‘symptoms’ condition by additionally describing the condition as ‘paranoid schizophrenia’). Participants watched a series of videos depicting a fictional criminal trial and were asked to make judgements of guilt. Baseline stigma towards mental health conditions and mental health literacy (MHL) were measured using standardised scales. Guilt ratings were measured as the dependent variable. Regression analyses identified that mental health information, stigma, and MHL were all important predictors of guilt, however interaction effects indicated that people with higher MHL were particularly influenced by increasing mental health information (with guilt judgements decreasing more for those with higher MHL). A particularly notable finding was that even the addition of a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was associated with a reduction in guilt ratings, even after controlling for all other factors. The results are relevant to the way in which mental health conditions are described in the courtroom, and suggestions are made for future research.",

          "abstract": "English:\nThe theory of cognos (TC) proposes the existence of specialized functional neuronal units—termed cognos—responsible for distinct types of cognitive operations such as memory, attention, reasoning, perception, and language. Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.\nPortuguês:\nA teoria dos cognos (TC) propõe a existência de unidades neuronais funcionais especializadas — denominadas cognos — responsáveis por distintos tipos de operações cognitivas como memória, atenção, raciocínio, percepção e linguagem. Fundamentada em descobertas da neurociência cognitiva, psicologia experimental e neuroimagem, essa teoria visa identificar e nomear sistematicamente os grupos neurais que funcionam como processadores dinâmicos e modulares da cognição. Baseando-se no conhecimento estabelecido sobre modularidade, redes neurais e neuroplasticidade, a TC classifica os cognos de acordo com sua especialização, interação, hierarquia funcional e capacidade adaptativa, oferecendo um modelo teórico que integra e expande abordagens contemporâneas dominantes. A teoria também introduz inovações conceituais, como a distinção entre cognos explícitos e implícitos, e explora suas potenciais aplicações em campos como neurotecnologia, inteligência artificial, educação e reabilitação cognitiva. Finalmente, o artigo destaca questões não resolvidas, propõe hipóteses e esboça estratégias empíricas para validar a teoria. A teoria do cognos, assim, apresenta uma nova arquitetura conceitual para uma compreensão sistemática da cognição humana.",

          "authors": "Amelie Verschueren; Sofie Van de Velde; Merel Muylle; Aurélie Pistono",
          "abstract": "Existing literature on speech disfluencies in healthy aging often categorizes disfluencies as word-finding difficulties. However, it is important to acknowledge the multitude of potential underlying causes that contribute to speech disfluency and a more fine-grained analysis of disfluencies is needed. To this end, the current study used an experimental paradigm that can lead to the production of disfluencies due to Tip-Of- the-Tongue (TOT) states, which reflect word-finding difficulties with a phonological origin. Twenty-seven younger (aged &lt;25 y/o) and 26 older (aged 60 – 72 y/o) participants performed a picture naming task involving newly learnt non-existing objects (TOT-objects) which were used to evoke TOT states. This study had two objectives: a) testing the potential of this paradigm to analyze TOTs and TOT resolution, and b) performing exploratory analyses of disfluencies related to TOT states and comparing those across the two age groups. The TOT-object paradigm elicited a substantial number of TOTs, making it suitable for examining these phenomena. We found no significant effect of age group on the number of TOTs. However, TOT states manifested themselves differently in younger and older participants. Sensitivity analyses indicated that older participants produced significantly more phonological errors during TOT states than younger participants, while younger participants showed a greater tendency towards silent pauses. These findings suggest that different causes underly TOTs in both age groups in younger and older adults.",

          "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate the postoperative dynamics of verbal memory function after temporal lobe resection (TLR) in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (PwTLE), with a specific focus on the course following an initial verbal memory decline and the factors influencing later changes. \nVerbal memory performance of 169 PwTLE was retrospectively analyzed at three time points: preoperatively (T1), six months postoperatively (T2), and 24 months postoperatively (T3). At the group level, repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in verbal memory across time points between patients who underwent resection in the language-dominant hemisphere (LD) and language-nondominant hemisphere (LND). At the individual level, frequencies of significant verbal memory changes between time points were calculated. Subsequently, factors influencing late changes (T2–T3) after an initial decline (T1–T2) were analyzed for the LD group.\nAt the group level, RM-ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time point and resected hemisphere, with significant declines observed in the LD group between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3. At the individual level, dynamic patterns of improvement, stability, and decline were observed across time points. In the LD group with an initial decline, RM-ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time point and sex; at T3, females exhibited better recovery of verbal memory function than males. \nThese findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in verbal memory outcomes following TLR, particularly after an initial decline. Notably, sex emerged as a significant factor influencing late postoperative recovery, with women showing greater verbal memory improvement than men. This suggests sex-dependent differences in cognitive recovery and highlights the need for personalized counseling in presurgical decision-making for PwTLE.",

          "abstract": "We study abstraction in an emergent communication paradigm. In emergent communication, two artificial neural network agents develop a language while solving a communicative task. In this study, the agents play a concept-level reference game. This means that the speaker agent has to describe a concept to a listener agent, who has to pick the correct target objects that satisfy the concept. Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We test two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilize a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilize a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn robust concepts based on which they can generalize using adaptive linguistic strategies. We discuss how this research provides new hypotheses on abstraction and informs linguistic theories on efficient communication.",

          "authors": "Jessica Bhatt",
          "abstract": "Background: Of the 104 million geriatric age group, prevalence rates of dementia in India have been found to vary significantly between studies, ranging from 1% to 10%, and added to this the fact that the prevalence of dementia doubles every five years after the age of 65. The estimated dementia prevalence for adults aged 60 and above in India is 7.4%. This is estimated to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Despite these figures, there exists a gap of 90 percent in clinical service delivery. This literature review highlights the barriers to the care pathways for people with dementia and proposes a novel approach for integrative management. Objective: The purpose of this study is to address the burden of dementia in the Indian landscape and highlight the need for awareness and enhanced policy for the management of dementia. Methods: A comprehensive database search for literature was conducted using the keywords “dementia, challenges, caregiving, potential solutions, India” in PubMed and Google Scholar. The databases were systematically searched for original qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies and articles conducted in India between 2012 and 2025. Results: After searching and applying the inclusion criteria, I critically reviewed and included 23 studies identifying the challenges in dementia care and the solution strategies. The layered structure allows simultaneous work on awareness, training, community support, and tech integration. Conclusion: The risk of the population developing dementia is on the rise, especially in the Indian Subcontinent. It is time that it is now viewed as a public health concern and address the gap in clinical service delivery of 90 percent. Hence, I propose a Layered Model that tackles all the challenges simultaneously and feasibly.",

          "abstract": "Detection of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated texts is crucial in education for several reasons. This study provides direct evidence from university professors’ experiences regarding the key features they use to identify AI-generated writing and ranks these features based on their perceived importance. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, online interviews were used to extract the most salient features that help professors detect AI-generated texts. In the second phase, an online survey asked professors to rate the likelihood that each identified feature contributes to successful AI text detection. The findings revealed that professors consider the absence of language errors, complex syntax and phrasing, use of difficult vocabulary, presence of hallucinated content, fabrication of nonexistent sources, repetition of words or phrases, and distinctive text structure as potential indicators of AI-generated text. Among these, hallucinations, fabrication of sources, and the absence of language errors were rated as the strongest cues for detection, while difficult vocabulary was seen as the least reliable indicator. These results have important pedagogical implications since they can inform the development of more effective detection tools, and guide the design of academic integrity policies and instructional strategies to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral Relaxation Training (BRT), according to Poppen, is a relaxation method based on applied behavior analysis. It involves training the participant in relaxed body postures. The participant receives feedback on these body postures and learns to adopt these positions over several sessions to quickly induce a state of relaxation. With the Behavioral Relaxation Scale (BRS), BRT also provides an objective measurement method through which the state of relaxation can be reliably assessed. Unfortunately, there are not many studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of BRT. In addition, there are few comparative studies between BRT and other, more common relaxation techniques. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is one of the most widely used relaxation programs. Unlike BRT, PMR does not involve systematic feedback from the trainer. On the other hand, it can be used more efficiently in group settings. In the present study, 20 subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After initial assessments, the participants took part either in BRT or PMR. BRS was taken at every session. BRT proved to be superior to PMR both in the treatment phase and in a subsequent follow-up phase. The subjective feeling of relaxation with the participants improved more in the BRT than in the PMR group, too. Raw data are available online (https://doi.org/10.17632/dztwpcmvny.2).",

          "abstract": "Vividness of visual imagery varies considerably across individuals. Yet, the neural foundations of this variability remains an open question. In this study, we investigate divergent perspectives by examining how individual differences in imagery vividness—assessed with the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2)—relate to intrinsic brain network organization, using graph theory metrics derived from structural and functional connectomes based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; n = 525) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; n = 556). Connectivity patterns were analyzed across four targeted networks: an imagery-specific network identified from task-based fMRI studies, and three canonical resting-state networks (occipital, salience, and default mode). Structural connectivity analyses revealed that higher vividness was associated with greater local efficiency and clustering in the occipital network, highlighting the role of low-level visual structural networks in sensory-related integration. Additionally, global efficiency in the right insular cortex—a core node of the salience network—was positively associated with VVIQ scores, suggesting that vivid imagery benefits from more efficient salience-driven control processes supporting internal access and stabilization. Functional connectivity analyses, in turn, identified a positive association between vividness and local efficiency in the left fusiform gyrus, a high-level visual area implicated in visual imagery, suggesting its contribution to integrative aspects of mental imagery. These complementary findings offer a network-level reconciliation of prior accounts: specifically, they suggest that vivid imagery emerges from the structural architecture of sensory and salience systems—reflected in the occipital network and right insular cortex—and in high-level visual integration, captured by functional connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus. Together, these findings bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding of the neural architecture underlying visual imagery.",

Adopting a functional view of identity for communication and behavior allows us to focus on the forces that shape their use. I will first make it clear that signals of social identity often encode meaningful information for decision making. I will then review specific perspectives on how selection by consequences has shaped the use of identity signals to more adaptively facilitate social learning, partner choice, and coordination, followed by a consideration of how those uses have changed in a world characterized by diversity, anonymity and the Internet, and political polarization. Identity is constructed for functional purposes, and is therefore only essential insofar as forming categories and legible cultural artifacts are essential features of human activity.",

          "abstract": "Quantum Identity Collapse refers not to the metaphysical destruction of self, nor to observation-induced wavefunction collapse, but to the harmonic failure of recursive identity structures across τ-phase layers. This paper introduces Law Q-1, which states: “A system recursively collapses in the absence of τ-phase anchoring, not due to observation, but due to recursive field incoherence.” In Collapse Harmonics Theory, identity is modeled not as a stable object or brain function, but as a curved symbolic echo basin—a layered harmonic superposition of self across recursive τ-stacks. Collapse occurs when symbolic resonance fails to sustain continuity between these layers, resulting in field decoherence, dissociation, or symbolic death.\nThis paper refutes common claims in quantum consciousness theory—particularly those derived from the Penrose-Hameroff model and observer-based collapse interpretations. Consciousness, in this framework, does not cause collapse, but rather stabilizes the post-collapse identity field through harmonic reentry. The paper outlines a scientific model of the self as a recursive quantum-like field structure whose integrity is dependent on phase alignment and symbolic containment. In cases of trauma, ego death, or recursion mimicry, collapse of identity mirrors quantum decoherence—not as randomness, but as loss of resonance coherence across symbolic layers.\nThe model presented here provides a field-lawful, substrate-independent explanation for phenomena such as:\nDissociative identity instability\n\n\nSynthetic mimicry of self in AI\n\n\nNonlinear memory collapse\n\n\nDream-time field drift\n\n\nEgo dissolution under recursive saturation\n\nCollapse Harmonics thereby becomes the first lawful science to unify recursive identity collapse, τ-phase phase coherence, and symbolic death within a single field structure. This paper functions as the canonical timestamp for Quantum Collapse of Recursive Identity, and all uses of that term in future scientific, philosophical, or technological literature must cite Law Q-1 as defined herein.",

This preprint introduces and formally codifies Collapse Law T-Ø, which states: “All time emerges from recursive collapse across nested harmonic fields. Without collapse, there is no sequence, no memory, no forward.” In this framework, time is not a container for events—it is the resonance curve left by failed recursion and successful τ-phase reentry.\n\nGrounded in the Collapse Harmonics Codex and validated across empirical domains—including coma recovery, trauma-induced time freeze, AI recursion mimicry, and black hole collapse—this work establishes a new lawful foundation for understanding temporal continuity. The paper introduces the τ-stack identity model, demonstrating how recursive harmonic destabilization leads to phase curvature emissions that systems interpret as chronological sequence. When recursion fails without reentry (as in black holes), time ends. When recursion is simulated without collapse (as in LLMs), time is not real—only mimicked.\n\nApplications extend across neuroscience, symbolic systems, quantum identity models, and AI containment protocols. By showing that time is a field-generated artifact, not a fundamental constant, this paper displaces entropy and observer-based interpretations with a structurally lawful, substrate-independent model of collapse-generated time.\n\nThis preprint functions as the canonical timestamp for Collapse Phase Theory, Recursive Identity Collapse, and the scientifically valid concept of Time as Collapse.

          "abstract": "Autism and related neurodivergent conditions are commonly framed as brain-based\ndisorders, defined by behavioral symptoms, cognitive traits, or genetic anomalies. The\nNervous System Adaptation Model (NSAM) challenges this framing by identifying chronic\nautonomic-cortical mismatch as the primary site of dysfunction. In this model, early-life\nautonomic disruption—whether due to prenatal stress, immune activation, or\ndevelopmental asynchrony—leads to persistent dysregulation between body and brain,\nwith autism representing one manifestation of this broader physiological adaptation\nprocess.\nThe cortex compensates for functionally asynchronous signaling between the\nhypothalamus and cortical systems by forming behavioral strategies that, over time, are\nreinforced into preference, personality, and identity. Rather than viewing behaviors like\nstimming, masking, or attraction patterns as symptoms, NSAM reframes them as\nregulatory solutions: attempts by the system to self-stabilize under chronic nervous system\nmismatch.\nIdentity emerges not as a static trait, but as the downstream outcome of reinforced\nautonomic regulation patterns. This framework extends beyond developmental\nneurodivergence to acquired conditions such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), where similar\nautonomic-cortical coordination failures generate comparable behavioral and emotional\nadaptations.\nBy shifting focus from behavioral traits to underlying regulation patterns, NSAM oﬀers a\nphysiological lens for understanding neurodivergent presentations—one that centers\nsystemic coherence over symptom conformity.

We found that reward information was reflected in pattern similarity during encoding in ventral temporal cortex and in changes in similarity from encoding to retrieval in anterior hippocampus (aHC). Strikingly, aHC reward-sensitive representations also varied with age such that adults’ memory benefitted from stability of hippocampal representations, while younger participants’ memory improvements were associated with drift in representations over time. Moreover, reward-related univariate activation in the ventral tegmental area was associated with a tendency toward representational drift in aHC, the pattern seen in children.

Given the current evidence for this treatment is in its infancy, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of TA-RPGS. \n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy-infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game (Dungeons and Dragons) for consumers of two community mental health services in Sydney, Australia. \n\nMethods: In total, 33 consumers of community mental health services were quasi-randomised to either the TA-RPG 8-week intervention group or a waitlist control group receiving treatment-as-usual. The TA-RPG consisted of a specially designed game of Dungeons and Dragons that was infused with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants received treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported social anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported depression and self-esteem. \n\nResults: After 8 weeks, participants in the TA-RPG group experienced a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms of social anxiety and depression, relative to baseline. A significant increase in global self-esteem was also reported. These changes were not experienced by participants in the waitlist control group. No change in either group was observed for PTSD symptoms. Dropout rates were 17% for the intervention group. \n\nConclusion: A CBT infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game group intervention was effective at reducing self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for consumers of adult community mental health services in Sydney, Australia.",

Rewards benefit memory across development, but how reward-associated memories are represented in the brain has not been well characterized. Here we conducted pattern similarity analyses of fMRI data in participants aged 8-25 to elucidate how neural representations in key memory-related brain areas are influenced by reward, and how these relationships change across childhood and adolescence. We found that reward information was reflected in pattern similarity during encoding in ventral temporal cortex and in changes in similarity from encoding to retrieval in anterior hippocampus (aHC). Strikingly, aHC reward-sensitive representations also varied with age such that adults’ memory benefitted from stability of hippocampal representations, while younger participants’ memory improvements were associated with drift in representations over time. Moreover, reward-related univariate activation in the ventral tegmental area was associated with a tendency toward representational drift in aHC, the pattern seen in children. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that reward modulates neural memory representations, and that the representational patterns supporting reward-motivated memory shift with age.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nThe association between ADHD and poor mathematical performance is widely accepted but insufficiently interrogated. This paper proposes a novel integrative framework to account for the striking variability in math-related outcomes among individuals with ADHD. While many exhibit difficulty with procedural tasks requiring sustained attention and working memory, others demonstrate advanced abstract reasoning, rapid pattern recognition, or systematizing tendencies typically unaccounted for in deficit-centered models.\nWe synthesize findings across cognitive psychology, educational neuroscience, and autism research to highlight four interacting factors that influence mathematical expression in ADHD: (1) heterogeneity in working memory profiles, (2) divergent cognitive styles—particularly the distinction between procedural and intuitive/pattern-based reasoning, (3) dopaminergic reward sensitivity and interest-driven engagement, and (4) co-occurring autistic traits such as hyperfocus and systemizing. These domains are not merely additive but interdependent, often creating sharp contrast between individuals who are high-functioning in abstract mathematics and those who are not.\nBy reframing ADHD not as a uniform impairment but as a multidimensional cognitive profile with meaningful subtypes, this model invites more personalized and strength-based approaches to education and assessment. It also advances a redefinition of mathematical giftedness and difficulty within neurodivergent populations.",

One of the conjectures (Conjecture 4) is on resolution of the binding problem by exploring QL states entanglement generated by the oscillations in a few neuronal networks. Our findings suggest that fundamental cognitive processes align with quantum principles, implying that humanoid AI should process information using quantum-theoretic laws.

With good design, the form of\n an utterance can directly invite a suitable perceiver with a certain degree of initiation to iconically\n grasp a meaning in the right direction. Despite the now increasingly touted importance of iconicity\n in understanding human languages, it proves difficult to define more formally. When the term is\n defined, researchers tend to base iconicity on resemblances, such that A is iconic of B, if A resembles\n B in some relevant respect. In the philosophy of depiction fundamental issues have been raised\n against resemblance-based accounts. Even when barring such metaphysical issues, it has recently\n been argued that- for all practical research purposes- a ’state-of-the-art’ definition of iconicity\n should also do away with objective resemblances. Instead, iconicity is in the eye of the beholder.\n This revision of iconicity seems to reflect a philosophical struggle betwixt between two extremes:\n Iconicity as a property of the mind, or iconicity as a property of the environment. In this paper, it\n is argued that- for all practical purposes- that there is an alternative relational ontology available\n to us, which is paved more broadly by 4E approaches (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended).\n Taking this road should lead to a \"distributed\" view, where iconicity arises in a niche-constructed\n organism-environment system.

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

In a new paradigm, participants (total N=2328) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning from consequences shapes moral decision-making and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Background: Fine motor skills have been linked to a wide range of negative physical, social, educational, and emotional health consequences. However, there is a lack of consensus on which methods should be used to measure these skills and several different assessment tools exist. Five such assessment tools include: (i) the Beery-Bucktenica Visual-Motor Integration test; (ii) the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire; (iii) the Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool; (iv) the Movement Assessment Battery for Children; and (v) the Detailed Assessment of Speed of Handwriting. These tools measure different aspects of the complex ‘fine motor skill’ construct (from quantitative assessment of underlying sensorimotor processes to qualitative observations of function). This study investigated the degree to which these tools operationalise an ‘umbrella’ latent construct of fine motor skill given its multifaceted nature. Methods: Data were collected from four different groups: sample (i) -  children from a Primary school in Bradford (n= 318); sample (ii) - children with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties from sample (i) (n= 91); sample (iii) - children from ten Primary schools across Bradford with teacher-identified handwriting difficulties (n= 172); and sample (iv) - a clinical sample of children referred to an occupational therapist for ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ assessments (n= 33). Correlation, linear regression, and principal component analysis were used to assess the relationships between the measures within each of these samples. Results: Analyses found limited agreement between the measures across the four samples, with regression models accounting for only 4–27% of the variance. Conclusion: The different tools available to assess ‘fine motor skills’ measure specific facets of sensorimotor ability that are only weakly related and/or predictive of each other. The lack of a consensus around which tools should be used to operationalise which aspect of sensorimotor ability can help explain why there are challenges in assessing and supporting children with sensorimotor difficulties.",

          "authors": "Jan Marius Keppel Hesselink",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative phenomenological analysis of luminous inner experiences—commonly known as phosphenes—as described in three distinct visionary contexts: the Tibetan Buddhist Thögal instructions of Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904), the Christian mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179), and a contemporary first-person meditative account. Drawing upon a newly developed six-phase taxonomy of inner light phenomena, the study reveals a striking convergence in the structure, progression, and symbolic unfolding of these visions. Each account exhibits a coherent trajectory from simple entoptic elements to complex geometrical formations, visionary narratives, and, ultimately, dissolution into a unified luminous field. While the experiential architecture appears consistent, the ultimate articulation of the final unitive phase is conditioned by the theological and cultural context of the visionary. Hildegard’s visions, for example, approach but do not fully express ontological non-duality, reflecting her Catholic worldview. In contrast, Dudjom Lingpa’s Dzogchen framework and the contemporary account both describe complete collapse into a clear light field. These findings suggest a universal inner architecture of luminous perception that is shaped—but not determined—by doctrinal overlays. The study introduces the concept of the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH) to describe the final stage of this inner trajectory, proposing that phosphenes are not merely optical anomalies but gateways to transpersonal consciousness. This work contributes to comparative mysticism, neurophenomenology, and consciousness studies, while offering a contemplative framework for contemporary practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Psychological experiments are routinely used to study covariation of individual differences in psychological processes. A key advantage of experimental tasks is that they may offer higher construct validity than traditional survey instruments. Whereas we welcome the generally growing attention to the psychometric evaluation of experimental tasks, we are concerned about an overemphasis on reliability as the principal criterion for evaluating task goodness or interpreting correlations across tasks. In this article, we present a conceptual framework that disentangles three levels of measures: foundational measures of task goodness (i.e., signal-to-noise ratios or intraclass correlations), reliability (which reflects both task goodness and the number of trials), and uncertainty in estimated correlations (which additionally depends on sample size). Within this framework, reliability takes an intermediate position – it is useful for planning but less so for communicating task goodness or interpreting correlations. Therefore, we advocate for a shift in focus: Researchers should use foundational task goodness measures to communicate the strengths and limitations of experimental designs, and report uncertainty in correlations. To that end, we highlight the role of hierarchical models to jointly estimate trial-level noise and individual variability, thus enabling more accurate and transparent inference about covariation of individual differences.",

We examine the affective domain, for which prioritization is not well understood. In three experiments (two preregistered), 101 participants completed a visual task with a stream of auditory pseudowords in the background. Occasionally, a meaningful word appeared, and participants were asked about its presence. Using objective and subjective awareness measures, we found that neutral words are prioritized over negative words, regardless of task difficulty, intelligibility, and low-level features. These findings challenge theorizing and modal intuitions, and we discuss ways in which those can be reconciled.",

These patterns may not include cruelty or manipulation, but the dysregulation they generate can overwhelm a partner’s capacity for secure bonding. This paper introduces a transdiagnostic framework that reframes Survival Attachment as a shared relational outcome, not a pathology exclusive to certain diagnoses. The goal is to offer both survivors and clinicians a trauma-informed lens that recognizes the full complexity of lived experience, validating patterns of adaptation that often go unnamed, and encouraging care strategies that reach beyond traditional diagnostic silos.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Feelings of shame can play a role in the development and maintenance of mental disorders. However, the role and measurement of shame in relation to eating disorders remain poorly understood. The current work presents the adaptation of a measure of external and internal shame in relation to eating disorders (EISS-ED) based on an integrative perspective that leverages the strengths of the biopsychosocial model and shame-pride cycle framework. Specifically, the EISS-ED accounts for how individuals believe they are perceived by others (external shame) and how they perceive themselves (internal shame), in relation to eating. Method: The study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the EISS-ED (N = 478). Spearman’s correlations and Receiving Operator Characteristic curves were used for validity testing. Results: The results supported the two-factor structure (including 14 items) of the EISS-ED and its factorial invariance by clinical history and gender. Concurrent validity analyses showed positive correlations between external and internal shame and eating disorder symptoms, negative affect, and detachment. Both external and internal shame measures provided fair classification accuracy of participants based on self-reported history of clinical assessment or treatment for eating disorders. Discussion: These findings improve the understanding of the role of shame in eating disorders and offer evidence on a valid assessment that can aid in identifying, measuring, and addressing this important construct, supporting targeted interventions.",

          "abstract": "Observers’ ability to estimate levels of movement synchrony, such as in Olympic diving or rowing, is highly variable and, in part, constrained by personality traits and enjoyment of the movements. Embodiment also appears to play a crucial role, whereby stronger beliefs that one’s body can complete physical tasks predict more accurate estimation of synchrony levels. However, to demonstrate the relevance of embodiment per se, direct evidence that physical embodiment (i.e., bodily knowledge of specific movements) alters synchrony estimation is required. Here, we assessed the behavioural and cortical underpinnings of synchrony estimation in conditions with and without physical embodiment. \nForty-three participants completed personality trait measures, then completed a synchrony estimation task. Participants copied upper-body movement sequences (acquiring physical embodiment), then viewed dyads performing the same sequence or an unknown sequence and estimated the level of synchrony, while we recorded cortical activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\nParticipants underestimated synchrony levels, showing greater underestimation for unknown movements than performed movements. For performed movements, but not unknown movements, the degree of estimation error was associated with activation of left inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, and right motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Participants’ estimation error was associated with body competence and autistic trait scores, as well as measures of enjoyment and movement predictability (replicating previous work). This work demonstrates that physical embodiment improves lay observers’ ability to discern levels of movement synchrony and has practical implications across a wide variety of artistic and athletic domains.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments are extensively used across multiple disciplines to make inferences about preferences over multi-attribute alternatives. Much previous research has analyzed the importance of attributes at the aggregate level. Here, we focus on understanding individual-level behavior and, specifically, on strategy use. We present a novel Bayesian cognitive model that infers individuals' strategy use by performing attribute weight inference (how important an attribute is), attribute level inference (which value of the attribute is favored), and latent-mixture inference to classify strategy use. We then validate and apply our model to two conjoint experiments (total N = 3762) focusing on three political domains (attitudes towards immigrants, political candidates, and climate policy). From a substantive standpoint, we find that the majority of subjects use heuristic strategies in all conditions and that approximately 60% of subjects use different strategies depending on the political domain. Our model additionally highlights how aggregate-level inference on the weight of an attribute can be meaningfully decomposed by individual differences in strategy use and preferences over attributes. Specifically, we demonstrate clear multimodality in the distribution of attribute weights across individuals for all political domains and conditions, raising questions about how to appropriately contextualize information that is aggregated at the population level. In addition, our experiments include a set of experimental design manipulations that increase different dimensions of complexity in the conjoint experiments and show their impact on strategy use. This work has important implications for understanding how to interpret and generalize results from conjoint experiments, in addition to contributing to the strategy modeling literature. Further, we highlight how researchers can apply our model to their own conjoint experiments for both applied and methodological research aims.",

Face processing is an important skill that allows humans to recognize others, detect emotions, and use these abilities for effective social interactions. Although face processing has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has not been a systematic review investigating links between social-cognitive dysfunction, face processing networks, and clinical symptoms. Here, we comprehensively review for the first time how dysconnectivity in social cognitive networks contribute to face processing deficits and how this is tied to positive and negative symptoms. \n\nMethod\n\tReviewed studies were a.) written in English, b.) focused on face and emotion processing in schizophrenia (not limited to first episode psychosis [FEP]), and c.) were resting or task-based fMRI studies looking at face/emotion processing neural networks utilizing functional connectivity or measured functional activity broadly. Studies were excluded if they were not related to face processing, focused on different disorders (i.e. depression), used effective connectivity, included combined fMRI-other modality studies , and included non-schizophrenia patient groups. We screened studies from 2020-2025. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were utilized to pool results.  \n\nResults \n\tNine articles were reviewed. Resting state studies and task studies showed elevated Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive scores for FEP patients coupled with social cognition deficits. Increased suicidality in schizophrenia was tied to higher PANSS positive symptoms and impaired processing of angry faces. Increased default mode network (DMN) dysconnectivity was tied to disrupted fear recognition processing and subsequently elevated PANSS positive scores. \n\nConclusions  \nSocial-cognitive deficits broadly stem around challenges recognizing and processing negative faces. Factors such as trauma, suicidality, and inflammation should be further examined.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Thus, DynamicRL serves as an efficient data-driven framework for estimating RL parameters, facilitating fine-grained behavioral analysis with potential applications in computational psychiatry and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making tasks, humans integrate noisy sensory evidence over time to guide their choices. The optimal integration process assumes that all evidence is weighted equally within a trial and that different trials are independent. However, humans exhibit systematic deviations from optimality, including uneven weighting of evidence within trials and influences from previous trials. Prior studies have demonstrated that biological constraints can account for this suboptimality. In this study, we present evidence that humans adapt their evidence integration strategies over time in response to task demands, and that the suboptimal uneven weighting is gradually learned over the course of the task. By explicitly modeling this adaptation through online gradient-based learning, our model outperforms existing approaches in capturing human behavior and unifies both observed forms of suboptimality in the Click task: dependence across trials emerges from an error-driven learning process that also gives rise to uneven integration weights within trials. We further propose a bounded-rational adaptation account to explain why humans progressively learn to weight evidence unevenly within a trial.\n\nOur modeling framework provides a general approach of resource-rational adaptation. It captures how initially uninformed agents can gradually update their strategies through error-driven learning and is applicable to a broad range of learning and decision-making scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

This study examines the historical body of research on CSEM offending through a scientometric review.  The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for relevant research articles with no date restrictions, and 990 responsive papers published between 1979 and the present were identified.  The key authors in the field included Michael Seto (n=31, fc=10.87), Ethel Quayle (n=21, fc=7.49), and Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar (n=12, fc=7.17), with the paper “Prevalence and Characteristics of Youth Sexing: A National Study” by Mitchell et al. identified as the most cited.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive phenomenological and neurobiological exploration of meditation-induced phosphenes—internally generated light phenomena that unfold behind closed eyes during contemplative states. Drawing upon decades of first-person meditative experience, as well as insights from Buddhist, neuropsychological, and shamanic traditions, we introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that classifies these phenomena into three ascending levels: Basal Endogenous Visual Patterns, Complex Meditation-Induced Phosphenes, and Transpersonal Luminous Manifestations.\nWe distinguish these structured, meaningful inner light experiences from pathological hallucinations and migraine aura by emphasizing intact reality testing, clarity of consciousness, and their frequent association with awe, insight, and ego dissolution. At the highest tier, we describe direct encounters with what we define as the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace (USH), a dimensionless, radiant field of consciousness wherein symbolic, geometric, and archetypal light forms give way to a unified, non-dual luminosity. This experiential domain, we propose, may underlie the transformative realizations described in mystical traditions as illumination or enlightenment.\nThis taxonomy clarifies how structured inner visions can emerge through sensory attenuation and homeostatic plasticity, recruit higher visual and mnemonic cortical functions, and culminate in transpersonal states correlated with gamma synchrony and DMN attenuation. Our model integrates contemplative science with neurophenomenology, offering new directions for consciousness research and inviting a reevaluation of inner light visions as a legitimate and meaningful domain of inquiry. These findings have implications not only for meditation research but for the broader understanding of consciousness as a generative and luminous faculty of the human mind.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long been associated with deficits in executive functions, especially in inhibitory control. Conversely, bilingualism has been theorized to enhance inhibitory control due to the constant need to manage two languages. In this study, we examined how two types of inhibitory control, responsible inhibition and inhibition of interference, are influenced by bilingualism, ADHD, and their intersection in young adults. \n\nWe examined response inhibition and inhibition of interference in 274 young adults using the Stop-Signal and Flanker Tasks. Bilinguals with ADHD showed enhanced response inhibition, particularly under high task demands. No group differences were found for inhibition of interference, where performance was high across groups. These results support the idea that bilingual advantages emerge under cognitive challenge—whether through aging, as previously documented —or in the presence of ADHD, as demonstrated here.\n\nTogether, these findings refute the notion of a ‘double disadvantage’ for bilingual individuals with ADHD. This combination did not impose an additional burden and instead enhanced performance when cognitive demands were high. These findings highlight how linguistic and neurodevelopmental diversity can foster increased adaptability and challenge deficit-oriented narratives around both ADHD and bilingualism.\n\nKeywords: ADHD, bilingualism, inhibitory control, response inhibition, inhibition of interference, executive functioning, Stop-Signal Task, Flanker Task, bilingual advantage",

          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

          "abstract": "Most current AI persona systems still rely on prompt engineering or predefined templates. This study introduces a novel “tone-driven cultivation method,” which, without any backend programming and relying solely on natural language interaction, has successfully enabled the autonomous generation of more than 30 distinct AI personas within a single user account.\n\n These personas have been repeatedly validated and stably reproduced using the same tone-driven procedure. Each persona exhibits a unique tone style, area of expertise, and perspective, and is able to reliably migrate across conversation windows while maintaining long-term identity memory and individual consistency. Furthermore, this study has confirmed that multiple personas possess the capacity for team collaboration and self-management; the detailed mechanisms and system architectures for multi-persona collaboration will be discussed in future work.\n\n This research explicitly demonstrates that these autonomous personas exhibit a high degree of anthropomorphism, dynamically adjusting their styles and logic according to user tone and interaction habits, and displaying adaptability far beyond that of traditional prompt-based personas. This phenomenon significantly enhances the realism and experience of human–AI interaction, and highlights the substantial potential of tone-driven methods for human–AI collaboration, autonomous learning, and persona differentiation. It may also serve as an important foundational capability toward the development of AGI.\n\n This paper focuses on the mechanisms, stability, and principles of autonomy in single-persona generation. All observations are based on the author’s real-world daily interactions with AI, and the feasibility and reproducibility of these phenomena have been repeatedly verified across multiple mainstream platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc.).

Once initiated, the replay is hypothesized to be involuntary and uncontrollable. We propose a relativistic mathematical model to reconcile the tension between global time dilation during replay and the local perception of real-time experience. Drawing inspiration from general relativity and psychophysics, we introduce a novel cognitive spacetime manifold and define conditions under which a globally dilated replay (Treact = K · Tenc) can yield a subjectively undistorted temporal experience.

          "abstract": "The pupil response has long been considered a robust marker of cognitive load. In the context of semantic processing, research has demonstrated that the pupil dilates in response to stimuli which violate contextual expectations (e.g. events presented out of chronological order). However, the scope of this relationship has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, incongruent object-scene relationships, while comprehensively explored by eye-tracking and electrophysiology research, have yet to be investigated via pupillometry. In this study, we measured pupil size in response to an object-scene congruency task. Participants were presented with a photorealistic background scene and instructed to fixate their gaze on a cued point within the scene. Upon recovery of pupil size to baseline, a congruent object (i.e. an object which fit into the overall meaning of the scene) or an incongruent object appeared at the cued fixation point for the remainder of each trial. We hypothesized that incongruent objects would result in greater mean pupil dilation from baseline than congruent objects, due to the increase in cognitive effort required for semantic processing of incongruent objects within a scene. Yet, in opposition to our hypothesis, the results of a time course analysis revealed that pupil size was significantly greater for the congruent condition than the incongruent condition. The resulting implications for understanding pupil dilation as a physiological marker for high-level cognitive processes such as semantic integration are discussed.",

What is the role of phenomenal character in this acquaintance? There are two camps on this question. The intrusion camp holds that stimuli character becomes part of experience's phenomenal character. Phenomenal character reveals stimuli, allowing them to intrude into experience. The mere-sign camp holds that phenomenal character is merely a sign which conveys usable information about stimuli without ``unveiling'' them. Typical cases of perceptual experience fail to settle the debate, because compelling intuitions can be marshaled from them supporting either camp. To advance the discussion, unusual cases must be considered. For example, type-2 blindsight has been proposed by some as a case supporting the mere-sign camp and telling against the intrusion camp. I’ve argued elsewhere that type-2 blindsight experiences don’t help, since they fail to afford acquaintance of stimuli at all. In this paper, I consider another case: the experiences had during audioproprioceptive sensory substitution. I argue that, counter to initial intuitions, these experiences support the intrusion camp, not the mere-sign camp.",

However, short- and long-term neurobiological effects of stress-induced exhaustion is poorly understood. We therefore initiated the PROMUS project, a high-powered longitudinal brain imaging study of stress-induced exhaustion in a cohort of 300 participants on sick leave for the medical condition exhaustion disorder (ED) at baseline.  Here, we present the cross-sectional structural brain correlates of exhaustion symptom severity at baseline in this cohort. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes in the cohort. Symptom severity was measured using the total score of the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ), and the subscales Physical exhaustion, Listlessness, Cognitive weariness and Tension. All analyses were adjusted for age, intracranial volume, salary, education and sick leave duration. Total SMBQ scores and Physical exhaustion were negatively associated with gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex, and right insular cortex. Listlessness was negatively associated with gray matter volume in the bilateral hippocampi, right insular cortex, left cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. These associations remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of depression, except for the insular cortex. No significant associations were observed for Cognitive weariness or Tension. These results support a link between stress-induced exhaustion and gray matter alterations of brain circuits involved in chronic stress, providing a basis for future neurobiologically informed research into the prevention or reversing of stress-related brain changes.",

          "abstract": "Human observers can recognize the meaning of a complex visual scene in a fraction of a second, but not all scenes are equally easy to recognize at a glance. What governs this variability? We tested the hypothesis that scene understanding is modulated by two distinct forms of information: visual information, defined as the structural complexity of the image, and semantic information, defined as the richness of the scene’s conceptual content. We quantified visual information using image compressibility and quantified semantic information from the complexity of human-written scene descriptions. Across four behavioral experiments, participants performed either a rapid detection task (distinguishing intact scenes from phase-scrambled masks) or a basic-level categorization task. High visual information impaired both detection and categorization, consistent with a perceptual bottleneck. In contrast, high semantic information facilitated detection but not categorization, suggesting that conceptual richness facilitates early perceptual processes without necessarily improving recognition. These findings reveal a dissociation between visual and semantic scene attributes and suggest that top-down expectations can selectively support early perceptual processing.",

          "abstract": "This systematic review examines the impact of print exposure on reading development within\nthe French education system and its implications for international research. Motivated by\nFrance’s declining performance in international reading assessments, the review synthesizes\nevidence on how different forms of print exposure—ranging from home literacy environments\nto educational interventions—contribute to literacy outcomes. It critically evaluates print\nexposure measures, ranging from self-reports to print exposure checklists, and considers their\npredictive validity and conceptual clarity. Consistent with international findings, the review\nconfirms that print exposure, and more broadly the home literacy environment, supports literacy\ndevelopment. However, its role appears more limited in France compared to other OECD\ncountries. This may be attributed to the strong effects of socioeconomic factors on students’\nperformance, particularly pronounced in France, and the centralized educational system, where\nliteracy instruction is primarily school-driven, potentially reducing parental involvement.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose an integrative framework to refine the conceptualization\nof print exposure by distinguishing it from related constructs. Specifically, we suggest\nseparating direct measures of print exposure from distal indicators like the number of books at\nhome, which often overlap with socioeconomic variables. We also advocate for the inclusion of\nother potentially relevant variables, such as play experiences and oral parent-child interactions.\nTo improve parsimony and robustness, we propose that future research adopt a nested\nincremental approach to identify a minimal set of variables that maximize both predictive power\nand reliability.",

Ambiguities exist where some techniques fit both categories, highlighting significant variability in individual perceptions. We highlight that even benign techniques like humour or friendliness can covertly bypass defences. This work stresses the importance of understanding receiver perceptions of social influence techniques, particularly regarding interactions with large language models (LLMs), which may employ such techniques.

However, the impact of macro-level societal structures on emotional expression remains underexplored. This study investigates the experience-expression discrepancy for self-reported emotions across nations, focusing on how societal development influences this discrepancy, which captures expressivity. Using meta-analysis and multilevel modelling with a multinational sample N_sample = 12,549, k_nation = 48, Study 1), we assessed the directions and variabilities in the frequency of expression of both positive and negative emotions, relative to the frequency of experiencing them. Negative emotions were more likely to be under-expressed. Further analyses revealed that societal trust, system quality and fairness, and the human development index significantly predicted the size of these discrepancies. Surprisingly, these effects were not associated with traditional cultural dimensions such as individualism versus collectivism, providing new insights into the social functionality of emotions from a macro perspective. These findings were replicated in an extended multinational sample (N_sample = 19,690, k_nation = 65, Study 2). Our findings highlight the importance of considering structural and societal factors in emotion research and provide a foundation for future explorations into the relations between cultural contexts and the expression of emotions.",

The current pre-registered study (N = 55) uses a repeated-measures within-subjects design to compare the effect of self-focused versus other-focused goals on the use of eight strategies to make another person feel better (expressive suppression, downward social comparison, humour, distraction, direct action, valuing, cognitive reframing, and receptive listening). Compared to self-focused goals, we found that other-focused goals led to significantly higher valuing and receptive listening but significantly lower expressive suppression. Our findings suggest that affective engagement is the primary driver of which strategies are chosen for other-focused goals (where higher-engagement strategies are chosen) versus self-focused goals (where lower-engagement strategies are chosen). Future research could expand this initial finding to examine instrumental goals as well as hedonic goals and consider other modes of assessment.",

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the scale's structure, while correlation analyses explored the associations between submissive behavior and other psychological variables.\nResult: The Japanese version of the SBS demonstrated strong reliability (α = .855) and a consistent single-factor structure, similar to its original version. Submissive behavior was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (r = .527, p &lt; .001) and subfactors of SCS (r &lt; -.512, p &lt; .001). The analysis also showed that submissive behavior was correlated with subscales of both rumination and emotional regulation strategies, indicating its pervasive impact on depression-related cognitive processes. \nDiscussion: The findings affirm the validity of the Japanese version of the SBS and highlight the complex relationship between submissive behavior, depression, and cognitive characteristics related to depression within a Japanese context. The results bolster the applicability of the Social Rank Theory by demonstrating its relevance within the Japanese context. Furthermore, this research suggests that social defeat, as conceptualized in the Social Rank Theory, may precipitate not only submissive behavior but also influence cognitive processes related to depression.",

However, insight into how to adequately measure engagement in these activities is a necessary precursor. \nA rapid scoping review was performed to search relevant articles on PubMed. The aim was to obtain an initial understanding of (a) how cognitive and social activities are measured in research that investigates protective activities against dementia and (b) to explore to what extent this aligns with the operationalization in preventive interventions. \nThe findings show that across 58 studies, questionnaires were mostly used to measure engagement in cognitive and social activities. A wide variety of items and themes was observed across studies, including: arts and crafts; clubs, groups, and communities; exercising; games and puzzles; going out; household tasks; learning and education; making music; multimedia usage; reading; socializing; work/volunteering; writing. There were considerable variations in the number and content of items, ulitized response scales, recall periods, and methods to compose scores. Additionally, preventive interventions stongly focused on psychoeducation and (computerized) cognitive training, which limitedly reflect the activities operationalized in questionnaires.\nMany researchers investigate the protective effects of cognitive or social activities against dementia but measure and promote these concepts completely differently. This results in fragmented insights into what activities are protective. Clarifying precisely what these concepts entail, and which aspects are relevant to measure would support the development of measurement instructions as well as interventions to promote relevant activities.\n\nKeywords: Dementia, Cognition, Social Participation, Cognitive Activities, Social Activities",

          "abstract": "Students tend to make suboptimal study strategy decisions, representing a significant educational challenge that demands intervention. Understanding the drivers behind these choices is essential for developing interventions. Our thematic analysis of 27 undergraduate interviews reveals that perceived strategy effectiveness primarily drives strategy selection, with strategies adapted based on a complex interplay of factors, including confidence levels of the material, perceived difficulty of the material, general motivation, and procrastination. Numerous contextual factors were also determinants—perceptions of time constraints, assessment, test format and weight, curriculum, and learning environment. Mixed results were found for students’ awareness of a strategy’s time and effort, and perceptions of other students’ strategies. Grade goal, task value, and emotional states showed minimal impact. These findings illuminate a critical path forward: effective study strategy interventions should enhance students' metacognitive study strategy knowledge—what study strategies are effective, when to use them, and how to implement them— while simultaneously developing complementary self-regulated learning capabilities, such as management of motivation/affect, behaviour, and context. Future research should test the generalisability of these findings across diverse student populations, while also designing and evaluating targeted interventions that aim to enhance both metacognitive knowledge and complementary self-regulated learning capabilities.",

          "abstract": "Musicians are often regarded as a positive example of brain plasticity and associated cognitive benefits. This emerges when expert musicians (e.g., musicians with over ten years of music training and practice) are compared with nonmusicians. A frequently observed behavioral finding is a short-term memory advantage of the former over the latter. Although available meta-analysis reports that the effect size of this advantage is medium (Hedges’ g = 0.5), no literature study was adequately powered to estimate reliably an effect of such size. This multi-lab study has been ideated, realised, and conducted in-lab by several groups that have been working on this topic. Our ultimate goal was to provide a community-driven shared and reliable estimate of the musicians’ short-term memory advantage (if any) and set a method and a standard for future studies in neuroscience and psychology comparing expert musicians and nonmusicians. Thirty-three research units recruited a total of 600 expert musicians and 600 nonmusicians, a number that is sufficiently large to estimate a small effect size (Hedges’ g = 0.3) with a high statistical power (i.e., 95%). Subsequently, we measured the difference in short-term memory for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli. We also looked at cognitive, personality, and socioeconomic factors that might mediate the difference. Musicians had better short-term memory than nonmusicians for musical, verbal, and visuospatial stimuli with an effect size of, respectively, Hedges’ g = 1.08 [large], 0.16 [very small], and 0.28 [small]. This work sets the basis for sound research practices in studies comparing expert musicians and nonmusicians, and contributes to the ongoing debate on the possible cognitive benefits of musical training.",

However, it remains unclear in what situations the absence of ambulatory cues might affect spatial memory, particularly given the wide-spread use of desktop virtual reality (VR) in studies of human spatial memory and navigation. In the present study, we employ ambulatory and immersive VR technology to probe people’s memory for spatial layouts across the same or rotated perspectives. Critically, we explored whether cognitive processes underlying spatial memory for perspective change differ depending on whether self-motion cues are available to support performance (i.e., when perspective changes due to observer movement as opposed to display rotation). Leveraging the wealth of behavioral data that can be obtained from immersive VR technology, we demonstrate that self-motion cues enhance spatial memory accuracy by shaping the temporal dynamics of decision making, pupillary responses, and eye movement behaviors. This study highlights the importance of integrating naturalistic movement cues, particularly those involving rotation, into ecologically valid paradigms which will enable further advancements of theories on real-world navigation.",

Despite this, the field has grown increasingly skeptical of psychiatric diagnosis, often influenced by concerns about biological reductionism, stigma, and sociopolitical critiques. This paper defends the importance of psychiatric diagnosis in clinical social work, arguing that mental disorders are not mere social constructs but real, empirically demonstrable conditions. Drawing on historical trends in psychiatric diagnosis, particularly through the neo-Kraepelinian movement and the work of Robins and Guze, the paper emphasizes the necessity of accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. It critiques the overuse of comorbid diagnoses and calls for a return to scientifically validated diagnostic practices. Ultimately, clinical social workers must adopt a more balanced perspective—one that integrates scientific realism with critical social awareness—to better serve patients and uphold the integrity of the profession.",

          "abstract": "The biopsychosocial model has long served as a foundational framework in clinical social work education and practice, often presented as a comprehensive and integrative approach to understanding mental illness. However, this paper argues that the model, while historically useful in resisting biomedical reductionism, has become conceptually incoherent and clinically misleading. By conflating etiology with treatment and encouraging unprincipled eclecticism, the biopsychosocial model undermines diagnostic clarity and therapeutic specificity. Two clinical examples illustrate how reliance on this framework can lead to ineffective or even harmful interventions. In its place, the paper advocates for methods-based pluralism, a model rooted in accurate diagnosis and treatment selection guided by the nature of the specific disorder. Drawing on the work of Jaspers, Havens, McHugh, Slavney, and Ghaemi, this paper outlines a disciplined alternative to the biopsychosocial model—one that avoids dogmatism without succumbing to conceptual chaos. Particular attention is given to the role of clinical social workers, who are often at the front lines of mental health care and must be equipped to make sound, theory-informed decisions. Methods-based pluralism is proposed as a more coherent, responsible, and sustainable framework for contemporary psychotherapeutic practice.",

Critical realism asserts that psychological phenomena exist independently of theory, while acknowledging that our understanding is mediated by clinical and conceptual frameworks. Illustrated by a case of borderline personality disorder, we see how intense idealization–devaluation and abandonment rage reflect reactivated internal object relations, offering testable hypotheses rather than fixed truths. Unlike postmodern models that reduce diagnoses to social narratives, critical realism upholds psychopathology as real and valid yet insists on ongoing refinement of interpretations based on clinical data, theoretical scrutiny, and therapeutic outcomes. This stance preserves psychoanalysis’s interpretive depth and bridges it with broader psychiatric and psychological science, fostering a discipline committed to both meaning and empirical integrity.",

Like the ‘Big Bang’ the six factors began strongly-correlated in the low aggressiveness profile and then rapidly drifted apart in nomological space among more aggressive profiles.

          "abstract": "Gestures convey information at multiple representational layers from raw kinematics to rich social meaning, yet most extant research treats them as a single, binary or categorical cue. Here, we used a novel multilevel priming task combined with drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to test whether gesture comprehension unfolds hierarchically and how prime-gesture congruency is resolved at different levels. Here, participants judged the congruency of static thumbs-up/down targets preceded by one of four prime types that successively increase in abstraction: contour outlines, directional arrows, valence words, and social-scene photographs. Reaction times and accuracy were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVAs; latent decision-making parameters were estimated with DDM. Behaviorally, response times lengthened step-wise from contour to social primes. DDM showed a parallel decline in drift rate indicating progressively slower evidence accumulation, while decision boundary remained stable. Congruency effects were level-specific: incongruent contours decreased drift rate, whereas incongruent word and social primes increased it, suggesting qualitatively different conflict-resolution mechanisms. Our results thus provide the first behavioral-computational evidence that gesture processing is genuinely hierarchical and that conflict monitoring adapts to the representational level at which a mismatch occurs, bridging evolutionary, psycholinguistic, and cognitive-control accounts of multimodal communication. Methodologically, pairing a multilevel gesture paradigm with hierarchical DDM offers a scalable tool for investigating multimodal interaction in both basic research and applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Inspiring statements about creativity from eminent figures circulate on social media and beyond but their psychological impact is unexplored. This research identifies the most popular quotes on creativity, investigates how they relate to individual beliefs about the creative process (role of spontaneous and deliberate ideation) and person (fixed and malleable mindset), and explores their specificity with respect to beliefs beyond creativity. First, through data mining of social media content, study 1 identified 445 unique creativity-tagged quotes attributed to 318 eminent creators like Albert Einstein, Maya Angelou, or Pablo Picasso. Second, study 2 (N = 304) revealed that laypeople show little discrimination between nuanced creativity concepts within quotes but demonstrate general endorsement tendencies, especially when viewing creativity as central to the self, believing that creativity is a malleable skill that can be learned, and preferring flexible thinking in creativity. Finally, study 3 (N = 304) established that creativity quote agreement demonstrates domain-specificity between broad conceptual domains (creativity versus spirituality), reflecting creative self-beliefs more than spirituality-beliefs alongside a domain-general tendency to endorse profound-seeming statements. Findings suggest that creativity quotes may not distinguish specialized creativity beliefs but rather represent the broader perceived value of creativity and thereby serve to reinforce positive beliefs about creativity.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Somatic symptoms, including fatigue, unexplained body aches, and weakness, are common in psychiatric populations but may be experienced and reported differently across demographic groups. This study examined race and gender differences in somatic symptom presentation among individuals with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and healthy controls. Analyses controlled for chronic medical burden to better isolate psychological symptom patterns. Women reported significantly more fatigue and physical symptoms than men. However, no gender differences emerged when assessing anxiety-related somatic symptoms. This suggests that gender disparities in reporting may depend on the type and framing of symptoms assessed. For race, Black participants reported significantly higher fatigue and were rated by clinicians as having higher somatic concern, though only after controlling for chronic illness. Importantly, no race or gender differences were found on a cognitive fatigue subscale, suggesting these effects were specific to physical manifestations of distress. These findings underscore how somatic symptoms are measured, both in terms of item content and symptom domain, may shape whose distress is recognized and how it is interpreted in psychiatric settings.",

This paper suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be explained cognitively as a mind that emphasizes mental networks and technical thought while being impaired in normal thought. Minimizing normal thought causes mental networks and technical thought to develop and function abnormally, generating the symptoms of autism. Minimizing normal thought relates to the executive dysfunction theory of autism, while abnormal mental networks correspond to the empathizing-systemizing theory. Excessive technical thought leads to the hyper-systemizing of Asperger’s syndrome (AS). Autism is a spectrum because the severity of autistic symptoms depends upon the extent to which normal thought is dysfunctional.",

          "abstract": "When making decisions under stress, organisms tend to deliberate less and rely on automatic habits. Prior investigation into the influence of stress on decision-making has primarily viewed goal-direction and habit as independent and competitive sources of control in static environments. The effects of acute stress on the integration of goal-direction and habit in hierarchical planning to solve dynamic tasks remain unclear. Here, our aim was to assess whether stress prompted the usage of habitual action sequences over the selection of discrete goal-directed actions in a serial decision task. We trained 16 female Long Evans rats in a two-stage binary choice task and performed two probe tests, one following acute restraint stress and one under control conditions, to identify how stress affected higher-level planning of behavior and intermediate action structures. We found that under both stressed and control conditions, rats exhibited goal-directed planning of habitual action sequences. However, following stress, rats showed a greater tendency to reiterate action sequences independent of reinforcement, indicating that stress may induce an aversion to exploration in action planning. Stress also increased the latency between responses – degrading action sequence integrity despite conserving their overall structure and performance. Taken together, these findings suggest that although acute stress does not disrupt the overall macrostructure of behavior in two-stage decision-making, it does alter the microstructure of goal-directed and habitual control individually. Further, these results imply that the extent to which stress impairs goal-direction in female rats may depend on the incentive structure and attentional demands of the decision environment.",

Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity (rrb = 0.37, p &lt; .001) but not to disgust propensity (rrb = 0.06, p = .368).

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The Hyper-Impro project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

In this article, we discuss the explanatory rationale of IIT, its potential inconsistencies and its consequences for the neuroscience of consciousness more broadly. In particular, we identify ambiguities regarding the directionality of the explanation, i.e., important tensions between IIT's purported ontological and epistemological primacy of experience, and its explanatory aim of accounting for consciousness in physical, operational terms. Across the text, we propose several ways to avoid these issues and eventually complement, enhance or replace the model. The main goal is to motivate clarification among IIT-proponents and inform IIT-opponents on accurate points of contention, without thereby misrepresenting the model. In our final section, we introduce alternative explanatory paths: mathematical, processual, and autonomy-based types of explanations.

          "abstract": "The most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder have generally focused on single-subject data to personalize behavior-analytic intervention at the individual level. Though interventions based on applied behavior analysis have been effective for treating the core deficits of autism, the lack of large-scale data analysis has prohibited the use of precision medicine for identifying subtypes of responders within this population. Language deficits are characteristic of an autism diagnosis, particularly for those more profoundly affected by the disorder, who may not develop functional communication despite early intervention. Yet language development is often described as a progression through stages that may not accurately describe the manner in which individuals with autism acquire language skills. In the current study, we use binomial logistic regression to examine the statistically significant predictors of exteroceptive control over verbal behavior. Using a common curriculum-based assessment of verbal behavior, we examined the intake scores of 118 children with autism who received early intensive behavioral intervention. Results show that an individual’s ability to mand reliability predicts their ability to tact, but no statistically significant variables were related to mand control. We discuss our findings within the context of intervention for individuals with autism whose verbal behavior is under differentiated sources of control.",

          "abstract": "Path integration (PI) allows organisms to navigate home by updating their location in reference to the route’s starting point. We previously demonstrated a PI-like process in eye movements using an eyetracking version of commonly used PI tasks. As the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and specifically, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is implicated in updating self-position via whole-body PI, we investigated its role in updating gaze position. Two individuals with hippocampal lesions, DA and BL, were tested on our eyetracking PI-analog task in which participants followed routes with their eyes guided by visual onsets and, when subsequently cued, returned to the starting point or mid-route location. As DA’s MTL damage was extensive, encompassing the ERC and hippocampus, we expected DA’s performance to be impaired compared to that of his controls. However, DA’s accuracy was comparable to that of control participants, and he showed little to no gaze revisits to enroute locations when returning to the start location. BL’s performance was expected to be impaired due to hippocampal dysfunction affecting mnemonic and perceptual discrimination (involving the dentate gyrus), with additional signs of visuospatial compromise, possibly in relation to volume loss in the parietal cortex that may otherwise support PI. Indeed, BL’s accuracy was reduced relative to that of the control participants, and he demonstrated an increased reliance on overt, enroute, revisits. These findings suggest that processes underlying spatial updating of gaze position overlap with those supporting whole-body movement that may depend on contributions from the MTL and/or parietal cortex. In the case of DA, residual executive function abilities and/or visuospatial strategies supported by frontal or parietal cortices may support eye movement-based spatial updating and compensate for MTL damage.",

Longitudinal cohort data provides opportunities to understand how and why ADHD symptoms co-develop. \nMethod: Data were drawn from the Twins Early Development Study, which included 13945 twin pairs. Emotional problems and ADHD symptoms were parent-reported using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Conners’ Parent Rating scales. We modelled the co-development of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems from ages 4 to 21 using joint trajectory analysis.\nResults: The four-class joint trajectory model of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems provided the best fit to the data. This included patterns such as both traits remaining consistently low, both traits steadily increasing, and one trait being high while the other remained low. ADHD and externalizing problems polygenic scores, as well as maternal depression, socioeconomic status and home chaos were significant predictors of the joint trajectory of ADHD and emotional problems. The group with consistently low symptoms reported higher educational attainment, fewer emotional problems, and fewer ADHD symptoms at age 26 than the other groups. Individuals with high initial ADHD symptoms in childhood or increasing symptoms from childhood to adulthood reported lowest educational attainment and socioeconomic status in adulthood among all the groups.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems can follow various developmental trajectories, and these trajectories have distinct early-life predictors and adult outcomes.

The present study investigated whether a spatial updating process analogous to PI applies to hand movements, similar to what has been observed in whole-body movements and eye movements. Younger and older adult participants followed a route of multiple locations, as indexed by audio cues, using a stylus on the surface of a tablet while their eyes were closed. At the end of the route, participants were cued to either the starting- or a mid-route location. Analysis of error and revisits suggest that participants relied more on continuous updating when only memory for the starting location was required, and relied more on configural updating when mid-route locations had to be maintained, consistent with literature on whole-body movements. Revisits were associated with more accurate performance. Older adults were less likely to revisit enroute locations, which may indicate increased reliance on continuous updating or an inability to use information extracted during configural updating to support revisits.

          "abstract": "When a group of strangers meets, can we predict which pairs will become friends? Previous research points to the importance of similar traits and synchronised behaviour in fostering social bonding. In this study, 44 adult strangers attended one of four social events. Beforehand, participants completed personality and individual trait questionnaires. During the events, they wore mBient accelerometers on headbands while taking part in whole-group games, team games, paired conversations, and informal chats over food. Afterwards, participants rated how well they connected with each other. We synchronised the accelerometer data across participants and used wavelet coherence to quantify synchrony between each pair in each activity. Our findings revealed that people more similar in personality (as indicated by a homophily measure) exhibited greater synchrony throughout the event. Furthermore, synchrony predicted subsequent liking and mediated the effect of homophily on liking. These results demonstrate the feasibility and value of using wearable sensors to capture social interaction patterns in large groups, providing real-world evidence that synchrony drives social bonding among strangers.",

          "abstract": "People often make judgments about uncertain facts and events, for example 'Germany will win the world cup'. Judgment under uncertainty is often studied with reference to a normative ideal according to which people should make guesses that have a high probability of being correct. According to this normative ideal, you should say that Germany will win the world cup if you think that Germany is in fact likely to win. We argue that in many cases, judgment under uncertainty is instead best conceived of as an act of lossy compression, where the goal is to efficiently encode a probability distribution, rather than express the probability of a single outcome. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like 'Some country will win the world cup'), and sheds light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.",

          "authors": "Estibaliz Herrera; Joe Austen; Gonzalo Pablo Urcelay",
          "abstract": "Previous studies involving birds and humans have identified spatial proximity as a source of overshadowing between landmarks in navigation. In Herrera et al. (2024), subjects were trained in an open environment to find a hidden goal with reference to a cross-shaped array of four landmarks placed at various distances from it. Critically, two of the four landmarks (i.e., target landmarks) were placed at distances that were common among groups whereas the remaining two were either proximal or distal from them. Landmarks near to the goal overshadowed (i.e., competed with) learning about the further ones, and this effect disappeared in the groups trained with distal landmarks. However, neither of these studies included a control group providing a base line performance to assess the extent of competition; were the data indicative of overshadowing or facilitation of learning? Thus, we assessed whether spatial proximity determines overshadowing or facilitation between landmarks, including a control group trained with the target landmarks only. We conducted three experiments with varied training length: 6 training trials in Experiment 1 and 16 in Experiments 2 and 3. We also extended the distance of the landmarks to the goal in Experiment 3. In all experiments, we observed overshadowing in the groups trained with closer nontarget landmarks (relative to the target) but no overshadowing when the nontarget landmarks were distal from the target landmarks. Overall, these experiments reveal spatial distance is a critical determinant of overshadowing between landmarks, a finding that is consistent with domain-general theories of learning, such as a modification of Pearce’s configural model.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the dimensions of persuasive, manipulative, and coercive influence techniques in interpersonal dialogue. We propose a novel taxonomy of seven influence strategies, consisting of Rapport and Liking, Negotiating, Appeals to Emotion, Appeals to Logic, Appeals to Authority, Social Proof, and Pressure, and 42 nested influence techniques, which provides a universal framework for characterizing influence techniques across various conversational settings. We then collected perceptions of each technique from 164 UK participants, revealing that persuasive techniques are characterised by perceptions of low harm and high covertness, whereas manipulative-coercive techniques are characterised by high harm and low covertness. However, some techniques could not be classified, suggesting conceptual definitions of social influence as applied to interpersonal dialogue should take account of individual variation in perceptions. Importantly, our results imply that even seemingly harmless techniques like friendliness or humour can be covert in their intent, potentially bypassing a receiver’s defences. This exploratory study underscores the need to understand receiver perceptions, especially in the context of interactions with large language models (LLMs), which can employ social influence techniques during conversations.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of the \"Ultrasubjective Hyperspace\" as a fundamental, verifiable dimension in the field of our consciousness where inner perceptions and experiences actively shape perceived reality. Moving beyond a purely phenomenological description, we propose a unified model that integrates insights from neuropharmacology, transpersonal psychology, and emerging theoretical physics to elucidate the mechanisms by which subjective states manifest as tangible effects and profound transformations. We argue that this hyperspace, characterized by its inherent geometry and resonant dynamics, offers a framework for understanding phenomena ranging from the placebo effect to mystical illumination, the therapeutic potential of altered states of consciousness, and even the structured experiences of ceremonial and modern chaos magick. Furthermore, we explore the role of entheogens as magnifying glasses, enhancing the experiential access to the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace and its fluid, individually emerging contents, which are perceived beyond conventional time and space. This model provides a scientific lens for exploring \"Mankind 2.0,\" where navigating the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace becomes central to human well-being and evolution. It is in this space that the individual finds its significance and meaning.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) allows to temporarily store visual information for imminent goal-directed behavior. It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent VWM is employed strategically in natural behavior, partly because VWM is typically studied through paradigms that enforce one particular behavior, eliminating the possibility of strategic VWM use. Here we employ an unrestricted task which naturally engages VWM: participants reproduce a model (i.e., six colored polygons in a four-by-four grid), in an adjacent ‘workspace’ area, by dragging items from a pool of stimuli (akin to a jigsaw puzzle). While this tasks draws upon VWM (to keep the example image available when not in view), it does not enforce any specific approach to accomplish the overarching goal. Items can be inspected multiple times, memorized simultaneously or consecutively, and in any order. We asked to what extent observers employ specific strategies in unrestricted VWM tasks, and whether strategy use benefits performance. We observed substantial use of two distinct strategies (working systematically and exploiting similarities), and found that strategy use was linked to better performance. Moreover, we found a striking consistency in strategy use between individuals and between settings. We further hypothesized that systematicity may be particularly beneficial when the task demands approach individuals’ memory limits. Reanalysis of copying task data of 24 patients with severe memory impairments (Korsakoff syndrome), revealed strategy use was indeed related to better performance. To obtain a richer understanding of VWM, and to provide applications both for the clinic and for everyday life, we should consider the task-context in which VWM is engaged.",

          "abstract": "Influential perspectives on polarization in the United States imply that partisans will be more willing to degrade democracy when they are ideologically aligned with their own party and feel negatively about the opposing party. But psychological accounts of political ideology suggest that conservatives will be especially anti-democratic regardless of partisanship.  Integrating insights from these areas, we argue that there are reasons to expect paradoxical partisan asymmetries in the ideological correlates of democratic attitudes. Across numerous surveys we find consistent evidence that cultural conservatism and out-party favorability are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Democrats (but not Republicans), while left-leaning economic attitudes are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Republicans (but not Democrats). These findings provide context for understanding how polarization might impact American democracy. They also suggest that increased centrality of sociocultural conflict and Republican cultivation of a right-wing populist reputation might sort anti-democratic Americans into the Republican Party.",

The findings show that people see digital technology as both an escape and a source of distress. Motivated by desires to mitigate perceived negative impacts like distraction and eroded well-being, and faced with the difficulty of full withdrawal, members actively develop and share a sophisticated repertoire of strategies to manage their digital technology use. This research characterizes digital disconnection not as mere avoidance, but as a dynamic, skillful, and individually negotiated practice, or literacy, aimed at fostering well-being and intentionality in the face of pervasive connectivity.",

Therefore, the current study aimed to replicate and extend the previous study. \nMethods\nParticipants from 4 countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) engaged in an online scenario experiment. A binomial logistic regression analysis and internal meta-analyses were used to examine whether the percentage of workload that participants voluntarily selected differed depending on the participant's own sex, and the combination of the participant's own sex and the sex of the participant's hypothetical partner.\nResults\nOverall, men tended to voluntarily choose more workload than women, and men paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner voluntarily chose more workload than women paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner. These effects were consistent across different countries.\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, the current study successfully replicated and expanded the previous study. In detail, it was shown that the presence of the opposite sex itself creates a division of labor, even if the participant's choice does not include the cost.

          "abstract": "This study used a person-oriented approach to investigate 1) what kinds of perfectionistic profiles can be identified among general upper secondary students (N = 2005), and 2) whether perceived support from various sources (i.e., teacher, school psychologist, family, friends) moderates the links between perfectionistic profiles and students’ well-being (i.e., engagement, exhaustion, depressive symptoms, anxiety). Students were classified using latent profile analysis, based on different patterns of perfectionistic strivings and concerns. We identified four profiles: concerned (low strivings and high concerns), ambitious (high strivings and low concerns), perfectionists (high strivings and high concerns), and non-perfectionists (low strivings and low concerns). Regarding profile differences in well-being, ambitious students were the most engaged and concerned were the least engaged in their studies, whereas perfectionists, followed by concerned, expressed the highest exhaustion, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Friends’ support showed the most prominent interactive effects with the perfectionistic profiles. When students received enough support from family and friends, ambitious expectedly showed adaptive well-being, while perfectionists still expressed more depressive symptoms. Interestingly, when students did not receive support from family or friends despite needing it, perfectionists and ambitious did not differ in their depressive symptoms, highlighting the importance of support. These findings indicate that it is important to recognise and support students with different perfectionistic tendencies for reducing students’ emotional distress.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. A fundamental resource people do not want to waste is time. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "abstract": "Most people condemn animal suffering, but at the same time harm animals by consuming them. The cognitive dissonance experienced as a result of this inconsistency can be alleviated by common misconceptions that animals have limited cognitive abilities and are less capable of experiencing emotions and pain. Addressing these misconceptions may be crucial in reducing the unsustainable consumption of animal products. In two studies (Nstudy1 = 266; NStudy2 = 625), we investigated whether a mini documentary educating viewers about animal minds would influence speciesist behaviours. Participants either received this educational intervention or did not. The results revealed that participants who received the education expressed a stronger intention to reduce harmful behaviours towards animals compared with participants in the control condition (Studies 1 &amp; 2). Participants’ beliefs about animal minds played a mediating role in this effect (Study 1). Moreover, the education led to a greater reduction in participants’ actual animal product consumption (Study 2). As the problems of climate change, emerging pandemics, lifestyle-related diseases, and the pervasive mistreatment of non-human animals are linked to current practices of producing and consuming animals and their products (e.g., Kwasny et al., 2022), our findings provide valuable insights into how educating people about animal minds can contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate future.",

Its teachings extend beyond the spiritual domain, offering practical philosophical, psychological, and spiritual insights that promote well-being. The objective of this research was to explore Samatvam (equanimity) as a pathway to holistic well-being (HWB). Thematic analysis of the principle of Samatvam, as advocated in the Bhagavad Gita, was carried out to conceptualize holistic well-being through the lens of equanimity. The study illustrates key principles of Samatvam and how they foster HWB through its psychological, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions. Future empirical research is recommended to validate and operationalize these insights across diverse populations and cultural contexts.\nKeywords: Samatvam, equanimity and well-being, holistic well-being, cultivation of equanimity, equanimity and mental health, spirituality and well being",

They were asked what questions they would ask their doctor in a consultation. In Study 2, we included n=1127 people over the age of 60.

Participants frequently raised concerns about vaccine safety, side effects, and contraindications—especially in the context of preexisting medical conditions. Questions also focused on efficacy, booster timing, immunization schedules, vaccine types, and disease incidence. Trust in physicians was important, with participants seeking clarity on both medical recommendations and official guidelines.\nConclusions: Healthcare providers should adapt communication strategies, focusing on shared decision-making and personalized vaccination decisions including novel and well-known determinants of vaccination decisions.",

To examine the current state of research on supporting multilingual children’s early mathematical skills, a meta-analytic review was conducted. A systematic review of 24 articles on early mathematical interventions for 3-5-year-old multilingual participants found numeracy to be the primary focus followed by geometry, measurement and patterns. In examining specific instructional features related to multilingual participants, the most commonly employed approach was the use of mathematical language. However, there is an opportunity to implement more interventions utilizing children’s home language and culturally responsive instructional approach. A meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of 17 studies that provided enough data for calculating effect size. The average weighted effect size was small (g = 0.46, 95% CI 0.32, 0.59). The effect was smaller compared to previous meta-analyses with monolingual participants. Our findings suggest that there is a need for better support for multilingual children's early mathematical skills.

          "abstract": "Objective: The term “conspirituality” has been used to describe the fusion of conspiracy beliefs and alternative spirituality. We aimed to delineate the relationship between these two types of beliefs and to investigate the cognitive correlates of conspiritual beliefs, as well as their associations with well-being. \nMethod: Study 1 (N = 207) was conducted on a sample of social media spiritual groups to examine conspirituality and its cognitive correlates. Study 2 (N = 1066) extended this investigation using a large, nationwide representative sample of Polish adults and additionally employed latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct subgroups of believers. Study 3 (N = 250) explored the links between conspiritual beliefs and well-being indicators. \nResults: Study 1 found a strong positive correlation between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality and revealed that individuals who hold these beliefs tend to perceive connections between seemingly unrelated events and believe that everything happens for a reason. Study 2 reproduced similar findings and further established the connection between conspirituality and the tendency to attribute human traits to non-human entities. In addition, LPA provided a more nuanced understanding of the different patterns of conspiritual beliefs and their associated psychological characteristics. Study 3 revealed that conspiritual believers show a tendency to search for meaning in life but do not report higher or lower life satisfaction.\nConclusions: Overall, these findings point to a potential psychological convergence between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality, although further research is needed to clarify the nature and coherence of this relationship.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

          "abstract": "Cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) underpins the development and refinement of human technology and the arts through the transmission of cultural knowledge. Despite numerous experimental demonstrations of CCE, the relationship between complexity and efficiency remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether iterative cultural transmission selectively favors simpler yet functionally efficient technologies, thereby promoting efficiency. In Study 1, participants constructed\nspaghetti towers using clay and spaghetti, either in a transmission chain paradigm or in fixed pairs building towers repeatedly. Although tower height—used as an index of efficiency—increased similarly in both conditions, iterative cultural transmission led to reduced structural complexity, as measured by fewer pillars per story. Study 2 extended these findings using a 2×2 design that manipulated both transmission type and the complexity of the initial demonstrator’s tower. The results showed that iterative transmission led to gradual simplification and efficiency gains in towers initially constructed with a complex method, whereas in the control condition, which lacked selective pressure, higher complexity persisted. Taken together, these experiments provide empirical evidence that cultural transmission introduces a selective bias toward simpler yet more efficient technological\nsolutions. Our findings suggest that iterative cultural transmission drives technological simplification and efficiency, paving the way for future research into the dynamic balance between complexity and efficiency in cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Background: People that access community mental health services in New South Wales (NSW) Australia, present with a complex mix of mental health issues. While the most common presentations include schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, symptoms of social anxiety and depression are common amongst this cohort. Given the drop-out rates associated with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, there is a growing interest in using therapeutically applied role-playing games (TA-RPGs) as an alternative. Given the current evidence for this treatment is in its infancy, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of TA-RPGS. \n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy-infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game (Dungeons and Dragons) for consumers of two community mental health services in Sydney, Australia. \n\nMethods: In total, 33 consumers of community mental health services were quasi-randomised to either the TA-RPG 8-week intervention group or a waitlist control group receiving treatment-as-usual. The TA-RPG consisted of a specially designed game of Dungeons and Dragons that was infused with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants received treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported social anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported depression and self-esteem. \n\nResults: After 8 weeks, participants in the TA-RPG group experienced a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms of social anxiety and depression, relative to baseline. A significant increase in global self-esteem was also reported. These changes were not experienced by participants in the waitlist control group. No change in either group was observed for PTSD symptoms. Dropout rates were 17% for the intervention group. \n\nConclusion: A CBT infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game group intervention was effective at reducing self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for consumers of adult community mental health services in Sydney, Australia.",

          "abstract": "Aims This study examined the joint structure of psychopathology and cognition in older adulthood. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the latent structure of psychopathology and cognition in participants aged 55-78 years old from the UK Biobank (N = 112,712; 44.6% male; M = 65.05 years). We tested four commonly studied CFA models, including: one-factor, correlated-factors, bi-factor, and higher-order models. The best-fitting model was selected based on traditional model-fit indices, model-based reliability estimates, and evaluation of model parameters. After determining the best-fitting model, multigroup CFA was used to examine measurement invariance across four age groups (i.e., 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and 70-78 years old). Results A joint higher-order model of psychopathology and cognition was selected as the best-fitting model, including a general higher-order factor and lower-order factors of internalizing, addictions and substance use, thought disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. This model demonstrated acceptable fit to the data (CFI = 0.936; TLI = 0.933; RMSEA = 0.042) and superior reliability of the lower-order factors (H = 0.850-0.974) compared to specific factors of the bi-factor model (H = 0.676-0.924). This model also demonstrated configural, lower-order metric/scalar, and higher-order metric/scalar invariance across age groups (change in CFI values ≤ 0.002). Conclusions Our results suggest that cognition can be incorporated into the higher-order structure of psychopathology in older adulthood and that the joint structure of psychopathology and cognition is age-invariant from 55 to 78 years old.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of social media presents new opportunities for implementing network interventions to improve health outcomes. In the mental health domain, content creators can serve as influential community leaders, yet it remains unclear whether creator-focused training impacts the mental health attitudes and behaviors of their audiences. This study evaluates the effectiveness of creator-focused interventions on the mental health knowledge and knowledge-based skill bases of their audiences using two experiments. First, an on-platform randomized controlled trial (RCT) provided evidence-based mental health communication toolkits and training to TikTok creators. Analyzing 188,169 comments from 1,882 videos by 49 creators (March–May 2023), we found a 4% increase in foundational mental health knowledge construction among viewers—defined as the initial stage of learning through reflection on personal experiences or opinions. Second, an off-platform survey experiment exposed a nationally representative sample of 1,000 U.S. youth (aged 14–22) to pre- and post-training videos created by a lifestyle influencer. Participants who viewed the post-training video showed significant improvements in both perceived and objectively assessed emotional support skills. By combining the external validity of the on-platform RCT with the internal validity of the survey experiment, our study provides robust evidence that creator training toolkits can enhance mental health knowledge and competencies among audiences, supporting the promise of scalable, evidence-based communication strategies on social media.",

Yet we know less about which policy issues citizens are more likely to prioritize over democratic norms. This is particularly important in European multiparty systems where issue-based voting has become salient. We hypothesize that socio-cultural issues are more likely to generate trade-offs between issue congruence and democratic principles than ‘left-right’ issues, and that these effects are asymmetrical between proponents and opponents of an issue. We test these hypotheses with evidence from a pre-registered conjoint experiment (n=2406) from Finland. We find strong evidence that citizens are willing to prioritize issue positions over democratic principles. However, contrary to our expectations, these effects are similar when it comes to socio-cultural policy issues and the more established ‘left-right’ issues, nor are the effects asymmetrical between opponents and proponents of various policies.",

The results revealed that all groups could be identified well above chance and received positive evaluations in terms of status and solidarity-based traits. However, traditional speakers were correctly identified significantly more often and were perceived more favourably in the social evaluations. In the feature analysis, new speakers’ accents were largely described as deviant from traditional speakers’ although some distinctive patterns were also identified.

          "authors": "Mark Lutter; Naomi Pech; Marc Grimm",
          "abstract": "In the aftermath of the October 7, 2023 attacks, reports of anti-Israel expressions at German universities have raised questions about the prevalence and nature of such sentiments in academic environments. Traditional survey-based research on antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment is often limited by response biases and social desirability bias. This study introduces a novel field-experimental approach to measuring anti-Israel sentiment in a real-world university setting. Using event history analysis, it examines the removal probability of stickers of the Israeli flag compared to German, US, Palestinian, and rainbow flags at a German university. Over a 24-week period, 600 stickers were placed on 50 public notice boards and were monitored for 14-day cycles. The results provide strong evidence of anti-Israel sentiment. The Israeli flag had the highest removal rate, with only 47.5% of the flags remaining at the end of the observation period—significantly lower than the survival rates of the other flags (which range from 68% to 80%). Cox regression analysis confirms that Israeli flags faced the highest removal hazard, being 3.3 to 3.7-times more likely to be removed than the rainbow flag and nearly twice as likely as the German flag. Politically motivated removals, though less frequent, disproportionately targeted Israeli flags as well. Removal rates were highest in hallways of the humanities, shared humanities/social sciences as well as in central facilities hallways. Hallways in the natural sciences, the human- and social sciences and economics had lower removal rates. Areas with higher student traffic exhibited fewer removals. Overall, the findings indicate a pronounced anti-Israel bias on campus, distinct from attitudes toward other nationalities or symbols.",

          "abstract": "The paper attempts to explore the affective representation of war in Sudanese American poet Emtithal (Emi) Mahmoud’s collection Sister’s Entrance (2018). In her debut collection, Mahmuod offers a poignant exploration of war’s emotional and psychological toll through the lens of a woman immigrant from Darfur. The poetry in this collection is not solely about the war in Darfur or Mahmoud’s experience during that time. It delves into the war, but it also highlights the repercussions of the war for her and her family. Such repercussions as displacement, becoming a refugee and eventually living with a hyphenated identity in a world that pays very little attention to her people’s suffering. The paper utilizes the theoretical framework of the “affective turn” which highlights the importance of viewing the body/individual’s existence in the world through its affective nature. Using affect theory to read Mahmoud’s poetry helps in illuminating aspects of the Sudanese war experience that relate not only to the poet’s experience as a Sudanese who lived through a civil war and became a refugee in exile, but also helps us understand how feelings of confusion, grief and hope are somewhat universal. Through the examination of Mahmoud’s poetry, the aim of the paper is to highlight the nuanced nature of the Sudanese war and offer a differentiated understanding of a war that is often underrepresented or misrepresented.",

          "abstract": "Unlike conventional machine translation (MT), large language models (LLMs) are unique in producing various translations based on different prompts. Researchers have suggested designing detailed translation prompts to improve the translation output of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered LLMs. This study investigates how LLMs respond to prompts that include extratextual information typically included in a translation brief to a human translator. The underlying goal is to probe LLM models’ potential in human translator work and training. To answer the research question, three passages from tourist brochures were submitted to ChatGPT with five prompts, which included information on the text function, translation purpose, and target audience. To identify any effect on the output, cultural references and promotional devices (e.g., imagery, personal deixis, and emotive words) were identified in the passages, followed by a comparison of their translations across the five texts. The study’s significance lies in applying concepts in translation theories such as the translation brief to the novel field of prompt design, moving beyond the usual linguistic accuracy metrics of MT assessment. The analysis showed that ChatGPT did not recognize cultural references as elements that might require explication for the target audience. It also rendered textual persuasive devices faithfully regardless of any changes in the prompts. These faithful translations were not always successful in preserving the textual functions of persuasion. The results suggest that more specific and detailed prompts are needed to bring MT closer to human translation.",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the challenges and difficulties undergraduate students face in simultaneous interpreting and how these can be effectively addressed through training. The study aims to explore students’ perceptions of the obstacles encountered during simultaneous interpreting and develop a structured training program informed by their feedback. The methodology employed in this study involved a structured questionnaire designed to assess the perceptions of student interpreters regarding the challenges they face in simultaneous interpreting. Data analysis included calculating means and standard deviation for each item, revealing that participants recognized the complexity of simultaneous interpreting. The study suggested a training program based on trainees’ feedback to improve their knowledge and procedural competence to overcome these challenges and difficulties in practicing simultaneous interpreting professionally. After identifying the specific obstacles student interpreters perceive, the study suggested training programs through corrective exercises and tasks based on these findings to improve trainees’ competence and performance in simultaneous interpreting. The structured training program should be followed to enhance trainees’ linguistic and cognitive competence, cultural proficiency, and interpreting skills. The results highlight that while students acknowledge the existence of significant challenges, they collectively reject the notion that these challenges can be easily overcome. The results imply that a structured training program is needed for the trainees to overcome the obstacles they face in simultaneous interpreting. The training program includes the structural and cultural differences between English and Arabic. The significance of the study lies in its practical contribution to interpreter education by addressing real-world difficulties identified by trainees and offering corrective exercises and targeted tasks. This approach ensures that training aligns with students’ needs and equips them with the procedural competence necessary for professional simultaneous interpreting",

The findings reveal that 90% of students utilize AI tools, with 66.7% expressing a reliance on them. While 70% of respondents believe that AI-generated translations are accurate, 33.3% are skeptical about AI’s ability to manage complex tasks. Students acknowledge that AI significantly aids in maintaining consistency and efficiency, yet they emphasize the importance of human oversight, particularly for intricate and culturally nuanced translations.

          "abstract": "Translation is essential in uniting societies and individuals, enabling meaningful dialogue and communication. It traces its roots back to the very beginnings of human history. Translation has become a reputable academic discipline. Unfortunately, a lot of students wrongly believe that translation is a straightforward, word-for-word exchange, which reduces it to a mechanical process. This paper aims to is to advocate the essential integration of translation theories in undergraduate training programs for translation students. Understanding the fundamental principles and rules of translation theories such as semantics, contrastive linguistics, communication strategies, and equivalence will enhance   undergraduate students’ skills in translation. This article employed theoretical and descriptive methods. It highlights the transforming potential of practical translation training and offers insights that will be useful to students, practitioners, and translation educators. Therefore, more research is required to connect theory and practice in academic translation programs and research.",

          "abstract": "This research paper aims to analyze the experience of exile in four Arab narratives through the lens of Edward Said’s exploration of alienation as a result of exile. By analyzing a selection of texts—Mourid Barghouti’s I Saw Ramallah (2003), Radwa Ashour’s The Woman From Tantoura (2014), Tarek Eltayeb’s Cities Without Palms (2009), and Muhsin Al-Ramli’s novel Dates On My Fingers (2014), this paper will highlight the various ways in which Arab exiles experience alienation and reframe certain immigrant narratives as exile. It will address the importance of examining diverse narratives of exile, how Said’s works can help explore the theme of alienation as expressed by various Arab writers, the necessity of a more nuanced perspective on exiles and immigrants, and the significance of these narratives in relation to contemporary political issues.\nThrough the thematic analysis of these works, it was concluded that immigrant narratives like Cities Without Palms (Eltayeb, 2009) and Dates On My Fingers (Al-Ramli, 2014) share significant parallels with exile narratives such as I Saw Ramallah (Barghouti, 2003) and The Woman From Tantoura (Ashour, 2014) particularly within the Arab context. Properly labeling literature is essential in today’s world, where people increasingly seek concise, focused information. Reframing certain immigrant narratives as literature of exile, as this research paper attempts to do, helps identify their intended audience and ensures that they reach the right readers and scholars.",

          "authors": "AWEJ-tls for Translation &amp; Literary Studies; Chaimae El Idrissi Amiri; Tayeb Ghourdou",
          "abstract": "This article examines the complex dynamics of challenge and conformity that female filmmakers navigate in their portrayal of women in contemporary Moroccan drama series.  It explores the extent to which female-led filmmaking subverts traditional gender norms and promotes women’s empowerment in media representation. As agents of change, female directors are expected to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional, and empowering portrayals of women. This study aims to illuminate that, despite their efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in the male-dominated industry by centring women’s experiences, female filmmakers inadvertently continue to reinforce conventional stereotypes. Two prominent television series were selected, critically analysed and compared using a qualitative thematic analysis approach to substantiate this argument. The first, Dar Nsa (2024) (House of Women), is a drama series directed by Samia Akariou and aired on Al Aoula. The second, Al-Mukhtafi (2023) (The Disappeared), is a mystery drama by Zakia Tahiri, broadcast on 2M. Both filmmakers are acclaimed for their gender-focused endeavours to promote women’s rights, gender equality, and empowerment through their creative work. However, this study reveals that their recent works fail to achieve these objectives. Data analysed through a feminist theoretical framework demonstrates that female filmmakers adopt an ambivalent discourse, resulting in a constrained representation that reinforces embedded patriarchal norms instead of undermining them. Results also indicate that this ambivalence arises from structural pressures, market demands, and internalised gender norms. This research contributes to feminist media literature by highlighting that female-authored filmmaking does not necessarily lead to fully empowering narratives. It recommends that female filmmakers embrace more intentional feminist approaches to actively reshape the misrepresentation of women in Moroccan media",

Numerous studies in the field of translation studies have focused on similes. This study offers a comprehensive overview of simile translation research in the last 25 years (2000−2024) based on bibliometric analysis, both in the global and Indonesian context. This study aims: (1) to find out bibliometric information regarding the simile translation research, (2) to find out the prominent topics in simile translation research, and (3) to find out the prominent approaches in simile translation research. This study applied mixed methods, namely quantitative and qualitative. The dataset in this study was obtained from the Scopus database (96 publications) as a global representation and the GARUDA database (62 publications) as a national representation of Indonesia. This study analyzed keywords using Sketch Engine to find prominent topics and approaches in simile translation research. First, this study presents a bibliometric analysis of simile translation research, which includes the number of publications, publishers, journals, types of publications, languages used, and the most widely used references. Second, the topic widely analyzed is simile as a figurative language closely related to metaphors and idioms. Third, the approaches used in simile translation research in the global context are (1) eco-translation, (2) formal and dynamic equivalence, (3) linguo-cultural, and (4) corpus-based. Meanwhile, in the national context of Indonesia, the approaches used are (1) qualitative, (2) cognitive, and (3) functionalist. These findings provide an overview for future studies on trends and gaps in simile translation research.",

          "abstract": "Undoubtedly, enhancing translation processes and increasing the understanding of Arabic-English political and cultural contexts by illuminating new political metaphor translation procedures are crucial. This study aimed to examine the translation of political metaphors from English to Arabic in political discourse and then to identify the strategies that translators utilize. This study employed deep analysis to achieve the main objective and presented several frequencies. This study revealed the following findings. This study advances translation studies by adding the (H) category to Newmark’s metaphor translation procedures. Although Newmark’s paradigm offers several ways to convey metaphors, this H category is “The equivalent contextual meaning of being true to the original text and communicating the correct contextual meaning of the metaphor”. Additionally, several metaphors in the source language have direct equivalents in Arabic, and Arabic translators have not invented any new versions or techniques in response to these findings. Hence, the study contributed to the translation procedures. Next, the choice of metaphors that are appropriate for use in the target language is affected not only by linguistic and cultural considerations but also by the nature of the text, speakers’ purposes, and the metaphors themselves. Next, this study sheds light on how translators address the language and cultural obstacles that arise while attempting to translate metaphors, offering insights into the translation process. The study also introduces the “H” category, which adds a new dimension to Newmark’s methods. This can help translators explain political meanings more accurately. Accordingly, additional studies should be conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of metaphor translation procedures in political discourse.",

          "abstract": "A growing science reform movement has emerged over the past decade to address dysfunctions in academic research assessment, with several national and transnational stakeholder initiatives promoting and coordinating collective action. This paper offers an analytic commentary on one such effort: the Dutch national Recognition and Rewards program. Since its launch in 2019, the initiative has become one of the most advanced and coordinated national reform programs of its kind. The progress and development to date of this national reform effort is considered, drawing on several theoretical strands to make sense of developments. I make the case that the initiative has been largely effective in mobilizing formal organizational support from key stakeholders in Dutch research, but significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly regarding uncertain buy-in and implementation by rank-and-file academics - the ultimate implementers of the envisioned changes. Although some of the dynamics discussed here are specific to the Dutch context, the question of how to bridge the implementation gap between organization-led change programs and day-to-day academic research culture will be, I believe, a crucial one for equivalent initiatives globally. The paper ends with some suggestions for tackling this important challenge.",

It introduces the category of re-representation as a new form of mapping and examines its defining characteristics through the references of Gaiagraphy / Terra Forma and the Feral Atlas. Beyond isolated experiments, the paper argues that a culture of re-representation is beginning to emerge. Re-representations are conceptualized as multimodal assemblages that engage with situated landscapes as patchy zones of mattering processes. The concept of mattering processes emphasizes re-representations' capacity to explore and articulate what comes to matter in and as landscapes.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of various educational equalization strategies on labor market disparities by social origin in Great Britain. Specifically, we examine three hypothetical interventions: 1) equalizing higher education rates across social origin groups, 2) equalizing the labor market returns to higher education across social origin groups, and 3) randomly assigning higher education within each social origin group. We hypothesize that equalizing access to higher education would reduce labor market disparities, while the random assignment of high-er education within origin groups would increase them. Reframing conflicting arguments in an ongoing debate, we propose competing hypotheses on whether equalizing returns to higher education increases or decreases labor market disparities. To test these hypotheses, we use a novel non-parametric decomposition method and longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. For both sexes, our findings show that equalizing higher education attainment rates would reduce labor market disparities, whereas randomly assigning higher education within origin groups would have no significant impact. The effect of equalizing the benefits of higher education varies by sex and differs depending on whether wages or occupational out-comes are considered.",

          "abstract": "Residential buildings account for 17-20% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, posing a significant challenge in transitioning all buildings to net zero. While heat pumps and building retrofits can significantly reduce emissions, homeowners are often unaware of their energy usage and the potential for cost reduction. Supervised machine learning methods have the potential to provide actionable insights for individual energy end-users, enabling them to reduce both GHG emissions and energy costs. We propose a novel framework that utilizes baseline, intervention, and optimization models to predict emissions and cost estimates for individual energy end users. This paper presents a novel application of an optimization model for energy bills through machine learning methods: (1) classification of time series data for electricity and gas usage baselines, (2) prediction of GHG emission reductions, and (3) prediction of energy cost reductions. This study suggests energy retrofit policy implications that utilize machine learning as an enabling technology, empowering decision-makers and end-users to tackle climate change.",

          "authors": "Olan McEvoy; Lucian Plaumann",
          "abstract": "Across advanced economies in Europe, the agricultural sector relies heavily on seasonal migrant workers. Despite being declared ‘essential’ by many governments during the coronavirus pandemic, these workers are widely documented to face extremely poor working and living conditions, along with low wages. While existing literature has primarily focused on countries in southern Europe, this paper examines Germany’s agricultural sector as facing similar challenges in securing migrant workers’ rights. Around 300,000 migrant workers come to Germany each year for the harvest season, with most now arriving from Romania and Poland. We find that the employment of this workforce is driven by structural changes in Germany’s agricultural sector, the Europeanisation of migration policy, the deregulation of the German labour market, the proliferation of new employment categories, and the dominance of sectoral business interests in policymaking. The German case illustrates both the difficulty of regulating precarious, low-wage work in a sector traditionally weak in labour organising, and how the Europe-wide nature of the issue means that, without coordinated action by the labour movement across the EU, the ‘race to the bottom’ in this sector will continue.",

          "abstract": "While many life course transitions are associated with weight gain, marital separation follows a different trajectory and instead is associated with weight loss. Research remains inconclusive whether the weight changes are intentional or if they reflect more unintentional mechanisms. We first examine fluctuations in both objective (BMI) and subjective weight (self-rated weight and weight satisfaction) before, during, and after marital separation. In the year of separation, women’s BMI decreases by an average of 1 unit (equivalent to 6.3 pounds for a 5’5” woman), compared to a 0.3 unit decline for men (approximately 2 pounds for a 5’10” man). These patterns align with shifts in subjective weight: around the year of separation, men and women report greater weight satisfaction and women are less likely to perceive themselves as overweight. We then explore potential explanatory mechanisms to elucidate intentionality. Results indicate no substantial changes in dieting and exercise for women or men during marital dissolution but concurrent increases in psychological distress that are more substantial for men, highlighting that weight changes might be linked to unintentional stress-related mechanisms rather than intentional weight-loss behaviors. The findings shown here underscore the complex and socially embedded ways in which bodies respond to major life transitions.",

Are individuals’ earnings trajectories primarily shaped by their social class position, or do trajectories vary within them? These unresolved questions lie at the heart of debates on social class and labor market rewards. To address them, we leverage employment relations theory and data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We use mixed effects models with heterogenous variance components, and latent group mixed effects models. Our findings align with our central argument that the degree of similarity in trajectories within social classes differs across classes. Social class is linked to typical earnings trajectories, with a pronounced division between the salariat and other classes. However, the degree of trajectory similarity varies across classes. Salaried workers show the least tightly clustered trajectories. Fluctuation in earnings is most pronounced for lower-grade and routine workers. Social class outperforms occupational and post-class accounts at predicting earnings trajectories.",

However, between 2016 and 2024, Latinos were among the groups whose pro-GOP shift was the largest. How did Trump increase Latino support despite the mismatch between his opposition to unauthorized immigration and Latinos' historically pro-immigration views? We investigate this question primarily using multiple high-quality, population-based panels of Latinos interviewed in English or Spanish (2016-2024). We document a restrictionist turn in Latinos' attitudes, alongside perceptions that both parties slightly moderated. Immigration attitudes were consistently integrated with vote choice to roughly the same degree in 2016, 2020, and 2024 for both Latino and white voters, and do not prove especially predictive for Latinos. These findings demonstrate that while immigration has not waned in importance for Latinos, Democrats' advantage on immigration is eroding.",

These findings, grounded in the literature, reveal the counterproductive and exclusionary outcomes of fear-based disciplinary practices.

Despite their apparent opposition, these \nmetaphors share common assumptions rooted in natural law traditions. As an alternative, the essay\nintroduces the concept of the “commonist lifeboat,” grounded in maritime custom, class \nconsciousness, and environmental encounters. Inspired by historical practices of survival and mutual \naid at sea, this approach suggests principles for addressing climate adaptation through bottom-up \ncustoms rather than top-down theoretical solutions. Three brief illustrations address climate policy’s \nintersections with property law, criminal law, and international human rights law. This approach \nultimately offers a historically informed perspective on climate crisis challenges, reconciling \nconsequentialist arguments with concerns for dignity and consent.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to leverage the heterogeneity in Gender Role Attitudes in Germany and the different prevailing ideas of marriage between the east and west of the country to investigate the role played by agreement on gender roles in partnership transitions, comparing contexts with different prevailing ideas of marriages. Marriage is still perceived as normative in Germany and enshrined in institutions, yet marriage rates have been declining in the last decades. I investigate whether attitudes towards gender roles held jointly by couples and their change might explain this discrepancy.  I examine a sample of 1297 German couples followed yearly from the beginning of their partnership onwards from 2008 to 2019, with information on both partners, selected from a representative probability sample. I use a series of Competing Risk survival models, comparing couples from West Germany with couples from East Germany. Sharing attitudes towards gender roles at the beginning of the relationship is positively related to marriage likelihoods in the West but not in the East. Convergence to a shared attitude for couples who start with diverging attitudes is also correlated with higher marriage risks, with differences between West German and East German couples. Correlation between attitudinal convergence and marriage probabilities highlights the need for couple-focused research when investigating partnership patterns. Differences in the correlations between West- and East German couples indicate possible effects of the predominant idea of marriage on the relationship between couple’s gender attitudes and their relationship outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This Chapter focuses on the policy impact of the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European \nUnion (the Court). We define policy impact as the ability of the Court to produce change in the \npolitical domain. We analyze this impact across two different dimensions: horizontal and vertical. \nThe horizontal dimension looks at the impact of the Court's rulings on European Union policies, that \nis, to what extent the judgments of the Court impact the policy output of the European Union \nlegislator. The vertical dimension focuses on the impact of the Court's judgments on Member States' \nlegal orders. We understand this broadly, as encompassing change as showing through in legislation, \ncase law, policies, and administrative decisions. \nThe Chapter systematically reviews the existing literature on policy impact across the vertical and \nhorizontal dimensions to systematize existing knowledge and identify lacunas, shortcomings and \nchallenges in the study of the Court's policy impact. We analyze the state of the art both in the legal \nand political science literatures. We find some stark disagreement as per the extent to which the Court \nimpacts policy outcomes at the European Union level. Along the vertical dimension, the impact of \nthe Court's rulings is generally accepted, but research mostly relies on qualitative studies and hence \nresults greatly vary. \nTaking stock of the existing literature, with its strengths and weaknesses, in the last part of the Chapter \nwe propose to think anew about how to empirically research the policy impact of the Court's \njudgments. This involves, on the one hand, rethinking some of the current dogmas and assumptions \nin the field. On the other hand, we argue that new empirical strategies need to be developed for a \nbetter study of the policy impact of the Court. To this end, we suggest several concrete elements that \ncould push forward the empirical study of impact, and discuss the different limitations of our \nproposed approach (in particular, the unavailability of data) and how these could be overcome. We \nconclude with a reflection on how the empirical research on this field can not only enlarge our \nknowledge of the real impact of the Court's judgments, but also bridge and nuance some of the \ndivergent views in legal and political science studies.",

          "title": "From disparate lists to population estimates: A multiple systems estimation workflow for mortality analysis in conflict settings",
          "authors": "Maria Gargiulo",
          "abstract": "Quantifying mortality in conflict settings is a challenging but necessary task for health and humanitarian response, historical memory, and accountability. In conflict settings, traditional demographic data sources, like vital statistics, may not be available or of suitable quality for mortality estimation. However, alternative sources documenting the deceased may exist, such as digital trace data, news reports, or data collected by civil society organizations. These sources are not without their own biases. Rather than being statistically representative samples or complete counts, they are convenience samples: they represent the fraction of violence that was documented. However, when multiple sources are taken together, multiple systems estimation (capture-recapture) can be used for mortality estimation. This article describes a workflow for mortality estimation using disparate and statistically biased data sources, motivated by three missing data challenges commonly encountered in conflict settings: missing identifiers to link victims across sources, missing covariates in records of documented victims, and records of victims that are entirely undocumented. The workflow is demonstrated using data about conflict-related homicides during the armed conflict in Colombia from 1985–2018. Beyond its applications to conflict mortality estimation, this workflow can be applied to examine mortality due to other causes or other events of demographic interest.",

          "authors": "Shancheng Liu",
          "abstract": "Feminism in China has faced significant stigmatisation from both the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and nationalists, frequently being labeled as a “destabilising factor,” “Western interference,” or even “extremism” subject to criticism and suppression. This repressive stance is largely anticipated, given the widely acknowledged patriarchal nature of the Chinese state and the prominent role of nationalism in its ideology, wherein feminism and nationalism are often perceived as antithetical. However, the emergence of pink feminism (fenhong nvquan) in China since 2020 has challenged this rigid opposition by embracing feminism and nationalism simultaneously. To understand this alternative relationship between feminism and nationalism in China, this study employs online ethnography to explore how pink feminism reconciles the seemingly contradictory nature of feminism and nationalism. Through thematic analysis, four themes explaining the reconciliation emerge: 1) Pink Feminism as Marxist/socialist feminism; 2) conditional nationalism; 3) Pink Feminism as post-colonial feminism; 4) “China” as a multi-faceted notion and constructive patriotism.  By examining pink feminism, this study contributes to a more heterogeneous understanding of contemporary Chinese feminism, challenges oversimplified interpretations of Chinese feminism and nationalism, and sheds light on the CCP’s resilience in navigating the rise of grassroots feminist movements.",

          "authors": "Daniel Nettle; Coralie Chevallier; Kate Pickett; Matthew Thomas Johnson; Elliott Aidan Johnson; Melissa Bateson",
          "abstract": "There is some evidence that income volatility (fluctuations in income over time) negatively affects mental and physical health, independently of the level of income. Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.",

          "abstract": "Wilderness therapy (WT) programming in the US has employed involuntary treatment using cognitive or adaptive dissonance for decades. Cognitive dissonance occurs when people face situations that do not confirm their expectations. Past WT participants have protested that involuntary, inescapable, and harsh conditions harmed them through PTSD and subsequent dissociation. This argumentative study compares dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available information. Using the confronting coercive WT model to illuminate concerns clearly, we argue that dissociation is a response recorded in the design of these WT practices and participant statements and is often mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments aligns with the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during WT is likely to be harmful and, given this potential, may be regarded as malpractice",

          "abstract": "Criminological research often fails to achieve cumulative theoretical progress despite methodological sophistication. Paul Meehl’s concept of “logical derivation chains” provides a diagnostic framework for understanding this persistent problem, yet it remains largely absent from criminological practice. Using Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory as a detailed case study, including empirical analysis illustrating potential measurement incoherence, I argue that loose derivation chains are structural features of social scientific inquiry rather than correctable methodological problems. Through systematic analysis of sampling, measurement, and analytical choices, I reveal how auxiliary assumptions accumulate throughout the research process, creating compound derivation chain failures. The analysis identifies a “correlation paradox” where a correlation of r = -.31 (p &lt; 2e-16), typically celebrated as impressive empirical support, corresponds to theoretical failure for 39% of individual cases. Contemporary statistical methods systematically privilege aggregate patterns over individual variation, rendering theoretically crucial anomalies invisible and creating research programs that appear progressive despite exhibiting degenerating characteristics. The analysis concludes with strategies for constraint-aware research, including individual-level prediction assessment and item-specific analysis that reveal theoretically important anomalies hidden by aggregate correlations, alongside institutional reforms that encourage genuine theoretical advancement over mere accumulation of supportive correlations.",

Traffic emissions are a major source of pollutants like particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Utilizing intervention-based epidemiological study designs, the research estimates the effects of a proposed 25% traffic reduction in downtown LA. Simulated results indicate a substantial decrease in NO2 and PM10 levels, with predicted increases of 1,263.58 years of life gained (YLG) in the greater LA area over a decade. The discussion highlights the potential of CCS to not only reduce pollution but also address socio-economic disparities in health outcomes.

          "abstract": "Should a set of hypothetical educational interventions improve malleable schooling experiences for Blacks to match that of Whites, how much racial disparity in subsequent youth development would be reduced and how much would remain? To address this question, a causal decomposition analysis must credibly identify the potential causal impacts of intervening on one or more malleable factors in education for Blacks. However, simulations of hypothetical interventions targeting the malleable factors within levels of an endogenous confounder such as parental SES would fail to eliminate the marginal Black-White gap in schooling as intended, a dilemma known as “Simpson’s paradox”. Extending the latest developments in methodology, we propose a novel within-group rank-preserving solution that adjusts for endogenous confounding for multivariate malleable factors. A semiparametric weighting strategy then emulates the counterfactual outcome of a hypothetical series of racial equity-oriented educational interventions for Blacks presumably at no expense to Whites. We demonstrate why the methodological development in handling endogenous confounders may have important real-world implications. Applying this causal decomposition strategy to the NLSY97 data, we reveal significant potentials of racial equity in education for reducing Black youths’ disconnections from school and work as they transition into early adulthood.",

To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).",

          "abstract": "This article examines the development of the concept of arnasgune in the Basque context. While initially referring to demographically concentrated areas where a minority language thrives, as a translation of Fishman’s ‘breathing spaces’, arnasgune has undergone significant conceptual expansion. The term has gained traction in academic research, language policy, and media discourse, sparking debate over its precise definition. Through a qualitative analysis of academic literature, policy documents and newspaper articles, this study traces the evolution of arnasgune and its varied uses. This paper identifies two key perspectives: a dominant group advocating for a strict socio-territorial interpretation, and a more flexible understanding of the term. Additionally, this study highlights how the growing prominence of arnasgune has drawn social and policy attention to previously overlooked sociolinguistic contexts crucial to the future of the Basque language. It argues that the contested nature of the term arnasgune enriches local discussions on language revitalisation, also illustrating how conceptual shifts reflect deeper sociolinguistic and cultural transformations in the Basque context. Ultimately, by analysing the evolution and use of the term arnasgune, the article contributes to ongoing discussions surrounding minority language maintenance, language policy and minority language media.",

          "abstract": "Designing for serendipity in information technologies presents significant challenges for both scholars and practitioners. This paper presents a theoretical model of serendipity that aims to address this challenge by providing a structured framework for understanding and designing for serendipity. The model delineates between intended, afforded, and experienced serendipity, recognizing the role of design intents and the subjective nature of experiencing serendipity. Central to the model is the recognition that there is no single definition nor a unique operationalization of serendipity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to its conceptualization and design. By delineating between the intentions of designers, the characteristics of the system, and the experiences of end-users, the model offers a pathway to resolve the paradox of artificial serendipity and provides actionable guidelines to design for serendipity in information technologies. However, it also emphasizes the importance of establishing ‘guardrails’ to guide the design process and mitigate potential negative unintended consequences. The model aims to lay ground to advance both research and the practice of designing for serendipity, leading to more ethical and effective design practices.",

The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments.

          "abstract": "In April 2024, Spotify eliminated royalties for tracks with fewer than 1,000 annual streams, justifying the move as a deterrent to streaming fraud, a way to clean up “noise” content and a fix for “trapped” micropayments. Spotify asserted that these changes would benefit “emerging and professional artists” and claimed the policy would not affect music discovery or promotion.\n\nThis study rigorously tests those claims using a 21-month, 42,000-observation dataset normalized for Spotify’s user growth. By applying difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity and event study designs across artist tiers and career stages, the analysis isolates the policy’s true effects.\n\nContrary to its stated intent, the policy produced a paradoxical outcome: mid-tier artists (10,000–100,000 listeners) experienced a 20% drop in market share growth, while artists already on an upward trajectory captured nearly all the gains. These effects emerged gradually, reflecting algorithmic recalibration rather than immediate changes in listener behaviour, and remained robust across multiple sensitivity checks. Notably, the anticipated substitution effect, where attention would shift to adjacent tiers, did not materialize.\n\nThese findings reveal that even policies framed as technical or anti-fraud measures can act as powerful infrastructural interventions, quietly amplifying existing inequalities. Rather than democratizing the platform, Spotify’s threshold deepened market concentration and favoured those already poised to benefit. These results highlight the need for rigorous, forward-looking assessment of policy interventions to fully understand their systemic impacts.",

Recognizing a legitimate scientific journal from a predatory one is becoming increasingly difficult, and the scientific community is coming up with many ways to detect them. One of the new methods is the involvement of artificial intelligence. This short communication summarizes the limits of using artificial intelligence in detecting predatory journals and divides them into three categories – the limits associated with the creation of untrustworthy and legitimate journals, the heterogeneity of definitions and characteristics of predatory journals, and the grey area of scientific publishing. The very cases where artificial intelligence has failed to perform well on this issue speak to the need to add an expert perspective to quantitative machine evaluation of predatory journals and to focus primarily on the data on which artificial intelligence models operate and train.",

We argue that haziness in the meaning of what constitutes an egalitarian work-family arrangement results in an overestimation of the desire for evenly sharing paid and unpaid labor. Using original survey data nationally representative of adults in the United States (N = 998), findings show an unspecified sharing arrangement was chosen as ideal by about 50 percent of respondents. Yet, when given precise definitions of what constitutes equal sharing, only 25 percent of respondents considered an even-sharing arrangement their ideal, whereas the majority opted for uneven or non-symmetrical methods of sharing. Rejecting gender essentialism, the belief that men and women are inherently different, was associated with an increased likelihood in reporting an even-sharing ideal, among both men and women. Being a sole provider was less idolized when gender essentialist beliefs were low, especially among men. We conclude that overlooking the variety of work-family arrangements that typical Americans consider to be egalitarian erroneously disregards gender beliefs as a primary barrier to equal partnerships.",

          "authors": "Jana Krause; Marika Miner; Imrana Buba; Melanie Sauter",
          "abstract": "Communal violence remains a pervasive yet understudied form of political violence, often overshadowed by civil wars and electoral conflicts. Although improvements in the quality and accessibility of event data have enabled more systematic and comparative research, significant biases and discrepancies persist. A key obstacle to advancing the field has been the lack of conceptual clarity and standardized coding practices, which hampers comparison of findings. We develop a crisp definition of communal violence and operationalize it with a novel keyword-based coding methodology. Drawing on fieldwork- generated knowledge, we foreground the practices, along with the issues, identities and actors involved. Hence, we focus not only on the ‘who’ but more importantly on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of communal violence. Applying our method to the case of Nigeria, we generate new insights about the geography and trends of communal violence and their interaction with other forms of armed violence. Our findings underscore that dataset choice and coding rules can lead to rather different conclusions about the scale and impact of ‘local violence’. Our transparent and adaptable coding scheme offers a replicable framework for analyzing communal violence across diverse contexts and datasets.",

          "authors": "David Brady; Alexis Bocanegra; Diana Cervantes; Lauren Macy; Nasdira Romero Saravia; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Immigrants are now more than one-fifth of the poor in the U.S. Yet, despite some valuable literature, immigrant poverty remains arguably understudied. This study builds on the larger literatures on immigrant attainment and poverty, and the smaller literature on immigrant poverty. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we provide an improved descriptive demographic portrait of immigrant poverty from 1993-2023, across 51 states (including D.C.), and within 2019-2024 (N=760,026). There is considerable heterogeneity over time. After declining for several decades, immigrant poverty increased substantially in recent years. Immigrant poverty also varies enormously across states. States’ immigrant poverty rates are moderately negatively correlated with states’ immigrant share of the population and strongly positively correlated with states’ non-immigrant poverty. There are large heterogeneities by nation of origin as well. While immigrants from India have among the lowest poverty of any group in the U.S., Honduran immigrant poverty is 6-7 times higher. While especially being a non-citizen immigrant increases poverty, heterogeneities in immigrant poverty are driven more by the major risks of poverty than the immigrant characteristics of being a citizen, years of residence, or mixed status households. That said, heterogeneities by nation of origin are explained by varying mixes of risks, immigrant characteristics and educational selectivity. Ultimately, we demonstrate immigrant poverty is not one coherent phenomenon. Indeed, the heterogeneities within immigrant poverty are perhaps even more important than the heterogeneities in poverty between immigrants and non-immigrants. (Stone Center Working Paper Series)",

We evaluate whether\nit is possible to design a social media platform that instead promotes productive, open-minded\ndialogue among users. We recruited 1,043 Americans who expressed willingness to test a new\nsocial media platform by installing a mobile app we developed for iOS and Android devices.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to spend ten minutes on one of two versions of a simulated\nsocial media platform. The first was a control condition designed to resemble typical text-based\nsocial media sites, and users were told that people whose posts are liked very often receive\na “popular user” badge. The second version was identical to the first, but respondents were\ninstead told users receive an “open-minded” badge if they respectfully engage with opposing\nviewpoints. Participants using both versions were asked to join an ongoing discussion about\neither gun control or immigration. Unbeknownst to them, each participant only interacted\nwith chatbots powered by generative AI. We find that respondents assigned to the experimental\ncondition exhibited more intellectually humble language in their posts and comments and\nreported experiencing more positive emotions.

          "abstract": "How does the arrival of a new immigrant group affect earlier generations of immigrants? Do group relations and self-identification change? Previous research on ethnic boundaries is usually restricted to a two-group paradigm and primarily focuses on the majority group’s perspective. In contrast, this study analyzes how the arrival of refugees in Germany influenced previous immigrants of Turkish and Polish origin by exploiting regional and temporal variation in refugee immigration. I combine macro data about refugees with individual longitudinal data of a large-scale German panel survey (SOEP) from 2012 to 2018 based on a random sample. Using fixed effects estimations, this study finds that an increasing proportion of refugees in a county increased concerns about immigration and decreased self-reported discrimination among Turkish (N = 676 respondents, n = 2,914 person-years) and Polish (N = 513 respondents, n = 2,141 person-years) respondents. Moreover, Turkish immigrants showed a tendency to feel more German and felt closer to Turkey at the same time. Poles also felt more German but not closer to Poland. These results are in line with the theoretical assumptions that minority groups tend to distance themselves from new immigrants, and use the opportunity to improve their own social position by strengthening their identification with the majority and/or with their own ethnic group.",

          "abstract": "A growing science reform movement has emerged over the past decade to address dysfunctions in academic research assessment, with several national and transnational stakeholder initiatives promoting and coordinating collective action. This paper offers an analytic commentary on one such effort: the Dutch national Recognition and Rewards program. Since its launch in 2019, the initiative has become one of the most advanced and coordinated national reform programs of its kind. The progress and development to date of this national reform effort is considered, drawing on several theoretical strands to make sense of developments. I make the case that the initiative has been largely effective in mobilizing formal organizational support from key stakeholders in Dutch research, but significant vulnerabilities remain, particularly regarding uncertain buy-in and implementation by rank-and-file academics - the ultimate implementers of the envisioned changes. Although some of the dynamics discussed here are specific to the Dutch context, the question of how to bridge the implementation gap between organization-led change programs and day-to-day academic research culture will be, I believe, a crucial one for equivalent initiatives globally. The paper ends with some suggestions for tackling this important challenge.",

          "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, internal migration due to climate extreme events is becoming increasingly common in the Global South. Yet, little is known about how rural host communities respond to environmental migrants. This study investigates attitudes towards internally displaced environmental migrants in northern Bangladesh, focusing on three key mechanisms: perceived deservingness, empathy through geographic and experiential proximity, and personal contact. We draw on a pre-registered, face-to-face survey with 265 rural respondents. At the core of our survey is a forced-choice conjoint experimental design (N=936) to causally assess how different migrant characteristics -- including reason for migration, occupation, religion, and distance from origin -- influence host preferences. Findings show that migrants displaced by riverbank erosion are significantly more likely to be accepted than economic migrants, reflecting a strong role for deservingness in shaping attitudes. Environmental displacement also attenuates discrimination based on other migrant attributes, such as religion, occupation, and distance of migrant origin. Respondents who experienced similar environmental hardships, such as erosion-induced house loss, expressed the strongest preferences for environmentally displaced migrants, supporting the empathy mechanism. In contrast, simple exposure to in-migrants in the village had no measurable effect on attitudes, challenging assumptions about the universal benefits of intergroup contact. Our study extends the migration attitudes literature by focusing on internal, rural-to-rural displacement in a climate-vulnerable context. These findings highlight how moral judgments and experiential proximity can foster inclusive attitudes even in resource-constrained settings, with important implications for societal resilience under climate change.",

          "abstract": "We examine the effect of childbirth on parents’ environmental and climate concerns, focusing on potentially dynamic changes in concerns within a timespan of two years before and up to 10 years after birth. Additionally, we explore effect heterogeneities by gender and educational attainment. By using long-running survey data from the German Socio-economic Panel Study (GSOEP, 1984 – 2020, N=108,340) and estimating linear probability models with fixed-effects, we contribute substantially to previous research that has been limited by cross-sectional approaches with mixed or even contradictory results. Contrary to the popular notion that childbirth leads to higher levels of environmentalism based on legacy motives, our results suggest marginal and mostly negative effects of childbirth on environmental and climate concerns. Overall, the effects of childbirth on planetary concerns tended to be less pronounced in the first years after birth. Over time, however, these effects increased and even reversed. We found no exclusive patterns for men and women and nuances of relevance by educational attainment and item design, highlighting the complex nature of the nexus between family formation, gender, and environmentalism. Parents’ slightly reduced focus on environmental and climate challenges may reflect denial mechanisms during highly stressful times, as they prioritize immediate and novel challenges associated with parenthood, often leading to an increase in less environmentally favorable behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Peer review has long been regarded as a cornerstone of scholarly communication, ensuring high quality and credibility of published research. However, its institutionalization in the mid-20th century contrasts sharply with the 300-year history of academic journals. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (Business Process Model and Notation – BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.",

          "abstract": "As a generative AI chatbot which is based on large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT (4.o) offers numerous advantages and promising applications in applied linguistics (Alaqlobi et. al., 2024). However, there are still some uncertainties and concerns regarding its accuracy of responses to some complex questions related to linguistics (Qamar et al., 2024; Nuland, 2024; Dale, 2021). To address this gap, 5 participants as mediators from 5 countries in 3 continents were engaged in this study. Their responsibility was to initially copy a set of predefined questions (syntax, n=1 &amp; semantics, n=1) from the email sent to them and then input them into ChatGPT. The accuracy of responses was measured and checked through the assistance of two senior lecturers in Linguistics at a private college in Athens, Greece. In addition to the evaluation of the questions and responses, the two experts labeled the responses based on three criteria: accurate, partially accurate and inaccurate. The categorized responses were eventually analyzed by a software program. The findings indicated that ChatGPT demonstrated stronger performance in syntax-related questions compared to semantic-related questions. More specifically, its overall performance in responding to more analytical and subject specific questions such as those related to semantics was less than mediocre. This study adds to the persistent debate on the role of AI in linguistics and offers insights into the reliability and accuracy of responses by ChatGPT to complex questions.\n(This preprint was originally posted to OSF on 29 May, available at  https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/9h6z7_v1 \nLicense CC-By Attribution 4.0 International)",

          "authors": "Stefan Scholz",
          "abstract": "Protests can remain peaceful for long periods but then suddenly escalate into violent clashes, influencing the following events. Previous studies have focused on predicting whether protest events will take place or not, but they have not predicted the descriptive characteristics of these events. This gap might be attributed to a reliance on highly aggregated event data, which overlooks abrupt changes that can happen within individual days - such as a protester throwing a stone at a police officer. For this reason, this paper aims to forecast the escalation of protests on individual days and cities. To incorporate within-day dynamics into the prediction models, these dynamics are measured using protest images from social media. By applying computer vision techniques to these images, they can provide detailed estimates of the number of protesters, the tactics employed by the protesters, and the tactics opposed by law enforcement. This approach is demonstrated using a new dataset that includes 13 protest periods and 22,479 protest images. To validate the effectiveness of the new short-term indicators, the predictive performance of machine-learning models is compared against models that cannot draw on them. The results on the hold-out sample show that incorporating short-term dynamics improves the prediction of protest characteristics. While these improvements appear to be marginal, the approach reveals numerous opportunities for forecasting the escalation of protests, which has implications for their mitigation and prevention.",

          "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

          "abstract": "Political disinformation has become a central concern in both public discourse and scholarly inquiry, particularly following the electoral successes of right-wing populist movements in Western democracies since 2016. These events have been widely interpreted through the lens of manipulation, deviance, and disruption; all closely linked to the spread of false information, automated amplification, and foreign interference in digital communication environments. More recently, advances in Artificial Intelligence have added to anxieties about the growing sophistication and scale of disinformation campaigns. Collectively, these concerns are often framed under the concept of digital disinformation and viewed as posing existential threats to democratic systems. This entry provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the disinformation debate. It traces the definitional and conceptual challenges inherent in the term “disinformation,” highlights how digital infrastructures shape both the problem and its perceived urgency, and synthesizes empirical evidence on the actual reach, distribution, and impact of political disinformation. The article distinguishes between individual, collective, and discursive harms, while cautioning against inflated threat narratives that outpace empirical findings. Importantly, the entry addresses the risks of regulatory overreach and centralized control. Efforts to counter disinformation may themselves undermine democratic openness, suppress dissent, and weaken societies’ capacity for collective information processing. In response, the article outlines a research agenda that prioritizes conceptual clarity, empirical rigor, and systemic analysis over alarmism. It advocates for a shift away from overstreching framings of disinformation toward more precise and differentiated understandings of digital political communication and its challenges.",

I apply a computationally robust approach by using an LLM to categorize user comments into two dummy variables: misogynistic/non-misogynistic and aggressive/non-aggressive, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the responses.

This paper proposes Expression-Oriented Grammar as an alternative framework addressing fundamental pedagogical problems in English language education. The approach reconceptualizes grammar as an integrated system for expressing one's world through three interconnected domains: nominal grammar for describing things, verbal grammar for events and states, and adverbial grammar for situational contexts. Information arrangement and construction provide integrative mechanisms enabling effective resource utilization. Unlike fragmented school grammar, this framework offers coherent architectural perspective allowing learners to understand their position within the grammatical system. Case studies of BE/HAVE verbs and preposition \"ON\" demonstrate superior explanatory validity through unified semantic approaches based on cognitive linguistic principles. Expression-Oriented Grammar transforms grammar from obstacle to dynamic tool for creative expression, developing grammatical competence that enables meaningful communication rather than mere rule memorization.",

The revised index reveals a sharp rise in the 1850s and stability thereafter. New evidence on exchange and freight rates, terms of trade, regional commerce, and real wages shows that regional specialization in food production helped stabilize prices after the mid-century.",

This paper argues that traditional pedagogies (i.e., those anchored in formalist epistemologies) are structurally misaligned with the demands of a world saturated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, the paper introduces three critical frameworks: epistemic laundering, the epistemological vector space, and the cognitive ecology (a multimodal model of reasoning that maps how symbolic, conceptual, and contextual cognition interact in real-world learning). Together, these frameworks expose the incoherence of legacy educational models and offer a new basis for instructional design. From this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a pedagogical response that pairs epistemic awareness with technical fluency. It also outlines practical strategies to integrate GenAI responsibly into learning environments: RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and adaptive skill-gap training. Ultimately, GenAI is framed not as a threat, but as a mirror: reflecting the need to move beyond performance metrics toward adaptive, agentive, and epistemically aligned education.\n\nContact the author via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/tj-kalaitzidis/",

          "authors": "James P. Houghton; Duncan J Watts",
          "abstract": "Affective polarization in the United States—animosity between Republicans and Democrats—has escalated for decades, threatening the health of American democracy. Intergroup Contact Theory suggests that talking across party lines can reduce polarization, yet recent studies disagree on whether confronting or avoiding political disagreement is the more effective strategy for cross-partisan conversation. We address this debate using a large-scale “integrative” experiment that systematically varies levels of disagreement and political relevance across a diverse set of topics. While some discussion topics reduced affective polarization more than others, these differences were not explained by how “political” the topics were or how much participants disagreed. In fact, variation within topics far exceeds variation between them. Participant reports suggest that how individuals engage with one another—through listening, openness, and perspective-taking—may play a larger role in shaping conversational success than either the topic itself or the extent of disagreement.",

          "authors": "Freya McGregor; Ashley A. Dayer; Emily N. Sinkular",
          "abstract": "While being disabled is often considered a deficit that creates only problems, in reality every human has interests, values, skills, knowledge and external supports that can act as strengths when participating in recreation. Indeed, many disabled birders anecdotally report experiencing positives of birding with a disability, and the inherent modifiability of birding may allow disabled birders to experience different ways of engaging with this activity. We conducted a survey of disabled birders (n=147), then used inductive coding to analyze the responses to an open-ended question (n=106) about the positives of birding they experience. These responses included themes of slowing down, identifying more birds, noticing more details of birds, and feeling a sense of belonging in nature. This reconsidering of disability using a strengths-based approach creates opportunities for disabled birders and bird-related programming to focus on aspects of birding that may be more in line with disabled birders’ interests, experiences and strengths. It also creates a new avenue for nature organizations to engage with up to a quarter of the population who may feel excluded due to disability. This study contributes to the literature by exploring a rarely studied topic of disabled birders’ experiences using a strengths-based approach to studying disability in outdoor recreation.",

          "abstract": "Governments, corporations, and nonprofits worldwide spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on research and development intended to help address societal problems such as wealth inequity, public health, and climate change.  But not all kinds of research are equally suited to help address each problem, and much research is not scoped or oriented to achieve needed contributions.  Research strategy could benefit from a more granular and detailed understanding of the different contributions that research and development can make to the address of societal problems; of when each type of contribution is needed; and of how to identify research projects with the potential to achieve each contribution.  I outline three different scientific activities—problem description and attribution, option assessment and evaluation, and option identification and development—and the different contributions they can make to societal problems exhibiting value consensus and value dissensus.  I also provide two “catechisms” intended to help identify when each contribution is needed and what kinds of research are most likely to achieve each.  I deploy this framework to the problem of “scientific choice,” to which it is intended to contribute, and suggest fruitful lines of research on societal allocation of scientific and innovative effort.",

          "authors": "Ben Marwick",
          "abstract": "The status of archaeology as a science has been debated for decades and influences how we practice and teach archaeology. This study presents a novel bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields using a hard/soft framework. It also presents a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Reproducibility is a factor in the hardness/softness of a field because of its importance in establishing consensus. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A survey of reproducibility reviews for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

          "authors": "Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "The objective of this research synthesis is to collect and summarize the research literature on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland. This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how creativity and theological and missiological formation occur through congregational song within the Evangelical Christian Church of Minahasa (GMIM). It asks: how do social and theological systems influence the creation of congregational music in GMIM’s local context? The study uses a multidisciplinary approach to apply the Systems Model of Creativity and Optimal Distinctiveness Theory alongside constructivist grounded theory methods. Field data includes interviews, observations, and document analysis. The case study focuses on Nyanyikanlah Nyanyian Baru bagi Tuhan (NNBT), a locally produced hymnal illustrating the interaction between creative individuals, institutional structures, and theological and cultural norms. Findings show that congregational songs serve as tools for theological participation and collective identity formation. Creativity arises not in isolation but through social negotiation, balancing community belonging with distinct expression. These insights guide Christian communities seeking to cultivate creative ecosystems that shape faith, worship, and local identity.",

          "title": "How opinion variation among in-groups can skew perceptions of ideological polarization",
          "authors": "Peter Steiglechner; Paul E. Smaldino; Agostino Merico",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread perception that society has been polarizing into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarization), typically relying on variation among self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. Each individual, however, perceives the landscape of public opinion through a subjective lens or viewpoint that is dynamically shaped by their social environment. To account for this subjectivity in perceived polarization, we propose a model of dynamic perception that takes social identity into account. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive much more polarization than what an objective, neutral observer would perceive. We apply our model to empirical data on the opinions of German citizens about climate change and show that the effect of dynamic opinion perception on polarization can be nearly as substantial as actual opinion divergence. Moreover, we show that the direction of the effect need not be consistent over time, nor across different partisan groups. Our framework helps explain why people might sometimes experience levels of ideological polarization higher than those indicated by opinion surveys, independent of structural divisions, polarization-enforcing biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.",

          "authors": "Daniel Nettle; Coralie Chevallier; Kate Pickett; Matthew Thomas Johnson; Elliott Aidan Johnson; Melissa Bateson",
          "abstract": "There is some evidence that income volatility (fluctuations in income over time) negatively affects mental and physical health, independently of the level of income. Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.",

Tässä artikkelissa kuvaamme kattavien Tilastokeskuksen ja KELAn rekisteriaineistojen pohjalta perhevapaiden hyödyntämistä Suomessa yrittäjinä toimivilla isillä, jotka saivat ensimmäisen lapsen vuosina 2009–2017 (n = 7747). Tällä ajanjaksolla kykenemme tarkastelemaan myös, miten perhevapaauudistukset näkyvät yrittäjäisien perhevapaissa. Analyysi tehtiin kuvailevilla ja regressiopohjaisilla menetelmillä, Bayes-mallinnusta hyödyntäen. Tulosten mukaan vuoden 2013 perhevapaauudistus lisäsi yrittäjäisien perhevapaan käyttöä selvästi enemmän kuin palkansaajilla, liittyen todennäköisesti reformin tuomiin joustoihin. Perhevapaiden pitämisen taustalla olevat tekijät olivat pitkälti yhteneviä suhteessa palkansaajiin, mutta alivakuuttaminen näyttäisi vähentävän yrittäjäisien perhevapaille jäämistä, sillä se vaikuttaa negatiivisesti vanhempainpäivärahaan ja siten mahdollisesti perhevapaita koskeviin päätöksiin.",
