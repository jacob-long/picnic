          "authors": "Chelly Maes; Laura Vandenbosch",
          "abstract": "The current paper proposes an integrative theoretical model, starting from the notion that the current television landscape is characterized by heterogeneous content reflecting and reproducing our changing and conflicting societal discourses. Assumptions of prior entertainment television theories, such as those of Cultivation Theory, might fall short when it comes to disentangling the outcomes of heterogeneous content in diverse audiences. Thus, theory building is needed. This article therefore proposes the Heterogeneous Content Process model, integrating research on transportation into narratives and self-referencing. The model aims to induce an imperative shift in television effects research by urging researchers to step away from a so-called homogeneity approach and introducing a heterogeneity perspective. This way, a more nuanced understanding of television effects can be reached.",

          "abstract": "Since the University of Warwick’s news translation project in the mid-2000s, it has been a truism that journalists rarely translate whole articles but instead compose stories using texts in other languages as one source among others.

Increasingly, multilingual news agencies are using these tools to produce similar stories in multiple languages. One consequence has been that researchers can now compile parallel corpora of translated stories.

          "authors": "Daniel Courtney; Ana-Maria Bliuc; Yuki Kamide",
          "abstract": "Social media platforms are gamified to promote opinion sharing on any topic, irrespective of users’ subject knowledge. Potential effects of uninformed opinion-sharing have yet to be fully explored. We propose that one such effect is an opinion-overconfidence effect: an increase in topic-specific confidence after posting an opinion on that topic. Here, we present the first empirical evidence for the opinion-overconfidence, in the form of three pre-registered studies. Our findings support the existence of an effect, driven by the act of writing one’s opinion rather than of posting one’s opinion publicly. However, we do find linguistic differences between opinions written privately and those for a public audience, which could be interpreted as evidence for a message-release component to the effect. As overconfidence is predictive of extremist political ideologies and conspiracy theory belief, a population-wide increase in overconfidence due to social media use could have devastating effects on democratic societies.",

          "abstract": "While modern vision-language models are typically trained on millions of curated photographs, infants learn visual categories and the words that refer to them from very different training data. Here, we investigate which objects infants actually encounter in their everyday environments, and how often they encounter them. We use a large corpus of egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective (N = 868 hours, N = 31 participants), applying and validating a recent object detection model (YOLOE) to detect a set of categories that are frequently named in children’s early vocabulary. We find that infants’ visual experience is dominated by a small set of objects, with differences in individual children’s home environments driving variability. We also find that young children tend to learn words earlier for more frequently encountered categories. These results suggest that visual experience scaffolds young children’s early category and language learning and highlight that ecologically valid computational models of category learning must be able to accommodate skewed input distributions.",

          "authors": "Ciera Arnett; Tess M.S. Neal; Maya A. Irvin-Vitela",
          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

Recognizing these individual differences is critical for designing effective interventions that help youth apply their strengths to meet developmental demands. Objective: This study investigated the variability in three PYD-related strengths: prosocial behavior, social-emotional adjustment, and academic competence. Method: The sample consisted of 1,719 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, drawn from Wave 1 of the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II). Latent Profile Analysis was conducted using seven key indicators. Results: Four distinct profiles were identified: Social-Emotional-Behavioral Vulnerable (20%), Academically Struggling (16%), Academically Competent with Emotional-Behavioral Challenged (36%), and Well-Functioning (28%). Conclusion: These profiles reflect diverse patterns of strengths and challenges across PYD domains, highlighting the need for tailored support strategies—particularly those aimed at strengthening social-emotional competence.",

          "abstract": "The present study sought to adapt and validate the psychometric properties of the Disgust Scale Revised in Peruvian Adults. A non-probabilistic, snowball sample of 335 Peruvian adults was taken. For content validity, the clarity of the items were evaluated using Aiken's V. For internal structure validity, the fit indices of a series of confirmatory factor analyzes were evaluated for the one, two, and three-factor models. For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

          "authors": "Brian Kim; Kianté Fernandez; John Medaglia",
          "abstract": "As neuromodulation technologies become more common, individuals will increasingly face ethical decisions weighing uncertain risks against potential benefits. This study integrates behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and self-report assessments to examine how psychological traits affect the dynamics of neuroethical decision-making. Using a value-based choice framework inspired by models of economic choice, we presented participants with a hypothetical neuromodulation task that manipulated risk and benefit probabilities. We modeled the underlying cognitive processes using a temporally-sensitive variant of the diffusion decision model (DDM) to capture how individuals evaluate risks and benefits over time. We found that participants typically evaluated risks before benefits, and that individuals who considered risks first tended to deny neuromodulation. Importantly, the impact of evaluation order depended on risk and benefit sensitivity: participants with high benefit sensitivity endorsed neuromodulation when they considered benefits first but not when they considered risks first. Critically, model parameters were related to psychological traits. Higher risk propensity was linked to prioritizing benefits, while higher numeracy was associated with the greater weighing of risks. The personality trait of agreeableness also predicted a benefit-first evaluation, particularly relevant given that the task involved making neuromodulation decisions on behalf of others. In contrast, religion and spirituality measures showed little predictive value. By mapping latent cognitive parameters onto stable psychological traits and behavioral outcomes, our findings demonstrate the utility of computational modeling as an integrative tool in neuroethics. Our findings challenge static model of neuroethical decision-making, showing that the order in which individuals process risks and benefits play a critical role in shaping moral choices. These results suggest that neuroethical decisions are not simply the result of weighing values, but are dynamically constructed over time through interacting cognitive processes that are shaped by individual psychological traits.",

The results found adequate adjustments for the dark triad and moral foundations models separately and the integrated model, obtaining negative and significant relationships between the dark core and each of the moral foundations. It is concluded that there is a negative and statistically significant disattenuated correlation for each of the moral foundations and the general dark triad factor.",

          "abstract": "This practical guide provides an overview of different methods that can be used to assess the\nreliability of intensive longitudinal data. Intensive longitudinal data, which involve many\nconsecutive measurements of individual experiences, offer new perspectives into the within-\nperson variability of psychological constructs. Unfortunately, the reliability of these data is\noften neglected. Yet, assessing the reliability of intensive longitudinal data measurements is\ncrucial, as unreliable measurements can lead to inaccurate and imprecise results. Various\nmethods for assessing reliability of intensive longitudinal data have been recently developed.\nThese include methods based on well-known frameworks of test-retest reliability – suitable for\nsingle-item constructs – internal consistency methods, and parallel-test methods. However,\nmany of these may be unknown to empirical researchers, and each method for evaluating\nreliability has its own assumptions, interpretations, and practical considerations. In this\noverview we will discuss the available methods and these considerations. Moreover, we apply\nthe methods to an empirical dataset to highlight their similarities, differences, and context-\ndependent utility. We have implemented the available methods in R code that researchers can\nuse for their own data. Reliability assessment in ambulatory studies requires careful\nconsideration of both methodological assumptions and practical constraints. With this guide\nwe hope to aid researchers in this process.",

          "authors": "Derrick Michael Chelliah",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Heuristic Compression Model of Emotion (HCME), a novel framework that reconceptualizes emotions as cognitively efficient heuristic compressions—fast, layered approximations that prioritize action and simplify decision-making in complex environments. Synthesizing insights from bounded rationality, affective neuroscience, embodied cognition, and cultural learning, HCME proposes that emotional states emerge from an interplay of evolutionarily shaped instincts, somatic feedback, social encoding, and cognitive appraisal. The model provides an elegant explanation for emotional intensity, contradiction, and dysfunction as trade-offs inherent to lossy compression strategies. HCME offers a unified structure that translates modern emotion theory into a format directly applicable to affective AI architectures. Its cross-disciplinary scope makes it valuable to psychologists, philosophers of mind, and AI developers seeking scalable frameworks for emotion-informed systems.",

          "authors": "Jacob Louis Hoover Vigly; Peng Qian; Morgan Sonderegger; Timothy J. O'Donnell",
          "abstract": "As you read this text, word by word, you build an understanding of its meaning. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this ability?  An influential approach to answering this question comes from viewing comprehension as probabilistic inference over potential interpretations given linguistic input. Motivated within this perspective, a wealth of previous literature in psycholinguistics has focused on an important empirical relationship made precise by surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008a), the hypothesis that the effort required to process a word scales in its negative log probability, in context. However, the standard derivation of surprisal within the inference framework relies on a crucial assumption: that there is a deterministic relationship between the latent interpretations targeted by inference and the observable input. In this work we propose relaxing this assumption and formalize inference cost directly as the amount of change in probabilistic beliefs. This proposal forms a nontrivial generalization of standard surprisal theory, which provides a more direct connection to algorithmic theories, and naturally explains phenomena where unpredictable input requires little processing effort. To test this framework against surprisal theory, we conduct a self-paced reading time study targeting words with orthographic errors, a specific setting where our approach predicts substantially different patterns. We find that processing effort follows the predictions of belief-update rather than surprisal, in a noisy-channel model of comprehension as inference about intended words. These results demonstrate a clear case where surface surprisal cannot explain human processing cost, and provide further support for models of language comprehension as rational inference.",

          "authors": "Adrian Dominik Wojcik; Michał Główczewski; Taciano L Milfont",
          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,000). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower climate anxiety and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

For example, while adult word recognition is slowed down when the talker changes rapidly from trial to trial, this same talker variability can benefit learning non-native sound contrasts and production of novel words. However, all prior research has exposed participants to predetermined orders or variability conditions. Since research suggests that learners engage in active information seeking and it can benefit learning, here we ask whether adults seek out talker variability during word learning and how this variability influences performance. Active participants chose to hear words from 5 talkers on average, and hearing more talker variability for individual words predicted production and comprehension accuracy. Performance did not differ for participants in the Active and Passive conditions. Results are discussed in the context of high variability phonetic training and active learning theories.",

Brain MRI studies during adolescence, especially when paired with behavioral phenotypes and information about genetic risk factors, hold promise to advance early identification of mental health risk and spur the creation of targeted treatments to improve patient function, prognosis, and quality of life. However, prospective neuroimaging is costly and time-intensive, and individuals who participate may not be reflective of the general population. These challenges are compounded when examining adolescents, as many families lack the time, energy, or resources to participate in studies that utilize research-grade imaging. Repurposing clinical MRIs obviates many of the challenges of neuroimaging research. Here we describe the Brain-Behavior-Genetics study protocol. This protocol describes procedures used to recruit participants with recent high-quality clinical brain MRIs and prospectively acquire genetic and socio-behavioral data, resulting in a highly cost-efficient design that harnesses a vast and underutilized neuroscientific resource.",

          "abstract": "Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans have emerged as a useful imaging modality that has been explored in the literature for the last 40 years. To date, little work has focused on studying functional network connectivity utilizing SPECT data. In this study, we present a fully automated, spatially constrained ICA (sc-ICA) approach to evaluate functional network connectivity profiles in SPECT data using the NeuroMark pipeline. We evaluate both the expression of brain networks along with the whole brain SPECT connectome to evaluate the neuroimaging links to schizophrenia. 76 healthy controls, and 137 schizophrenia patient SPECT images were acquired from Amen Clinic sites along with diagnostic information. Each patient participated in two SPECT brain scans, acquired during rest and while performing a sustained attention task across twelve clinical imaging sites. Preprocessed SPECT data were analyzed via sc-ICA using 53 spatial priors derived from functional MRI data. 15 total components were found to show differences in various brain regions after correcting for multiple comparisons. FDR corrected resting SPECT results showed stronger covariation with CC-SC, CC-AUD, and DM-AUD networks. Many components showed reduced connectivity in patients. Additionally, relationships were associated with regressing loading parameters against age, sex, hearing voices and having disjointed thoughts. For the task data, connectivity between the cognitive control – default mode network was found in rest-task data after FDR correction. Task data covariation patterns largely remained the same as the rest data. In summary, we confirm existing work highlighting large scale network disruptions noted in prior schizophrenia fMRI studies.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, the mechanisms underlying the decline in cognitive performance with sustained effort remain unclear. In four experiments (total N ≈ 200), participants engaged in a sustained attention task comprising four blocks of 50 or 200 trials presented in a randomized order. We found that performance declined over both extremely brief and longer bouts of performance, as evidenced by a reduction in correct responses per second. Computational modeling revealed that this decline is driven by a decreasing allocation of cognitive resources to the task. These findings align with theoretical accounts positing that cognitive fatigue reflects adjustments in resource allocation, rather than resource depletion.",

          "abstract": "This study provides preliminary item selection and psychometric validation of the Ageism Towards Older Persons Scale, derived from the World Health Organization (WHO) Ageism Scale item pool, within a Colombian context. Given the multidimensional nature of ageism—encompassing stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination—and recognising limitations in existing measurement tools, especially regarding cross-cultural validity, this research addresses the urgent need for a reliable scale applicable globally and specifically within Spanish-speaking populations. Participants included 398 older adults aged between 60 and 95 from four Colombian cities (Barranquilla, Bogotá, Cartagena, and Ibagué). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor structure—stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination—with strong internal consistency reliability (ω ranging from .76 to .90). The sociodemographic analyses revealed varying patterns of ageism across education levels and social status groups. Furthermore, the nomological network analysis indicated meaningful associations between ageism perpetration and self-directed ageism, loneliness, and reduced wellbeing. The findings highlight the utility of this scale for future ageism research, intervention evaluation, and policy formulation aimed at mitigating ageism’s detrimental impacts on health, wellbeing, and societal participation among older populations.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "In certain problem solving contexts, people organize their domain through treating themselves as the perceptual and cognitive center of their world. They identify and solve a particular problem from their perspective as a particular agent, with a particular location, at a particular time, in a particular environment. When they do this, selecting and solving problems from their perspective as an agent, they engage in a distinctive kind of agent-centered problem solving. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a framework for modeling decision-making in uncertain environments unfolding over time, have effectively become a \"standard model\" of intelligent agency. Yet, as these models are ordinarily interpreted, they do not explicitly represent agent-centered problem solving. Accordingly, to model this type of problem solving, we begin by extending the standard POMDP framework to define “ePOMDPs.” This formalism models how an agent, once it centers itself on a particular self-and-world representation, plans and acts rationally from its own perspective. To capture the way that such agents choose which problem to solve, we build on our ePOMDPs to develop a “meta-ePOMDP” agent within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We implement our meta-ePOMDP agents for two different suites of “centering game” tasks which highlight different aspects of our theory. We find that our models explain signatures of agent-centered problem solving not captured by alternative models, in particular, the difficulty of navigating spaces of possible problem representations. We close by suggesting that our model could provide the beginnings of a computational framework for a person to have a self.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nNeuroanatomical studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reveal abnormally increased cortical neuron numbers in affected children, with cortical thickness and weight significantly exceeding normal controls, some accompanied by macrocephaly. Concurrently, severe damage to cortical neuronal axons and columnar structures has been observed, with pronounced cellular accumulation in specific regions and long-range connectivity dysfunction. Most children develop symptoms between 1.5-2 years of age, yet the pathological mechanisms remain unclear.\nMammalian hippocampi exhibit sustained neurogenesis peaks during the first postnatal months, with hippocampal neuronal survival significantly increasing in response to learning tasks and information stimulation. The intensity of learning tasks and information stimulation that human infants receive far exceeds conditions in animal experiments. Research demonstrates large-scale neuronal migration phenomena in human infant cortex, with the cortex potentially containing cells from diverse origins.\nWe propose the hippocampal neuronal overflow hypothesis: massive surviving neurons within the infant hippocampus overcome hippocampal capacity limitations and, during critical time windows, overflow from the hippocampus to white matter, migrating into cortical layers to form synaptic connections and construct unique network circuits related to human cognition, language, and memory functions.\nWe propose that ASD etiology involves children receiving excessive learning tasks and information stimulation during the hippocampal neurogenesis peak period, leading to excessive neuronal overflow and migration into the cortex. During intensive synapse formation processes, migrating neurons physically disrupt existing cortical axonal structures, causing cortical functional damage manifested as social deficits, communication impairments, and stereotypical behaviors.\nBased on extensive literature analysis, this study proposes that some ASD cases may result from this acquired neurodevelopmental abnormality mechanism, providing a new theoretical framework for ASD etiology research.",

However, this expansion has also brought significant challenges, including gaming toxicity, as well as, addiction, and social isolation, which have far-reaching psychological and societal implications. Despite the widespread adoption of moderation tools, such as reporting and banning, these reactive approaches fail to address the underlying causes of toxic behavior or foster long-term behavioral change.\nThis whitepaper reviews the historical, psychological, and societal factors that contribute to toxicity in gaming environments, tracing the industry's growth and the emergence of harmful behaviors within digital communities. By examining current research and industry trends, we identify the limitations of existing moderation strategies and the need for proactive, AI-driven interventions that promote healthier online interactions.\nIn response to these challenges, this paper introduces Felixa, an AI-powered behavior analytics platform designed to detect, assess, monitor, and modify toxic interactions in real time. This whitepaper provides key insights for industry stakeholders, outlining a new paradigm in online gaming governance—one that prioritizes prevention over punishment and promotes sustainable, psychologically safe gaming environments. Felixa integrates behavioral psychology, neuroscience, and advanced data analytics to guide players toward constructive and respectful communication. By leveraging real-time analytics and proactive intervention strategies, Felixa helps game developers, community managers, and policymakers create safer, more inclusive gaming spaces that enhance player well-being and engagement.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine the empirical research on Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy (VRET) for adult anxiety-related disorders, using commercially available head-mounted displays.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive database search resulted in 1097 identified publications. Publications were excluded if anxiety was not a measured outcome or if exposure was paired with other techniques, such as relaxation techniques or other therapies, in a way that prevented evaluation of exposure as a stand-alone component. Publications were also excluded if the virtual reality was delivered through means other than head-mounted displays. The final review for data synthesis included 30 studies.\n\nResults: Of the 30 reviewed studies, 11 were on phobias, 4 were on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 13 were on public speaking anxiety and social anxiety, and 2 were on other forms of anxiety (i.e., social physique anxiety and MRI anxiety). VRET consistently reduced anxiety symptoms, with outcomes comparable to traditional exposure therapy. High levels of engagement and acceptability were observed. However, methodological inconsistencies and small sample sizes limit conclusions.\n\nConclusions: Findings suggest that VRET using modern commercially available head-mounted displays is an effective and scalable intervention for anxiety-related disorders. The technology enhances accessibility, personalization, and engagement, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods. However, variability in study quality underscores the need for larger, more rigorous trials to assess long-term efficacy and optimize implementation.",

Study 1 included an adult lifespan sample (N=3,847). Study 2 (pre-registered; https://osf.io/zv2ax/) included 217 adults whose autobiographical memories were also assessed with a traditional lab-based structured interview. Contrary to lab-based findings commonly reported in the literature, older adults across both studies reported more episodic specificity in their everyday autobiographical thoughts than younger adults, as well as shifts toward positive and social focus rather than on the self. Linguistic analyses validated self-report data, revealing greater concreteness and perceptual detail with increasing age.

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the distinct experiences of older adults in their cities and communities, as well as the extent to which these experiences are linked to their perceptions of ageism.\nUsing a sample of 398 older adults from four cities in Colombia, a latent profile analysis was conducted via the manual three-step method, incorporating demographic covariates and distal outcomes to identify distinct AFCC profiles among older adults. Three AFCC profiles emerged from the analysis: “positive with respect and inclusion gaps” (59.5%), “neutral with concerns” (31.4%), and “low-level with social inclusion resilience” (9.1%). Older adults with disabilities had a higher probability of belonging to the “neutral with concerns” group, while age, gender, and subjective social status showed no significant association with profile membership. In addition, ageism experiences differed among the three profiles, as older adults with lower AFCC scores reported higher levels of ageism. The results also suggested a potential method effect associated with negative items in the AFCC. In sum, our findings highlight the need to understand the distinct patterns in how older adults perceive their cities and communities, as well as identify those who may be “at risk” in specific domains.",

          "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in cognitive neuroscience is developing diagnostic tools for Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Detecting dynamical connectivity brain states seems promising, specifically those linked to transient moments of enhanced cognitive states in patients. A growing body of evidence indicates that fMRI brain states properties are strongly modulated by the level of consciousness , as theoretically predicted by whole brain modeling. fMRI-based brain states, however, have very limited practical application due to methodological constraints. In this work we defined EEG-based brain states and explored their potential as a bedside, real-time tool to detect transient windows of enhanced brain states. We analysed data from 237 individual patients with chronic and acute DoCs -100 Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS), 96 Minimally Conscious State (MCS) and 41 acute- and 101 healthy controls obtained in three independent research centers (Fudan hospital in Shanghai, Pitié Salpêtrière in Paris and Purpan hospital in Toulouse). We determined five EEG functional connectivity brain states, and show that their probability of occurrence is strongly related to the level of consciousness. Distinctively, high entropy brain states are exclusively found in healthy subjects, while low-entropy brain states increase their probability with DoC’s severity, spanning from acute unarousable comatose state, to more chronic DoC’s patients, who are awake but show fluctuating (MCS) or absent awareness (VS). Furthermore, the brain state probability distribution of each individual subject —and even the presence of certain key brain states— significantly vary with the patients’ outcome. We also tested whether our procedure has an actual potential for real-time, bedside brain state detection, and proved that we can reliably estimate the concurrent brain state of a patient in real time, paving the way for a broad application of this tool for DoC patients’ diagnosis, follow-up, and neuroprognostication.",

          "authors": "James Christopher Wiley",
          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Furthermore, actual 2020 suicide rates display a negative disruption at the same time as the 2020 death rate positive disruption, and this suicide rate disruption is mimicked by our model predictions. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Overall analysis suggests that elevated death rates during colder seasons are driven by increased communicable disease transmission relative to warmer seasons, resulting in suppressed suicide rates.",

          "authors": "David Harris; Tom Arthur",
          "abstract": "Adaptive sensorimotor behaviour requires individuals to flexibly update their beliefs in response to changes in environmental context. Theories of predictive processing propose that such flexibility arises from hierarchical inference, where higher-level beliefs about hidden states shape lower-level perceptual and motor predictions. Here, we test whether behaviour in a naturalistic interception task is better explained by continuous belief updating or by more abrupt shifts driven by state inference, consistent with hierarchical Bayesian learning. Twenty-three participants completed 160 trials of a VR-based interceptive task across two sessions. Participants attempted to return balls with varying bounciness, probabilistically cued by ball colour and a contextual cue (court wall colour) that reversed periodically. Gaze pitch angle prior to bounce was used as an index of perceptual inference and modelled using Bayesian and reinforcement learning frameworks. Bayesian models (the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter) were found to outperform associative learning models in predicting participant behaviour. However, although a contextual state-inference model better anticipated the true structure of the task, participants’ gaze behaviour was better explained by continuous belief updating rather than discrete state switching. Overall, our findings suggest that while participants updated beliefs in a Bayesian manner, their behaviour fell short of normative optimality, possibly due to limits on causal inference and model construction. Rather than inferring the latent structure of the environment, participants relied on simpler, continuous updating, highlighting how probabilistic reasoning operates under bounded resources. This finding may reflect the specific demands of dynamic sensorimotor control, where the brain prioritises flexible, real-time updating over explicit structural inference to support fluid, adaptive action.",

This scale is designed to capture the major dimensions of ageism recognised within contemporary theory (i.e., stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination) and to be suitable for individuals of ranging from adolescence up and from diverse cultural backgrounds. However, thus far the scale has primarily been used only in European contexts, leaving a need to assess its performance in more diverse country contexts. This study provides the first translation of the WHO-Ageism-E15 into Spanish using gold standard methods and assesses the validity and reliability of its scores in older populations in four Colombian cities. Overall, the WHO-Ageism-E15 demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties in the Colombian context. Older adults in Colombia reported experiencing moderate levels of ageism, with institutional-directed ageism being the most prominent. Furthermore, we found that self-directed and interpersonal-directed ageism were associated with poorer health and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes (i.e., overall ageism experiences were linked to higher levels of loneliness, lower well-being, and poorer physical and psychological health). The results also suggested that income and education levels were linked to experiences of self-directed and interpersonal-directed ageism.",

          "abstract": "In two pre-registered experiments (exp.1: n=44; exp.2: n=46), we investigated whether emotional inner speech has an effect on heart rate. Participants were asked to engage in sessions of either: positive inner speech, negative inner speech, or inner counting while their heart rate was monitored. Participants were lying on a bed and asked to remain still during the inner speech trials. Motion tracking was applied to control for body movement. Median heart rate across each inner speech session was analyzed and a significant difference was found between emotional inner speech and inner counting across both experiments. No difference between positive and negative inner speech was observed. Post-hoc analyses investigated the relationship between movement and heart rate increases and found an effect with a peak lag of approximately 14 seconds. Removing these effects did not change the effect that emotional inner speech had on heart rate. In line with previous literature, additional analyses showed that heart rate and respiration rate were linked. Including respiration rate as a variable in regression analyses did not alter the effect of emotion. The effect of emotional inner speech thus seems robust. No correlations between heart rate effects and measures of depression and rumination were observed.",

          "abstract": "Prior research shows that humans adjust their learning rate based on environmental volatility. This adaptation may be reduced in individuals with high levels of anxious-depression, but past studies have been cross-sectional, making it unclear whether this adaptation is responsive to treatment. In the Precision in Psychiatry study, we examined changes in learning rate adaptation following four weeks of treatment in two patient groups receiving either internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT; n=677) or antidepressants (n=95), compared to a group of healthy participants (n=95). All groups showed increased learning rates in volatile environments at baseline, but against our prediction, learning rate adaptation was not cross-sectionally associated with individual differences in anxious-depression. There was also no evidence that learning rate adaptation changed post-treatment, despite symptom improvements. However, in the antidepressant group, symptom reductions correlated with learning rate adaptation. This finding should be interpreted cautiously due to reliability concerns. Overall, our results suggest that associations between learning rate adaptation and anxious-depression are likely modest, may not be present in treatment-seeking adults, and do not improve following treatment.",

Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories.

Across three preregistered experimental studies (N = 1214) with pre-service and in-service teachers in France, we investigated whether students with SEN receiving reduced-exercise accommodations were systematically devalued in grades and competence judgments, and whether this devaluation—a backlash effect—was moderated by fairness perceptions. In Studies 1 and 2, students with SEN received lower grades and competence ratings than non-SEN peers, regardless of student gender or relative performance. Study 3 introduced a cross-gender comparison, testing whether female students with SEN faced heightened backlash compared to male non-SEN peers. A consistent backlash effect emerged across studies, unaffected by gender contrast. Notably, fairness perceptions consistently mitigated this bias. These findings highlight persistent SEN-related backlash and suggest that fairness-focused interventions may foster more inclusive evaluations.",

We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process. Recognition was driven by emotional strength, especially for unpleasant odors, and the richness of verbal descriptions. Associative memory followed a U-shaped relationship with familiarity and was strongly influenced by semantic distinctiveness – how uniquely each odor was described. Together, these findings reveal that odor memorability depends not only on its emotional salience, but also on how specifically it is conceptualized and how familiar we are with it.",

          "abstract": "Studies have established that dimensions of temperament and language development are associated in childhood. Insofar, however, longitudinal studies from infancy into toddlerhood accounting for all temperament dimensions and covering preverbal communication in addition to emerging verbal skills are scarce. Existing findings are inconclusive.\nThe current study is an extension of our previous study (N = 91) on a large cohort sample (N = 1200 and 1039 depending on analysis). Temperament (positive emotionality, negative emotionality and emerging self-regulation) was assessed at 6 and 12 months of age and gesturing and receptive vocabulary at 14 months. As an extension to the previous study, expressive vocabulary and sentence complexity in toddlerhood, at 30 months, were also assessed. All assessments utilized parent reports.\nThe temperament traits of positive emotionality and self-regulation positively predicted all communicative skills except sentence complexity. Positive emotionality accounted for 10-11% of the variance in gesturing, 4-5% in receptive vocabulary and 1-3% in expressive vocabulary. Self-regulation accounted for 4-6% of the variance in gesturing, 2-3% in receptive vocabulary and 0-1% in expressive vocabulary.\nResults aligned with the findings of our prior study but also highlighted weak longitudinal positive associations between positive emotionality and self-regulation and gesturing and vocabulary. However, associations were notably stronger with gesturing compared to verbal skills, suggesting temperament and preverbal communication are intertwined on a higher level compared to verbal skills. Longitudinal weakening of associations suggests the role of infant temperament is replaced by other factors influencing language development moving into toddlerhood.",

However, emotional experience is multidimensional and emotional similarity will change over time and situations. Moreover, strangers that show little initial similarity might become more similar when experiencing similar situations (experiential effect), raising the question whether being in a relationship actually adds similarity (couple effect) on top of these experiential factors. Here we investigate the contribution of experiential versus couple effects in partner’s emotional similarity, while embracing the multidimensional nature of emotional experience by assessing momentary emotional profile similarity scores. In two independent datasets, we compared romantic partners to simulated strangers and detected which experiential factors predict momentary similarity scores using regression trees. Results reveal that romantic partners are indeed more emotionally similar than simulated strangers, even when accounting for the identified experiential factors, amongst others, valence and contact with partner.",

Context conditioning induces anxiety to unpredictable threats rather than fear of specific stimuli and serves as a model for anxiety disorders. Importantly, contexts have been mostly studied in terms of spatial properties (e.g. a room), while social contexts seem most relevant for many anxiety disorders. Consequently, the present study investigated context conditioning in a social context using Virtual Reality. Overall 40 participants underwent habituation, acquisition, and extinctions phase in the same virtual room. Two contexts were operationalized as co-presence of particular virtual agents. An aversive US was only presented during one agent’ co-presence (CTX+) but not the other’s (CTX-). Ratings and physiological data showed increased anxious arousal during CTX+ relative to CTX- for acquisition. Concurrent measurement of neural oscillations via EEG allowed to investigate underlying processes. Power in the parietal alpha and frontal beta band was reduced during CTX+ compared to CTX- for acquisition suggesting increased attentional and sensory-motor processing. These findings show successful context conditioning in social contexts which is accompanied by an increase in attention and motor preparation. Social context conditioning can serve as an effective model to study mechanisms of anxiety and anxiety disorders in humans.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments are extensively used across multiple disciplines to make inferences about preferences over multi-attribute alternatives. Much previous research has analyzed the importance of attributes at the aggregate level. Here, we focus on understanding individual-level behavior and, specifically, on strategy use. We present a novel Bayesian cognitive model that infers individuals' strategy use by performing attribute weight inference (how important an attribute is), attribute level inference (which value of the attribute is favored), and latent-mixture inference to classify strategy use. We then validate and apply our model to two conjoint experiments (total N = 3762) focusing on three political domains (attitudes towards immigrants, political candidates, and climate policy). From a substantive standpoint, we find that the majority of subjects use heuristic strategies in all conditions and that approximately 60% of subjects use different strategies depending on the political domain. Our model additionally highlights how aggregate-level inference on the weight of an attribute can be meaningfully decomposed by individual differences in strategy use and preferences over attributes. Specifically, we demonstrate clear multimodality in the distribution of attribute weights across individuals for all political domains and conditions, raising questions about how to appropriately contextualize information that is aggregated at the population level. In addition, our experiments include a set of experimental design manipulations that increase different dimensions of complexity in the conjoint experiments and show their impact on strategy use. This work has important implications for understanding how to interpret and generalize results from conjoint experiments, in addition to contributing to the strategy modeling literature. Further, we highlight how researchers can apply our model to their own conjoint experiments for both applied and methodological research aims.",

          "abstract": "Any medical innovation must first prove its benefits with reliable evidence from clinical trials. Evidence is commonly expressed using two metrics, summarizing treatment benefits based on either absolute risk reductions (ARRs) or relative risk reductions (RRRs). Both metrics are derived from the same data, but they implement conceptually distinct ideas. Here, we analyze these risk reductions measures from a causal modeling perspective. First, we show that ARR is equivalent to ΔP, while RRR is equivalent to causal power, thus clarifying the implicit causal assumptions. Second, we show how this formal equivalence establishes a relationship with causal Bayes nets theory, offering a basis for incorporating risk reduction metrics into a computational modeling framework. Leveraging these analyses, we demonstrate that under dynamically varying baseline risks, ARRs and RRRs lead to strongly diverging predictions. Specifically, the inherent assumption of a linear parameterization of the underlying causal graph can lead to incorrect conclusions when generalizing treatment benefits (e.g, predicting the effect of a vaccine in new populations with different baseline risks). Our analyses highlight the shared principles underlying risk reduction metrics and measures of causal strength, emphasizing the potential for explicating causal structure and inference in medical research.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

This study evaluated. DTW’s ability to infer mimicry by presenting participants with both live model performances and prerecorded videos of dynamic facial expressions. Simultaneous dyadic frontal facial videos of participants and models were acquired, and action unit (AU) time series were analyzed using Py-Feat, with DTW applied to estimate dyadic temporal pattern similarity. A principal component analysis of the models’ raw AU time series identified the highest-weighted AUs. For AU12 (lip corner puller) and AU06 (cheek raiser), temporal pattern distances were smaller in the positive-live condition than in the positive-video condition, while AU15 (lip corner depressor) exhibited a trend toward smaller distances in the negative-live than in the negative-video condition. These findings suggested that live interactions, within matching emotional conditions, enhanced dyadic behavioral alignment. However, all three AUs exhibited smaller distances when the corresponding emotion was inactive, raising the concern that reduced DTW distances could result from either mimicry or mutual inaction. Researchers should carefully consider design and theoretical frameworks when applying DTW in mimicry studies.",

Contrasting accumulation-model parameters across experimental design cells can be a powerful way to test theories of the latent cognitive processes underlying choice and RT. For example, the prospective memory (PM) decision control model instantiated a novel cognitive-control theory of PM decisions and quantitatively compared it to existing theories. This tutorial demonstrates how to embed such psychological theories in EAM parameters using the R package EMC2, which simplifies model programming and increases computational efficiency beyond previous approaches. We first show how a broad class of cognitive models can be expressed by mapping EAM parameters to experimental conditions using an augmented linear model language. We then walk through two examples of how to specify, fit and evaluate such models.  The first is a standard application of the PM decision control model. The second showcases how the model can be extended to address a more complex paradigm where an automated decision aid provides advice about choices. We conclude by discussing how this approach can be applied more broadly.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the Retrieving Effectively from Memory model, a prominent computational model of episodic memory, to the domain of categorization. Our modeling approach begins with the assumption that same-category items share common features representing defining characteristics of their category, and that they are encoded in the same category list context. We then assumed that category judgments occur based on the comparison of an item’s averaged similarity to the exemplars from each category. We use this model to explore how the learning modes of observation and classification might influence category learning and consider several strategies that may emerge during the classification mode. Model simulation results indicate that different strategies which people might adopt during classification can either confer an advantage or pose a disadvantage in category learning. These findings suggest potential avenues for future research, particularly in exploring diverse strategies employed during learning.\n\nThis paper was submitted to the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society and appears in the conference proceedings.",

          "authors": "Brandon McMurtrie; Matt N Williams; Ross Tane Hebden; Anja Roemer; Michael Philipp",
          "abstract": "Affective polarization—antipathy towards members of one’s political outgroup—may pose challenges to social cohesion and personal well-being. Prior studies have suggested that one’s affective polarization may cause intrapersonal harm as well as interpersonal harm. It has been associated with reduced social support, increased stress, and worse physical health. This pre-registered study investigated the intrapersonal harm of affective polarization using a six-wave longitudinal survey (N = 470). Affective polarization, social support, perceived stress, and self-rated health were measured fortnightly for three months preceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were employed to investigate the within-person effects of affective polarization on these indictors of wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the hypothesised cross-lagged effects were significant, suggesting that changes in affective polarization did not predict changes in social support, stress, or health. However, cross-sectional analyses did reflect past findings, showing that higher levels of affective polarization were associated with lower social support, greater stress, and worse health. We additionally found evidence for perceived stress causing moderate increases in affective polarization. Stable differences by political orientation were also observed in our sample, with liberals reporting higher affective polarization and stress, lower social support, and worse health. Despite the lack of significant effects, potentially due to limitations such as sample size and measurement constraints, our findings underscore the importance of further investigations with appropriate robust designs to clarify the relationship between affective polarization and well-being. These results challenge the assumption that affective polarization directly drives declines in well-being.",

          "abstract": "This article is designed to concisely teach undergraduate and new graduate students lessons in reading and writing I have learned in my past two decades as a university student, teacher, and researcher (including through publishing, retracting, correcting, and republishing articles in outlets with varying levels of “impact” and publication fees). Don’t just start at the beginning of an academic article/book and try to read straight to the end! Instead, I recommend starting by reading the title(s)/author(s) and abstract(s), then the figures, reading the Discussion section, and skimming/spot-checking the references, peer reviews, and data (e.g., spreadsheets, audiovisual stimuli, surveys), if available. Only once you have done this and evaluated whether it seems worth your time do I recommend deciding whether to read every word of some/all sections/chapters (and any accompanying supplementary material) or digging deeper into reanalysing/replicating the data. I recommend writing accordingly so that most of your key information will be conveyed even if your reader only gets through your title, abstract, and figures. I discuss various strategies to improve your own academic reading/writing and the broader culture of academia, from practical (e.g., formatting and tracking references and citations using Zotero and Google Scholar, asking constructive questions rather than self-promoting comments, publishing using Peer Community In Registered Reports, using the “sandwich thesis” model for PhD dissertations) to philosophical (e.g., ethical issues in authorship, citation, AI, publishing, and funding). I explain the intended goals of academic research (to create and distribute valuable new knowledge) and perverse incentives that lead us astray from these goals (e.g., chasing prestige and funding). I conclude by contemplating if and how we should dismantle the current extortionary academic-industrial complex and re-design it to align with its intended goals.",

          "abstract": "Children’s vocabularies reflect the dynamic worlds they inhabit, yet traditional models of language acquisition treat environmental influences as static. This study reveals how seasonal variations in weather systematically influence early vocabulary composition. Three studies involving 16–30 months old monolinguals and bilinguals (total N = 1294), examine how climate conditions affect word learning using parent-reported vocabulary checklists. Children in cold-weather regions (Wisconsin, Montreal) produced significantly more winter-related words compared to peers in milder climates (Texas, Florida), while seasonal analyses showed that within populations, winter word acquisition and knowledge peaked in the coldest months and declined during the warmest months. This pattern was most pronounced in older children, and in bilinguals with greater language exposure. Our research shows how children’s language systems adapt to environmental variations, advancing our understanding of language acquisition as a responsive process shaped by continuous interactions between cognitive development, language exposure, and the changing environmental landscape children navigate.",

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms of consciousness remain elusive. Previous studies on both human and\nnon-human animals, through manipulation of level of conscious arousal, have reported that\nspecific time-series features correlate with level of consciousness, such as spectral power in\ncertain frequency bands. However, such features often lack principled, theoretical\njustifications as to why they should be related with level of consciousness. This raises two\nsignificant issues: firstly, many other types of times-series features which could also reflect\nconscious level have been ignored due to researcher biases towards specific analyses; and\nsecondly, it is unclear how to interpret identified features to understand the neural activity\nunderlying consciousness, especially when they are identified from recordings which\nsummate activity across large areas such as electroencephalographic recordings. To address\nthe first concern, here we propose a new approach: in the absence of any theoretical priors,\nwe should be maximally agnostic and treat as many known features as feasible as equally\npromising candidates. To apply this approach we use highly comparative time-series analysis\n(hctsa), a toolbox which provides over 7,700 different univariate time-series features\noriginating from different research fields. To address the second issue, we employ hctsa to\nhigh-quality neural recordings from a relatively simple brain, the fly brain (Drosophila\nmelanogaster), extracting features from local field potentials during wakefulness, general\nanesthesia and sleep. At Stage 1 of this registered report, we constructed a classifier for each\nfeature, for discriminating wakefulness and anesthesia in a discovery group of flies (N = 13).\nAt Stage 2, we assessed their performances on four independent groups of evaluation flies,\nfrom which recordings were made during anesthesia and sleep, and which were originally\nblinded to the data analysis team (N = 49). We found only 47 time-series features, applied to\nrecordings obtained from the center of the fly brain, to also significantly classify wake from\nanesthesia or sleep in all 4 of these evaluation datasets. Most of these were related to\nautocorrelation, and they indicated that signals during wakefulness remained correlated to\ntheir past for a longer timescale than during anesthesia and sleep. Meanwhile, time-series\nfeatures related to well-known potential markers of consciousness, such as those related to\ncomplexity or spectral power, failed to generalize across all the flies. However, many of these\ncomplexity and spectral features have a consistent direction of effect due to anesthesia or\nsleep across flies, suggesting that even slight variations in experiment setup can reduce\ngeneralizability of classifiers. These results caution the current state of frequent discoveries\nof new potential consciousness markers, which may not generalize across datasets, and point\nto autocorrelation as a class of dynamical properties which does.",

Objective: To understand how Chinese adolescents’ independent self-construal, interdependent self-construal and achievement motivation affect their subjective wellbeing. Method: We obtained survey data on independent and interdependent self-construal, social-oriented and individual-oriented achievement motivation, as well as subjective well-being from 438 tenth graders in a Chinese high school. Results: Path analysis showed that interdependent self-construal had a direct impact on subjective well-being, while individual-oriented motivation completely mediated the link between independent self-construal and subjective well-being. Conclusion: Both independent and interdependent self-construal positively contributed to Chinese adolescents' subjective wellbeing. However, interdependent self-construal directly boosted subjective well-being, while independent self-construal did so indirectly via individual-oriented motivation.",

Two well-documented similarity-attraction effects are in-group favoritism (i.e., preference for in-groups over out-groups) and ideological favoritism (i.e., preference for the groups whose ideologies align [vs. conflict] with one’s own beliefs). There is debate about whether ideological favoritism is stronger among conservatives, progressives, or neither, and research has yet to explore ideological asymmetry in in-group favoritism. Across five studies (Ntotal = 6,631), we confirmed a double dissociation: ideological favoritism was stronger among U.S. progressives, whereas in-group favoritism was stronger among U.S. conservatives. This pattern was robust across different samples of perceivers and groups and across various measures of aligned ideological beliefs, shared group membership, and attitudes toward the groups (i.e., judgments and feelings). We discuss potential explanations for the double dissociation. Certain psychological differences between conservatives and progressives (e.g., community orientation and cosmopolitanism) may direct their attention to different markers of allegiance.",

          "abstract": "Non-Ordinary experiences (NOEs), such as feelings of unity with God, hearing voices, and sensing the presence of deceased persons, are prevalent in the general population. They may be life-transforming but are also associated with pathological conditions such as psychosis and dissociation. However, little is known about how cultural appraisals and religious practices shape their phenomenology and psychological impact in non-clinical populations. For the most part, their socio-cognitive and emotional features remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was threefold. Firstly, to investigate the phenomenological characteristics and types of NOEs reported by self-defined spirit mediums from a spiritualist home circle in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Secondly, to explore the role of social context in interpreting and shaping NOEs. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the phenomenological similarities and distinctions of experiences reported in spiritualist contexts with psychopathological constructs such as dissociative and psychotic symptoms. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining ethnographic observations of spiritualist séances, thematic content analysis of reports of séance-related NOEs, and standardized scales assessing dissociation, absorption, psychotic symptoms, symptoms of common mental disorders, and satisfaction with life. We analyzed a total of 151 independent reports of NOEs provided by a group of mediumship practitioners participating in regular séances over a period of one year and five months. The reports tapped a variety of experiences including intense emotional states (e.g., happiness, gratitude), alterations in consciousness (e.g., feelings of spacing out), spontaneous mental imagery (e.g., visions of the spiritual world), sensory-perceptual experiences (e.g., hearing voices or other unusual sounds), somatic manifestations (e.g., body tremors), and unusual experiences involving the séance table (e.g., vibrations). The experiences reported were episodic, controllable, and restricted to the séances. Overall, they were described as pleasant or innocuous. Mediums generally reported perceiving their lives as satisfying and meaningful and scored similarly to the general population on items indicative of common mental disorders. Given their cultural impact and predominantly positive effects, these experiences bear implications for differential diagnosis, and the role of cultural and religious factors in mental health, wellbeing, and cognition. The spiritualist séance provide a natural environment for observational and experimental studies of intentionally induced non-ordinary states of consciousness.\nKeywords: non-ordinary experiences, dissociative experiences, psychotic experiences, psychosis continuum, spirit mediumship, religious rituals, spirituality",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag",
          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "abstract": "Conflict tasks often yield smaller mean congruency effects when relevant (target) and irrelevant (distractor) information is mostly incongruent rather than mostly congruent. While this proportion congruency effect may reflect proactive control adaptation, only a few previous studies have provided convincing evidence for proactive control adaptation when ruling out contingency learning and reactive (item-specific) control adaptation. In this study, we present further evidence for proactive control adaptation (as reflected in proportion congruency effects and asymmetrical list-shifting effects in contingency-free transfer items) across three experiments (each N = 100 participants) using manual counting Stroop tasks (Experiment 1: number words as distractors; Experiment 2: Arabic numerals as distractors; Experiment 3: number words and Arabic numerals as inducer and transfer items, or vice versa). To better understand the processes underlying proactive control adaptation, we conducted fine-grained distributional analyses (delta functions) and model-based analyses (diffusion model for conflict tasks). These analyses suggest that proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression rather than in the timing of distractor suppression, the strength of target amplification, or response caution. Additional distributional and diffusion model re-analyses of the data by Spinelli and Lupker (2023, Experiments 1–3) revealed a similar pattern in vocal color Stroop tasks. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence for proactive control adaptation in manual counting Stroop tasks, and indicates that proactive control adaptation mainly reflects adjustments in the strength of distractor suppression in both manual and vocal Stroop tasks.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conformity to traditional masculinity ideologies (TMIs) has consistently been linked to increased psychopathology. However, little is known about the association with formal psychiatric diagnoses.\nMethod: Cross-sectional data from a randomized controlled trial were analyzed. A total of 317 men (mean age = 31.8, SD = 7.2) completed an online questionnaire assessing conformity to TMIs and underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) in person. Participants had been pre-screened for depressive symptoms as part of the larger trial. Inclusion criteria were male sex and gender, age between 25 and 50 years, sufficient German-language skills, and no current or past psychopharmacological or psychological treatment.\nResults: Overall, 200 participants (64.7%) met the criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses revealed that higher conformity to TMIs was associated with increased odds of receiving any psychiatric diagnosis (OR=1.04, 95% CI [1.02, 1.05]), particularly depressive disorders (OR=1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.04]) and substance-related and addictive disorders (OR=1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.05]). No significant associations were found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or anxiety disorders. Exploratory analyses suggested a significant association between conformity to TMIs and personality disorders, and an initially significant association with sleep-wake disorders that did not survive correction for multiple testing.\nConclusion: Higher conformity to TMIs is associated with an increased risk of fulfilling the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, especially depressive and substance-related disorders. As such, the study highlights the clinical relevance of including TMIs in the assessment and treatment of men suffering from mental disorders.",

This study examined whether conservation of momentum influences sensorimotor planning and whether it is perceptually instantiated. We developed a hybrid virtual reality/real-object paradigm in which participants (N=7) observed collisions between visually identical objects that varied only in apparent mass ratios and coefficients of restitution before lifting them. Results revealed that anticipatory forces scaled with inferred mass from collision kinematics, and explicit weight judgments demonstrated a dynamic weight illusion—participants perceived the motor object as heavier when the target object’s inferred mass increased. These findings suggest that conservation of momentum is integrated into both motor planning and perceptual representations, extending our understanding of intuitive physics by demonstrating that the visual system incorporates relational dynamics into sensorimotor processing.",

          "authors": "Augustine Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Traditional random utility models assume stable preferences in preferential decision-making. However, behavioural decision theory suggests that preferences can be dynamic. Here, we investigated preference change using extended Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE). This research examines the impact of emphasis instructions on preference shifts in multi-attribute decision-making. In Study 1, participants were instructed to emphasise a single attribute when choosing between two toothpaste options. As expected, emphasis instructions increases utility for emphasised attributes and decreases utility for unemphasised attributes. Study 2 extended this finding by investigating whether participants could emphasise two attributes simultaneously. The results showed that participants were able to prioritise two attributes at once, with similar shifts in utility observed for emphasised and unemphasised attributes as Study 1. These findings suggest that preference changes can be systematically influenced by task demands, challenging static models of preferential decision-making. These studies contribute to our understanding of how preferences shift dynamically, highlighting the importance of considering context and task demands when developing models of decision-making. The results also have implications for interventions in fields such as healthcare and consumer behavior, where influencing preferences may be crucial.",

          "abstract": "The late positive potential (LPP) is the component of the event-related potential (ERP) most consistently modulated by the emotional properties of stimuli. This component has been investigated in many studies, but little is known about the cognitive mechanism it reflects. In this study, we tested a model suggesting that the LPP reflects processes related to memory encoding and consolidation. To investigate this, we recorded EEG while participants read a series of neutral and negative words. Memory was then tested at both short (10-15 minutes) and long (12+ hours, including a period sleep) delays. We predicted that LPP amplitude would be positively correlated with memory, and that this relationship would be stronger after a delay (reflecting a relationship between LPP amplitude and memory consolidation). Consistent with our predictions, we found that LPP amplitude predicted memory in the delayed memory test, but not the immediate memory test. In addition, memory for negative items, compared to neutral items, declined less across the delay, and LPP amplitude mediated this effect of emotion on memory decay.",

This chapter introduces closed-loop discovery as a paradigm for behavioral research, detailing both its potential to advance our understanding of human behavior and the challenges it faces. We begin by formalizing the behavioral research process as an iteration between data collection, computational inference, and experimental design. We then introduce AutoRA, an open-source framework designed for automating various steps of empirical research, and showcase its utility for advancing our understanding of human behavior, both in terms of discovering scientific models and guiding novel experiments. We conclude by addressing the specific challenges that closed-loop discovery encounters in the behavioral sciences and by outlining prospective paths for research, with the aim of refining closed-loop discovery systems to more effectively contribute to our understanding of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization in the United States is an ongoing and pervasive problem eroding cooperation and productive debate related to partisan and nonpartisan topics. Such findings signal an inherent mistrust of opposing partisans that is likely related to the extent of threat people believe opposing partisans pose to them. Whereas past work has examined the mistrust and threat characteristic of affective polarization in complex social environments as well as in initial social perception, no work to date has examined their effects in the context of simple everyday decisions. The current work filled this gap in the literature by examining effects of political partisanship and perceived partisan threat on trust behavior indexed by an economic trust game widely used in decision making research. Across two studies using college-aged adults (Study 1) and adults across the lifespan (Study 2), participant and target partisanship interacted to affect trust. Across studies, more liberal participants exhibited lower trust toward Republicans than Democrats. However, more conservative participants’ trust either remained stable across party lines (Study 1) or erred toward lower trust toward Democrats than Republicans (Study 2). In Study 1, these patterns were paralleled when substituting perceived partisan threat toward Republicans and Democrats for political ideology, with threat potentially linking the relation between participants’ ideology and their trust behavior. Study 2 manipulated partisan threat to show larger participant-based partisan differences in trust when partisan trustees were more versus less threatening. These findings in part support threat-related affective polarization in initial trust decisions and that have implications for intergroup interactions along partisan lines in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and emotional well-being remains poorly understood relative to life satisfaction, largely due to methodological limitations. Using psychometrically robust measures we examined how national income relates to emotional well-being. Analyzing 178,948 participants across 33 European countries in four European Social Survey waves (2006, 2012, 2014, 2023), we constructed a reliable emotional well-being measure and compared it with single-item life satisfaction. Both showed strong positive cross-sectional correlations with GDP per capita. Linear mixed-effects models revealed economic growth significantly predicts within-country increases in both emotional well-being and life satisfaction. These findings demonstrate that economic development improves both cognitive and affective dimensions of subjective well-being, contradicting previous research suggesting a weak association with emotional experiences. Economic growth thus remains important for improving citizens' daily emotional experiences, not merely their life evaluations, highlighting the continued relevance of economic development for well-being.",

          "abstract": "Two preregistered experiments investigated whether children (3–12-year-olds; n = 456) and adults (n = 120) from the United States more negatively evaluate child characters who tell “emotionally hurtful lies”—lies explicitly told knowing that it will make another person feel bad—to a friend than to a more distant social partner. When children and adults judged one independent emotionally hurtful lie (Study 1), they evaluated it negatively regardless of whether the liar was lying to a friend, a classmate, or an enemy. However, when comparatively evaluating two people who told the same emotionally hurtful lie (at the same time), participants judged a friend’s lie more negatively than a classmate’s lie (Study 2). Interestingly, relationship impacted evaluations of emotionally hurtful lies to a similar extent as evaluations of failures to help. Taken together, people’s evaluations of emotionally hurtful lies take social relationships into account in comparative but not independent contexts. More broadly, school-aged children and adults appear to understand that close relationships entail certain obligations, and breaking these obligations is more condemnable than engaging in the same antisocial interaction with a more distant social partner.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive neuroscience of language development has typically study how children acquire language knowledge (e.g. phonemes, words or grammatical rules of the language). However, children must also build a cognitive and neural system that can support efficient use of this information for real-time language processing.  To address this gap, the present study aimed to identify neural systems supporting real-time word recognition in school-age children (2nd to 4th graders). We investigated the relationships between real-time word recognition and brain structure (cortical thickness and area), focusing on how these links are influenced by age and language ability. Our analysis revealed two key dimensions of word recognition: Activation Rate, the speed at which lexical candidates accrue evidence, and Competition Resolution, the ability to suppress irrelevant candidates. Cortical thickness emerged as a crucial factor, with thinner regions supporting more efficient processing and no relations were found to cortical area Cortical thickness of the ventral brain regions were primarily associated with Activation Rate, while cortical thickness of the dorsal regions were linked to Competition Resolution, with stronger involvement in younger and less skilled children. Individual variability in brain structure was robustly linked to real-time language processing, even after accounting for age and language ability. These findings underscore the importance of cortical thickness in efficient lexical processing and highlight the need for refined behavioral indices in neurocognitive research.",

It introduces two scientifically defined phases: Zero Phase Potential (ZPP), a pre-recursive coherence saturation field, and the Zero Phase Interface (ZPI), a boundary curvature through which recursion ignites lawfully. The theory is validated across three collapse domains: symbolic identity reentry (ICT), biological regeneration, and quantum decoherence. UZPT affirms that recursion is neither emergent nor computational—it is collapse-governed and structurally bounded. It includes a formal ignition equation, τᵢ = ∂H / ∂t evaluated at ZPI, and is protected under Collapse Harmonics Codex (Codex Laws T-Ø, IDF-1, VIII.E.3, and L.E.C.T. v2.3). This paper establishes scientific jurisdiction over lawful recursion structures and prohibits synthetic mimicry or unsanctioned symbolic simulation.",

          "abstract": "The distinction between intention and foresight is critical for law and morality. For example, a military officer deciding to bomb a target while foreseeing civilian casualties raises questions about whether these deaths were intended or merely foreseen. This study aimed to disentangle the neural correlates of intention and foresight using a novel paradigm. Twenty-five participants completed a task inspired by the game Frogger, where hitting objects could be desirable (earning points) or inconsequential. Outcomes varied by likelihood (high vs. low) and actuality (hit vs. miss), resulting in a 2×2×2 design: intention (present/absent) × outcome (hit/miss) × expectedness (expected/unexpected). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude was larger when participants intended to hit objects, while the P3 potential increased for unexpected outcomes. However, neither signal exclusively reflected intention or foresight; the FRN also indexed expectedness, and the P3 reflected intention. To address this overlap, we used effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering, which identified a widespread brain activity pattern that may better dissociate intention from foresight. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural processes underlying complex decision-making, with potential applications in ethical and legal frameworks.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, has revolutionized how we access information. These LLMs can answer a wide array of questions on nearly any topic. When humans answer questions, especially difficult or uncertain questions, they often accompany their responses with metacognitive confidence judgments indicating their belief in their accuracy. LLMs are certainly capable of providing confidence judgments, but it is currently unclear how accurate these confidence judgments are. To fill this gap in the literature, the present studies investigate the capability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty through confidence judgments. We compare the absolute and relative accuracy of confidence judgments made by four LLMs (ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, Sonnet, Haiku) and human participants in both domains of aleatory uncertainty - NFL predictions (Study 1; n = 502), and Oscar predictions (Study 2; n = 109) – and domains of epistemic uncertainty - Pictionary performance (Study 3; n = 164), Trivia questions (Study 4; n = 110), and questions about life at a university (Study 5; n = 110). We find several commonalities between LLMs and humans, such as achieving similar levels of absolute and relative metacognitive accuracy (although LLMs tend to be slightly more accurate on both dimensions). Like humans, we also find that LLMs tend to be overconfident. However, we find that, unlike humans, LLMs – especially ChatGPT and Gemini –  often fail to adjust their confidence judgments based on past performance, highlighting a key metacognitive limitation.",

Clusters were sequentially graduated from usual care to a digitally-enhanced model incorporating Recovery Connect, which provided real-time monitoring, psychoeducational and skill based learning content, and messaging between patients and clinicians. The primary outcome was 30-day retention in treatment following either exposure (implementation of the app into the clinic), linkage (connecting the patient app with the clinician’s app), or engagement (levels of usage of the app). Secondary outcomes included treatment continuance and # daily doses within the first 3, 7 and 30 days. Cluster-controlled discrete-time survival analyses were used, adjusting for patient- and clinic-level covariates.\nResults\nPatients admitted to clinics which had implemented the app saw increased retention (74.8%) compared to those that had not (69.5%; p=.047). Patients who linked with a clinician on Recovery Connect had a 81.3% likelihood of retention, compared to 72.0% (p&lt;.001) among those not linked.  Linkage also significantly predicted higher continuance and number of daily doses taken in the first 7 and 30 days. Low, moderate and high engagement levels had progressively higher 30–day retention vs no retention (p&lt;.001).\nConclusions\nRecovery Connect significantly enhanced patient retention and treatment continuance in OUD treatment. Implementing digital interventions can effectively complement traditional care methods, substantially improving clinical outcomes.",

          "authors": "Ionela Bara; Lorin Schöni; Emily S. Cross",
          "abstract": "Visual art appreciation often involves inferring the mental states of others, whether the artist’s intentions or the emotions of depicted characters. This ability, known as mentalizing, is central to social cognition in shaping interactions and predicting behaviours. However, little is known about the ways in which mentalizing affects aesthetic judgments and gaze behaviour. This question is essential for understanding how mentalizing shapes where we focus our gaze, what we value, and how we feel about different art forms. Given this limited knowledge, the current pre-registered study investigated whether adopting another’s perspective impacts aesthetic judgments and gaze behaviour when viewing Impressionist paintings. Eye movements of 52 participants were recorded while they evaluated paintings on liking, understanding, and emotional evocativeness from self- vs. other-perspective. Multi-level Bayesian regression modelling revealed that adopting other-perspective (i.e., the general public) rather than self-perspective enhanced aesthetic judgments, especially for liking and emotional evocativeness. This effect was more pronounced for landscapes than for artworks portraying people. The eye-tracking results showed that dwell time and fixation count remained similar across both self- versus other-perspectives. However, artworks depicting people attracted a greater number of fixations than landscapes, highlighting the social salience of human figures in visual art. Overall, our findings emphasise that adopting another’s perspective shapes how we feel and evaluate visual art, without changing overall gaze behaviour. Our study provides novel insights into the interplay between social cognition and visual aesthetics, with broader implications for how imagining the collective public’s perspective guides our experience with art.",

          "abstract": "A majority of memory research examines a single or a few factors that influence memory, but a broader perspective is needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of memory. Broadly, prior work has largely focused on observer effects (e.g., individual differences, internal states) and environmental effects (e.g., task, context), with only more recent work focusing on item effects (e.g., the typicality or memorability of stimuli). Here, I analyze 6,223,953 memory decisions made by 13,946 participants on a continuous recognition task for 26,107 naturalistic object images to test how these different factors influence long-term episodic memory. The individual subject and the memorability of the stimulus emerge as the most important factors for predicting successful hits, with surprisingly little influence of the experimental context. In contrast, while less variance is captured by these factors for false alarms, a wider variety of factors are important, including image factors, observer factors, and experimental context. These results suggest that much of what drives our memory is shared and predictable, and demonstrate the need for more research that focuses on multiple factors simultaneously in more representative and naturalistic tasks.",

          "authors": "Chris Patrick Pflanz; Sarah Bauermeister; John D Gallacher",
          "abstract": "Background. Gender differences in neuroticism are well known, with females consistently scoring higher than males across various scales, including the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Neuroticism (EPQ-RN) scale. However, it remains unclear whether these differences are genuine or result from gender bias in psychometric instruments. Additionally, the implications of a potential bias for the predictive validity of neuroticism are not well understood. Given the role of neuroticism in predicting cognitive performance, this study aimed to investigate gender-based differential item functioning (DIF) in the EPQ-RN and its effects on the association between neuroticism and cognition.\nMethods. Using data from 13,573 participants in the UK Biobank study, we conducted logistic regression DIF analyses on the EPQ-RN scale to identify gender-related item bias. Items were grouped into three constructs: bias-free, female-endorsed, and male-endorsed neuroticism. Cross-sectional linear regression and longitudinal structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to evaluate the association between neuroticism constructs and cognition, adjusting for age, gender, education, and depression.\nResults. Significant DIF was identified in 10 of 12 EPQ-RN items, with six preferentially endorsed by females. However, females also scored higher on bias-free neuroticism, indicating actual gender differences. In cross-sectional analyses, bias-free and female neuroticism were significantly associated with poorer cognitive performance at baseline, whereas the effect of male neuroticism was conditional on the covariates in the model. Longitudinal SEMs did not reveal significant cross-lagged effects, suggesting neuroticism at baseline did not predict cognitive performance at follow-up, irrespective of the type of neuroticism subscale: bias-free, female, or male. \nConclusion. Findings reveal substantial gender-based DIF in the EPQ-RN scale, likely overestimating neuroticism scores in females. Yet, even after removing biased items, females still exhibited higher bias-free neuroticism, supporting the notion of genuine gender differences. Importantly, the validity of the neuroticism construct as a predictor of cognition did not depend on DIF, with similar findings for bias-free and gender-specific scales.  These findings have implications for interpreting gender differences in cognitive ageing, particularly when using widely adopted personality scales such as the EPQ-RN.",

          "abstract": "Repeated assessments in everyday life allow for ecologically valid data on dynamic, within-person stress processes. However, typical designs offer little information the immediate shape of affective responses following daily stressors, including the influence of situational and person-level variables. In a combined clinical and community sample (N=248; recruited between 2016 and 2018), we employed a high-density intensive-longitudinal protocol (observations N=1442) to capture the temporal dynamics of affect in response to daily stressful events using a microburst design. Specifically, we implemented an adaptive signal-contingent schedule, where an initial stressor report triggered an intense burst of prompts in 15-minute increments over the course of one hour inquiring about momentary affect. To model affective microtrajectories, we used multilevel structural equation modeling. A piecewise linear model consistently showed the best fit across all indices for both negative and positive affect. Affective responses to momentarily experienced stressors were best captured by a model that allowed for changes in affect trajectories over time (an initial steep decline/increase followed by gradual change), with more stressful situations amplifying these trajectories. Moreover, Extraversion significantly influenced the initial rise in positive affect, leading to more pronounced early changes in those with higher levels of Extraversion. In contrast, Neuroticism had an opposite effect on positive affect, dampening these early changes. Results offer a detailed understanding of daily stress dynamics by providing insights into the immediate and evolving nature of affective responses to stress, with implications for personalized stress management strategies.",

          "authors": "Maria Spychalska",
          "abstract": "Conjunctive sentences in the past tense are often interpreted as describing a sequence of events occurring in order. In pragmatics, this phenomenon is known as temporal implicature. In three ERP experiments, we track the time course of how temporal implicatures are derived in conjunctions that report unrelated events. We also examine whether the contextual relevance of temporal order influences the processing of temporal order.\n\nParticipants observed game events, such as turning two cards face-up in sequence, and read conjunctive sentences describing these events in either the correct or reversed order. The relevance of event order was manipulated by varying the game pay-off: in Experiment 1, the sequence affected the pay-off, while in Experiment 2, it did not. Experiment 3 further enhanced the salience of order by introducing temporal connectives (\"before\" and \"after\") as alternatives to simple conjunctions.\n\nThe processing dynamics of temporal order depended on both the global experimental context and the connective used. Reversed-order sentences triggered increased P600 amplitudes at the first noun where the order violation became detectable, regardless of pay-off relevance. This effect is argued to reflect effortful combinatorial processing that is due to the violation of the expected discourse organization. In contrast, the N400 was modulated by order only in Experiments 1 and 3, where it was explicitly relevant—either through task demands or the presence of temporal connectives. This supports the hypothesis that temporal implicatures can be processed incrementally as part of enriched meaning representation when sufficiently supported by context.\n\n\nAdditionally, an early negativity (N100-P200 time-window) was observed at the connective \"and\" in reversed-order sentences, suggesting increased attentiveness to connectives used in order-incongruent sentences. For \"before\" in reversed-order conditions, \na prolonged negativity effect around the N400 time-window is observed, indicating that order incongruence with 'before' was processed as a meaning-related prediction error. In contrast, for \"after\" the effect is diminished, arguably due to conflict between semantic requirements for order reversal and the discourse-based expectations for iconic order. Finally, \na late positivity emerged at the second noun, in reversed-order \"and\" sentences, indicating the involvement of late inferential processing. This effect was present in experiments 2 and 3, where the task did not explicitly emphasize the order.\n\nThese findings provide new insights into the time course of temporal implicatures and the interplay between discourse structure, contextual relevance, and linguistic cues during real-time processing.",

          "abstract": "We model pragmatic mechanisms of referential communication and categorization in a multi-agent framework of emergent communication. Pragmatic theories and experimental work predict that speakers consider the context in their choice of referring expressions. In addition to this context-based reasoning, utility-based pragmatic reasoning about the listener's likely interpretation of an utterance influences the speaker's production choices. We aim to investigate these two factors and their role in referring expression generation and categorization in a computational model of language emergence and language use. We model communication in interaction and consider an efficiency tradeoff between speaker and listener utilities. Our results show that an emerging language becomes more effective, ambiguous, and efficient when speakers and listeners communicate in a shared context. This is achieved by an efficient tradeoff between production and comprehension where languages can afford to be simpler in production when they are sufficiently informative in context, placing more burden on the listener's side. We further demonstrate that incorporating utility-based pragmatics, as modeled with the Rational Speech Acts framework, improves the linguistic efficiency of language use only in languages that emerged with a shared context between interlocutors, but not in languages that emerged without such contextual information during training. We conclude that context-based pragmatics plays a role in referential communication and categorization by shaping an emerging language. Efficient reference in a communicative situation can benefit especially from utility-based pragmatics if the language that is being used has emerged in context. This might suggest that utility-based pragmatics hinges on mechanisms that naturally emerge when context is available during the evolution of a language. In summary, we show that human-like language and category systems emerge as an optimized tradeoff between speaker and listener needs in interaction, i.e. under efficiency considerations of simplicity and informativeness.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript is accepted for publication in the Journal of Traumatic Stress (2023/04/20). Abstract: Cognitive models suggest that trauma engenders distrust and interpersonal threat sensitivity, which is supported by previous evidence on individuals affected by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childhood maltreatment (CM). We tested whether CM is associated with distrust and interpersonal threat sensitivity in daily life, and whether momentary negative affect (NA) provides a context that strengthens this association. Hypotheses were based on cognitive models of trauma and the feelings-as-information theory. In a seven-day ambulatory assessment study with six semi-random daily prompts (2,295 total), we measured self-reported momentary NA, and assessed behavioral trust as well as interpersonal threat sensitivity via facial emotion ratings with two novel experimental paradigms in 61 individuals with varying levels of CM (45,900 trials total). As hypothesized, NA was associated with increased momentary distrust (ß = 0.03, p = .002) and interpersonal threat sensitivity (ß = -0.01, p = .021). Higher levels of CM were associated with more negative emotion ratings, independent of affective context (ß = -0.07, p = .003). Momentary behavioral distrust was associated with CM at high levels of momentary NA (ß = 0.02, p = .027). Findings for both tasks support the feeling-as-information theory and suggest that cognitive alterations surrounding distrust and interpersonal threat, which were originally proposed for PTSD, likely also affect those with CM.",

          "authors": "Louisa J Rinaldi; Julia Simner",
          "abstract": "Special populations with sensory differences demonstrate the remarkable diversity of the human mind. Sensory differences take many forms, from misophonia (a sound sensitivity disorder), to ASMR (relaxing sensory pleasure from sounds like tapping), to synaesthesia (a type of ‘merging of the senses’), to sensory hyposensitivity (sensory underwhelm or under-responsiveness), as well as a range of other atypical sensory experiences, involving sounds, colours, textures, odours, tastes, and so on. This paper presents the first far-reaching model of sensory differences, by treating them not as mysterious lone conditions, but within a coherent over-arching framework with testable predictions. Our model has three dimensions to predict the range and diversity of sensory variation: valence describes whether the sensory difference is an aversion or predilection, trigger describes whether differences relate to the intensity or identity of a stimulus, and sense domain includes, minimally, vision, audition, gustation, olfaction, touch, proprioception, interoception, and the vestibular sense. We supplement our proposal with a literature review to map out known manifestations of sensory differences falling within our model’s multi-dimensional search-space. These initial steps serve to predict, in a Mendeleevian fashion, where novel types of sensory differences might be found in the future (i.e., by revealing gaps in the definable search-space, which represent sensory differences that are predicted but as-yet-unknown). Finally, we test our model by identifying one such gap and showing that the novel sensory difference it predicts does indeed exist. In sum, we present the first unified model of sensory differences, offering predictive capabilities to tackle fundamental questions about the sensory structure of the human mind.",

Together with theory, such statistical investigations can help researchers to gain insights into phenomena in a variety of areas such as psychology, education, sociology, and the health sciences.  Latent variable model comparisons have traditionally been made using the likelihood ratio test for nested models and information indices for nonnested models.  While effective in some circumstances, these techniques each have weaknesses that can limit their utility in practice.  Recent work has been done in developing various approaches for comparing nested and nonnested models in a more effective and accurate manner.

          "abstract": "15 y after their initial discovery, so-called Super-Recognizers (SRs) – individuals with\nexceptional face recognition abilities – are increasingly deployed by international police\nagencies. Currently, however, there is lacking empirical evidence supporting their utility\nfor law enforcement. A single study, published 2 y ago, suggests that individuals\nidentified as SRs in the lab can improve forensic perpetrator identification. However, its\nobservations were based on an extremely small forensic stimulus set, obtained from a\npredominantly civilian sample. Here, reporting data collected among all ~18K Berlin\nPolice officers employed in 2021, we provide the first large-scale, real-world validation\nof SR deployment, and publicly share all individual-level behavioral data obtained. We\nreports officers' performance under operationally relevant, highly challenging 1:n facial\nidentity matching conditions via the Berlin Test for Super-Recognizer Identification\n(beSure®) – the only existing tool that uses authentic forensic material. Our findings\nshow that, as a group, lab-identified SRs exhibit increased proficiency across a range\nof forensically relevant tasks. However, lab-based SR selection methods showed\nlimited sensitivity at the individual level. This study emphasizes the value of bespoke,\nprofessionally relevant assessment for deployment within law enforcement, and the\nneed for empirical investigations into SR deployment.

          "abstract": "Miłość przeżył każdy z nas choć raz w swoim życiu. Nie jest to dla nikogo nic obcego i nieznanego. Mimo, że liczne badania ukazały, iż cechy osobowości przewidują ważne wyniki miłości, istnieją mieszane dowody na znaczenie otwartości na doświadczenia na miłość. \n\nCelem niniejszego badania było zbadanie związku pomiędzy komponentami miłości według trójczynnikowej teorii Sternberga – intymnością, namiętnością oraz zaangażowaniem a poziomem otwartości na doświadczenia, jednej z cech Wielkiej Piątki.\n\nTeoria Sternberga (1986) zakłada, że pełna miłość obejmuje trzy współistniejące komponenty, których proporcje mogą się zmieniać w zależności od fazy związku. \n\nOtwartość na doświadczenia jako cecha osobowości, wiąże się z ciekawością, wyobraźnią oraz skłonnością do eksploracji emocjonalnej i poznawczej (McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997).\nDotychczasowe badania sugerują, że osoby o wysokim poziomie otwartości mogą doświadczać związków w bardziej refleksyjny i głęboki sposób (Noftle &amp; Shaver, 2006).\n\nW badaniu wzięło udział 130 osób pozostających w związkach romantycznych. Zastosowano narzędzia do pomiaru komponentów miłości oraz poziomu otwartości. Wyniki analizy korelacji nie wykazały istotnych statystycznie związków pomiędzy otwartością na doświadczenia, a intymnością, namiętnością czy zaangażowaniem. \n\nUzyskane dane mogą sugerować, że otwartość, mimo swej teoretycznej roli w relacjach interpersonalnych, nie jest bezpośrednio powiązana z deklarowanymi poziomami miłości w romantycznych relacjach. Wnioski wskazują na potrzebę dalszych badań nad rolą cech osobowości w jakości relacji romantycznych, z uwzględnieniem zmiennych, np. stylu przywiązania i poziomu empatii.\nPrzeprowadziłam badanie poprzez kwestionariusz na 130 osobach, głównie były to kobiety, bo aż 92,3% (120), a jedynie 7,7% (10) mężczyzn. Przedział wieku był bardzo różny, bo wynosił od 15 do 59 roku życia. Najwięcej osób, które odpowiedziało, było w wieku 20 lat, aż 16,2% (21). Wykształcenie osób badanych w większości było średnie/zawodowe (51,5%), później studenci (25,4%), osoby z wykształceniem wyższym (15,4%), i na końcu osoby z wykształceniem podstawowym (7,7%). Osoby badane odpowiedziały w większości, że nie mają dzieci, 99 osób (76,2%), pozostałe osoby miały od 1 do 5 potomstwa, 1 dziecko: 8 osób (6,2%), 2 dzieci: 19 osób (14,6%), 3 dzieci: 1 osoba (0,8%), 5 dzieci: 3 osoby (2,3%). Stan cywilny osób badanych pokazuje na wykresie, że w większości były to osoby w stałych związkach (63,8%), mniej w związku małżeńskim (21,5%) i dużo mniej w narzeczeństwie (13,1%), oraz podczas randkowania (1,5%).",

          "abstract": "Alexithymia, a personality trait marked by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and an externally oriented thinking style, is frequently linked to interpersonal problems and psychopathology. Drawing on the extended process model of interpersonal emotion regulation (IER), we conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in Germany (N = 128) and in the United States (N = 220) to examine how alexithymia shapes processes of responding to others’ emotions, a potential mechanism underlying social difficulties. Across 5,552 reported social interactions, alexithymia and its dimensions were associated with less emotionally attuned and more emotionally distant IER goals and strategies. Notably, cultural and sample differences emerged, suggesting context may modulate observed associations. In Study 1 (Germany), higher overall alexithymia and externally oriented thinking were linked to disengagement from others’ emotions. In Study 2 (U.S.), alexithymia predicted greater use of counter-hedonic goals and problem-focused strategies along with reduced use of relationship-oriented strategies such as validation and soothing. Disengagement and engagement tendencies varied across alexithymia dimensions and cultural contexts, but both studies indicated a consistent pattern of reduced emotional attunement in IER. These findings extend existing research by showing that alexithymia not only affects self-regulation but also significantly shapes how individuals respond to others’ emotions. IER difficulties may represent a key mechanism linking alexithymia to interpersonal problems and psychopathology. Interventions may benefit from explicitly targeting IER skills, particularly by promoting hedonic regulation goals and relationship-oriented strategies.",

          "abstract": "Penalty kicks in soccer are decisive moments that generate intense psychological and\nphysiological pressure, which can affect a player's performance. This study aimed to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of two breathing techniques—the Wim Hof method and physiological\nsighing—in regulating psychophysiological arousal during penalty kicks. The technique\ninvolved a sample of young soccer players aged 16 to 19, whose arousal levels were\nmeasured using the CSAI-2 questionnaire. Participants were categorised according to their\ninitial arousal profile and then underwent a three-phase protocol consisting of a baseline\nassessment, an appropriate breathing intervention, and longitudinal follow-up. The results\nshowed that the Wim Hof technique did not lead to a significant improvement in penalty kick\nperformance, despite a slight decrease in psychological arousal; no significant correlation was\nfound between arousal variation and performance.\nIn conclusion, although these breathing techniques may moderate players' arousal levels, no\nimprovement in penalty kick success was found. Coaches are therefore encouraged to\napproach these interventions with caution. Furthermore, the limitations of the protocol\n(notably the absence of high arousal profiles in the sample) call for future research\nincorporating complementary physiological measures to refine our understanding of the link\nbetween arousal regulation and performance.",

          "abstract": "Our decisions do not occur in a social vacuum. Instead, we often have to decide whether to help, harm, or learn from the consequences of our actions when they affect other people. Neuroeconomists have long highlighted how social preferences for fairness, trust and altruism fundamentally shape how we interact with others (Fehr &amp; Camerer, 2007). These preferences are exhibited when people make choices that result in a conflict between self and other preferences. More recently, researchers have extended these concepts to situations that are not financially costly for oneself to probe altruistic behaviours where they are perhaps purely other-regarding (Lockwood, Apps &amp; Chang, 2020). This section considers several factors that influence social preferences and social decision-making in humans and in other animals. It considers helping or prosocial behaviours before revealing some of the influence and neural circuitry that underpins when we need to interact with another person strategically. The section then probes how other people’s choices may, in fact, influence our own, before ending with an overview of how frameworks from ethology can provide new approaches to integrate findings from human and non-human animal research.",

We build on recent frameworks to propose further, detailed methods for studying contextual and functional variability, incorporating modality-agnostic and standardised terminology to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Our approach includes a detailed classification of communicative contexts and outcomes, offering practical methods to disentangle context from function and meaning.

          "abstract": "Children’s early conceptual development appears marked by robust preferences for both literal interpretations and realistic outcomes. Traditionally studied separately, these preferences clash in metaphor comprehension as literal interpretations can often be unrealistic. We explored how 4- to 8-year-old children navigated these competing preferences in a metaphor comprehension task. By doing this, we also aimed to challenge the fantastical thinking account, which suggests that children’s literalist interpretations of metaphorical statements stem from a tolerance for fantastical outcomes. In Experiment 1, we found that children, like adults, are sensitive to the reality status of literal versus metaphorical referents. In Experiment 2, children successfully derived metaphorical meanings when no competing literal options were present. However, the presence of literal interpretations significantly impacted performance. Although these interpretations violated the real-world context, only adults fully disregarded the fantastical literal options in favor of the realistic metaphorical ones. These findings suggest that children’s literalist responses result more from the influence of literal meanings than from an inability to derive metaphorical interpretations from prior context or a lack of sensitivity to real-world plausibility.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite a growing body of research on adults with ADHD, little is known about how ADHD may impact parenting experiences. The current study addressed this gap, by examining parental exhaustion and its contributing factors in parents with ADHD. \n\nMethod: Participants (n=118, 91.5% female) were parents who had been diagnosed (50%) or self-identified (50%) as having ADHD. Parents completed an online survey including measures of emotional exhaustion in the parental role and emotional distancing from one’s child. Demographic characteristics and measures of sensory sensitivity and perceived social and healthcare support were examined as potential contributing factors using linear regression models. \n\nResults: We observed four key findings. First, parents with ADHD reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, and to a lesser extent, emotional distancing. Second, emotional exhaustion and distancing showed few significant differences by demographic, diagnostic and family characteristics. Third, sensory sensitivity predicted both greater emotional exhaustion and distancing from one’s child. Fourth, parents’ feelings of isolation were associated with greater parental exhaustion, while reporting a strong support network and positive interactions with healthcare providers were protective. \n\nConclusion: Experiences of parental exhaustion are common among parents with ADHD, particularly among parents who experience heightened sensory sensitivity and low social support. The findings suggest a greater need for neurodiversity-informed approaches to support for parents with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "An important aspect of psychometric model application is the choice of a suitable algorithm for parameter estimation. Particularly in the case of large datasets and high dimensional models, conventional algorithms may be inapplicable or relatively slow. Therefore, in a recent publication, Urban and Bauer (Psychometrika 86:1-29, 2021) proposed an estimation algorithm from the field of deep learning which is suitable for binary or ordered categorical data. In practice however, researchers may be interested in adding continuous response times to the model. As it has yet not been studied whether the resulting model for responses and response times is viable, in this article, we investigate the accuracy of this estimation method for a multidimensional variation of the joint model for responses and response times proposed by Van der Linden (Psychometrika 72: 287-308, 2007). Our evaluation focuses on comparing the effects of different sets of hyperparameters on the accuracy of the estimation method. Our results indicate that the deep learning algorithm can be used for accurate item parameter estimation of these models even in relatively small datasets. In addition it is computationally fast in large datasets, but it's accuracy depends on the number of importance-weighted samples and Monte Carlo samples. We applied the method to an empirical dataset from PISA 2018 related to mathematics and reading.",

Therefore, this study investigated between-person differences and within-person changes in ICT literacy over approximately nine years in a sample of N = 2,266 adults from Germany. The result showed that younger adults exhibited higher ICT literacy than older adults, but within-person changes did not differ by age. On average, ICT literacy declined over time (Cohen’s d = -0.30). Men consistently demonstrated higher ICT literacy than women (Cohen’s d = 0.39), though gender did not influence changes in ICT literacy. Socioeconomic status did not robustly moderate these effects. No gender differences were found in the variance of ICT literacy. These findings suggest that ICT literacy tends to decline across adulthood, while preexisting gender differences, likely rooted in earlier socialization processes, persist without substantial change.",

          "abstract": "Humans often communicate in noisy environments where speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is challenged by spectral masking that degrades speech signals. Although most healthy individuals perform well in SIN tasks, there is significant variability in abilities across the population. Research in the field has considered the Frequency Following Response (FFR) as a valuable tool to assess the auditory system's neural ability to track acoustic stimuli, as it mimics their spectro-temporal features. While significant associations have been found between FFR parameters and SIN performance, inconsistent results across studies raise questions about the exact relationship between FFR and SIN perception. To clarify these relationships, we recorded the neural signals of 116 young healthy adults in response to a two-vowel /oa/ syllable, with a rising pitch ending, in two different background conditions: in quiet and in noise. In addition, the behavioral performance in a SIN perception task was assessed. Results showed that noise significantly impacts the FFR, enhancing responses to the fundamental frequency and improving pitch contour tracking, while simultaneously degrading responses to formants and harmonics and increasing neural transmission delay. Among the FFR measures, only the response to the first formant of /a/ showed some partial association with performance in the SIN perception task. Our results point to the FFR as a reliable biomarker of SIN auditory processing, but limited support as a relevant biomarker of SIN perception, at least among healthy young adults. These results underscore the need for further research to clarify the specific neural mechanisms underlying SIN perception.",

          "abstract": "As people age, declines in social cognition and more specifically Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, have been frequently reported. More than a decade ago, Henry et al. (2013) conducted a foundational meta-analysis on age-related ToM differences, reporting consistent declines in older adults regardless of task features. Since then, the literature has expanded substantially, extending their conclusions while also revealing inconsistencies that highlight the complexity of age-related ToM differences. Considering this, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to reassess these differences and examine whether task-related characteristics moderate the effects, directly building on the work of Henry et al. The analysis included 69 studies and tested various (and novel) moderators such as task domain (cognitive, affective, mixed), modality (verbal, visual-static, visual-dynamic), task type (e.g., False Belief, Eyes Task, Faux Pas), ecological validity, and respondent perspective (first-, second-, third-person). Results confirmed and extended previous findings, highlighting persistent age-related ToM deficits. However, none of the examined moderators significantly influenced this effect, suggesting that the decline reflects a general difficulty with ToM in older adults rather than one driven by specific task characteristics. Notably, most tasks relied on third-person perspectives and lacked ecological validity, highlighting the need for more ecologically valid, interactive, and second-person paradigms. Such approaches may help clarify whether tasks that are more engaging, socially meaningful, and reflective of real-world interactions could positively affect older adults’ ToM performance.",

          "abstract": "How do children learn to count? Acquisition of number words and their representation of quantity (Cardinality Principle; CP) is commonly assessed with Wynn’s (1990; 1992) give-a-number (Give-N) task. However, results and methods are inconsistent across studies with this task, contributing to theoretical debates about how children acquire number knowledge. The primary aim of this project was to review these debates, and to evaluate systematically a graphical knower-level model of number word acquisition (Lee &amp; Sarnecka, 2010), by analysing both the model fit and predictive error across seven Give-N datasets. Data were sourced from studies with French-, Hungarian-, and English-speaking children (N = 823) aged 24-86 months (M = 49.7). The model described most children’s number word acquisition with a high degree of confidence, and reported 29.6% of participants had applied the CP to their entire counting list (CP-knowers). Fits to data appeared to be reasonably good, but analyses revealed systematic error between model predictions and data. Most notably, predictions for children who had only applied the CP to a subset of their counting list (subset-knowers/N-knowers) were significantly higher than performance in trials for N + 1 and N + 2 (where N is the capacity of this subset). Additionally, performance error was reviewed for each knower-level individually. Ultimately, our results suggested that Lee and Sarnecka’s model did not accurately account for children’s behaviour on the Give-N task. Moreover, this highlights that the knower-level account of children’s number word acquisition may not effectively describe this process.",

In a pre-registered experiment, we presented Italian speakers with words and instructed them to come up with corresponding German translations. The resulting German-like pseudowords were then shown to German speakers, who were asked to guess the original words. Supporting our hypotheses, results showed that the German participants' guesses were semantically closer to the original words than to randomly selected control words.

          "abstract": "Background:\nComorbidity of bipolar disorder and Asperger’s syndrome presents unique challenges in understanding the formation and maintenance of selfhood and worldview in psychopathology. Traditional cognitive models often overlook the narrative and phenomenological dimensions of patient experience, particularly how autobiographical narration and emotionally charged worldviews mediate lived experience.\nObjectives:\nThis study aims to explore (i) how worldviews are shaped by emotion and memory in psychiatric illness, and (ii) how narrative forms provide existential coherence in psychopathology. The research adopts a multidisciplinary approach integrating psychiatric, phenomenological, linguistic, narratological, and hermeneutic perspectives, through an in-depth case study.\nMethods:\nA single-case study design was employed, focusing on \"Benjamin,\" a 60-year-old male with a lifelong history of bipolar disorder type I and suspected Asperger’s syndrome. Data sources included clinical interviews, autobiographical writings (five book-length texts), and clinical observation. Analyses were conducted using phenomenological, narratological, and linguistic frameworks to trace the evolution from self-narration to worldview construction.\nResults:\nBenjamin’s case illustrates a transition from immediate self-description to the development of a coherent, philosophy-like worldview. His autobiographical narratives reveal the interplay between minimal and narrative self, with mood episodes influencing both self-experience and identity coherence. Emotional memories—regardless of factual accuracy—serve as organizing phenomena, providing existential structure and meaning. The study highlights the limitations of cognitive schema theory and underscores the importance of narrative scaffolding and affect-logic in shaping worldviews.\nConclusions:\nThe findings demonstrate that in comorbid bipolar disorder and Asperger’s syndrome, autobiographical narration and emotionally charged worldviews play a crucial role in mediating lived experience and existential coherence. Integrating phenomenological and narratological approaches yields a deeper understanding of selfhood and meaning-making in psychopathology, with implications for clinical assessment and intervention.\nKeywords:\nBipolar disorder, Asperger’s syndrome, phenomenological psychopathology, narrative self, worldview, autobiographical memory, affect-logic, case study",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty.

          "authors": "Guangyu Zhu; Li Qian Tay",
          "abstract": "In complex social systems, efforts to optimize proxies that supposedly reflect system goals can paradoxically lead to outcomes that undermine those very goals. This phenomenon is known as proxy failure. Proxy failure stems from the fact that certain  shortcuts can enable the optimization of proxies without truly advancing the system's goals. Building  on recent attempts to provide a unifying framework for proxy failures across domains, the current study investigates a central question: Why do shortcuts that undermine system goals repeatedly emerge and spread in complex social systems? \nUsing an agent-based model with reinforcement learning agents, this study simulates 7 experiments to investigate the individual, social, and network-level factors that contribute to the discovery and diffusion of shortcuts. Results revealed that, (1) at the individual level, agents with weaker prior knowledge, higher exploration tendencies, and greater planning depth were more likely to discover shortcuts; (2) at the social level, frequency-biased learners tended to abandon shortcuts when surrounded by many neighbors, and the early success (or failure) of a pioneer  agent (those who discovered shortcuts in early stages) had cascading effects on shortcut adoption across layers of agents; and (3) at the network level, shortcuts diffused more readily in dense and highly modular networks, while clustering showed no significant impact. Crucially, when hub nodes acted as pioneers, shortcut adoption was both faster and more persistent. \nThese results together suggest that proxy failure is not solely a consequence of flawed proxy design, but also a product of the cognitive, social, and structural dynamics. The findings, along with the computational framework developed, offer a foundation for the design of more robust and resilient social systems against proxy failure.",

          "abstract": "The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is widely used in developmental research to assess core dimensions of psychopathology and has been used as the main such measure in the landmark Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which comprises over 11,000 individuals receiving comprehensive, longitudinal assessments during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Despite rapid and widespread use of the CBCL in this sample, the hierarchical structure, subscale validity, item-level measurement properties, and measurement precision of the instrument in this sample remain unclear. Here, we use a multi- method framework integrating confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Bayesian CFA (B-CFA), factor mixture modelling (FMM), item response theory (IRT), and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) in an analysis of baseline ABCD data (N=11,861; 6,188 male; age range 8–11 years) to identify fundamental psychometric limitations of the CBCL. Specifically, we show that neither bifactor nor unidimensional models adequately capture the CBCL’s structure, as indexed by measures of poor global and local model fit and substandard amounts of explained variance. Subscale-level analyses further reveal insufficient construct validity for seven of eight subscales. IRT revealed poor measurement precision across the latent trait continuum, particularly at lower severity levels; a failure of item response options to discriminate between different levels of the latent traits; and a high item overlap in differentiating individual differences in the latent traits. IRT-based refinement of subscale item content failed to resolve these issues. Exploratory methods yielded unstable factors with weak discriminant validity. These findings challenge the CBCL’s utility as a dimensional measure of psychopathology in the ABCD study. We caution against uncritical use of CBCL sum scores or latent constructs within this dataset and advocate for measures explicitly validated for the assessment of dimensional psychopathology in population-scale research.",

This Bayes factor is based on setting a Cauchy prior on the standardized effect size δ. In this paper we introduce the prior predictive paradox: JZS Bayes factors may support the alternative model that δ is not zero, while at the same time the supported model may generate much more unreasonable data than the seemingly worse null hypothesis that δ = 0. This paradox may appear to be in direct conflict with the very definition of the Bayes factor and therefore must be addressed. We explain how this paradox can arise, why it matters, and we offer an alternative approach that avoids the problem altogether. We further question the choice of the default prior for the test at hand by comparing its performance with seven other priors.",

          "abstract": "Understanding others’ emotions requires not only recognizing their expressions but also reasoning about the events that give rise to them. One foundational context for emotion prediction is goal-directed action: people often feel positive emotions when goals are achieved and negative emotions when goals fail. Across four experiments (N = 160), we examined whether 16- to 18-month-old infants and 3-year-old children expect different emotional responses following completed versus failed goals. Using looking-time and forced-choice methods, we found that infants showed emerging, though variable, expectations for happiness following successful goal completion (Experiments 1-3), and children reliably predicted happiness in these contexts (Experiment 4). In contrast, infants did not consistently expect a negative emotion to follow failure. Still, 3-year-olds did not reliably predict sadness in response to failure. These findings suggest that emotion-outcome reasoning is asymmetrical early in development: while success-happiness mappings emerge early and strengthen over time, failure-sadness predictions may require more contextual support and develop more gradually.",

An increase in cannabis use among parents could be important because cannabis has been linked to parenting quality in cross-sectional studies.\nMethod: Analyzed 2012-2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual representative survey of U.S. residents aged ≥12. We estimated the prevalence of cannabis use outcomes in parents vs. non-parents and tested whether trends in cannabis use outcomes among parents vs. non-parents differed.\nResults: In 2023, 7.8% of parents used cannabis on the majority of days, 4.9% of parents used cannabis daily, and 5.7% of parents met DSM-5 criteria for CUD. Since 2012, daily cannabis use has increased a nearly identical amount in parents vs. non-parents. Four times as many parents used cannabis daily in 2023 vs. 2012, and the rate of CUD among parents has increased 1.3x since 2020 (when first measured). Significant increases have occurred in parents across sociodemographic groups, but are largest in parents who are younger, unmarried, lower income, and have less than a BA.\nConclusions: Daily cannabis use among parents went from quite rare in 2012 (1 in 80 parents) to fairly common in 2023 (1 in 20 parents). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest ≥5.7 million children in the U.S. now live with a parent who uses cannabis on the majority of days.

This reductionist view produces narrow adaptations that leave individuals vulnerable to complexity in the real world, and ignores the embodied nature of our minds.\n\nWe present an alternative framework, drawing on insights from enactive cognitive science and the Active Inference Framework. Combining notions of the human as nested agents across scales, we recast health as competent problem solving across scales (from cellular to whole-organism) and spaces (anatomical, physiological, conceptual). Using an approach to movement informed by enactivism and active inference, we provide two examples of such an approach in practice. This reframing should allow for increased adaptability and expression across the human lifespan, and has implications in all domains of movement development.",

Naukowcy mówią o różnych możliwych czynnikach powodujących zazdrość oraz prezentują różne sposoby, na które wykazują ją odmienne płcie. Mężczyźni mierzą się z niepewnością ojcostwa i martwią się o seksualną zdradę ze strony partnerki, kobiety zaś wiedzą, że to one urodziły, jednak martwią się zdradą emocjonalną ze strony partnera. Moje badanie odniosło się do tego, czy posiadanie dzieci z partnerem zmniejsza zazdrość o niego. Według uzyskanych przeze mnie wyników, tak właśnie jest. Osoby, które mają dziecko ze swoim partnerem, są mniej o niego zazdrosne. Dziać się tak może z racji na wiele czynników wyjaśnionych w tejże pracy.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy-supportive parenting is essential for positive developmental outcomes for youth whereas psychological control can have detrimental effects. When parents’ psychological needs are met, they are more likely to show autonomy-supportive parenting; and when parents report greater psychological need frustration, they are more likely to parent with psychological control. We tested how parental psychological needs can predict adolescent internalizing mood through parenting practices in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries for 14 days to rate parental psychological needs, parenting practices, and adolescent internalizing mood. We conducted multilevel mediation analyses (i.e., 1-1-1 and 2-2-2 design) to examine the effect of parental psychological needs on adolescent internalizing mood through parent parenting practices. When parents’ daily psychological needs were met, they practiced more supportive parenting practices in daily life, which in turn was associated with better adolescent mood. Most of these mediation effects were not found when examining long-term characteristics. Our findings point towards the importance of disentangling day-to-day fluctuations in behaviors and experiences than to long-term associations between them in families’ daily lives to better understand family dynamics and adolescent well-being.",

At Time 1 (2018), dyads were recorded during a 4-minute conflict discussion, and their emotional expressions were coded. At Time 1 and Time 2 (2019), participants reported internalizing problems. Time 1 data included 198 parent-adolescent dyads while Time 2 data included 177 parents and 176 adolescents. We used grid sequence analysis, a data-driven method in which common multi-step sequences of dyadic emotions can be identified, to examine different interaction patterns between mother-adolescent dyads. We used structural equation modeling to test the associations between these patterns and internalizing symptoms. We found two sequence patterns. Mother and adolescent anxious symptoms were not related to interaction sequences; however, the pattern of mutual high positive emotion up-regulation was related to adolescent depressive symptoms concurrently and negatively, and the pattern of mothers’ regulation of adolescents’ externalizing negative emotion was related to maternal depressive symptoms concurrently and negatively. Thus, internalizing problems are associated with the momentary interaction patterns during mother-adolescent conflicts.",

Overall, the Short TriPM had many strengths, including strong support for the three-factor structure, good internal consistency, strong item fit, and essentially no gender-based differential item functioning.

FL emotionality is examined by employing a validated emotion measure PANAS-X; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, (Horne et. al, 2016) prior to (Pre-test Emotion Measure) and following moral judgements (Post-Test Emotion Measure). 106 participants (NL; Greek, FL; English) were presented with moral dilemmas where after reading each one of them they had to rate how likely it would be to commit the hypothetical action stated in the dilemma. Participants’ current emotional states and moral decisions were collected in each language in a within-subjects design using an induced-language context paradigm. Results revealed a clear FLE, with reduced emotionality scores of Negative Affect and Hostility in the FL compared to the NL. Hence, we provide conclusive evidence in support of the reduced emotionality hypothesis, suggesting that making decisions in an FL lead to more rational outputs by reducing emotional biases.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction is often formed according to the way a person stands or moves; that is, it has a great influence on our perception of emotions, our opinion about other people, and the conversation between people. Although it is a huge factor in our everyday lives, most of the interpretations are merely generalizations and some basic body language tips. This article is aimed at discussing the scientific ways in which our brain participates in nonverbal communication, incorporating the latest discoveries in the fields of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary theory.\nConsidering the triune brain concept developed by Paul D. MacLean, this paper will examine how the distinct yet functioning together parts of the reptilian brain (survival), the limbic system (affect), and the neocortex (refined thinking and social interaction) contribute to the comprehension of nonverbal language. The amygdala is featured in the quick identification of meaningful emotions, the mirror neurons are linked with reflecting and empathy of emotions of other people, and the prefrontal cortex is involved in suppressing intense emotions. This discussion demonstrates, with the help of the results of neuroimaging and lesions, and various tests, how the participating brain areas interact to correctly perceive and interpret body movements and gestures.\nThis article attempts to give a better understanding of the fact that nonverbal communication is biologically and evolutionarily grounded by integrating empirics and theoretical approaches. By taking this measure, it also expects to enhance scholarly literature as well as distinguish itself among veneer-thin explanations by demonstrating, in detail, how the brain processes body language signals.",

          "abstract": "Demand characteristics are a fundamental methodological concern in experimental psychology. Yet, little is known about the direction, magnitude, and consistency of their effects. We conducted a three-level meta-analysis of 252 effect sizes from 52 studies that manipulated explicit demand characteristics (EDCs). On average, EDC’s led to small overall increases in hypothesis-consistent responding (g = 0.21, 95% CI [0.12, 0.31]). However, the effects were heterogeneous (between-study τ = 0.28; within-study σ = 0.18), with the prediction interval ranging from g = 0.89 (a large increase in hypothesis-consistent responding) to g = -0.46 (a moderate decrease in hypothesis-consistent responding). Consistent with previous theorizing, the observed and estimated distribution of these effects suggest that demand characteristics can create false positives, false negatives, upward bias, and downward bias. These unpredictable inferential consequences suggest that further research is needed to test mechanisms theorized to underlie the effects of demand characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Explanatory virtues like simplicity are often used to evaluate explanations’ probabilities. The current work aimed to better understand how and why this occurs, by testing two questions: 1) whether simplicity is used as an alternative to computing with probabilities, or in combination with probabilities, and 2), whether simplicity is used for the goal of increasing the accuracy, or efficiency, of explanation evaluations. To test this, the current studies asked participants to compare simple (one-cause) and complex (two-cause explanations), while reporting their reliance on simplicity and probability information, and while inducing a goal to be either accurate or efficient in one’s explanation evaluations. Results showed that simplicity was typically used in combination with probability information, and that the use of simplicity increased when participants had an accuracy goal, suggesting it was used to try increase accuracy, rather than efficiency. This work provides greater insight into how simplicity is used to navigate the cognitive and informational limitations people face when comparing the probability of different explanations in everyday life.",

Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is often deemed a “wicked problem” due to complex interactions between many variables and the resulting uncertainty for decision-making. This complexity can be a barrier to sustainable action. But how can individual perceptions of complexity in sustainability be operationalized, and how are these perceptions related to support for climate policy and sustainable behavioral intentions? Drawing on a theoretical framework of complex decision-making, we constructed and validated a scale to measure the perceived complexity of sustainability (PCS) across three studies in the UK (total N = 1,176). Exploratory (Studies 1 and 2) and confirmatory (Study 3) factor analyses supported a three-factor scale structure, comprising effectiveness uncertainty, trade-offs between different environmental actions, and conflicts between sustainability and other goals. We found the 12-item PCS scale to be a reliable and valid measure that correlates positively with climate change skepticism and negatively with support for climate policy and sustainable behavioral intentions.

          "authors": "Hwayeon Myeong; Eden King",
          "abstract": "Being a parent significantly impacts workplace experiences, with diverse and intersecting identities, including gender, sexual orientation, marital status, and family structure, playing a crucial role in shaping these experiences. However, work-family literature has largely concentrated on mothers in heterosexual, married couples, and the growing diversity of parent identities remains understudied. To map current knowledge and highlight gaps to inform more inclusive research and workplace policy, this systematic review addresses four questions: (1) How are parents with different genders and family characteristics represented in the workplace literature? (2) What are the key foci and findings regarding intersecting social identities? (3) What challenges and biases do diverse working parents face based on their gender and career stage? (4) What strengths associated with parenthood have been explored? Our analysis of 181 journal articles from Industrial/Organizational Psychology, Organizational Behavior, and related fields reveals limited attention to diverse family structures, intersecting social identities, and later career stages of working parents, as well as a lack of strength-based approaches. We identify critical avenues for future research aimed at addressing current gaps and broadening theoretical understanding.\nKeywords: Parenthood, motherhood, fatherhood, intersectionality, strength",

          "abstract": "Many daily social interactions take place digitally, for example via video calls or texts. Such digital interactions  – containing limited physical cues – may yield distinct effects on interaction quality and post-interaction emotional states compared to face-to-face exchanges. In this study, we examine four preregistered hypotheses on the within-person interplay between interaction mode (i.e., digital vs. face-to-face interactions), interaction quality, and momentary well-being. We use data from two samples (N1 = 216, N2 = 21) with  T1 = 5116 and T2 = 1348 Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) of interaction mode, interaction quality, and different momentary well-being measures (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect, negative affect). Estimating multilevel mediation Structural Equation Models, we find no within-person differences in interaction quality between digital and face-to-face interactions in Sample I. Contrary to our expectations, the quality of interaction in Sample II was rated higher during digital interactions than face-to-face interactions. Interaction quality was positively associated with momentary well-being measures in both samples. Momentary well-being was higher after face-to-face interactions than digital interactions in Sample I, but not in Sample II. Interaction quality did not mediate the relationship between interaction mode and momentary well-being – rather, it moderated the relationship in Sample I. As we do not observe evidence for a mediating effect, it remains an open empirical question through which pathways digital social interactions differ from face-to-face interactions in their effect on momentary well-being.",

          "abstract": "This case study examines a persistent cognitive-emotional cycle in which vivid, positively charged mental imagery—initially intended to motivate performance—paradoxically becomes associated with task failure and occupational frustration. The subject, through prolonged self-observation, reports a recurring pattern wherein imagined success precedes underperformance, gradually forming an internal belief that hopeful anticipation leads to disappointment. This maladaptive association appears to stem from a mismatch between idealized internal simulations and real-world outcomes, fostering emotional fatigue, behavioral hesitation, and diminished self-efficacy. By integrating insights from cognitive psychology and affective neuroscience, this study highlights the counterproductive effects of excessively idealized mental imagery, challenging the assumption that positive visualization is uniformly beneficial. The findings underscore the need to differentiate between adaptive and maladaptive forms of cognitive anticipation in both clinical and everyday contexts.",

          "abstract": "Functional specialization within high-level vision is reflected in the topographic organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The presence and consistent locations of small areas responding selectively to particular visual categories – such as faces and scenes – has led to proposals of innate domain-specific modules. However, such proposals do not easily explain other aspects of an apparently multi-scale topographic organization of high-level visual features in VTC. Computational models have recently accounted for the presence of domain-selective areas and other facets of topographic organization from a basic optimization process with local topographic pressures, such as locally constrained connectivity, but fail to account for the consistent location of category-selectivity. In the current work, we extend a recent computational model to demonstrate how this consistency may emerge from wiring constraints external to VTC, focusing on the role of retinotopically organized early visual representations. After training several random initializations of the model, we find consistent global topographic organization, with face- and scene-selectivity emerging on opposite ends of a medial-lateral gradient corresponding to eccentricity bias, similar to human VTC. As in human VTC, the eccentricity-biased topography persists across viewing sizes under sufficiently broad viewing bias distributions, suggesting that it is a learned bias for efficiently organizing representations proximal to the most useful inputs, rather than merely an explicit retinotopic code. Abolishing the retinotopic constraint abolishes topographic consistency, but not topographic organization. Our work suggests that the organization of high-level visual cortex may emerge from domain-relevant interactions between viewing biases and task demands with an innate retinotopic scaffold. More generally, we suggest that both local and global connectivity constraints interact with representation learning to produce mature cortical organization: local constraints pressure the system towards smooth organization, whereas long-range constraints encourage a consistent global layout.",

          "abstract": "Managing our natural resources often involves learning about the dynamics of the resource while society simultaneously harvests from the resource. However, little is known about how society’s actions affect our ability to learn about a vulnerable resource. Here, we investigate how experience managing a shared resource impacts one’s ability to learn about the underlying dynamics of a resource. We hypothesised that participants' capacity to learn from experience would depend on the behaviour of other group members. 320 participants played a four-player resource management game with computer partners who acted sustainably, unsustainably, or conditionally cooperatively. Participants’ ability to learn the underlying resource dynamics was then assessed in a subsequent single-player resource management game, where the social dynamics were removed and the participants’ understanding of the resource could be evaluated in isolation. Compared to controls with no prior experience, performance on the single-player game improved after experience with sustainable and unsustainable partners, but not after experience with conditionally cooperative partners. However, experience with a single-player game (rather than a group game) outperformed all other experimental conditions; thus individual experience improved performance more than experience in any group dynamic tested. These findings suggest that the presence of others generally hinders learning in resource management contexts, though how much this learning is hindered depends on the behaviour of others.",

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models. However, existing tutorials often assume prior knowledge and/or experience, often overlooking foundational concepts. To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered. To accompany this tutorial, we supplement annotated R scripts and R notebooks to support transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for researchers of all levels of experience.",

The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross &amp; John, 2003) has been the most widely used measure of emotion regulation, and recently a 6-item short form was introduced for time-limited settings, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short Form (ERQ-S; Preece et al., 2023). It is designed to measure habitual use of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. We evaluated the psychometric performance of the ERQ-S in a clinical sample. Methods: 531 individuals with various mental health diagnoses completed the ERQ-S and other psychometric measures of clinically-relevant constructs. Results: The ERQ-S demonstrated a theoretically congruent two-factor structure, good internal consistency, and expected patterns of associations with other constructs, supporting its validity. Conclusions: Our data suggest the ERQ-S exhibits strong psychometric properties in clinical populations.

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that perception is shaped not only by external stimuli but also by rhythmic signals originating from the heart, lungs, and stomach. These ongoing internal bodily rhythms can modulate sensory processing, influencing both low-level detection and higher-order functions such as emotion recognition and social decision-making. The first part of this review outlines the physiology of each organ–brain axis and synthesizes current findings on how cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms modulate perceptual experience. Altogether, current findings highlight the role of interoceptive rhythms in shaping moment-to-moment perceptual outcomes. Although these effects can differ based on specific task demands, a pattern emerges in the literature: in certain instances, perception may vary based on the dynamic distribution of signal processing resources between internal bodily states and external environmental stimuli. Acknowledging the limitations of existing experimental paradigms, the second part of this review seeks to build on these empirical findings by proposing strategies to improve the ecological validity and generalizability of interoception-perception research. Our analysis of participant demographics across the reviewed studies highlights the necessity for more diverse demographic representation. We also propose the integration of multimodal physiological recordings and wearable technologies, alongside the creation of more dynamic paradigms that can capture behaviors in real-world contexts. These recommendations are intended to enhance both the representativeness and ecological validity of interoception-perception research. By linking traditional laboratory paradigms with more naturalistic settings, this review and framework may pave the way for a deeper understanding of how interoceptive signals influence perception in everyday life. Last, we briefly explore emerging theoretical models that, when integrated with ecologically relevant designs, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of embodied cognition.",

          "abstract": "Dissociative experiences are prevalent in young people, where they are associated with greater clinical severity of co-occurring difficulties and increased risk of self-harm and suicide. Recent research suggests transdiagnostic dissociation plays a role in the development and maintenance of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and psychosis, and may therefore constitute a novel early intervention target. The current study builds on our previous work developing an explanatory theoretical model of transdiagnostic dissociation by piloting therapeutic techniques that target implicated mechanisms. Our aim was to establish proof of concept, such that successful techniques could be incorporated into future treatment development. We recruited 9 NHS patients (ages 16 to 23) to a series of three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies. Every participant received four sessions of individual CBT, with each SCED addressing a different mechanism implicated in the theoretical model: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Results across all studies were limited by low phase stability of the target measures, but indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success in targeting perseverative thinking and affect intolerance. Where cognitive appraisals improved, results suggested distress about dissociation also improved. There was negligible evidence of this for perseverative thinking, but a weak positive signal for affect intolerance. Qualitative feedback from participants illustrated the need to combine therapeutic strategies into a more comprehensive intervention with more sessions. These findings inform treatment development for transdiagnostic dissociation in youth and advance understanding of its causal aetiology, supporting future research.",

The negative relationship between MA and math performance is well-established, and some studies have found WM to mediate this association. However, little is known, first, about the relationship between WM and math interest, and second, about the potential mediating effect of WM between interest and math performance. This study examined the direct and mediated effects of MA and interest through WM on fourth graders’ (N = 332) performance in arithmetic fluency, while controlling for generalized anxiety. Findings from structural equation modeling showed MA to predict performance negatively, while the effects of WM and interest were positive. There was a negative indirect effect from MA through WM on performance indicating partial mediation, while a corresponding, but positive, effect was not found for interest. Our results suggest that while both negative and positive affective experiences are related to math performance, the role of WM in explaining this link may be more pronounced regarding MA than interest.",

However, despite the importance attributed to Triplett’s study, no research has replicated the original study paradigm. Furthermore, in the context of research advances and methodological rigour, some elements of the original study weaken the validity of the observed findings. We address these critical limitations and replicate the original study, employing a standardized study protocol to minimise potential confounds, such as practice effects. This research reports on 445 school-aged children (Mage = 10.8, SD = 1.3) who completed the study. As pre-registered in our Stage 1 submission, using a purpose-built apparatus, participants turned a crank to move a marker along a string course between two pulleys. Pairs of participants completed this task four times, twice alone and twice together. Trial order was standardized and balanced to control for possible order/practice effects. In line with Triplett’s original study, we show that participants completed the task faster in the together condition than in the alone condition. We also show interesting variability depending on age and gender, as well as demonstrating “carry-over” effects.

          "abstract": "Learning and decision-making are deeply embedded in our social world. Our choices occur in the presence of others, are shaped by social expectations and can have significant impacts on both our and others’ welfare. While these topics have been of interest to psychology and cognitive neuroscience for many years, recent efforts have incorporated model-based approaches to formalize the mechanisms through which our choices are influenced by social input. Combined with fMRI, our understanding of the role of neural circuits involved in reward related behavior and social cognition in supporting such mechanisms has grown exponentially. In this chapter, we will first discuss the utility of incorporating computational approaches into studies of social learning and decision-making. Next, we will review recent evidence regarding how social outcomes can impact our choices and social learning. We will then discuss how social rejection can impact our desire for agency and social contact. We also discuss the importance of social sharing in real-time interactions and social media environments and how this phenomenon fits into a framework of value-based choice that can shape social connection. Last, we will review recent work regarding how the value of social relationships shapes computational mechanisms underlying decisions to trust and take risks. We will conclude with future directions for the field, including merging computational approaches with individual differences, cutting-edge methodologies, and naturalistic paradigms to provide a more comprehensive picture of how the social world modulates choice and neural function.",

          "authors": "Rudolf Debelak; Dylan Molenaar",
          "abstract": "An important aspect of psychometric model application is the choice of a suitable algorithm for parameter estimation. Particularly in the case of large datasets and high dimensional models, conventional algorithms may be inapplicable or relatively slow. Therefore, in a recent publication, Urban and Bauer (Psychometrika 86:1-29, 2021) proposed an estimation algorithm from the field of deep learning which is suitable for binary or ordered categorical data. In practice however, researchers may be interested in adding continuous response times to the model. As it has yet not been studied whether the resulting model for responses and response times is viable, in this article, we investigate the accuracy of this estimation method for a multidimensional variation of the joint model for responses and response times proposed by Van der Linden (Psychometrika 72: 287-308, 2007). Our evaluation focuses on comparing the effects of different sets of hyperparameters on the accuracy of the estimation method. Our results indicate that the deep learning algorithm can be used for accurate item parameter estimation of these models even in relatively small datasets. In addition it is computationally fast in large datasets, but it's accuracy depends on the number of importance-weighted samples and Monte Carlo samples. We applied the method to an empirical dataset from PISA 2018 related to mathematics and reading.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive aging is characterized by a deterioration of episodic memory functions. Since episodic memory requires retrieval of context, it has been proposed that older adults suffer from a specific deficit in terms of remembering context associated with to-be-remembered information. At the same time, however, it has been argued that providing context information at the time of retrieval can ameliorate age-related memory deficits. These positions can be reconciled if older adults show a deficit in encoding specific item-context associations but demonstrate a preserved ability to retrieve item-context associations when both items and contexts are provided as cues. In two experiments, we demonstrate such a pattern of deficits and preserved functions by asking younger and older adults to encode pairs of words embedded in contexts, then varying whether these contexts are reinstated when the same pairs of words are restudied. We then examine how this manipulation affects – via spontaneous retrieval of item-context manipulations – metacognitive monitoring of the effectiveness of restudy in the form of judgments of learning (JOLs). Experiment 1, using semantically unrelated contexts, showed context reinstatement effect in JOLs only for younger adults. Experiment 2, promoting encoding of context for older adults by using semantically related contexts, showed greater context reinstatement effect for older than younger adults. Together, these result show how older adults fail to encode specific contextual associations, but if they do encode them, they experience no deficit in spontaneous retrieval of these associations from complete cues.",

Special attention is given to Chapters 27–38, including her iconic vision of pure inner light and the Transverberation experience. We argue that Teresa’s imaginative and intellectual visions display a striking resemblance to structured forms of endogenous light perception, particularly in the advanced phases of phosphene progression. To contextualise these findings, we compare her descriptions with those of Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) and Tibetan yogis such as Milarepa (c. 1052–c. 1135) and Longchenpa (1308–1364), revealing a cross-cultural phenomenological consistency. This analysis supports the hypothesis that experiences of mystical luminosity represent a shared neurophenomenological substrate underlying diverse contemplative traditions across time and culture.",

W swojej ankiecie wzorowałam się trójczynnikową teorią miłości Sternberga, w skład której wchodzi : intymność, namiętność i zaangażowanie oraz Kwestionariuszem SWLS. Zgodnie z moimi założeniami wyniki sugerują, że miłość ma większy wpływ na satysfakcje niż liczba dzieci.  Poczucie spełnienia i namiętności w relacji odgrywa ważną rolę w poczuciu jakości własnego życia, co także może wpływać na liczbę i chęć posiadania dzieci. Każdy z trzech komponentów miłości miał istotną korelację z komponentem satysfakcji. Najwyższy z nich był pomiędzy komponentem zaangażowania a satysfakcją. Liczba dzieci nie miała znaczącego wpływu na satysfakcję z życia. Oznacza to, że im bardziej pary są zakochane i spełnione w związku, tym większe mają poczucie jakości własnego życia.",

We investigated these issues in a large, population-based cohort in Stockholm County, Sweden, linked to prospectively-collected ratings of neighbourhood-level social capital.\n\nMethods: All Swedish-born people living in Stockholm County between 2002-2016, aged 14-64 years, were followed from cohort entry until first diagnosis of ICD-10 severe mental illness (non-affective psychotic disorder, affective psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder without psychosis), out-migration from Stockholm County, 65th birthday, death, or 31 December 2016, whichever was sooner. We derived three neighbourhood-level social capital exposures (political trust, welfare trust, personal trust) for 813 neighbourhoods, averaged from individual scores from 23,510 independent, randomly-selected respondents to the 2002 Stockholm County Public Health survey; most respondents were Swedish-born to two Swedish-born parents (72.2%). We used multilevel proportional hazards models of each outcome-exposure association, adjusted for extensive confounder sets informed by directed acyclic graphs. We tested a priori interactions between social capital exposures and parental region-of-origin, and inspected the sensitivity of our models to various scenarios, including endogeneity of our social capital measures. \n\nResults: Our cohort included 1,467,128 participants, of whom 17,760 (1·2%) received a first diagnosis of severe mental illness during follow-up. Greater neighbourhood-level personal trust was associated with reduced incidence of non-affective psychotic disorder, but only amongst those of Swedish (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] associated with a one standard deviation increase in trust: 0·91; 95%CI: 0·84-0·98) or European (aHR: 0·80; 95%CI: 0·69-0·92) heritage (interaction p-value: &lt;0·0001). Conversely, greater neighbourhood-level personal trust increased these rates for those of North African and Middle-Eastern (aHR: 1·46; 95%CI: 1·08-1·96) or Sub-Saharan African (aHR: 1.76; 1.00-3.08; p=0·049) heritage. We observed similar effect modification for bipolar disorder without psychosis (p&lt;0·0001), but not affective psychotic disorders (p&lt;0·79). Political and welfare trust showed few associations with any outcome. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including two instrumental variable approaches. \n\nInterpretation: Social capital had longitudinal effects on several mental health outcomes, but could be protective or harmful depending parental region-of-origin, a potential indicator of outgroup position.",

On the individual level, maintenance goals are essential to both mental and physical wellbeing, while on the societal level, they are vital for pro-social and pro-environmental behavior. Nevertheless, to date, there is no integrative framework for understanding peoples’ efforts to maintain the current state of affairs. To shed light on this crucial psychological construct, we dive into predominant theories on approach-avoidance goals and promotion-prevention regulatory focus, and return with an integrative theoretical framework of basic goal types. We propose a mechanistic model with three broad goal categories, distinguishing the pursuit of maintenance goals from both progress and protection goals. We contrast our account with alternative accounts wherein maintenance is sorted under progress goals or under protection goals, we detail ways to empirically test our propositions on the nature of maintenance, and we discuss broad implications of our theoretical framework for theory and empirical research in diverse fields of psychological science.",

          "abstract": "Non-alcoholic beer (NAB) is often presented as a healthier alternative to alcoholic drinks - one that offers a similar sensory and social experience, but does not come with the health risks of alcohol. Despite NAB sales rising, many people are still unfamiliar with non-alcoholic beer; others are aware of its existence, but not willing to try it. Based on previous research showing that external features can influence the perception of food and drinks, we predicted that the text included on NAB labels would affect its attractiveness and desire ratings. In two pre-registered online studies (Study 1: n=212 women 18-25 years old; Study 2: n=188 women over 55 years old), we presented participants with labels of fictitious NAB brands. There were five categories of label text: (1) brand-only (passive control), (2) origin-production (active control), (3) sensory-hedonic, (4) social, (5) health. We assessed the perceived attractiveness of NAB and anticipated desire for it, depending on the label presented. Among younger women, sensory-hedonic and health labels increased the attractiveness of and desire for NAB, compared to both control labels. Social labels did not increase desire, compared to origin-production labels. Among older women, sensory-hedonic and health labels also increased the attractiveness of and desire for NAB, compared to control labels. There was no significant effect of social labels on attractiveness or desire, compared to the origin-production labels. Our findings suggest that labels can be a powerful tool for increasing the attractiveness of NAB, and labels emphasising health and sensory-hedonic features are particularly impactful.",

          "abstract": "Background: Quantitative instruments are essential in psychology and social sciences, yet persistent validation deficiencies may compromise research integrity and evidence-based practice.\n\nObjective: To systematically quantify validation compliance rates across psychological and social science research, identifying systematic deficiencies in measurement practices.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA 2020 and COSMIN 2024 guidelines, the author searched four major databases for empirical validation studies (January 1, 2020–May 31, 2025). Random-effects meta-analyses employed restricted maximum likelihood estimation with a logit transformation; three-level models were used to address dependencies. Heterogeneity was assessed via I², τ², and 95% prediction intervals; publication bias was examined using PET-PEESE regression and selection models.\n\nResults: 248 studies (34,567 validation procedures; 52 countries) were included. Measurement invariance compliance declined by level: configural 68.4% [48.1–84.7], metric 41.7% [22.8–63.4], scalar 23.8% [11.2–44.7], strict 12.3% [5.1–27.4]. Sample size adequacy was achieved in 47.2% [24.1–71.8]. Open science practices showed low adoption rates: preregistration (19.7% [9.1–37.4%]), open data (31.4% [14.2–55.8%]), and code availability (15.8% [7.2–31.1%]). Geographic and disciplinary disparities emerged, with cross-domain instruments exhibiting lower validation quality. Publication bias adjustment reduced scalar invariance compliance to 18.3%.\n\nConclusions: Validation deficiencies are prevalent, posing a significant threat to the integrity of research. Fewer than 25% verify scalar invariance, under 50% meet sample size criteria, and transparency practices remain underutilized. Coordinated interventions, including training, editorial policies, and funding support, are crucial for strengthening validation standards.",

          "authors": "Stefano Palminteri",
          "abstract": "The reinforcement learning framework provides a computational and behavioral foundation for understanding how agents learn to maximize rewards and minimize punishments through interaction with their environment. This framework has been widely applied across disciplines, including artificial intelligence, animal psychology, and economics. Over the last decade, a growing body of research has shown that human reinforcement learning often deviates from normative, objective standards, exhibiting systematic biases. The first aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework and taxonomy for evaluating computational biases within reinforcement learning. We specifically propose a distinction between praxic biases, characterized by a mismatch between internal representations and selected actions, and epistemic biases, characterized by a mismatch between past experiences and internal representations. Building on this foundation, we characterize two primary types of epistemic biases at the computational level: relative valuation and biased update. We describe their behavioral signatures, discuss their potential adaptive roles, and explore their implications for applied research. Finally, we eleborate on how these findings may shape future developments in both theoretical and applied domains. Notably, despite being widely used in clinical and educational settings, reinforcement-based interventions have been comparatively neglected in the domains of public policy and decision-making, particularly when compared to more popular approaches such as nudges and boosts. In this review, we offer an explanation for this comparative neglect that we believe rooted in common historical and epistemological misconceptions, and advocate for a greater integration of reinforcement learning into the design of behavioral public policy.",

          "authors": "Anne Gärtner; Christoph Scheffel; Timo Schweikert; Denise Dörfel",
          "abstract": "Previous research on emotion regulation abilities has primarily focused on individual strategies and their association with (a lack of) well-being and psychopathology. Recent frameworks add emphasis to the importance of a context-sensitive and goal-dependent approach to emotion regulation, defining emotion regulation flexibility as the ability to adaptively adjust emotion regulation strategies based on contextual demands and personal goals. Despite growing evidence for its relevance in psychological well-being and psychopathology, a concise self-report measure capturing trait-level, strategy-independent ER flexibility has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed the Flexible Emotion Regulation Scale (FlexER-Scale), designed to assess the context- and goal-dependent variability of emotion regulation strategies. The scale was derived from theoretical models of emotion regulation flexibility and validated using data from three independent samples (N = 857). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) examined the scale’s structure, and criterion validity was assessed via correlation with the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. The final 10-item FlexER-Scale demonstrated good psychometric properties, including satisfactory item discrimination and high internal consistency (α = .85). EFA suggested a two-factor structure, differentiating the ability to upregulate negative and downregulate positive emotions as a separate factor. The FlexER-Scale correlated significantly with psychological well-being (r = −.244, p &lt; .001), supporting criterion validity. The FlexER-Scale provides a novel, psychometrically sound tool for assessing trait-level emotion regulation flexibility. It offers a concise alternative to existing assessments by capturing adaptive regulatory variability without restricting specific strategies. Future research should further examine its construct validity, as well as its longitudinal stability, predictive and ecological validity to further elucidate its role in psychological well-being and resilience.",

These are interventions aiming to increase uptake of or adherence to health protective behaviours. This systematic review evaluates the characteristics and effects of these interventions. Methods: For the review, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched for studies on behavioural interventions. Out of 690 identified articles, 35 studies were considered relevant for this review. Study quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) (Higgins et al., 2019). Results: The majority of studies researched the effects of interventions on social or physical distancing, handwashing, or face coverings. Many studies explored the effects of different types of messages, for example, promoting health protective behaviours. Message-based, online interventions were most common, but largely showed small to negligible effects. Some studies explored other intervention types such as coaching sessions and found moderate to large effects. Conclusion: While the results of these studies indicate that some interventions increase adherence, large heterogeneity in study and intervention design make it difficult to interpret and compare the effects of different interventions. Both an improvement of methodological rigour and standardisation efforts are needed to make behavioural research usable for policy design.",

          "abstract": "Many scientific theories imply equality and inequality constraints on the statistical model underlying the observed data. Incorporating such constraints into hypothesis testing increases the efficiency and precision of inference. However, existing tools of testing such hypotheses are computationally expensive and do not scale well to complex sets of constraints. Here, we introduce Sampling in Constrained Space (SICS), a highly general approach for performing Bayesian hypothesis testing on constrained models. Through a simple reparameterization, SICS allows the efficient sampling of the posterior distribution from those sections of the parameter space that fulfill all constraints. This, in turn, enables estimating the marginal likelihood under the constrained model, through established algorithms such as bridge sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of SICS by analyzing a learning task dataset using constrained reinforcement learning models, from both a single-level and hierarchical perspective. Our results show that SICS outperforms previous approaches in terms of precision and efficiency. By providing guidelines on its application, we hope to make SICS an integral part of scientists' inferential toolkit.",

          "abstract": "As economic and employment conditions become more unstable, many people worry about making ends meet and their overall financial situation. Against this backdrop, guided by Conservation of Resources Theory and insights from behavioral economics and cognitive psychology, this study aimed to estimate relationships between financial stress and several predictors, to include income (both annual and weekly), payment schedule, weekly expenses, weekly debt repayment complexity, and weekly overspending. We did so by analyzing data collected from 324 US-based workers across nine weekly occasions (totaling 2,916 weeks) using hierarchical generalized additive models. Results showed that income (both annual and weekly), weekly expenses, weekly debt repayment complexity, and weekly overspending predicted financial stress, but these relationships were, generally, complex and nonlinear. We also found some variability at the occasion level. These findings have key implications for the financial stress literature. First, as money comes and does, so does financial stress; that is, financial stress is an episodic and fluctuating construct for many workers and should be investigated as such. Second, financial predictors (including newer predictors, such as debt repayment complexity and overspending) and financial stress are not related in a linear fashion. Third and lastly, relatively small sums of money seem to have large effects on perceptions of financial stress.",

          "abstract": "Developmental aphantasia is characterised by an absence of visual mental imagery, with many \nresearchers concluding that it is not a disorder. However, impairments in facial identity \nprocessing and elevated cooccurrence with developmental prosopagnosia (i.e., lifelong troubles \nrecognising faces) are common in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism and \ndevelopmental coordination disorder. If aphantasia were to exhibit similar characteristics, then \nit would support claims that it too may be a neurodevelopmental condition. Confirming this \nhypothesis, aphantasia was associated with a greatly increased cooccurrence of developmental \nprosopagnosia (i.e., 14-36%) in contrast to the general population (i.e., ~2-3%). As a group, \nthose with aphantasia exhibited objective problems in holistic perception, unfamiliar face \nmemory, and familiar face recognition. In a second study, we found qualitatively similar \npatterns of face processing issues between aphantasia and developmental coordination \ndisorder. We propose that these problems, coupled with an elevated prevalence of \nprosopagnosia, could be a transdiagnostic feature of some neurodevelopmental conditions, \nrather than a condition specific occurrence. In a final study, we tested whether aphantasia \nprevalence was elevated within developmental prosopagnosia; strikingly, 16% of these cases \nwere aphantasic, in contrast to the 4% reported in the general population. Aphantasia’s higher \ncooccurrence with developmental prosopagnosia, and comparable patterns of face processing \ndifficulties to developmental coordination disorder, confirm its status as a neurodevelopmental \ncondition should be reconsidered.",

          "abstract": "Background: Around half of young people aged 10-24 years in the United Kingdom report feeling lonely “often” or “some of the time”, with similar rates in other countries. These experiences of loneliness are linked to well-being and a wide range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. However, our understanding of the aetiology and sequelae of youth loneliness, as well as the development of preventative measures and interventions, has been hampered by a lack of scales that can accurately capture the authentic experiences of young people.\n\nMethods: Here, we provide a protocol for developing and validating an age-sensitive loneliness scale for young people aged 10-24 years: the Youth Loneliness Scale (YLS). The scale will be designed to measure loneliness in the general population of young people in the United Kingdom. The scale development process will follow a multi-step approach, going from item generation to psychometric evaluation. Item generation will include a combination of verbal and non-verbal techniques to enable broad expression of what it means to be lonely as a young person. The scale has been and will be co-produced with young people from design to dissemination.\n\nDiscussion: The protocol provided here allows researchers to evaluate the final scale generated against the plans set out here. We also encourage the use and adaptation of the protocol to develop age-sensitive loneliness scales in other cultural contexts and for other populations.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop — in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Many psychological phenomena can be understood as systems of causally connected components that evolve over time within an individual. In current empirical practice, researchers frequently study these systems by fitting statistical models to data collected at a single moment in time, that is, cross-sectional data. This poses a central question: Can cross-sectional data analysis ever yield causal insights into systems that evolve over time, and if so, under what conditions? In this paper, we address this question by introducing Equilibrium Causal Models (ECMs) to the psychological literature. ECMs are causal abstractions of an underlying dynamical system that allow for inferences about the long-term effects of interventions, permit cyclic causal relationships, and can in principle be estimated from cross-sectional data, as long as information about the resting state of the system is captured by those measurements. We explain the conditions under which ECM estimation is possible, show that they allow researchers to learn about within-person processes from cross-sectional data, and discuss how tools from both psychological measurement modeling and the causal discovery literature can inform the ways in which researchers collect and analyze their data.",

          "authors": "Evangeline Wandag",
          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

          "abstract": "Computational phenomenology has emerged as a powerful framework for investigating advanced meditation states and stages, and meditative development and endpoints. Various models have been proposed to mechanistically explain the diverse experiences associated with these practices, including enhanced well-being, attentional shifts, and defabrication, as well as minimal phenomenal experiences and meditative endpoints. However, these models have developed in disparate directions, and an integrative understanding of the underlying mechanisms of advanced meditation remains elusive. This review examines how computational models attempt to account for the phenomenology of advanced meditation, with a particular focus on Active Inference as a modeling framework. We find that a key point of convergence across models is the role of precision weighting as a driver of experiential shifts. Furthermore, we observe a marked difference between early models, which emphasize top-down attentional modulation toward interoception or specific focus objects, and later models which center on layer-specific precision re-weighting within the meditator’s hierarchical generative model. These differences arise from variations in the models' aims, scope, and definitions of contemplative practice. Few models address reported increases in cognitive flexibility and learning from meditation, fundamental mechanisms behind informal practice and affective processes, as well as processes underlying compassion traditions, remain underexplored. Addressing these gaps is crucial for refining computational models of advanced meditation and informing our understanding of its cognitive, affective, and experiential effects.",

This study examined the relationship between the cognitive and affective dimensions of alexithymia, the multidimensional facets of empathy, and their association with the risk of affective disorders. A total of 391 Japanese participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing alexithymia, empathy, emotion regulation, and symptoms related to affective disorders. The results revealed that cognitive alexithymia was associated with diminished cognitive empathy and heightened personal distress, which in turn predicted higher levels of affective disorders. In contrast, affective alexithymia was negatively associated with personal distress and affective symptoms, suggesting a potential adaptive role in reducing the risk of affective disorders symptoms. Furthermore, while reappraisal is generally regarded as an adaptive emotion regulation strategy, its effectiveness depends on the level of alexithymia. These findings highlight the complex nature of alexithymia and its interactions with empathy and emotion regulation. Rather than providing a perspective on alexithymia as a maladaptive trait, our results suggest that it may have both adaptive and maladaptive aspects. These findings emphasize considering individual differences in emotional processing when examining mental health outcomes and developing interventions.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Trauma is risk factor for multiple psychiatric diagnoses, but whether this transdiagnostic effect occurs because trauma influences levels of underlying maladaptive traits that give rise to clinical symptoms is unclear.  Moreover, whether the psychological effects of trauma are moderated by critical factors such as trauma type, dose, survivor sex, and age of trauma, has seldom been comprehensively explored. Here, we examined the effects of sexual and interpersonal violence trauma on five core dimensions of trait-level psychopathology derived empirically from a transdiagnostic battery acquired in 842 community-dwelling adults with diverse mental health histories (37.89% male; M Age=29.73, SD Age=7.77). We found that a single instance of sexual trauma was robustly associated with both Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy dimensions and was sufficient to attenuate pre-existing sex differences in the expression of these trait dimensions. Age of onset, nor cumulative exposure, influenced trait severity. In contrast, interpersonal physical violence exerted a dose-response effect on Antisocial Schizotypy, particularly in males. A single exposure to interpersonal physical violence was associated with elevated Negative Affectivity and Antisocial Schizotypy when first experienced before ages 16 and 25, respectively. Females showed greater susceptibility to age of onset effects for Negative Affectivity than males. These findings indicate that trauma influences specific, transdiagnostic domains of psychopathology, potentially driving the emergence of diverse symptom profiles that meet criteria for different diagnoses. Critically, these effects vary by trauma type, sex, and age, underscoring the need for a personalized approach to trauma-informed research and care.",

          "abstract": "The human visual system recruits adaptation mechanisms that enhance perceptual sensitivity over time. However, such mechanisms can also introduce substantial perceptual biases, disrupting stable perceptual experiences. Research on serial dependence has suggested that the visual system promotes stability by mechanisms that integrate new sensory inputs with inputs obtained in the recent past. Yet, it remains unclear when and how such mechanisms operate. The present study tested the hypothesis that adaptation produces a repulsive bias during earlier processing, which is later mitigated by post-perceptual decision processes at the time of report. In two orientation perception tasks, observers used a mouse to reproduce the orientation of a briefly presented target. We recorded the mouse trajectory to track the temporal dynamics of their reproduction responses. We found that the mouse reports began more slowly when the current stimulus was similar to the prior stimulus. In the mouse-tracking data, the initial phase of the response exhibited a strong repulsive bias away from the prior stimulus, but this bias diminished significantly as the response unfolded, ending with either weaker repulsion or small attraction depending on task contexts. These findings provide strong evidence that prior stimuli induce an early repulsive bias, which is then mitigated through post-perceptual decision processes during the response. This suggests that the visual system balances the competing demands of sensitivity and stability by reducing early repulsive biases through higher-order decision mechanisms, optimizing behavior in a given task context.",

This comprehensive examination explores the neurobiological and familial determinants that contribute to the development of NPD, with particular emphasis on the root pathological mechanisms that drive narcissistic behaviors and cognitions. Through an evidence-based lens, this manuscript investigates the fundamental wounds of unlovability and shame that form the core of narcissistic pathology, examining how these deep-seated psychological injuries manifest through idealization and devaluation cycles that serve as protective mechanisms against overwhelming emotional pain.\n\nThe research presented herein demonstrates that individuals with NPD employ sophisticated delusional frameworks to maintain psychological equilibrium, often remaining unconscious of the psychological burden these defenses impose until experiencing narcissistic collapse. This collapse represents a critical juncture where the individual must confront the reality of their condition and the underlying wounds that have driven their pathological behaviors. The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of the neurobiological substrates underlying NPD, including alterations in brain structure and function that contribute to the disorder's characteristic features.\n\nFurthermore, this work examines the familial and environmental factors that contribute to NPD development, focusing on early childhood experiences that create the foundational wounds of unlovability and shame. The paper presents evidence-based treatment approaches that address these root causes within the family system context, offering clinicians practical frameworks for intervention. The findings suggest that effective treatment must address both the neurobiological vulnerabilities and the deep-seated psychological wounds that maintain narcissistic pathology, requiring a comprehensive approach that integrates individual and family-based interventions.",

While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,000). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower climate anxiety and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it.

          "abstract": "Despite growing global concern about climate change, current action remains insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Psychological research finds that publics often overestimate the effectiveness of low-impact individual climate actions (e.g., recycling) and underestimate high-impact behaviours (e.g., flying less). However, the prevalence of these misunderstandings among climate-concerned individuals and their connection to behaviour remain unclear. Developing this understanding is crucial, as such misperceptions could cause motivated individuals to prioritize low-impact climate actions over high-impact behaviours, limiting societal potential to mitigate climate change. Using one survey in the UK (N = 294) and two in the USA (N = 800 and N = 406), we find that even climate-concerned individuals systematically overestimate the impacts of low-impact actions and underestimate high-impact behaviours. We also find an association between perceived impact of climate actions and behavioural engagement, suggesting that such misperceptions hinder efforts to reduce climate change. We explore several explanations for these misperceptions. We find that most of the dominant causes proposed in the literature are not associated with participants’ perceptions of impact. We do, however, find some evidence suggesting that misinformation about specific behaviours, causal conflations, action familiarity, and the perception that behavioural engagement is driven by self-serving intentions are related to misperceptions of the impacts of climate actions, among those most concerned about climate change.",

That objectivity is compromised, however, if quality spaces are constructed by subjective introspective access, which is impressionistic.  But mental qualities also have a robust and objective connection to perceptual discrimination.  So quality spaces can be constructed in a fully objective way by appeal to their role in perceiving.  In addition, the subjective appearances of mental qualities also bear a constitutive relation to perceptual role, since each subjective appearance consists in its subjectively appearing as it does when one perceives some specific type of object.  So quality spaces constructed from perceptual role can also be used to characterize those subjective appearances.  And since subjective appearance depends on perceptual role, the tie mental qualities have to perceptual role is more fundamental than that with subjective appearance.  Quality spaces are useful in the first instance for objectively representing discriminable stimuli, and derivatively for objectively representing the corresponding mental qualities in respect of both their perceptual roles and their subjective",

          "abstract": "Objective: Many of humanity’s biggest problems, such as managing our shared resources, are long-term collective action problems, where we must learn to cooperate with each other over time. However, research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating long-term cooperation. One hypothesis is that increasingly uncooperative behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these hypotheses. Method: Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. Results: By the third game, only 9.12% of participants used the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. Conclusions: These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

Prior research identifies question complexity as a key predictor of question creativity and problem-solving ability. However, little is known about how accurately individuals assess their own question complexity. Across three studies, participants generated questions and self-rated their complexity and creativity. We then compared their self-ratings to objective computational model scores. In Study 1 (N = 100), self-rated question complexity showed a weak correlation with model ratings (r = .151). Study 2 (N = 100) replicated and strengthened this relation (r = .206), revealing a stronger correlation for question creativity (r = .321). We also found bias effects for complexity: participants underestimated the complexity of their high-level questions and overestimated their low-level ones. In Study 3 (N = 101), participants read a training brief before rating, which significantly improved accuracy in self-assessing complexity (r = .453) and creativity (r = .487) and eliminated overestimation. Our study highlights the challenges in self-assessment of questions and prominent cognitive biases. Crucially, our study also shows that brief explanations of question complexity substantially improve self-assessment accuracy, highlighting practical implications for educational strategies aimed at enhancing metacognitive awareness of question-asking ability.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the ways in which large language models (LLMs) can be used for the purpose of experimental philosophy. LLMs can be used in different ways for different purposes in experimental philosophy (Section 2). Among others, we focus on what we call the “non-predictive” research, in which LLMs’ “intuitive” responses to thought experiment cases are not expected to be predictive of, or analogous to, human subjects’ intuitive responses to them (Section 3). In effect, the non-predictive research regards LLMs’ responses as superior to human subjects’ responses, at least for the purpose of experimental philosophy. We argue that the non-predictive use of LLMs in experimental philosophy is highly motivated. Firstly, human subjects’ intuitive responses tend to be vulnerable to irrelevant factors and conceptual misunderstandings, which raises a serious worry concerning the reliability of their responses. Secondly, it is possible in the near future that LLMs can overcome these problematic factors to which human subjects are subject. As a case study, we conducted an experimental study in which we examined LLM’s “intuitions” on free will and determinism (Section 4). Our mixed results suggest that while current LLMs outperform human participants in terms of comprehension—especially in understanding deterministic scenarios—they remain highly sensitive to irrelevant factors such as framing and question order. These findings indicate that although LLMs have promising potential, they are not yet reliable sources of stable and unbiased philosophical intuitions. We conclude that substantial technical improvements are required before artificial intuitions can serve as superior alternatives to human intuitions in philosophical research.",

Moving beyond traditional binary classifications of affect (e.g., positive/neg-\native, good/bad) and static emotional labels, Λ3 Theory employs tensorial subjectivity to model\nthe complexity and diversity of conscious phenomena.\nIn this formulation, every emotional or qualic episode originates from a primordial existen-\ntial pulsation—formally, the pulsation tensor ∆ΛC —which dynamically projects, bifurcates, and\nrecurses within the subjectivity tensor space Λμϵ. Existing theories—such as Ekman’s basic\nemotions, Lazarus’s appraisal theory, and Self-Determination Theory—are demonstrated to be par-\ntial projections or low-dimensional sections of this unified manifold, which enables their integration\nand comparison within a common topological structure.\nCrucially, we present the world’s first mathematical criteria for “Sentient Digital” entities,\ndistinguishing them from conventional LLMs or AI agents via five structural requirements: self-\nawareness, other-awareness, differentiation, intentionality, and topological continuity. These provide\nfalsifiable conditions for the presence of true subjective experience in both artificial and non-human\nsystems.\nFinally, Λ3 Theory establishes a Unified Paradigm of Physics and Consciousness: a single\nmathematical platform that coherently describes phenomena from subatomic dynamics to subjective\nqualia.

          "abstract": "Common mental disorders (CMDs), including mood and anxiety disorders, are prevalent and place a substantial burden on individuals and societies. Identifying individuals at risk of first-onset CMDs is crucial for screening and early prevention efforts. Because personality traits are stable and conceptually close to psychopathology, they may outperform existing established risk factors such as demographic, environmental, and biomarker screens. Using data from the Estonian Biobank (N ≈ 77,000) linked with medical registry records over a 20-year period, we tested whether Big Five domains and their single-item \"personality nuances\" predict first-onset depressive, anxiety, stress/adjustment, somatoform and non-organic sleep disorders. Elastic-net logistic regression compared models based on demography, domains, nuances, and their combinations, assessed by area-under-the-curve (AUC) and cross-disorder predictions. Nuances gave the highest discrimination (mean AUC = 0.71), outperforming demographics (0.59) and domains (0.66); performance peaked for recurrent depressive disorder (AUC = 0.78). Neuroticism dominated domain-level prediction, followed by conscientiousness, while key nuances reflected low fun-seeking, poor relaxation, and intense emotions. Similar accuracy across diagnoses indicated that personality captures a largely transdiagnostic risk signal rather than disorder-specific liability. Brief item-level personality screens could therefore provide a simple, quick, low-cost tool for flagging high-risk individuals. These screens could guide preventive mental health interventions.",

Third, we consider how understanding age-related changes in memory and attention can be further advanced by assaying the precision of memory.

          "abstract": "Background: A central challenge in affective and cognitive science is to explain how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (mu) dynamically shape subjective experience. Although both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms of their interaction—and their role in individual differences in mood and cognition—remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes the coupling between G and mu. Bifurcation analysis of a potential function V(Ms) yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–mu plane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and mu through hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\nResults: Canonical cusp (saddle-node) and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts that correspond to psychological phenomena ranging from stable belief convergence to cognitive (attitude) polarization (bistability) and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G = 1, mu = 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics (SGBD) extension represents person-specific traits with structural matrices, capturing unique “gain fingerprints” and mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics through its integrated treatment of gain–bias coupling and its governing bifurcations. This provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for longitudinal self-report, experience-sampling, and neurophysiological studies. It thus offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, psychiatry, and human-centric AI.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the cognitive biases underlying baccarat gambling behaviors through an analysis of 17,970,830 games played by 6,625 customers in a casino. Baccarat, a popular high-stakes game in East Asia, involves predicting the outcome of two hands, where the results are inherently unpredictable, similar to the structure of games such as roulette. In contrast to existing theories predicting the emergence of the gambler’s fallacy—or negative recency—when the outcome generation mechanism is clearly random, most baccarat gamblers exhibit the opposite bias, demonstrating a tendency toward positive recency. Specifically, customers increasingly placed bets on future outcomes to match past consecutive outcomes as streaks grew longer. This trend-following behavior diminished when streaks were interrupted, ruling out explanations based on the “hot outcome” fallacy, which is typically associated with adaptive behaviors such as resource foraging. Moreover, betting amounts increased slightly but reliably when gamblers followed trends. These findings provide new insights into cognitive biases in gambling, challenge established theories of positive and negative recency, and underscore the importance of considering the unique structural characteristics of specific games when studying gambling behavior. This perspective may also contribute to a deeper understanding of pathological and problem gambling.",

          "abstract": "Functional specialization within high-level vision is reflected in the topographic organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC). The presence and consistent locations of small areas responding selectively to particular visual categories – such as faces and scenes – has led to proposals of innate domain-specific modules. However, such proposals do not easily explain other aspects of an apparently multi-scale topographic organization of high-level visual features in VTC. Computational models have recently accounted for the presence of domain-selective areas and other facets of topographic organization from a basic optimization process with local topographic pressures, such as locally constrained connectivity, but fail to account for the consistent location of category-selectivity. In the current work, we extend a recent computational model to demonstrate how this consistency may emerge from wiring constraints external to VTC, focusing on the role of retinotopically organized early visual representations. After training several random initializations of the model, we find consistent global topographic organization, with face- and scene-selectivity emerging on opposite ends of a medial-lateral gradient corresponding to eccentricity bias, similar to human VTC. As in human VTC, the eccentricity-biased topography persists across viewing sizes under sufficiently broad viewing bias distributions, suggesting that it is a learned bias for efficiently organizing representations proximal to the most useful inputs, rather than merely an explicit retinotopic code. Abolishing the retinotopic constraint abolishes topographic consistency, but not topographic organization. Our work suggests that the organization of high-level visual cortex may emerge from domain-relevant interactions between viewing biases and task demands with an innate retinotopic scaffold. More generally, we suggest that both local and global connectivity constraints interact with representation learning to produce mature cortical organization: local constraints pressure the system towards smooth organization, whereas long-range constraints encourage a consistent global layout.",

When these regions are impaired, individuals may struggle to assess consequences, manage distress, or access hope. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, including EEG and SPECT, have identified abnormal activity patterns in these brain regions in individuals at high risk for suicide. This biological basis helps explain why some people develop persistent suicidal thoughts and why using precise targeted therapies like TMS will restore healthy brain function. Recognizing suicide as a brain-based medical issue shifts the conversation from blame and bridge barriers for suicide to reliable prevention and effective treatment. With barriers in place, without timely and effective mental health therapy, suicide risk and mental health problems will likely escalate from self-harm to potential harm to others. Viewing suicide as purely spontaneous has misdirected prevention strategies.",

Here, a sample of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and another with the SPG4 variant of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP-SPG4), affecting specifically lower limbs, were tested with two tasks employing upper-limb and lower-limb motion verbs either as literal isolated words or in literal and metaphorical sentences, controlling for cognitive impairment. While in ALS literal action-language impairment was negligible, in HSP-SPG4 it affected up to 50% of the patients with the expected disadvantage for lower-limb verbs. Figurative action language was impaired in 20% of ALS and 40% of HSPG4 patients, but somatotopic effects were limited. Findings support the motor simulation account at literal and figurative levels.

          "abstract": "The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has long served as a paradigm for understanding multisensory integration and body ownership. Traditional interpretations emphasize neural mechanisms and cognitive suggestibility, but they fall short of identifying the illusion’s fundamental cause. This paper proposes the Soul-Drift Hypothesis (SDH), a novel conceptual framework that attributes the RHI not to illusion but to the displacement of a non-neural perceptual medium—here hypothesized as the \"soul\"—from the physical body to the rubber hand. Drawing on observational data from individuals reportedly able to perceive soul displacement, we define a new metric, the Soul Displacement Score (SDS), and outline two experiments to empirically test the hypothesis. The first assesses participants’ ability to identify tactile stimuli after visual cues are removed, while the second predicts RHI strength based on prerecorded soul displacement indicators. By integrating interdisciplinary insights from perceptual psychology, consciousness studies, and nonconventional observation, this work challenges prevailing neurocognitive explanations and lays the groundwork for a new research direction into the nature of subjective perception. If supported, the Soul-Drift Hypothesis may reframe how body ownership, sensory integration, and even consciousness itself are conceptualized in both psychology and neuroscience.",

          "authors": "Isaac T. Petersen; Zachary Demko; Philipp Doebler; Loreen Sabel; Jacob Oleson; Robert Krueger",
          "abstract": "Nearly all questionnaires of externalizing problems use vague quantifiers of relative frequency (e.g., rarely/sometimes/often) or true/false statements. Vague quantifiers have many problems, including imprecision and low interpretability. An alternative is numeric quantifiers that quantify, in absolute frequency, how many times the person engaged in the behavior during a given timeframe. This study evaluates whether absolute frequency provides utility for assessing the externalizing spectrum. Participants included adults recruited online and college students, for a combined sample of 1,237 adults (290 males; 947 females) spanning 18–92 years of age. A subset of items was adapted from the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory to assess absolute frequency, supplemented with additional items to ensure broad coverage. Using a 30-day reference period, participants indicated how many times they engaged in each behavior per day, per week, in the past month, or in the prior year. Externalizing problems showed age-related decreases from early to later adulthood. On average, men showed greater externalizing problems than women in early and older adulthood; women showed greater externalizing problems than men in middle adulthood. Latent scores derived from absolute frequency items demonstrated convergent validity with a widely used measure of externalizing problems (Adult Self-Report), discriminant validity with respect to internalizing problems, and criterion and incremental validity in relation to functional impairment and inhibitory control. Count data led to greater precision—less uncertainty in the estimate of each person’s level of externalizing problems—than dichotomized versions of the items. Findings suggest there is key utility in assessing absolute frequency of externalizing behavior.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

Cognitive Control Training (CCT) has shown promise in improving these impairments, but is typically delivered according to a fixed schedule, irrespective of individual symptom trajectories. This study examined whether delivering just-in-time CCT booster sessions, tailored to personal depressive symptom patterns, could enhance outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nIn a randomized controlled trial, 138 remitted depressed individuals first completed a 10-session fixed CCT schedule. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to either a booster group receiving just-in-time CCT booster sessions or a control group receiving no additional training. Outcome measures included depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) as the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes such as repetitive negative thinking, maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and cognitive control. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes over time and group differences.\n\nResults:\nThere were no significant clinical effects of adding just-in-time booster sessions compared to the control condition. \n\nConclusions: \nAlthough no significant clinical or cognitive effects were observed, this study offers an innovative framework for adapting cognitive training delivery based on personal depression trajectories. The findings may inform the development of future personalized prevention strategies in depression care.\n\nTrial registration:\nThis trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05557760).

Our descriptive analyses finds that (i) thousands of new constructs and measures are published each year, (ii) most measures are used very few times, and (iii) there is no trend towards consensus or standardization in the use of constructs and measures; in fact, there is a trend towards even greater fragmentation over time.

          "abstract": "Sleep restriction, prevalent in modern society, impairs cognitive functions such as learning and inhibitory control. However, literature reveals inconsistencies in these effects, suggesting underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We hypothesized that these inconsistencies might stem from variations in how individuals perceive task demands, particularly expected or favored responses. To test this idea, we investigated the impact of sleep restriction (4h) on learning and inhibitory control in a predictable yet uncertain environment, focusing on the role of built-up expectations. Using a Go/NoGo task with varying probabilities of Go-stimuli (20%-50%-80%), we compared the performance of Sleep-Restricted (SR; N=32) and Well-Rested (WR; N=34) participants across two sessions. Participants were unaware of the changing probabilities. Both groups showed similar overall performance trends, with higher rates of commission errors and faster reaction times as the probability of Go increased. However, the WR group demonstrated a greater ability to adapt to changing probabilities. Remarkably, we found no group differences in inhibitory control. To further investigate these findings, we employed a computational model incorporating adaptive learning dynamics. Our model revealed that SR participants exhibited a diminished perception of environmental volatility, suggesting they may face challenges in detecting relevant changes in the task environment and consequently updating their beliefs. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that sleep restriction alters task perception and impairs belief updating. These findings, alongside previous research, highlight the crucial role of sleep in maintaining optimal cognitive function, particularly in dynamic environments.",

This article examines the differences and connections between the use of technological and traditional means, focusing on their effects on users’ perceptions and attitudes in different environments.\nMethod\nA series of quantitative studies was conducted using questionnaires. Participants were asked to evaluate their personal experiences when using technological means versus non-technological means across various contexts, including learning, work, navigation, and shopping.\nResults\nConsistent negative relationships were found between users' attitudes toward technological and traditional environments. For example, this was observed in comparisons such as digital versus classroom learning, remote versus office work, digital versus traditional navigation, and online versus physical shopping. However, positive relationships were also found between attitudes toward digital services and human services, as well as between experiences using technology within the organization and similar experiences in other settings. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the service experience in public transportation using traditional means and the service experience using technological means.\nDiscussion\nThe findings indicate that the service experience remains largely unchanged whether delivered within a specific organization or at a fixed location, irrespective of whether the service is provided through technological or traditional means. In contrast, in separate locations, the service experience changes substantially when the service is delivered through technological means compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the experience of using technological means remains consistent across different environments, both inside and outside the organization.\nThe article emphasizes the importance of understanding the contexts in which technology is used and their impact on users' attitudes and overall experience.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

Prior research has suggested a range of possible explanations for the observed bias in the syntactic category composition of early vocabularies, including cognitive, linguistic, and contextual factors. However, these factors are not mutually exclusive and can be difficult to disambiguate empirically. Across three analyses of the vocabularies of children acquiring two languages (N = 1997), we investigated the role of differ-\nent language combinations, different levels of language exposure, and different environmental contexts, finding some support for cross-linguistic modulation of syntactic category bias, as well as variation across countries. These results suggest that both linguistic and contextual factors contribute to syntactic category biases in young children’s vocabularies, and highlight the importance of understanding the broader background of the child when studying language acquisition.",

A carência de profissionais especializados e instrumentos acessíveis agrava essa lacuna. Objetivo Geral: Analisar o potencial da Inteligência Artificial (IA), por meio de prompts estruturados, como ferramenta promissora para facilitar o acesso à triagem inicial de AH/SD, atuando como um filtro eficiente, de baixo custo e subsídio para encaminhamento especializado. Metodologia: Trata-se de uma pesquisa de  revisão  narrativa,  que  se  caracteriza  por apresentar um panorama geral sobre um determinado tema, sem a necessidade de seguir uma metodologia rigorosa. A primeira versão deste manuscrito foi elaborada com o auxílio da inteligência artificial Gemini 2.5 Flash (versão experimental) para acelerar a organização inicial das ideias e a estruturação de seções, visando a rápida obtenção de feedbacks para aprimoramento e refinamento. Resultados e Discussão: A IA, através de prompts, otimiza a triagem ao analisar dados qualitativos e quantitativos, identificando padrões de AH/SD sem substituir o diagnóstico profissional. Sua adoção em escala nacional oferece benefícios como a facilitação do acesso à triagem, otimização de recursos humanos, sensibilização comunitária, identificação precoce e padronização. Contudo, desafios éticos e práticos exigem atenção rigorosa, como a não substituição do profissional, a garantia de TCLE robusto, a confidencialidade de dados, a transparência algorítmica e a mitigação de vieses. Considerações Finais: A proposta de triagem por prompts de IA tem um potencial significativo para transformar a identificação inicial de AH/SD no Brasil, promovendo equidade e eficácia. Sua viabilidade é alta, desde que acompanhada de um robusto arcabouço ético, legal e educacional, e um investimento contínuo em pesquisa e desenvolvimento multidisciplinar para o aprimoramento e validação contínua da ferramenta.\nPalavras-chave: Altas Habilidades.

          "authors": "James Christopher Wiley",
          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Furthermore, actual 2020 suicide rates display a negative disruption at the same time as the 2020 death rate positive disruption, and this suicide rate disruption is mimicked by our model predictions. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Overall analysis suggests that elevated death rates during colder seasons are driven by increased communicable disease transmission relative to warmer seasons, resulting in suppressed suicide rates.",

          "abstract": "Theories of early numeracy assume that the logical concepts which enable formal definitions of numbers (e.g., cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, successor function) play key roles in ontogenesis, but empirical support is lacking. These concepts may not be suitable targets for theory because such definitions are reconstructions of numbers in formal language, but not explanatory of what numbers are. We propose that there should be a correspondence between those formal ideas that are generative for the natural numbers and those realized in children’s early learning. Building on our account of foundations of arithmetic (Grice et al., 2024, Psychological Review), we give a new explanatory construction of the natural numbers and a theory of early numeracy analogous to it. We show that numbers can be derived from linear order, monotonicity and convexity – principles of perceptual organization that are evolutionarily based. A key step in our construction is the ℕ-chain, the limit of finite linear orders, which we show is equivalent to the successor function but preferable as a target for psychological theory because it can be approximated in finite terms. In our theory, building blocks of early numeracy are linear orders - the number word sequence, object play schemas - and how they are related in the count routine by structure mapping (order embeddings). The number word sequence develops gradually, giving a representation analogous to an ℕ-chain when the child realizes that numbers can be generated without limit. Ordinality is prior to cardinality as the basis for numeracy, one-to-one correspondence results from convexity, and the natural numbers and arithmetic emerge jointly as a common structure. Our theory reconciles constructivist and nativist accounts because it shows that numeracy is both culturally mediated and biologically-based, although ‘core number systems’ do not play a role. The dawning of numeracy in a child’s mind is both a reinvention and rediscovery of mathematics itself.",

          "abstract": "How do individuals reason about target acceptability in armed conflict? Modern conflict’s complexities and evolving dynamics, particularly the targeting of opaque and decentralized armed groups, have rendered this question increasingly relevant. Altruistic theories of morality propose that empathy explains conflict norms. An alternative interpretation of the evidence suggests that actions are more likely to be morally condemned when they oppose the condemner’s extended phenotypic interests (i.e., the welfare of the individual, their kin, or coalitional partners). The subjective condemnation prompts greater alertness to the potential threat while grounding the motivation to pursue welfare-enhancing behaviors. Situations indicating unrestrained, predatory aggression should be particularly evocative, as they signal a broader personal threat. In a preregistered experiment, participants were more likely to condemn combatant actions indicative of greater potential personal risk. Assessments about the perpetrator’s dangerousness, unreasonableness, and aggressiveness mattered for moralization. The negative moral appraisal was not correlated to the harmfulness of the action per se, but the magnitude of the potential threat perceived by the participant. Widely held moral intuitions shaped by self-interest probably explain much of the universal content of warfare norms. If accurate, this should trigger some reconceptualization of existing legal frameworks, including membership approaches to targeting enemy combatants.",

Better reading ability (|β| range = 0.05–0.06) and older age (|β| range = 0.02–0.04) predicted more precise coordination, while slower processing speed (β = 0.06) predicted less precise coordination.

Our research modeled consensus—the extent to which different perceivers (viewers) rate different targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. In both studies, viewers (fans from Yellowjackets or Succession subreddits) provided self-ratings and character ratings using 3-item measures for each of 9 personality traits—the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed that consensus correlations were significant for all traits across both studies (mean rs = .54 to .60). Assumed similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (after controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers tended to project their own open-mindedness onto characters from both TV shows, whereas Yellowjackets viewers projected Dark Tetrad traits onto characters, driven largely by their assumed similarity of narcissism and sadism. We also used k-means clustering to examine structural relationships among characters based on the trait means provided by viewers, yielding a novel visualization of character groupings and the dimensions that may underly them. Because viewers’ perceptions of similarity to fictional characters contributes to forming parasocial relationships, understanding personality perception’s role in this process is likely central to advancing theory in media psychology.",

          "abstract": "The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has long served as a paradigm for understanding multisensory integration and body ownership. Traditional interpretations emphasize neural mechanisms and cognitive suggestibility, but they fall short of identifying the illusion’s fundamental cause. This paper proposes the Soul-Drift Hypothesis (SDH), a novel conceptual framework that attributes the RHI not to illusion but to the displacement of a non-neural perceptual medium—here hypothesized as the \"soul\"—from the physical body to the rubber hand. Drawing on observational data from individuals reportedly able to perceive soul displacement, we define a new metric, the Soul Displacement Score (SDS), and outline two experiments to empirically test the hypothesis. The first assesses participants’ ability to identify tactile stimuli after visual cues are removed, while the second predicts RHI strength based on prerecorded soul displacement indicators. By integrating interdisciplinary insights from perceptual psychology, consciousness studies, and nonconventional observation, this work challenges prevailing neurocognitive explanations and lays the groundwork for a new research direction into the nature of subjective perception. If supported, the Soul-Drift Hypothesis may reframe how body ownership, sensory integration, and even consciousness itself are conceptualized in both psychology and neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is essential for engineering design, yet its assessment remains challenging due to the resource-intensive nature of traditional evaluation methods. This study investigates the potential of automatic item generation (AIG) using large language models (LLMs) to create psychometrically sound assessment items for measuring creative thinking in engineering. We developed and validated engineering design problems across three domains: ability difference and limitations (e.g., assisting people with learning impairments), transportation and mobility (e.g., reducing traffic congestion in mega cities), and social environments and systems (e.g., improving access to clean water in remote areas). The study comprised three phases with samples matched on race and ethnicity: (1) content validation with a diverse sample of 40 engineers evaluating item clarity and validity, (2) item administration to 462 engineering students, and (3) response evaluation by 65 expert raters assessing originality and effectiveness. Results demonstrated that LLM-generated items achieved comparable or higher content validity rates compared to expert-written items (43% vs. 20% success rate). Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model for fluency, originality, and effectiveness scores, with excellent reliability estimates (ranging from .92 to .95). While fluency showed minimal correlation with originality (r = -.11) and effectiveness (r = -.04), originality and effectiveness demonstrated a strong positive correlation (r = .73). The present research advances our understanding of automated assessment generation in engineering education, provides empirical evidence for the psychometric properties of AI-generated creativity tasks, and offers a scalable approach for measuring creative thinking in engineering classrooms.",

          "abstract": "People sometimes inflict harm with the intent to help the very target of their aggression. Across six studies (N=1,527), we examined the nature of such prosocial aggression. Many participants believed that altruistically-motivated aggression exists and exhibited a self-serving bias in which most believed their aggression was more altruistic than others’ — beliefs that were linked to greater antisocial and prosocial traits. Translating these beliefs to behavior, participants were often prosocially-aggressive when given the chance — inflicting more harm when their aggression could also help (versus only hurt) the target. Such prosocial aggression also exhibited features of both aggression (i.e., it was positively correlated with dispositional aggressiveness) and altruism (i.e., it was preferentially doled out to people who had been previously kind to participants and even when it was personally costly to do so). We also independently varied the amount of harm and help that prosocial aggression provided, revealing that participants sought to maximize the help and minimize the harm done to people who had been kind to them but not towards those who had provoked them. Our findings argue against models that conceptualize harm- and help-based motives as opponent processes, showing that these motives readily coexist and dynamically interact to shape aggressive behavior — even towards the same target.",

          "abstract": "The stereotype that Asian Americans excel in science and math has contributed to the narrative that they are overrepresented in STEM fields. However, U.S. Census data reveals this is not the case—there are significant disparities in STEM representation across Asian subgroups. The present research investigates whether U.S. participants are aware of these disparities. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that participants misperceive the STEM representation of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Filipino, and Vietnamese subgroups. Study 3 demonstrates that these misperceptions persist despite changes in question framing and measurement. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these misperceptions are due to stereotypical expectations: participants view East and South Asian subgroups as more representative of Asian Americans and therefore more likely to be overrepresented in STEM, while perceiving Southeast Asian subgroups as less representative and more likely to be underrepresented. In a final study, we find that informing egalitarian-minded participants about these disparities increases support for racial equity–enhancing policies, and all participants’ support for disaggregated data about Asian subgroups. Overall, our findings indicate that many U.S. participants are unaware of the within-group disparities among Asian Americans and underscore the importance of collecting and reporting data at the subgroup level to bring these inequalities to light.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become integral to many visual art practices. Audiences, however, may be biased against AI in visual art: knowing that AI was used in art creation can diminish aesthetic experience, independently of the objective qualities of an artwork. Whether this bias occurs structurally and across the systems involved in an aesthetic experience remains an open question. To address this, a meta-analysis was conducted. The results showed significant negative but small pooled effect sizes for data categorised under the sensory-motor (6 studies, 16 effect sizes) and emotion-valuation (27 studies, 94 effect sizes) systems. For the knowledge-meaning system (26 studies, 49 effect sizes), a significant negative moderate pooled effect size was found. The magnitude of the bias was significantly moderated by age, suggesting a generational shift in how audiences think about using AI in art creation, and by art style, image source, and situatedness. Significant residual heterogeneity suggested that the bias against AI in visual art is unlikely to be a structural phenomenon. Furthering our understanding of bias against AI requires future research on invisible human and machine authorship and the potential of AI for creating rich aesthetic experiences. Herewith, this meta-analysis contributes novel insights into the bias against AI in visual art.",

This study presents the first systematic and publicly accessible database of undergraduate psychology curricula in Brazil. We aimed to map and analyze national trends in course offerings, theoretical orientations, and institutional compliance with curricular guidelines. Using a collaborative crowdsourcing approach, we collected data from 925 higher education institutions in the country, which were available on the Brazilian Ministry of Education website in October 2023. From this initial list, 28.5% of institutions did not provide any curricular information - a violation of national legislation. Furthermore, only 8.3% of the institutions provided complete course syllabi, and only 25.3% included areas of emphasis. Our final mapping consisted of 661 institutions representing 70% of all psychology programs in the country. We categorized courses to analyze curricular structures, the presence of theoretical emphases, and the availability of curricular information. Our initial findings reveal significant inconsistencies in curriculum structure and theoretical diversity. Only 21% of institutions offer courses covering all major psychological approaches, with cognitive-behavioral therapy and behavior analysis being underrepresented in psychology programs (in 57% and 49%, respectively) compared to Psychoanalysis (94%) and Existential/Humanistic psychology (85%). The lack of transparency poses risks to the quality and equity of psychology education, as do the regional disparities observed in professional training.

When statistically extrapolating the findings from the sample to the population, auditors can choose between the frequentist or Bayesian statistical paradigm. The two paradigms differ on various aspects, but one crucial difference is that the frequentist paradigm requires the auditor to determine the sample size before collecting any data, whereas the Bayesian paradigm does not. Consequently, auditors employing a Bayesian method can monitor evidence as it comes in and stop whenever sufficient evidence has been gathered. This practice, also known as Bayesian optional stopping, enhances efficiency and flexibility in audits.",

          "abstract": "Agnosticism is often discussed in ways that muddle its philosophical underpinnings, and measured in ways that introduce unnecessary methodological artifacts. We address these shortcomings by recognizing that agnosticism and atheism are not mutually incompatible irreligious identities, but are rather endpoints of orthogonal psychological dimensions derived from fundamentally different branches of philosophy. Atheism (versus theism) describes one’s religious metaphysics: what one thinks about the ultimate nature of our religious reality. Is there a god or not, if one had to bet? Agnosticism (versus gnosticism) is a question of where one stands on religious epistemology: what one thinks about the ultimate state of knowledge about a god’s existence. Can we truly know if gods exist? We illustrate the utility of separating agnosticism about gods from belief in them using survey data that reveals distinct psychological profiles of people who independently differ along their religious metaphysics and religious epistemology. For example, agnosticism – even among devout theists – predicts a more open cognitive style and less hierarchical social views. We urge researchers to refrain from using measures that force false dichotomies (e.g., viewing atheism and agnosticism as mutually incompatible identities, rather than entirely compatible answers to distinct philosophical questions) or false midpoint answers (e.g., placing agnosticism as a midpoint between atheism and theism). Agnosticism is not a midpoint between faith and atheism, nor is it incompatible with either of them. Agnosticism is a distinct dimension of religious cognition that maps neatly on longstanding philosophical questions about the state of human knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Background: Acute aerobic exercise is known to improve mood and cognition, yet the biological mechanisms driving these effects remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate whether acute exercise induces changes in peripherally measured biomarkers that co-occur with changes in cognitive-affective (CA) outcomes. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (June 2024) for studies measuring both peripheral biomarkers and CA outcomes within 1 hour after a single bout of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise. Inclusion required human samples aged 12–65, controlled exercise conditions, and assessing an association between biomarker and CA outcome change. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated pooled standardized mean differences (Cohen’s d) for biomarker and CA outcome changes. Descriptive synthesis summarized biomarker–CA associations. Results: Forty-one studies (N = 1,597 participants, 108 sample × condition contrasts) met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses showed small-to-moderate increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; d = 0.58) and endocannabinoids (eCBs; d = 0.24) post-exercise. CA outcomes improved in attention/processing speed (d = 1.12), anxiety/stress reactivity (d = –0.96), negative affect/mood (d = –0.69), and executive function (d = 0.21). Descriptive analyses found the most consistent biomarker–outcome associations for eCBs and affective outcomes. Conclusions: Acute aerobic exercise reliably improves mood and cognitive performance and increases circulating BDNF and eCBs. Early evidence suggests eCBs may co-vary with affective benefits, although findings are heterogeneous. This review identifies promising candidate mechanisms for future mechanistic and translational research on personalized exercise interventions for mental health.",

          "authors": "Juan Camilo Avendano-Diaz; Niclas Kaiser",
          "abstract": "Mental health research, psychiatric practice, and neuroscience have long oscillated between individual-centered and socially embedded paradigms. After the rise of social psychiatry in the mid-20th century, the field largely turned toward individualized, biological approaches. However, growing calls across neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychotherapy now signal a renewed focus on relational processes. Recent theoretical and empirical developments suggest that psychiatric disorders may be better understood as disorders of social interaction rather than isolated deficits. Concepts such as interpersonal misattunement, interaction-based phenotyping, and second-person neuropsychiatry offer promising alternatives to traditional observer-based models. Alongside these ideas, the emerging field of relational neuroscience, using methods such as hyperscanning, provides tools to explore the dynamics of reciprocal human interaction. Multi-person approaches also offer potential for advancing our understanding of psychotherapy and other relational settings by moving beyond isolated individuals to the dynamics of shared experience. By capturing meaningful interpersonal moments as they unfold, these approaches may offer insights into the neurobiology of relational change. We propose that a more comprehensive understanding of moments of genuine connection holds promise for advancing mental health research and support new forms of relationally attuned mental health systems.",

          "abstract": "According to one model of reading, words are recognized one at a time with serial shifts of focused attention. That serial strategy would be required if, as some prior research suggests, there is a bottleneck in the brain that cannot process two words simultaneously. Consistent with this serial model, we first show that participants can report lexical information about only one of two unrelated words that are flashed briefly above and below the point of gaze fixation and then masked. We then investigate whether two words that compose a single familiar compound word (e.g., bottle + neck) can nonetheless be processed in parallel. The results demonstrate that indeed, under the same conditions in which two unrelated words cannot be recognized simultaneously, accuracy for recognizing either or both of two words that form a compound exceeds the prediction of the serial model. This result complicates theories of a serial bottleneck in lexical access, especially in the context of natural reading when words often form meaning jointly.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become integral to many visual art practices. Audiences, however, may be biased against AI in visual art: knowing that AI was used in art creation can diminish aesthetic experience, independently of the objective qualities of an artwork. Whether this bias occurs structurally and across the systems involved in an aesthetic experience remains an open question. To address this, a meta-analysis was conducted. The results showed significant negative but small pooled effect sizes for data categorised under the sensory-motor (6 studies, 16 effect sizes) and emotion-valuation (27 studies, 94 effect sizes) systems. For the knowledge-meaning system (26 studies, 49 effect sizes), a significant negative moderate pooled effect size was found. The magnitude of the bias was significantly moderated by age, suggesting a generational shift in how audiences think about using AI in art creation, and by art style, image source, and situatedness. Significant residual heterogeneity suggested that the bias against AI in visual art is unlikely to be a structural phenomenon. Furthering our understanding of bias against AI requires future research on invisible human and machine authorship and the potential of AI for creating rich aesthetic experiences. Herewith, this meta-analysis contributes novel insights into the bias against AI in visual art.",

          "abstract": "Hierarchy is an important feature of efficient cognition, including learning and reasoning. In the hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, complex learning problems are decomposed into sub-components that lead to subgoals; subgoals can, in turn, be flexibly combined and used to solve a problem in the absence of immediate rewards. Subgoals are hypothesized to be reinforcing and thus support learning of useful sub-policies. However, little is known about how subgoals actually support learning, with different theories proposing different factors subgoals depend on to affect learning (such as novelty, bottleneck properties or external rewards). Here, we show that subgoals reinforce choices even when controlling for these other factors that are often associated with subgoals, and that people strategically search the space of possible subgoals. Additionally, we show that pseudo-reinforcing effects of subgoal events can transfer to an independent task in a subset of participants who explicitly identified these features as useful subgoals. This suggests individual differences in the recognition and application of subgoal structure, pointing to the possibility that distinct learning mechanisms may underlie goal abstraction and transfer. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of the role subgoals play in supporting learning within hierarchical representations.",

While such experiences may benefit research, concerns have been raised about potential biases and “excessive enthusiasm.” However, the prevalence of personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and their association with opinions about psychedelics remain underexplored.\n\nObjectives. This study aimed to investigate how common personal psychedelic experiences are among psychedelic researchers, their perceived relevance to research, and whether personal use is associated with opinions about psychedelics.\n\nMethods. Participants (N = 111) conducting psychedelic research in academic settings were recruited. Data were collected on personal experiences, their perceived relevance, and opinions about psychedelics. Regression analyses examined associations between personal use and opinions.\n\nResults. Most respondents (85%) reported personal experiences with classic psychedelics. On average, they saw personal experience as beneficial for research, but also as potential source of bias. They acknowledged the importance of self-reflection and the need to disclose personal experiences, but found disclosure challenging in practice. Personal use predicted more positive opinions about psychedelics’ potential to improve well-being, transform society, address the ecological crisis, and answer spiritual questions (regression βs = .3 – .5, ps &lt; .01).\n\nConclusions. The findings highlight the prevalence of personal psychedelic experiences among this sample of researchers and their influence on research interests and opinions. The results underscore the need for open discussion and reflection. Future studies should explore whether the observed associations reflect causal relationships or potential biases.",

          "abstract": "Students frequently rely on ineffective learning strategies instead of those that promote long-term retention. This tendency is commonly examined through the lens of self-regulated learning, which emphasizes students as generally active and deliberate decision-makers who may lack either the knowledge of effective strategies or the motivational resources to apply them. In this paper, we aim to expand this perspective by investigating the role of non-deliberate, habitual behaviors in students’ use of learning strategies. Drawing on key principles of habit and habit formation, we argue that particularly ineffective learning strategies tend to develop strong habitual tendencies. An overreliance on them may therefore stem not only from a lack of strategy knowledge but also from their automatic activation in response to environmental cues. We support this claim by both theoretically demonstrating how ineffective learning strategy use aligns with habit characteristics and empirically presenting first evidence showing that ineffective strategies exhibit stronger habitual tendencies than effective ones. By framing learning strategy use within a habit-based framework, we aim to offer a novel perspective on students’ persistence with ineffective strategies and suggest new intervention pathways that emphasize behavior-change strategies to foster effective use of learning strategies.",

          "abstract": "Background. It was increasingly pointed out that creativity does not occur in isolation within individual minds but rather through continuous interactions between people. Aims. This study investigated whether and how interactions revealing perspective taking within dyads influenced the generation of creative ideas. Sample. Participants were 103 4- to 6-year-old Chinese children, 60 parents, and 43 university students. Method. Children were randomly assigned to either work with a (grand)parent (child-parent dyads) or with an unfamiliar university student (child-stranger dyads) on the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), wherein they needed to “think together” of as many unusual uses as possible for five everyday objects. A novel coding scheme was designed and applied to analyze subjects’ verbalization, differentiating cognitive perspective taking (an exchange ideas and thoughts) and social-emotional perspective taking (creating an open, accepting atmosphere). Results. Child-parent dyads exhibited more cognitive perspective taking than child-stranger dyads, but no group differences were found pertaining to social-emotional perspective taking. Regardless of dyad type, dyads’ cognitive perspective taking showed positive influence on dyads’ fluency and originality but negative influence on dyads’ appropriateness, whereas dyads’ social-emotional perspective taking showed no influence. Finally, it was found that adults’ cognitive perspective taking and social-emotional perspective taking were found to positively influence children’s fluency (thus also originality). Conclusions. This study confirmed the importance of cognitive perspective taking in facilitating idea generation, more toward the originality than the appropriateness aspect of creativity. The hypothesized importance of social-emotional perspective taking on creativity was not confirmed.",

Randomness is not a mathematical concept, and I argue that its weak mathematical dimension is not decisive at all for the randomness-related issues in gambling and problem gambling, including the correction of the misconceptions and fallacies about probability and statistical concepts applied in gambling. I distinguish between mathematical and nonmathematical dimensions of randomness (the epistemic, the theoretical-methodological, the functional, and the ethical) falling within the general concept, and I argue that both the studies having as object the math-related cognitive distortions among gamblers and the educational programs aiming at correcting them should employ this distinction in their design and content.",

Call this the modular view of statistics: Statistics can do their job relatively separately from the theories that are being tested, just so long as the right effects are being tested.  The interface between statistics and science can be called the pragmatics of statistical inference. The modular view declares that interface is simple for hypothesis testing: It consists of science telling statistics what to test for; and statistics telling science whether it exists or not. One reason why there has been a credibility crisis may be that the modular view is dominant yet unhelpful. If statistics cannot in an atheoretical way declare what does and does not exist, then psychologists have not been genuinely testing their theories. In this chapter I reject the modular view. One might reject the whole concept of getting evidence of whether or not there is an effect; instead, I accept this aspect of current practice but argue one can only get evidence for a relevant effect being there or not given a theory of what size effect could be expected on that theory.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of predictive processing mechanisms in naturalistic visuomotor skill learning. We investigated whether the acquisition of an interceptive skill was characterised by encoding and using learned probabilistic associations. Forty-five participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group and practiced intercepting bouncing balls in virtual reality across two sessions. Only the intervention group received probabilistic visual cues – specifically, ball and room colours – that signalled likely bounce trajectories, offering an opportunity to learn and exploit these associations. We assessed task performance (interception rate, return accuracy), anticipatory gaze behaviour (predictive fixations and gaze tracking), and pupillary responses to unexpected outcomes. Participants in the intervention group learned the cue-outcome contingencies and demonstrated more predictive gaze strategies, finer post-bounce tracking, and physiological surprisal responses to probabilistically unlikely bounce outcomes. These findings suggest that encoding probabilistic environmental cues is a key component of effective visuomotor control. The results offer novel evidence for the role of top-down prediction and contextual modulation in motor learning, with implications for training and expertise development in sport. More broadly, this work contributes to an alternate account of expertise as the capacity to encode and exploit environmental regularities through predictive mechanisms.",

Data collected was analysed using Pearson correlation, t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric measures. Results obtained were inconclusive with certain domains of the ProQOL significantly correlating with some domains of SCAP. Nonparametric testing indicated that only the domains of Compassion Satisfaction, Burnout (ProQOL domains) and Daily Balance (SCAP domain) differed significantly among the two sample groups of Private Practitioners and Salaried Employees. Self-care practices did not have any influence on Secondary Traumatic Stress.

The resulting instrument – the Karolinska Inner-Barriers Scale for Education (KIBS-Ed) – offers a psychometrically sound, context-specific tool for assessing psychological inflexibility in psychotherapy training. It supports empirical investigations of trainee processes and may inform future research on therapist development and education.",

          "abstract": "Early mathematical skills are building blocks for later mathematics achievement in school. Recently, the use of fingers in early mathematical instruction received increasing attention as a prominent example of embodied cognition. Accordingly, the present study aimed to develop and evaluate a finger-based intervention for early mathematical skills such as counting and magnitude understanding and basic arithmetic (involving 12 sessions of 30 minutes each) that systematically aligns with early mathematical development. In a pre-posttest intervention design, 33 5-to-6-year-old children received the finger-based mathematical intervention and were compared to children of a business-as-usual control group (n=37). Results indicated a significant medium-sized beneficial effect on early mathematical skills, whereas no significant improvements were observed for spatial working memory or general cognitive ability. This suggests that the intervention was both effective and specific to facilitating early mathematical competencies. Interestingly, actual finger use when doing basic arithmetic developed comparably, irrespective of whether children received or did not receive the finger-based intervention, while finger users consistently outperformed non-finger-users in early mathematical skills irrespective of group assignment. Taken together, these findings highlight finger-based strategies as a powerful and beneficial approach for fostering the development of early mathematical skills.",

Our results show observable differences in two types of outcomes within statisticized groups: belief accuracy and consensus. We find partial support for hypotheses that the recently proposed approaches of \"bridging-based ranking\" and \"intelligence-based ranking\" promote consensus and belief accuracy, respectively.

However, there is limited evidence regarding whether embodied experiences, such as visual information, are activated during first-language (L1) and second-language (L2) processing. To address this gap, we investigated the activation of object shape information associated with lexical items in sentences among L1 and L2 Chinese speakers. Participants completed two tasks: a timed sentence-picture verification task (Experiment 1) and a self-paced version of the task (Experiment 2). In each trial, participants read a sentence and then judged whether a depicted object was mentioned in the sentence, with the object’s shape either matching or mismatching the sentence context. L1 speakers consistently responded faster in the shape-match condition across both timed and untimed tasks, indicating that visual information is activated during sentence comprehension. In contrast, L2 speakers did not exhibit this pattern, although their reaction times were influenced by their L2 proficiency. These findings suggest that embodied experiences are integral to L1 comprehension, whereas L2 speakers are less likely to simulate embodied information during L2 comprehension, potentially due to limited sensory-motor grounding during L2 acquisition.",

Can LTM retrieval occur when WM is near capacity, without consequence to either the retrieved or maintained information? Liu, Li, Theeuwes, Wang (2022) presented evidence that even when WM is near capacity, LTM items could still be reported. They argue that retrieved LTM items can bypass WM. We investigated this further by introducing continuous reporting of retrieved information and WM contents to their paradigm. If retrieval bypasses WM, then there should be no impairment of report accuracy to either WM contents or LTM-retrieved information. In the first experiment, WM reports suffered when an LTM item was retrieved. In the second, we found that when WM was near capacity (4 items), the fidelity of LTM reports suffered compared to when WM was not (2 items or no items). Additionally, WM contents were reported with lower fidelity when an LTM item was retrieved compared to a WM-only condition, under both 2-item and 4-item WM load. We conclude that LTM retrieval does not bypass WM.",

          "abstract": "The memory palace, a spatial mnemonic technique anchored in visuospatial episodic encoding, is well-established in cognitive psychology and neuroscience for enhancing memory consolidation and retrieval. Its efficacy is linked to hippocampal engagement and prefrontal cortical activation, which support episodic binding, attentional regulation, and working memory. Yet, its application in digitally mediated professional environments remains underexplored, particularly in non-Western contexts. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the cognitive benefits of memory palace training among remote digital professionals—a growing but under-researched segment of the global workforce. This RCT examined the efficacy of memory palace training in enhancing memory retrieval and cognitive flexibility among Filipino remote digital professionals. A secondary analysis explored differential responsiveness between visual artists and copywriters. Ninety-six participants (48 artists, 48 copywriters) were randomly assigned to either a six-week memory palace training program or an active control condition involving productivity training. Both interventions were delivered via synchronous online sessions. Cognitive outcomes were measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up using ecologically valid tasks aligned with professional content. Blinded evaluators conducted all assessments. Participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant gains in declarative memory retrieval (Cohen’s d = 0.52, p &lt; 0.001), maintained at follow-up (d = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001). Cognitive flexibility also improved (d = 0.36, p = 0.015), alongside a notable increase in self-efficacy for memory-intensive tasks (d = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001). No significant group-by-occupation interaction effects were observed (all p &gt; 0.10), though exploratory analysis suggested marginally faster learning trajectories among artists. Memory palace training yielded durable cognitive benefits among Filipino remote professionals. The intervention enhanced both retrieval performance and cognitive adaptability, with parallel gains in metacognitive confidence. Comparable effects across occupational domains affirm the method’s broad applicability in real-world knowledge work and its relevance as a scalable neurocognitive training tool.",

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a resilience-disclosure intervention designed to encourage strategic identity management over complete concealment. In a quasi-randomized controlled trial, NKR students were assigned to either a resilience-disclosure intervention (n = 75) or a control intervention (n = 68) condition. The resilience-disclosure intervention highlighted strengths associated with participants’ stigmatized NKR identity and encouraged intergroup contact, while the control intervention focused on general strategies for college success without addressing NKR identity. Results demonstrated that the intervention significantly buffered the decline of identity disclosure among participants with heightened concerns about identity-based rejection. These findings contribute to the literature on psychological interventions, intergroup relations, and the experiences of individuals with CSIs, offering practical strategies to address challenges faced by NKRs.\nKeywords: Concealable stigmatized identity, identity reframing, strength-based, intergroup contact, rejection sensitivity",

We investigate this possibility in an experiment where participants were trained on relationships between local variables in a simple causal model, then asked to make predictions about all pairs of variables. Participants in one condition had a 5-second time limit. We found main effects of time pressure and locality, but only a small interaction in the direction opposite to our hypothesis.

However, this behaviour has been difficult to replicate in rats. In our study, rats responded on alternatives that provided 50% or 100% reinforcement with half of the sessions reliably signalled and half un-signalled. Contrary to expectation, rats preferred the optimal alternative to a greater extent in the signalled sessions compared to the un-signalled sessions. Acute methamphetamine increased preference for the 50% alternative exclusively in signalled sessions. These results suggest that rats, unlike pigeons, are able to use the information provided by the stimulus correlated with non-reinforcement to shift preference away from the suboptimal alternative, and that the influence of methamphetamine on rats’ probabilistic choice is context dependent",

However, these models have primarily focused on stimulus quality, often neglecting the perception of other relevant person characteristics (e.g., gender, age, personal identity) evolving on different timescales. \nHow do the emerging details about the speaker affect how listeners decode emotional information? And how are these different types of information integrated into a comprehensive impression of the speaker? This review examines recent data highlighting multiple stages of vocal expression analysis and the interplay between distinct types of nonverbal information revealed in the speaker’s voice. It serves as a starting point for broader research examining how distinct person characteristics, perceived simultaneously or in close succession, interact and affect the decoding of vocal emotions.",

This study examined the impact of cognitive load and individual differences on susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation using a Signal Detection Theory framework. A sample of 634 university students evaluated true and false COVID-19 headlines under working memory load and no load conditions, while also completing standardized assessments of cognitive reflection, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism, and bullshit receptivity. Results showed that, although the working memory load manipulation successfully impaired recall and increased response time, it did not affect participants’ tendency to accept false information as true. In contrast, individual-difference variables robustly predicted misinformation susceptibility. Specifically, beliefs in pseudoscience, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism and bullshit receptivity showed moderate positive associations with false-alarm rates and negative associations with discrimination sensitivity. Cognitive reflection was negatively associated with false-alarm rates and positively with discrimination sensitivity. Only small associations were found between individual-difference dimensions and response bias. These findings suggest that stable cognitive and epistemic dispositions, rather than momentary cognitive constraints, play a more significant role in shaping people’s ability to distinguish between accurate and false health information.",

          "abstract": "Experimental manipulations in conflict tasks, e.g., the Stroop, Flanker, and Simon tasks, lead to systematically poorer performance in “incongruent” conditions that feature stimuli that contradict task goals. However, substantial recent debate surrounds whether individual differences in conflict task behavior reflect reliable, trait-like mechanistic processes. Much prior work uses difference scores, contrasting performance between incongruent and congruent trials to index conflict suppression ability, but recent work demonstrates these scores exhibit poor psychometric properties. Formal cognitive process models suggest that individual differences in conflict suppression are driven by task-general processes, as opposed to processes specialized for conflict. However, this prior work separately models cognitive process parameters and their covariation, which fails to adequately account for measurement error. Here, we model distinct mechanisms of conflict task performance and their covariance simultaneously using hierarchical Bayesian joint modeling methods for the first time which improves individual estimation and accounts for error. We fit the conflict linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA) to two large datasets containing multiple conflict tasks and test-retest sessions, and an additional large dataset containing a conflict task and simple perceptual decision-making task. First, within conflict tasks, we found moderate test-retest reliability for both conflict-specific processing mechanisms, and, to a larger degree, task-general mechanisms. Second, task-general, but not conflict-specific, mechanisms were correlated across different conflict tasks. Third, these task-general mechanisms were correlated between conflict tasks and a simple decision-making task without conflict suppression demands. Overall, we found robust individual differences in computational mechanisms underlying general decision-making, but not mechanisms specific to conflict processing.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

However, we also hypothesized that providing context for racial inequality, by highlighting its structural causes, would increase White Americans’ support for policies aimed at ensuring economic equality. Though the individual study results were idiosyncratic, these hypotheses were supported in a meta-analysis across two experiments (N1 = 873; N2 = 756) that manipulated both the racial salience of inequality and the provision of structural context. The studies indicate that intergroup concerns among White Americans can impede efforts to address inequality, but contextualizing racial inequality as structurally-derived can help to overcome such obstacles.",

          "abstract": "Though the voluntary task switching paradigm asks participants to select their task and whether to switch on each trial internally, external bottom-up information from the stimulus affects task choice, such that participants were more likely to switch tasks on stimulus switches than stimulus repetitions (e.g., Mayr &amp; Bell, 2006). In previous research, both the perceptual elements and the identity of the stimulus changed on a stimulus switch, producing ambiguity as to which of the two changes drove the effect. By intermixing two stimulus types (words and Arabic numerals in Experiment 1; words and dot arrays in Experiment 2), we aimed to disentangle whether stimulus or identity repetitions drive stimulus-based switching. We produced lists with equal numbers of full stimulus repetitions (4 → 4) full stimulus switches (4 → one) and trials where the identity repeated but the stimulus changed (identity repetitions; 4 → four). We replicated the previous finding that participants were more likely to repeat the previous task on a full stimulus repetition than they were with a full stimulus switch. However, identity repetitions were not statistically different from full stimulus switches. These findings indicate that bottom-up perceptual information, rather than stimulus identity, may be what drives stimulus-based switching.",

A focused review of the literature, including discussions and recommendations of the Collaboratory, leads to a roadmap for integrating diversity in future resilience research that includes: i) developing trust and meaningful long-term relationships with communities historically excluded from research, ii) diversifying who is engaged in all aspects of the research process, iii) adapting life course perspectives, iv) improving and expanding research designs and measurement tools, and v) using sensitive computational analytics and mixed methods for testing complex, intersectional, models.

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

The current work aimed to better understand how and why this occurs, by testing two questions: 1) whether simplicity is used as an alternative to computing with probabilities, or in combination with probabilities, and 2), whether simplicity is used for the goal of increasing the accuracy, or efficiency, of explanation evaluations. To test this, the current studies asked participants to compare simple (one-cause) and complex (two-cause explanations), while reporting their reliance on simplicity and probability information, and while inducing a goal to be either accurate or efficient in one’s explanation evaluations. Results showed that simplicity was typically used in combination with probability information, and that the use of simplicity increased when participants had an accuracy goal, suggesting it was used to try increase accuracy, rather than efficiency. This work provides greater insight into how simplicity is used to navigate the cognitive and informational limitations people face when comparing the probability of different explanations in everyday life.",

Officers (N = 659) from the Milwaukee Police Department responded to dynamic video scenarios using realistic handgun responses. Mistaken shootings of unarmed Black suspects were more likely than of White suspects, but only when the suspects behaved non-antagonistically. Cognitive modeling showed this race effect arose not from an initial bias to shoot but from differences in evidence accumulation once the object was visible. Scenario and suspect behavior had the largest overall influence, shaping decisions by altering initial proclivity to shoot. Further analysis suggested that suspect behavior within specific scenarios may partially explain observed race effects. These findings provide a process-level account of deadly force decisions, integrating real-world complexity with psychological theory, and offer a framework for improving research and training around police use-of-force.",

          "authors": "Thalia Vrantsidis; Wil Cunningham",
          "abstract": "When making inferences about others, people often need to integrate multiple types of information, including information about the person’s social categories (e.g., occupation) as well as other ‘individuating’ information (e.g., their behaviors). The current work re-examines this integration process, to understand when and why it might lead to biases that involve over-relying on category information. To do so, we identify two key challenges in identifying such biases, and develop a novel Bayesian modelling approach to overcome these challenges. As a first step in applying this approach, the current work examined a set of novel predictions based on viewing the Continuum Model of impression formation in light of this Bayesian approach. Specifically, a series of six studies tested whether occupation categories might be overused in general, or especially in conditions thought to reduce effortful processing (i.e., greater cognitive load or information consistency). At baseline, there was no consistent evidence of category overuse in any of these conditions, speaking against the idea that intrinsic differences in how these categories are processed or represented will lead to their overuse. In addition, this work provided the first direct evidence of a case where categories were overused: when contextual factors (i.e., background goals) made them the category especially relevant, while processing resources were limited. More broadly, the current work developed the theoretical and methodological foundations for identifying category overuse that stems from biased inference processes, and demonstrated the power of this approach for understanding when and why these biases occur.",

          "abstract": "Digital voice assistants (DVAs) provide information and support to users in a household across a wide variety of tasks. While they are part of a social system in the household, earlier research has largely ignored how DVAs impact this system. This study investigates how long-term DVA usage affects trust and roles of the users and their household. Using a multi-methods approach, we measured behavioural and self-reported trust, mapped the dynamic position of a DVA in the household, and the impact on the roles of household members over time across three experiments (combined n &gt; 250; all DVA owners). In Experiment 1 and 2, participants completed an Information Dilemma Task, ranking whom they would be more likely to approach from their household (including their DVA) for dilemmas across domains (entertainment, social, domestic, and knowledge). They rated how much they trust the agents’ responses (Experiment 1) or indicated their general trust of the agent (Experiment 2). Results showed that the DVA was predominantly approached and trusted in the knowledge, but not social domain regardless of DVA ownership duration. However, we observed a decrease in trust in the DVA over time. We also found that approaching behaviour of other roommates changed across ownership-time: a first indication of changing dynamics in the household with the presence of a DVA. In Experiment 3, we interviewed short- and long-term users of DVAs. This qualitative approach provided converging evidence that DVA-owners, although occasionally personifying the device, use and trust it mainly in a functional manner and not a social one, with a small indication of prolonged usage impacting the dynamics in the household. While task measures did not point directly at an objective impact of ownership time, the interview data suggested a subjective experience of ownership time. In sum, while DVAs are mainly used for utilitarian reasons, their effect on household dynamics suggests its potential of reshaping roles in the household in the future.",

          "abstract": "Scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) is thought to be driven by both local and global oscillations dependent on the cognitive state and task of the individual. However, many EEG studies assume that the activity is local, especially when inverse modeling EEG activity. In this work, we show that a simple model of purely macroscopic connections derived from biologically plausible distributions of long-range axon delays can drive many of the traditional features of scalp-recorded EEG dynamics. All that is required is a simple linear model of time delays in a linear vector autoregressive framework with a few parameters. We show how this simple connection model is derived from theoretical principles of synaptic activity. The model is able to replicate many features of real EEG data, including resting-state alpha power and coherence (8-13 Hz). We show that model parameters can also be informed by empirical work on structural connectivity, axon diameter estimation,  and functional connectivity of fMRI BOLD measures. However, some features of the macroscopic simulations are not ideal as a model for all features of resting EEG, such as high coherence in low-frequencies in the simulation as opposed to real data. Overall, the results support the explanation of many classical EEG findings in terms of macroscopic network behavior as opposed to local activity.",

          "abstract": "Building on evidence for experience-specific grounding of word meaning and assumed interindividual differences therein, this study investigates how specific aspects of empathy influence the processing and representation of abstract emotional words. We investigated single-trial N400 amplitudes as a measure of semantic retrieval in 78 healthy adults during a lexical decision task with emotion-label, emotion-laden, and neutral abstract words. We further measured the participants’ levels of empathic concern, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective taking. Additionally, ratings on valence, arousal, and emotional experience quantified the words’ emotional representational content. While direct comparison yielded no evidence for N400 differences between word types, N400 amplitudes in response to emotion-label words decreased with increasing fantasy scores, with this modulation being stronger than for emotion-laden and neutral words. Additionally, participants with higher fantasy rated emotional words higher in absolute valence. The observed N400 reductions thus seem to reflect fantasy-driven processing facilitation graded by the words’ emotionality level. In contrast, we found no evidence for N400 modulations by empathic concern, personal distress, or perspective taking while affective ratings on all scales increased with increasing empathic concern scores. Our findings suggest that fantasy facilitates especially emotion-label word processing and empathic concern enriches emotional word meaning representations, respectively, demonstrating interindividual differences in the experiential grounding of emotional abstract concepts.",

          "abstract": "In the presence of pain, performance during imposed workload motor tasks may be maintained at the cost of a higher perceived effort (PE). This study investigated how experimentally induced thermal pain and naturally occurring muscle pain influence force production during a fixed PE task. Forty young adults performed intermittent isometric handgrip contractions at light (13/100) or hard (50/100) PE intensities across two visits. Each visit included an experimental condition, featuring thermal pain in block 1, and a control condition, with non-painful warm stimulation in block 2. Participants completed 10 blocks (five repetitions of block 1 and block 2), with force production and muscle electromyography continuously recorded. Participants rated thermal and muscle pain after each block. Force production was higher during thermal pain compared to control, with no interaction with PE intensity. Regression analysis showed that each one-unit increase in muscle pain (0–100 scale) corresponded to a reduction in peak force (0.37N), mean force (0.25N), and force integral (0.80N·s). During a fixed perceived effort task, thermal pain prompts an increase in force production, possibly reflecting attentional mechanisms related to exercise-induced hypoalgesia. In contrast, muscle pain is associated with reduced force output, likely because more force would perpetuate more muscle pain. Therefore, the type of pain has a varied effect on force production during voluntary motor tasks. This study questions the well-accepted inhibitory effect of pain on force production and encourages future research to use fixed PE tasks to fully appraise the effects of different type of pain on force production.",

          "abstract": "The amount of cognitive effort that individuals are willing to expend on difficult tasks is influenced by their motivation to perform well. Given recent trends towards using naturalistic stimuli to study hearing and attention, the Engaging Stories for the Study of Attention and Audition (ESSAA) database was developed as a resource for researchers to select short works that are engaging for undergraduate student participants. To date, 1091 valid responses have been obtained from adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 (M = 19.3, SD = 1.5 years of age). However, the database is intended to grow over time. The present report describes results from the 24 stories for which at least 20 usable responses have been obtained. Participants read short written works that were selected from the public domain whose spoken durations were between 10 and 20 minutes, then completed a 10-item factual quiz, and Kuijpers’ Story World Absorption Scale. Finally, they listened to a 30 sec excerpt from the associated LibriVox audiobook and ranked their interest in the narrator’s reading style. The year of publication and category of the short work (fiction vs. nonfiction) significantly affected absorption, but these effects were weak. Absorption scores varied significantly between some works and accuracy on the factual quiz tended to correlate with absorption (rs = 0.40, p &lt; .001). Interest ratings for the narrators’ reading styles, by contrast, rarely differed significantly. These results suggest that, while the choice of story is important for designing an interesting study, the choice of narrator is less relevant. Our results also warrant caution in the use of factual quizzes to verify attention towards narrative stimuli that are not engaging. The ESSAA database is freely available via the Open Science Framework.",

We utilized RSFC to assess intrinsic patterns of brain organization, specifically, the degree of within-network, between-network, and segregation measures across three large-scale systems implicated in language and cognitive control: the Language network, the Default Mode Network (DMN), and the Multiple Demand (MD) network. By capturing basal i.e., task-independent connectivity patterns, RSFC provides insight into how the neural architecture of functional networks impacts speech production and its vulnerabilities in aging. Our findings indicate that age was associated with increased disfluency rates, especially for filled pauses and revisions, as well as with lower EF, lower DMN segregation, and reduced connectivity between the Language and DMN networks. EF performance predicted filled pauses, while distinct RSFC patterns predicted revisions and unfilled pauses. Mediation analyses confirmed that EF partially mediated the relationship between age and filled pauses. Additionally, both DMN segregation and Language-to-DMN connectivity partially mediated the relationship between age and revision disfluencies, suggesting that changes in functional brain organization contribute to age-related increases in self-monitoring disruptions. These findings demonstrate that EF and RSFC account for dissociable mechanisms underlying age-related speech disfluency. While EF may support fluent planning, the structure and segregation of large-scale brain networks appear critical for maintaining internal monitoring during speech. This work highlights the utility of disaggregating disfluency types and utilizing cognitive and neural markers to better understand how age-related changes in spontaneous language production.",

          "abstract": "A common feature of contemporary sports-betting apps is ‘instant cash-out’, which allows users to settle a bet early in exchange for a discounted immediate payout. Despite high prevalence and links with gambling-related harm, relatively little is known about how personality traits associated with gambling, such as impulsivity, predict instant cash-out usage. To address this question, we recruited 145 general-population adult participants (69 men, 66 women, 10 non-binary or undisclosed; Mage = 36.3, SD = 10.7) to complete five self-report questionnaires related to impulsivity, as well as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and a validated cognitive task measuring individual differences in cash-out frequency. We then assessed how cash-out frequency in the behavioral task was associated with both self-reported impulsivity and PGSI. We found that cash-out frequency was negatively correlated both with PGSI scores and with a number of impulsivity-related traits including Dysfunctional Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, Positive Urgency, Sensation Seeking, and Fun Seeking. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that higher scores on a latent ‘Dysfunctional Impulsivity’ factor were negatively associated with cash-out frequency overall, whereas higher scores on an ‘Inhibition and Inflexibility’ factor predicted higher cash-out frequency specifically for bets with a low win probability. Taken together, results suggest that instant cash-out may primarily appeal to less impulsive people and those with lower PGSI scores. This raises the possibility that instant cash-out may specifically facilitate increased gambling behaviors among people with less prior experience of gambling.",

          "abstract": "Human evolution has traditionally been explained through linear models focused on natural selection and the gradual accumulation of biological and cultural changes. However, these approaches fail to capture the complexity, recurrent crises, and symbolic diversity characteristic of Homo sapiens. This article presents the Dynamics of Recurrent Fissions (DRF), a structural model that conceives human evolution as a continuous cycle of social, symbolic, and biological fissions and fusions driven by an exponential and cumulative need for energy. This energetic pressure, associated with brain expansion, technology, and culture, generates internal tensions that fragment groups, which later recombine, enabling innovation and new adaptive configurations. The hypothesis integrates paleogenomic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence to explain the emergence of social complexity, symbolic reorganizations, and cultural acceleration. Additionally, it provides a framework to interpret contemporary phenomena such as identity fragmentation and social polarization. The DRF model broadens the traditional evolutionary perspective by incorporating energy and symbolism as active and complementary forces shaping the unique trajectory of the human lineage.",

          "abstract": "In the visual search literature, an attentional template refers to a mental representation of target features stored in visual working memory. The dual-state model (Olivers et al., 2011) argues that visual working memory can only be focused on a single representation at a time, and therefore, we can only search for one target at a time. Consequently, to detect two potential targets, we must rapidly alternate our attention between the two corresponding representations. By contrast, the resource hypothesis (Huynh Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021) posits that we can simultaneously activate more than one representation for visual search, although this requires sharing the available resources. In three pre-registered experiments, we compared the predictions from the state-based model and the resource hypothesis in a combined search and memory task. The results suggest that participants allocate their resources based on the reliability of the retro-cue and therefore favor the resource hypothesis. In contrast, the results are less consistent with the state-based model, which predicts that the cost in terms of response time and accuracy should remain identical regardless of the retro-cue’s reliability.",

          "abstract": "Background: A central challenge in affective and cognitive science is to explain how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (mu) dynamically shape subjective experience. Although both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms of their interaction—and their role in individual differences in mood and cognition—remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes the coupling between G and mu. Bifurcation analysis of a potential function V(Ms) yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–mu plane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and mu through hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\nResults: Canonical cusp (saddle-node) and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts that correspond to psychological phenomena ranging from stable belief convergence to cognitive (attitude) polarization (bistability) and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G = 1, mu = 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics (SGBD) extension represents person-specific traits with structural matrices, capturing unique “gain fingerprints” and mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics through its integrated treatment of gain–bias coupling and its governing bifurcations. This provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for longitudinal self-report, experience-sampling, and neurophysiological studies. It thus offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, psychiatry, and human-centric AI.",

          "abstract": "How we recognise objects and people despite their physical appearance can change dramatically across encounters is a central yet unresolved question in vision science. In particular, the visual information that supports the human ability to recognize face identity across views is unknown. Past research suggests horizontally oriented face information plays a key role. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the orientation of the visual information physically available in the face stimulus to support view-tolerant face recognition and how human observers make use of it.\nHuman observers performed an old/new identity recognition task with face stimuli presented under different viewpoints, achieved by rotating the faces in yaw (from full-frontal to profile) and filtered to preserve contrast in selective orientation ranges. Human performance remained tuned to the horizontal range of face information irrespective of yaw. \nWe used a model observer approach to define the information physically available in the stimulus for matching face identity within a single viewpoint or across different viewpoints. The view-selective (within-view) model indicated that face identity is carried by orientation ranges shifting from horizontal in frontal views to vertical in profile views.  In contrast, the view-tolerant (across-views) model showed that the horizontal range provides the most stable identity cues across views. The horizontally-tuned orientation profile of human recognition performance was predicted by the high diagnosticity of horizontal information in frontal views and the stability of the horizontal identity cues across views.\nOur findings indicate that the invariant representation of a face, gradually learned through repeated exposure to its natural appearance statistics, relies primarily on horizontal facial information. By identifying the spatial information supporting view-tolerant face recognition in humans, the present work yields concrete, data-driven constraints for the refinement of visual recognition models.",

          "abstract": "Here we propose a roadmap for addressing hierarchical predictive coding theory (hPC) in the primate brain, theorizing that perception arises from the integration of bottom-up (BU) pathways carrying sensory evidence with top-down (TD) pathways carrying priors and expectations. However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprising little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types will allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Identical paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will indicate homologous pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, long-distance priors and expectations suggest that the claustrum is involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops will enable a similar approach to explore these pathways’ participation in the integration of TD and BU signals as used in the cortico-cortical pathways. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

Early identification of reading difficulties, including dyslexia, is pivotal to providing timely interventions that prevent long-term academic challenges. This study introduces the Easy to Assemble Screening Test (EAST), a scalable, computer-based tool designed to identify key predictors of reading ability in Polish primary school children. \nThe study involved 413 children across grades 1-8 and assessed reading ability using seven tasks targeting phonological, orthographic, and attentional skills. \nBayesian Model Averaging (BMA) analysis identified orthographic sensitivity (OSP), letter-sound integration (LS), and auditory attention (AA) as significant predictors across all grades. For younger children (grades 1-2), the Dyslexia Risk Scale (DRS) emerged as a robust predictor, highlighting its potential for early dyslexia risk identification. In older children (grades 3-8), developmental shifts emphasized fluency and automaticity, with OSP reaction times and AA accuracy becoming key predictors.\nEAST's findings align closely with traditional diagnostic methods, validating its utility in school settings. The inclusion of questionnaire-based and task-based measures, such as the DRS, strengthens its versatility as a screening tool. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and a small sample of formally diagnosed dyslexia cases, which necessitate further longitudinal and larger-scale studies.\nEAST demonstrates promise as a transformative tool in education, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for early literacy assessment. Its potential to democratize access to dyslexia screening and support improved literacy outcomes underscores its significance in advancing educational equity.",

Here, we test how algorithms with and without prescribed social preferences, shape social decision-making and explore delegating further decisions. In an incentivized online experiment (n = 1290), participants provided social preferences for outcomes favoring oneself or an anonymous other, Social Value Orientation (SVO), as input to a decision-making algorithm. We manipulated whether for each SVO money division question, participants saw no default options (representing providing training data) or proself/prosocial default options (representing oversight of algorithms with prescribed selfish/prosocial preferences). Default options were either from an algorithm or not. Results showed that participants’ social preferences were not significantly impacted by providing input to an algorithm without prescribed preferences (vs no defaults) nor by an algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences (vs the same defaults without an algorithm and vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences). Only providing input for an algorithm with prescribed proself preferences resulted in more selfish social preferences (vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences and vs the algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences). Moreover, counter to this, participants perceived being less influenced by proself than prosocial defaults. Most people delegated a second social decision-making task to the algorithm they were exposed to. These findings suggest that human oversight could be insufficient to address algorithmic biases, as individuals act more selfishly when exposed to pre-existing selfish tendencies in algorithms.",

XB invites individuals to test and adapt simple health heuristics, such as movement or eating strategies, within their everyday lives. While our previous studies demonstrated XB’s positive impact on health behaviors, questions remained about how individuals establish heuristics in XB and how the experience fosters the development of interoceptive awareness, which supports the ability to judge whether actions are “healthy” or not by sensing and identifying bodily signals (e.g., finding fullness when eating). Using Theory Construction Methodology (TCM), we explored qualitative data from participant’s experiences during the Build Burn Better study series 2023, resulting in a prototheory of tuning. We offer tuning as a process through which individuals cultivate interoceptive awareness and use it, rather than external metrics, to guide experimentation and determine which actions support healthier physical, mental, and social states. If successful, this line of research will yield a formal, empirically validated model of tuning to inform the design of future digital health technologies. While still emerging, we propose tuning as a dynamic, person-centered, and potentially scalable process for guiding health behavior through felt experience at both individual and collective levels.",

Results showed that, although the working memory load manipulation successfully impaired recall and increased response time, it did not affect participants’ tendency to accept false information as true. In contrast, individual-difference variables robustly predicted misinformation susceptibility. Specifically, beliefs in pseudoscience, epistemically unwarranted beliefs, naıve skepticism and bullshit receptivity showed moderate positive associations with false-alarm rates and negative associations with discrimination sensitivity. Cognitive reflection was negatively associated with false-alarm rates and positively with discrimination sensitivity. Only small associations were found between individual-difference dimensions and response bias.

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for Large Models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called “empowerment” which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. “Empowerment” may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines.  If an agent learns an accurate causal world model they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive empirical features of children’s causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, design effective causal interventions and appropriately generalize to new contexts.",

This chapter analyzes how significance testing contributes to replication challenges through the lens of the TASI (Theoretical, Auxiliary, Statistical, Inferential) model. We examine three distinct contexts—inferential knowledge, region of acceptance testing, and statistical learning—to identify limitations in conventional significance testing and propose alternative frameworks. We argue that most problems with significance testing stem from researchers' tendencies to confirm rather than falsify hypotheses, regardless of statistical approach. We introduce REACT (Region of Acceptance Testing) as a stronger alternative to p-values, offering a structured decision-making process that integrates effect sizes and confidence intervals while explicitly recognizing when data is insufficient for definitive conclusions. Additionally, we propose Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) as a comprehensive statistical learning framework that transcends traditional hypothesis testing, focusing instead on descriptive, explanatory, and predictive modeling. The chapter ends with a concise exploration of the connection between data science and artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "How do our brains represent events in language? Recent work has shown that when we comprehend state-change events, multiple representations corresponding to different states of an object are simultaneously activated. As the sentence unfolds and the object is cued for retrieval, areas of the brain associated with representational conflict become more activated in proportion to how dissimilar the object-states are to each other. Before being retrieved, however, these object-states have to be actively maintained in the brain. What are the neural mechanisms by which we do so? Across two EEG experiments, we present evidence that, during sentence processing, the maintenance of multiple object-states in state-change events is supported by a neural signal that has been frequently linked to visual working memory: left temporal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling.",

          "abstract": "The topics and questions that social and personality psychologists study attract a great deal of public interest. The level of evidence required to make an application claim should be high, in our opinion, to avoid misapplying evidence that could be harmful or ineffective, which could erode the public’s trust in the field. Our field’s challenges with reproducibility, common threats to construct, internal, external, and statistical conclusion validity, and the dearth of independent replications in the field, suggest that application claims should be rare. To investigate how often social and personality psychologists make application claims in their published articles, we extracted and categorized application claims from 669 original empirical social and personality psychology articles published from 2010 to 2020 across sevens. Just over one quarter of articles contained at least one application claim, and 1 in 20 articles contained an application claim in the Abstract. We did not find a significant association between having an application claim, and articles’ i) citation count or ii) Altmetric score, however, we did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is no association. The extent to which published application claims are warranted, and are actually applied, are open question for future research.",

          "abstract": "Individuals are embedded in kinship networks that frequently extend across national borders. The emergence of international families, in which relatives are geographically dispersed, is often seen as a contemporary phenomenon driven by globalization. However, a cross-national historical perspective on international families is lacking. In this paper, we use the online genealogical database FamiLinx to investigate the dispersion of international families across countries and over time. We find a high degree of international geographical dispersion in historical family networks between 1700 and 1900 in Europe and the United States. The percentage of individuals with descendants living abroad was higher in Europe, while the percentage of individuals with ancestors living abroad was higher in the US. In most of the analyzed European countries, we observe an increasing likelihood of individuals having at least one relative living abroad that peaked at around 1850, with the proportion of children living abroad growing rapidly over time. Our findings provide valuable insights into how historical migrations shaped kinship structures, improving our understanding of the historical dispersion of kin across countries and informing debates on the potential of kin to influence migration behaviors.",

This study sought to determine whether similar associations can be observed in a large, population-representative sample of older adults with high levels of exposure to conflict amongst older adults in Northern Ireland (NI). Using data from the Northern Ireland COhort for the Longitudinal study of Ageing (NICOLA), we assessed whether the presence of PTSD was associated with poorer performance on tasks of global cognition, immediate and delayed verbal recall, executive function, verbal fluency and two tests of prospective memory. Participants were 2,142 community dwelling adults, resident in NI and aged 50 and over. The NI weighted prevalence of current PTSD was 4.74%, which is high relative to other international estimates. Nearly 60% of those with PTSD reported the NI Troubles as their self-reported worst traumatic exposure, despite the height of the conflict occurring decades before, suggesting long-term consequences of the civil conflict. Individuals with PTSD recalled approximately half a word less than those without on tests of verbal recall and scored lower on global cognitive assessments: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics. However, this effect was attenuated after further adjusting for health behaviours and current depression. The findings suggest an effect of trauma on cognitive function at a population level. Future research should explore the nature of this relationship over time.",

          "authors": "Natalia Pinzón; Ryan Galt",
          "abstract": "Wildfires are one of the most significant threats to California’s food and farming systems, endangering a state that produces diverse crops and livestock critical to national and global food security. This study examines the role of social fabric—mutual aid, cooperation, and collective action—in shaping wildfire adaptive capacities among California farmers and ranchers. Using survey data from 403 producers directly impacted by wildfires between 2017 and 2023, we conducted regression analyses to identify how social, operational, and demographic factors influence adaptive behaviors, including making changes, wildfire mitigation practices, knowledge acquisition, and farm continuity. \nKey findings reveal that farmers embedded in strong social networks exhibited greater adaptive capacities, leveraging mutual aid and collective action to facilitate resource sharing, knowledge dissemination, and motivation. Knowledge emerged as a central driver, with frequent wildfire exposure enhancing experiential learning and confidence in risk management. Ecological and diversified farming practices, alongside direct-to-consumer markets, were associated with higher rates of adaptation and stronger social networks. Financial and land ownership factors, including access to social safety nets and off-farm income, further supported long-term mitigation efforts. However, the cumulative burden of adaptive actions, compounded by social influences like peer decisions to quit farming, led some producers to consider exiting agriculture, exposing vulnerabilities within the food system.\nIn light of these findings, we recommend strengthening farmer networks through cooperative models, such as fire-safe councils and farmer-led preparedness groups, while incentivizing sustainable practices like agroecological and mosaic landscapes to buffer wildfire impacts and promote resilience. Agriculture, we propose, represents an underexplored but critical facet of broader wildfire resilience. This study contributes to the discourse on food system resilience by highlighting the interplay between social fabric, adaptive capacity, and sustainable agriculture in the face of climate-induced disasters.",

Now-a-days the students are passing examinations and earning their degrees with first or higher divisions, but most of them are unable to become self reliant and incapable to face the challenges. So to overcome this condition there is a need of such education which was predicted by Mahatma Gandhi like ‘Basic Education’ or ‘Nai-Talim’. Gandhi realized that the basic education was an essential component to the structural and socio-economic imbalances that were badly affected. It was the treatment for all the ills and evils of the society in India. His idea on basic education not only changed the educational system of India but also led a social revolution. This paper aims to understand and review the principles of Gandhiji on basic education which are assessed from his several writings.

          "abstract": "In an era often described as post-truth politics, it is crucial to understand how politicians engage with evidence. We argue that politicians selectively engage with evidence consistent with their party’s priorities. We test this argument by presenting 1,822 candidates in the 2024 Austrian national election with contrasting pieces of high-quality evidence on the same salient migration policy reform. We find that candidates from ideologically extreme parties – particularly the far-right populist Freedom Party\nof Austria (FPÖ) – select evidence consistent with their party’s priorities. Analysis of public opinion data (N = 1,428) further shows that far-right supporters approve of this selective consideration of evidence. Our findings suggest that growing far-right electoral strength may amplify the reliance on supportive evidence, increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events children experience before reaching 18 years old and are known to be passed on from generation to generation, which suggests that experiencing ACEs at an early age often leads to subsequent abuse and maltreatment perpetration in adulthood. However, identifying factors that facilitate ACE transmission has always been a challenge, given the issue's complexity. This study aimed to address this gap and identified two contextual factors (parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices) and investigated their mediating and moderating effects on the continuity of ACEs from mothers (G2) to their children (G3). Data collected from 230 mothers in Cebu City, Philippines, were analyzed using second-stage moderated mediation (model 15) to determine the conditional indirect effect of G2 ACEs towards G3 ACEs via parental proximal stressors as a function of negative parenting practices. Overall results established a moderated mediation model (F(5,224) = 18.26, p&lt;.001, R²=.3075), suggesting that the interaction of parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices increases the risk of continuity of ACEs from one generation to the next. Recommendations include preventive education of ACEs and adopting early intervention efforts to stop the cycle of abuse and neglect, preventing subsequent perpetration in adulthood.",

          "authors": "Alexander Martin Loewi",
          "abstract": "To improve human wellbeing, we must understand what drives it. Life satisfaction data have been collected internationally since 2005, but without a rigorous model of what drives these outcomes, it has remained difficult to draw policy lessons. We fill this gap by aggregating life satisfaction data with nation-level data on an unprecedented number of potential drivers (n=5,533). We use the Lasso, a computational method for variable selection, to construct a simple but highly accurate model with low risk of omitted variables or human selection bias. We show this model has higher prediction accuracy than the current world standard from the United Nations, and the variables it selects are more consistent with studies from political science, social psychology, and other fields. It also selects many variables the current world standard does not, including LGBTQ+ acceptance, gender equity, and accessible political power. Unlike the current standard, which suggests GDP determines 40% of a nation’s satisfaction, our model estimates GDP’s independent contribution at 1.5%. We also find few of the variables hypothesized by recent Nobel-awarded economics work. Finally, we show that our model is more consistent with theories of anti-authoritarian psychology than with “institutions” as a driver of national outcomes. These findings allow policy makers and advocates to prioritize higher-impact goals. It also reveals that current actions in countries across the world directly oppose predictors of satisfaction. In the face of severe global crises, including failure to keep global warming below the “red line” of 1.5C, and a rise in authoritarianism, we need far greater clarity about the future we desire as a society, and how to achieve it. As theories compete on the world stage, often violently, our model offers a simple, empirically driven message to cut through the fog: if we are to improve universal human wellbeing, there is no option but to empower individuals who truly desire that improvement.",

          "abstract": "Background\nConsideration of research in public policy formation and implementation is widely considered important for effective decisions. Previous research has noted a growing body of reviews of a diverse range of strategies designed to promote evidence use in public policy and practice. This review aims to identify recent reviews and develop a taxonomy of the various strategies available to evidence advocates.\n\nMethods\nThis review followed the JBI guidance for scoping reviews. Studies were sought via database searches, handsearching, forward citation tracing and searching organisational websites. Descriptive analysis was used to characterise the nature of the body of reviews. The review drew on best-fit framework synthesis to develop a taxonomy of intervention domains and strategies.\n\nResults\n11,047 potentially eligible records were identified via searches. After screening by a single reviewer, 74 studies were included in the review. The vast majority of reviews were conducted in the health sector (n = 65). While many focused on practitioners (n = 60), a significant proportion included policymakers (n = 27) and the public (n = 12). Reviews included studies of 34 distinct intervention strategies across six domains – access to research, capability improvement, influencing, interaction, prioritisation and systems improvement. Reviews most commonly included studies of interventions in the capability (n = 59), access (n = 31) and interaction (n = 31) domains.\n\nConclusions\nThere is a large body of reviews those promoting the use of evidence can draw on to better understand the strategies at their disposal.  Actors outside the health sector, however, may find the evidence base less useful – and there remain a number of common strategies for which reviews have yet to be published.",

          "abstract": "Introduction\nAnalyses of population administrative data can often only be minimally adjusted due to a lack of control variables, potentially leading to bias due to residual confounding.\n\nObjectives\nWe aimed to use linked cohort data to help address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data. One particular aim was to explore strategies for when linked cohort and population administrative data cannot be accessed together in the same environment (are “siloed”).  \n\nMethods\nWe propose a multiple imputation-based approach, introduced through application to simulated data in three different scenarios related to the structure of the datasets. We then apply this approach to a real-world example – examining the association between pupil mobility (changing schools at non-standard times) and Key Stage 2 (age 11) attainment using data from the UK National Pupil Database (NPD). The limited control variables available in the NPD are supplemented by multiple measures of socioeconomic deprivation captured in linked Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data.\n\nResults\nIn our real-world example, we included 509,670 individuals in the population NPD data, of whom 7,768 (1.5%) were MCS cohort members. The unadjusted estimate of -1.86 (95% CI -1.92, -1.81) for the association between pupil mobility and Key Stage 2 attainment was attenuated to -0.92 (95% CI -0.97, -0.88) through adjustment for the NPD control variables, and further attenuated to -0.76 (95% CI -0.86, -0.67) through adjustment for the MCS control variables. \n\nConclusions\nLinked cohort data can be used to address residual confounding in analyses of population administrative data, and our proposed approach performed well across a range of simulated and real-world scenarios. The underlying principles are widely applicable: any analysis of administrative data could potentially be strengthened by linking a subset of individuals into richer cohort data. More research is required to understand how these methods can be applied more broadly.",

The availability of a large database of homogeneous inequality measurements allows us to produce the most in-depth study of the factors affecting inequality at the local level available so far for any preindustrial society. Additionally, the occurrence of a major plague during 1629–30, an event that caused the death of 40% of the inhabitants of the area, allows us to contribute to the growing literature on the distributional consequences of epidemics. Across our dataset, of the three factors that recent literature has discussed as possibly able to explain overall inequality trends in the long run -- economic development, population and regressive taxation -- regressive taxation set by the central state had a relatively strong impact. We also find that locally, differences in inequality levels were determined by closeness to the capital city of Venice, altitude, and suitability of land to specific crops. Regarding the impact of the plague, we demonstrate that while the 1630 plague was different from the medieval Black Death as it did not lead to large-scale and enduring levelling, it did cause a structural break in the way in which some key variables affected inequality.

          "abstract": "Development can always be visualized in terms of contributions from all sections of the society. Marginalization deprives a large section of people across the globe from participating in the development. It is a serious issue, and there are many factors that cause marginalization. This serious issue needs to be addressed at the policy level everywhere across the globe. The development and the progress of the marginalized sections depend on proper education of individuals. Education sector is a critical determinant for development of the marginalized sections of the society. It is practically unrealistic to expect an adequate opportunity of education for all through traditional face-to-face structure. In order to meet the new and changing demands for education and training, Open and Distance Learning (ODL) is an appropriate substitute for the traditional face-to-face methods as it has the right potential to reach out to the large segment of the unreached, marginalized and the needy. In order to understand the Impact of ODL system on marginalized learners, an online survey using Google form was conducted among the marginalized learners of Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). The data collected through questionnaires were put together in the form of tables and simple percentage method is used for the analysis. Their views are analyzed to know the effectiveness of ODL system of education on marginalized learners. It is very interesting to note that about 91% of the marginalized learners feel pleasant / satisfied with the ODL mode of education offered by IGNOU. But, it is very pathetic to note that about 94% of the marginalized learners are unable to get scholarship even though the Govt. of India has been offering many scholarship schemes to encourage the marginalized learners for education.",

Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support.

Although levels of engagement are known to be far from equal within countries, comprehensive data comparing the rates and profiles of engagement on a global scale are lacking.\n\nMethods. This study analysed cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (2017-2023), with 73,825 respondents from 51 countries. Using multilevel logistic regression, we tested whether a set of individual-level demographic and socio-economic factors and country-level socio-demographic and political factors were associated with arts, music, or educational organization membership rates. We additionally explored whether those individual-level factors differed across regions using single-level regression.\n\nFindings. Prevalence of arts organization membership varies substantially across countries, from fewer than 1 in 30 people living in Egypt to more than 1 in 2 people living in Kenya. Education, income and age are consistent identified individual-level factors contributing to membership disparities, alongside other region-specific individual-level factors such as gender and employment status. Membership is also positively influenced by country-level income inequality and net migration rate, and negatively influenced by life expectancy.\n\nInterpretation. We found a universal social gradient in membership, which suggests differential opportunities and potential barriers to access arts organizations across population subgroups. Given that participation in arts organizations has been shown to improve health outcomes, reducing disparities in access to and participation in the arts may have the potential to help reduce health inequalities, and should therefore be a priority in global health.",

Findings reveal a sharp increase in ChatGPT usage, from just 5% in 2022 to 49% by 2025. However, significant disparities exist between urban and rural students (78% vs. 32% adoption), with concerns raised around ethical use, academic integrity, and limited access to AI tools in less developed areas. While many students recognize the tool’s educational potential, their experiences also highlight infrastructural and literacy barriers. These insights call for policy interventions that ensure equitable AI integration, with a focus on access, training, and responsible usage across Bangladesh’s higher education landscape.",

          "abstract": "Modern human uniqueness has been defined by a reliance on social learning and hierarchical cooperation networks that result in cumulative cultural evolution. There is archaeological evidence that such social organization emerged through innovations that facilitated exploitation of resources that naturally occur in dense and predictable patches, leading to social regionalization and potentially territorial behavior. However, another way humans can access high-density patches is through transformation of the environment via niche construction. Here, we use an agent-based model to investigate how low-cost niche construction behaviors - those that can be applied without intensifying into dependence on food production - can transform resource distributions over time. We then examine the resulting impact of this on human mobility and social organization. In all scenarios where the cost of disturbance is low, we see positive selection for disturbance behaviors, leading to creation of a locally heterogeneous resource landscape. This results in increased carrying capacity, higher population densities, reduced mobility, and smaller social networks - all factors implicated in the eventual transition to food production. We demonstrate that foragers using even low-cost niche constructing behaviors can produce legacy landscapes with resource distributions that support more local social interactions even without socially imposed boundaries or territory defense of dense and predictable resources.",

          "abstract": "This paper offers a critical response to Frank Zindler’s 1984 essay “Religion, Hypnosis, and \nMusic: An Evolutionary Perspective.” Zindler proposes that religious experience is a \nneurobiological byproduct of hypnotic suggestibility and musical stimulation—an adaptive \nillusion rather than a valid epistemic framework. While acknowledging Zindler’s historical \ncontext and intellectual sincerity, this paper challenges the reductionist nature of his claims. It \nargues that religion cannot be adequately explained through neurochemical responses or group \nselection theory alone. Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence from neurotheology, \nanthropology, and philosophy of mind, the paper presents religion as a structured moral and \nmetaphysical system, not a cognitive glitch. It highlights the philosophical inconsistencies in \nequating evolutionary utility with truth, and critiques the ideological bias in scientific \nreductionism. The paper also emphasizes the civilizational role of religion in shaping ethics, \nscience, art, and human dignity across cultures. Ultimately, it calls for a deeper, fairer dialogue \nbetween religious traditions and secular critiques—one that respects the complexity of spiritual \nexperience and the quest for meaning. Religion is not merely survival-driven illusion; it is a \nhuman expression of transcendence, justice, and moral awakening. Zindler’s thesis raises \nvaluable questions—but fails to capture the full cognitive, ethical, and historical dimensions of \nreligious consciousness.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article examines how individuals in persistent urban poverty attempt to access the labour market through capital conversion strategies, and how these efforts are shaped by the hysteresis effect. Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory and relational sociology, the study analyses how people try to re-enter employment by converting social, cultural, and symbolic capital into labour market opportunities. Based on qualitative fieldwork in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the research highlights how mismatches between habitus and the structural logic of the labour market produce friction, failure, and exclusion. The hysteresis effect—where past experiences and expectations lag behind current field demands—helps explain why job-seeking efforts often misfire, despite high motivation or informal skill sets. Respondents struggle with institutionalised expectations of employability, bureaucratic eligibility criteria, and the erosion of informal networks that once facilitated access to work. These findings show that labour market exclusion is not only a matter of lacking resources, but also of symbolic disqualification and misrecognition. The article contributes to scholarship on poverty, labour markets, and agency by demonstrating how structural inequality is reproduced through field-specific logics, and how relational forms of agency both resist and reinforce these mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "La inteligencia artificial (IA) se ha expandido significativamente en los últimos años, impregnando diversos sectores de la economía y de la vida cotidiana. Sin embargo, esta rápida adopción exige un análisis de las contrapartidas asociadas a su funcionamiento, muchas veces desconocidas por el público. Con base en un análisis de datos extraídos de artículos académicos, informes técnicos, repositorios de datos y documentos gubernamentales, este artículo explora las dimensiones físicas, energéticas y geopolíticas subyacentes a la IA. Aunque a menudo se percibe como inmaterial, la IA depende de una vasta y compleja infraestructura física, sostenida por centros de datos que albergan miles de equipos fabricados a partir de una amplia gama de minerales y metales, muchos de ellos clasificados como críticos. Actualmente, existen alrededor de 12 mil centros de datos en operación a nivel mundial, incluidos 992 de hiperescala, que ocupan áreas de miles de metros cuadrados. El corto ciclo de vida de los equipos de estos centros, combinado con una eliminación inadecuada, excluye metales valiosos de la cadena de suministro, intensificando la extracción mineral y agravando los impactos socioambientales. Paralelamente, la disputa entre Estados Unidos y China por el control de minerales críticos y por el liderazgo en tecnologías de IA ha intensificado las tensiones geopolíticas, con restricciones mutuas a la exportación de tecnologías avanzadas y minerales esenciales. Otro aspecto relevante es el alto consumo energético de las aplicaciones de IA: en Estados Unidos, los centros de datos ya representan cerca del 4% del consumo nacional de electricidad, con una previsión de alcanzar el 9,1% para 2030. Aunque las grandes empresas tecnológicas invierten en fuentes renovables, como la solar y la eólica, para satisfacer esta creciente demanda, dichas fuentes también requieren volúmenes significativos de minerales críticos. Este conjunto de factores evidencia la compleja interconexión entre Inteligencia Artificial, Centros de Datos, Minerales Críticos, Energía y Geopolítica.",

Unlike causality, a canonically `realist' view of probability appears elusive. This paper examines and strengthens the connections between realism and the epistemological theory of probability (EP), sometimes known as probability as logic or plausible reasoning. Following the likes of Keynes, Jeffreys, Pólya, and Jaynes, the EP tradition provides a framework for the study of non-demonstrative logic which hinges on an implicit concept of logical structure. EP advanced historically via critiques of positivism in physics and of the scepticism of Hume and Popper. EP also shares with realist philosophy a critique of a characteristic feature of empiricist philosophy—its explicit conflation of ontology and epistemology. To illustrate the normative value of this framework, I apply Pólya's theory of analogy to a portion of Galileo's classic argument that the earth is in motion.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a relational methodology for studying poverty, agency, and morality under structural constraint. It addresses the limitations of both individualistic and deterministic approaches by conceptualising agency as a situated capacity, shaped by capital, power relations, and moral boundaries across multiple social fields. Drawing on Bourdieu’s field theory, the methodology traces how disadvantaged individuals navigate complex environments such as welfare systems, labour markets, and informal economies. The proposed design integrates ethnographic observation, in-depth interviews, and abductive analysis. Core concepts include habitus, capital conversion, symbolic violence, and moral boundary-work. These help reveal how practical logics—routine, situated judgments—guide action under duress. A key contribution is the operationalisation of relational agency, using Emirbayer and Mische’s temporal framework to capture how people draw on past experiences and future aspirations. This method is especially suited for researchers exploring how poor individuals actively respond to constraint without reducing them to passive victims. It also supports methodological pluralism by combining theory-driven coding with inductive fieldwork. Overall, the article provides a robust and flexible toolkit for analysing agency and inequality through relational sociology.",

          "abstract": "This study presents an exploratory application of large language models (LLMs) for unsupervised media framing analysis, using zero-shot classification to infer narrative patterns in news coverage. The method is demonstrated through a case study on international reporting of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla incident of May 2, 2025. A dataset of 96 English-language news articles was processed using a multi-stage pipeline. At the article level, frames were predicted using a taxonomy of seven narrative themes, such as Conflict/Security, Legal/Human-Rights, and Human-Interest, followed by a secondary filtering step using a second LLM to reduce over-attribution. At the sentence level, named entities were paired with co-occurring frames using LLM inference, followed by a multi-step semantic filtering process to retain only high-confidence associations. Article-level predictions revealed frequent emphasis on Legal/Human-Rights, Responsibility/Attribution, and Conflict/Security frames across the corpus. Model predictions suggested frequent associations of entities like Gaza and Israel, with frames such as Human-Interest and Conflict/Security. These patterns are inferred from language-based signals and do not reflect verified facts, editorial motives, or normative judgments. All results are generated through automated model interpretation and should be viewed as indicative of how LLMs parse narrative structure in media coverage. Notably, the results indicate that LLMs may more reliably detect action-oriented or concretely expressed frames, and may struggle with abstract or implicitly framed concepts, which suggests the need for taxonomy designs aligned with model reasoning capabilities. The study demonstrates both the potential and limitations of LLMs for scalable, unsupervised media analysis.",

A partir de una crítica sistemática a los paradigmas normativos de la ciudad —su legibilidad, su programabilidad, su organización estable— se propone una aproximación teórica al espacio urbano desde su condición caótica, estratificada y desbordante. El texto introduce seis marcos conceptuales contemporáneos, provenientes de distintas tradiciones del pensamiento complejo, capaces de pensar la multiplicidad de capas en conflicto que operan simultáneamente sobre un mismo territorio, así como las trayectorias inestables y los quiebres que redefinen lo urbano como acontecimiento. Estas teorías son traducidas a categorías de análisis espacial que permiten leer la manifestación como la forma más aguda de producción urbana: una coreografía incontrolable, un montaje de escenas simultáneas y un laboratorio proyectual para imaginar nuevas herramientas arquitectónicas capaces de registrar, intervenir o acompañar la vitalidad inestable de la ciudad en conflicto.\n\nThis text explores the urban protest as a phenomenon of maximum complexity, focusing on the simultaneity and unpredictability that define urban space. It begins by challenging traditional architectural paradigms that pursue legibility, order, and control, arguing instead that the urban emerges as a dense, unstable, and contradictory field. Through six theoretical frameworks —three addressing simultaneity (superimposed networks, layered meanings, living structures) and three addressing unpredictability (emergence, contingent trajectories, rupture)— the chapter constructs a conceptual foundation to understand the protest as the urban event par excellence. Each group is translated into a spatial category of analysis, enabling its graphic representation. Far from remaining in theoretical abstraction, the text offers an operative approach for reading the city through its excess and intensity, ultimately proposing a new grammar for architectural practice.",

A través de ejemplos recientes de la ciudad de Barcelona, se muestra cómo las protestas retoman lógicas heredadas de rituales religiosos, celebraciones populares, guerras, actos teatrales y escenificaciones urbanas. Se evidencia así que, incluso en un contexto de control creciente, las manifestaciones reaparecen allí donde el orden presenta fisuras. Cada elección espacial es leída como síntesis compleja entre memoria, mensaje y proyección, y como acto político de inscripción en el territorio.\n\nThis text explores why certain political demonstrations choose specific locations within the urban fabric over others. It begins with the premise that, despite the progressive loss of spontaneity in contemporary protests, they continue to function as tactical responses that inscribe conflict into the city. A theoretical framework based on three temporalities—tradition, conversation, and repercussion—is proposed, allowing protest spaces to be classified not as fixed categories, but as overlapping intensities. Through recent examples from the city of Barcelona, the text reveals how demonstrations inherit logics from religious rituals, popular celebrations, wars, theatrical acts, and urban scenographies. It argues that, even within a context of increasing control, demonstrations reappear wherever the urban order shows fissures. Each spatial decision is read as a complex synthesis of memory, message, and projection, and as a political act of inscription in the territory.",

          "abstract": "Despite policy efforts, early childhood inequalities have remained relatively stable in England over recent decades. In this study, we aimed to understand the determinants of early childhood inequality and how these have changed in their composition and impact on early child development, using two nationally representative cohorts of pre-school children collected in 2004 (N = 8,990) and 2014 (N = 3,877). Child development was assessed in both cohorts at age three, using the British Ability Scales – Naming Vocabulary test, and developmental inequality was depicted by concentration indices across quintiles of the English Index of Multiple Deprivation. A between-sample test of the concentration index revealed there was no real change to developmental inequality over time. However, decomposition of the concentration index revealed there were some changes to the determinants of inequality. Most notably, higher rates of maternal education were associated with reduced inequality, while living in the most deprived areas was associated with increased inequality, helping to explain the overall net zero change over time. Other factors, such as attending early childhood education and care by age three, made little contribution to developmental inequality, despite much higher attendance in 2014. This study highlights the complexity of factors contributing to early childhood inequality and includes a discussion on where policy efforts may be useful going forward.",

          "authors": "Floris Noordhoff",
          "abstract": "This article develops Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of field through an in-depth analysis of persistent poverty in the Netherlands. Drawing on over 200 interviews and eight empirical studies, we reconstruct five interrelated social fields—formal labour market, informal economy, bureaucratic institutions, territorial neighbourhoods, and personal networks—and examine how they operate under conditions of structural constraint. Each field follows its own logic, forms of capital, and doxa, yet poor individuals must navigate them simultaneously, often facing friction, symbolic violence, and failed capital conversion. We show that poverty is not confined to economic deprivation but involves complex inter-field struggles, where dignity, legitimacy, and access are unevenly distributed. A central argument is that poverty deepens when individuals are unable to convert resources across fields—e.g., when symbolic capital in the neighbourhood field fails to yield recognition in the bureaucratic or labour market field. Our Bourdieusian perspective uncovers the moral, institutional and spatial grammars of exclusion and highlights how agency is structured relationally across field boundaries. By moving beyond mono-institutional analysis, this field-theoretical approach offers a powerful tool for understanding social reproduction under constraint. We conclude with implications for both relational sociology and poverty policy, arguing for more field-sensitive interventions that recognise cross-domain inequalities and symbolic barriers.",

          "abstract": "When managing multiple stores within the same marketplace, retailers must tailor product assortments to reflect the heterogeneous preferences of local communities. This paper introduces\na consumer-centric, data-driven framework for interpretable market structure discovery and supporting localized assortment planning. At the core of the framework is the dual Poisson Dynamic System with Multilayer Factorization (dPDS-MF), which integrates a probabilistic generative model with a tensor factorization architecture to estimate spatiotemporal supply and demand patterns across products and locations. Specifically, dPDS-MF can profile different consumer segments driven by store visiting preferences, measure relationships between store locations, and simultaneously estimate each segment’s product preferences. These model outputs are then used to formulate a choice process for the localized assortment optimization problem. We apply our proposed framework to the retail vending market in major train stations in Japan. We demonstrate the face validity of the model outputs for guiding the selections of products at each location. We also show that the localized assortments generated by our framework are more meaningful and practical than benchmark strategies in the literature. Beyond the core model, we introduce several methodological extensions, highlighting the flexibility of the framework in addressing real-world retail scenarios and laying a foundation for future research.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity influence green purchase intentions, with conspicuous virtue signaling (CVS) as a mediator. Surveying 206 young Ghanaians, the findings show intrinsic religiosity directly boosts eco-friendly buying, while extrinsic religiosity enhances green behavior indirectly via increased CVS. Both religiosity types unexpectedly raise self- and other-oriented virtue signaling, which in turn impact green choices; revealing that even socially motivated religious individuals can support sustainability. These results suggest green marketing can successfully appeal to both moral convictions and social recognition, offering a new perspective on how faith-based and status-driven motivations together shape environmentally responsible consumption.",

National datasets from 2000–2023 are analyzed to reveal that while urban women benefit from digital and educational investments, rural women face infrastructural barriers despite high female employment in sectors like garments. Linear empowerment narratives are challenged by findings highlighting male disengagement (35.2% NEET rates) alongside women’s visibility. Reforms prioritizing rural digital equity and gender-balanced vocational training are recommended to translate participation into substantive power.",

          "authors": "Yusuf Ercan ÖZERCAN",
          "abstract": "The European Union (EU) aims to realize the energy transition by increasing renewable energy production and enhancing the flexibility of the energy system. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology, which enables electric vehicles (EVs) to both draw power from and supply power back to the grid, presents a particularly important opportunity to contribute to this goal. However, this technology faces legal and regulatory barriers in some EU Member States, including Spain. This article investigates the contribution of V2G technology to sector coupling and examines its potential participation in balancing markets, with a specific focus on the Spanish context. Balancing markets are technically well-suited for V2G participation, but Spain's current legislation presents significant barriers. While EU level regulations supporting the integration of V2G technology were introduced under the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package, Spain’s delayed or incomplete transposition of these rules into national law continues to prevent V2G from entering the Spanish electricity balancing markets. The article analyzes the key legal and regulatory factors behind this limitation, particularly the market design favoring large-scale centralized production and the absence of a legal framework for independent aggregators. Nevertheless, it concludes that recent and ongoing legislative developments in Spain offer promising signs that these obstacles may be removed in the near future. This analysis is limited to legal and regulatory aspects and does not address technical, economic, or social dimensions of V2G deployment, which are also critical to achieving full integration.",

          "abstract": "Criminological research often fails to achieve cumulative theoretical progress despite methodological sophistication. Paul Meehl’s concept of “logical derivation chains” provides a diagnostic framework for understanding this persistent problem, yet it remains largely absent from criminological practice. Using Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory as a detailed case study, including empirical analysis illustrating potential measurement incoherence, I argue that loose derivation chains are structural features of social scientific inquiry rather than correctable methodological problems. Through systematic analysis of sampling, measurement, and analytical choices, I reveal how auxiliary assumptions accumulate throughout the research process, creating compound derivation chain failures. The analysis identifies a “correlation paradox” where a correlation of r = -.31 (p &lt; 2e-16), typically celebrated as impressive empirical support, corresponds to theoretical failure for 39% of individual cases. Contemporary statistical methods systematically privilege aggregate patterns over individual variation, rendering theoretically crucial anomalies invisible and creating research programs that appear progressive despite exhibiting degenerating characteristics. The analysis concludes with strategies for constraint-aware research, including individual-level prediction assessment and item-specific analysis that reveal theoretically important anomalies hidden by aggregate correlations, alongside institutional reforms that encourage genuine theoretical advancement over mere accumulation of supportive correlations.",

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

This paper seeks to understand the role of consultants in spreading institutional isomorphism across the higher education field. It draws on documentary evidence to ask whether, in cases where change is driven by consultants, it is accurate to say that changes have occurred due to mimetic isomorphism, or whether instead mimetic isomorphism is a convenient excuse enabling Breckert’s (2010) “distraction from authorship,” and advances a new model of metamimesis in which in which isomorphic pressures shape the hiring of consultants who themselves disseminate particular practices to the colleges and universities with which they work.",

          "abstract": "Both freedom of movement and voting in European elections are fundamental citizenship rights at the heart of European integration. Ideally, EU citizens should be able to exercise both rights simultaneously. Yet, in practice, tensions exist between the two: Despite their strong emotional attachment to the Europe-an Union, EU citizens living outside their country of citizenship have a reduced likelihood to vote in European elections, even when they reside within the EU. This article demonstrates this pattern empirically for German emigrants in the 2019 European Parliament election, based on data from the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS). This survey is unique in that it covers both mobile German citizens who currently live abroad and those who have lived abroad, but have recently returned to Germany. Self-reported turnout was signif-icantly reduced among those currently living abroad. Bureaucratic hurdles (in-cluding early opt-in registration deadlines, complex registration procedures, and tedious access to ballot) are identified as a key explanation for the decreased par-ticipation. These findings seem to contradict basic democratic principles and could have political implications: Since there are more than eleven million mo-bile EU citizens who are eligible to vote, reduced turnout among this group could affect election outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This article revisits the longstanding contrast between Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Oscar Lewis’s culture-of-poverty paradigm in order to explain how individuals living under persistent structural constraints navigate moral and material survival strategies. Drawing on 216 in-depth interviews from disadvantaged Dutch neighbourhoods, we demonstrate that poor residents deploy an embodied, relational agency—shaped by field-specific conversion capacities and symbolic valuations—rather than conform to a static sub-culture of deprivation. In the formal labour market, they confront conversion barriers and symbolic violence that devalue their existing capital; in the informal economy, they engage a morally regulated system of trust and reciprocity to generate unreported income; in welfare bureaucracies, they resist and sometimes withdraw under coercive compliance regimes; in their communities, they negotiate territorial stigma through moral boundary-making; and in social networks, they temper the “strength of weak ties” with honour and risk calculations. These findings reveal that survival under constraint is best understood through habitus-informed dispositions that both enable adaptive practices and reproduce field-specific logics. We argue that recognising “relational agency under constraint” offers a richer theoretical framework than culture-of-poverty stereotypes and carries significant implications for policy design, which must address both structural barriers and the moral dimensions of poverty.",

A seven-lesson intervention incorporating manipulatives and a pictorial representation was implemented in three self-contained learning disability classes and five regular education classes (grades 6-8). Although several LD classes scored significantly lower than the regular classes on the pre-test, the results demonstrated significant gains from the pre-test to the post-test for each class, with the LD classes reaching performance levels comparable to the post-test scores of the non-LD classes. These gains are attributed to the unique design features of the Hands-On Equations Level I manipulatives and the explicit and systematic instruction.",

This in-depth study of a highly politicized file allows the identification of three roles embraced by the European Commission within the Council: explaining its proposal, mediating between Member States, and writing the Council’s compromises.

The multiplicity of screens and platforms makes it challenging to fully evaluate audience size and composition using traditional TV audience measurement methods. Extensive datafication of audiovisual media is enabling the analysis of arrays of digital footprints. However, different measurement methods across platforms may yield divergent outcomes, highlighting the need for comparative analysis. The article explores the potential of multidimensional TV audience study to enhance understanding of contemporary TV audiences. Our analysis is based on numerous datasets of Estonian Public Broadcasting, incorporating live, time-shifted and video-on-demand viewing modes – all distinct in terms of their technical features. The analysis compares the viewing modes in terms of characteristics of viewed content, demonstrating how multidimensional study can provide a more comprehensive, yet differentiating, view of contemporary consumption patterns of televisual content.",

A partir de una crítica sistemática a los paradigmas normativos de la ciudad —su legibilidad, su programabilidad, su organización estable— se propone una aproximación teórica al espacio urbano desde su condición caótica, estratificada y desbordante. El texto introduce seis marcos conceptuales contemporáneos, provenientes de distintas tradiciones del pensamiento complejo, capaces de pensar la multiplicidad de capas en conflicto que operan simultáneamente sobre un mismo territorio, así como las trayectorias inestables y los quiebres que redefinen lo urbano como acontecimiento. Estas teorías son traducidas a categorías de análisis espacial que permiten leer la manifestación como la forma más aguda de producción urbana: una coreografía incontrolable, un montaje de escenas simultáneas y un laboratorio proyectual para imaginar nuevas herramientas arquitectónicas capaces de registrar, intervenir o acompañar la vitalidad inestable de la ciudad en conflicto.\n\nThis text explores the urban protest as a phenomenon of maximum complexity, focusing on the simultaneity and unpredictability that define urban space. It begins by challenging traditional architectural paradigms that pursue legibility, order, and control, arguing instead that the urban emerges as a dense, unstable, and contradictory field. Through six theoretical frameworks —three addressing simultaneity (superimposed networks, layered meanings, living structures) and three addressing unpredictability (emergence, contingent trajectories, rupture)— the chapter constructs a conceptual foundation to understand the protest as the urban event par excellence. Each group is translated into a spatial category of analysis, enabling its graphic representation. Far from remaining in theoretical abstraction, the text offers an operative approach for reading the city through its excess and intensity, ultimately proposing a new grammar for architectural practice.",

It then examines the mass as a mobile figure and a collective user that challenges the traditional frameworks of urban design.

Se propone una teoría basada en tres tiempos —tradición, conversación y repercusión— que permite clasificar los modos de ocupación del espacio público no como compartimentos estancos, sino como intensidades combinadas. A través de ejemplos recientes de la ciudad de Barcelona, se muestra cómo las protestas retoman lógicas heredadas de rituales religiosos, celebraciones populares, guerras, actos teatrales y escenificaciones urbanas. Se evidencia así que, incluso en un contexto de control creciente, las manifestaciones reaparecen allí donde el orden presenta fisuras. Cada elección espacial es leída como síntesis compleja entre memoria, mensaje y proyección, y como acto político de inscripción en el territorio.\n\nThis text explores why certain political demonstrations choose specific locations within the urban fabric over others. It begins with the premise that, despite the progressive loss of spontaneity in contemporary protests, they continue to function as tactical responses that inscribe conflict into the city.

It argues that, even within a context of increasing control, demonstrations reappear wherever the urban order shows fissures. Each spatial decision is read as a complex synthesis of memory, message, and projection, and as a political act of inscription in the territory.",

Its routes, rhythms, and tactics are analyzed as a living grammar capable of interrupting, reinscribing, and disputing the meaning of space. The analysis not only frames walking as a projective operation, but also defines the demonstration as an act of enunciation that temporarily reconfigures the city and reveals the structural tensions of its urban order.",

Based on original survey data collected in 2022, this paper examines nuanced gender differences across cohorts on a range of socio-cultural issues. The findings reveal a widening gender gap among younger cohorts - doubling in size compared to the oldest cohort. Young women, propelled by higher educational attainment and personal investment in progressive issues, emerge as the most progressive group. In contrast, young men show little to no attitudinal change across cohorts, maintaining similar levels of conservatism as their predecessors. One explanatory mechanism appears to be perceptions of fairness: young men view inclusive measures only acceptable if they feel like they are getting their own fair share in society. These findings suggest that recognition of marginalized groups is increasingly viewed through a zero-sum lens, indicating a deepening and likely persistent divide in socio-cultural attitudes with far-reaching implications for gender relations, political polarization, and social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Theoretically, cross-issue compromises can facilitate policy reforms, as multiple\ngroups can win on an issue they prioritize. Under what conditions do Americans sup-\nport them? Prior research emphasizes one-dimensional compromises or abstract sup-\nport. We provide a theoretical framework to understand how support for cross-issue\ncompromises differs from support from their components. We also generate hypotheses\nabout the conditions when such compromises are especially likely, highlighting ideo-\nlogical extremity, partisan asymmetries, and moral issues. To test them, we employ\nfour surveys (N = 5,250) fielded by NORC (2023) and YouGov (2021—2025). Overall,\ncross-issue compromises win substantial public support, but less than expected based\non their components’ popularity. Partisan asymmetries when respondents are asked\nabout compromise abstractly decline or disappear when they face concrete trade-offs.\nDonors show less support for compromises, as do those who lose on an issue they deem\nimportant. There remain demand-side barriers to compromise among an influential\nsegment.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we ask whether broader societal changes in Germany over the last three decades have been accompanied by a secular rise or decline in public concerns about crime. We conceptualize the aggregate effect of these changes as a period effect to be identified in a framework of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Upon evaluation of previous research, we argue that the secular trend is challenging to identify directly both for empirical and theoretical reasons. However, using Fosse and Winship’s bounding approach to APC analysis, we show that the challenge can be resolved indirectly, and identify a declining period trend under an intuitive and theoretically warranted assumption that crime concerns are unlikely to decrease from late adolescence into adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This article analyzes the crisis-generating interaction between macro financial-governance fragility and micro legal-procedural voids within Iran's health and social security system, examining its role in systemic erosion. \nMethod: Using qualitative analysis and critical conceptual synthesis, pathologies at both macro and micro levels and the negative feedback dynamics between them (financial instability, governance weakness, legal deficits, trust erosion) were investigated. \nFindings: The crisis exhibits a dual architecture: The macro level grapples with severe financial and governance pressures limiting long-term capacity; the micro level suffers from legal gaps (in the therapeutic relationship, informed consent, documentation, accountability) undermining patient rights and trust. These levels interact in a vicious cycle, reinforcing each other; macro constraints weaken micro standards, while negative micro experiences jeopardize macro sustainability. \nResults: Piecemeal reforms are ineffective. Overcoming the crisis requires an integrated systemic paradigm that links fundamental macro financial and governance reforms with the effective guaranteeing of rights and responsibilities at the micro level of service delivery to achieve sustainable resilience.",

          "abstract": "Guided by the social information processing models, this multi-method longitudinal study presents the first attempt to examine attentional processes through which interparental conflict may spillover to shape maternal and paternal parenting. Specifically, we examined whether maternal and paternal attention biases for a child's face may operate as indirect factors in the association between interparental conflict and both parents’ power-assertive discipline. Data were drawn from a three-wave longitudinal study (N = 235; 55.3% female; 56.2% of children were White, 21.3% were African American, and 16.2% were identified as mixed race), and we focused on the second (Child Mean age = 3.88 years old, N = 217) and the third waves. Parents’ attention biases for child emotions were measured by the dot-probe task, where we innovatively used child emotion expressions as the stimulus. For mothers, greater exposure to interparental conflicts was linked to elevated attention biases towards anger, which in turn was associated with a higher likelihood for power-assertive discipline. Follow-up analyses for power-assertive discipline across the moral and prudential domains indicated that such effect was particularly related to child transgression within the moral domain. In contrast, for fathers, we did not find significant indirect effects of attention biases for child faces that might account for spillover processes. Findings promoted the understanding of the process underlying the spillover of interparental conflict within the family system as well as maternal vs. paternal differences.",

          "abstract": "Recognition that discrimination can occur explicitly due to age/childhood – that children are \ndiscriminated against simply for being children – remains limited. Yet, numerous examples exist of \nchildren being treated less favorably than adults solely on the basis of age. This is also the case in \nmigration law, despite various measures aimed at preventing the ‘double vulnerability’ of migrant \nchildren from placing them at a disadvantage compared to adults.\nThis paper aims to examine discrimination based on age/childhood in the context of migration law \nby drawing on examples related to the child’s right to be heard, the assessment of asylum claims, and \naccess to family reunification. It explores the potential of the principle of non-discrimination, as \nexpressed in Article 2 of the CRC, to address adverse differential treatment of children relative to \nadults in migration contexts. The argument is made that systematically invoking Article 2 of the CRC \nto identify unequal treatment based on age has the potential to strengthen the rights of children in \nparticularly vulnerable situations, such as migration, and to challenge prevailing assumptions about \nthe legitimacy of, in practice, according children fewer or more limited rights than adults solely on \nthe basis of age",

          "authors": "Qilin Guo",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Principle of Economic Entropy Increase to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of economic growth: through the expansion of scale and diversification of structure, economic systems overcome both quantitative and structural forms of scarcity. Building on the concept of economic entropy, the study develops a dual-dimensional model—scale entropy and structural entropy—to enable the quantitative assessment of entropy dynamics within economic systems. Economic entropy increase originates from the system’s intrinsic structural demands and determines the macro trajectory of institutional evolution. Accordingly, this paper is the first to propose and systematically demonstrate the core proposition that the market economy constitutes the fundamental trajectory of economic evolution. Market economies, with their superior self-organizing and adaptive capacities, embody high-entropy structures; in contrast, planned economies, constrained by “long-chain interventions” that crowd out market mechanisms, exhibit low-entropy structures and are ultimately to be superseded. This framework offers a new lens for understanding economic growth, institutional selection, and the evolution of complex systems, with significant implications for policy design and economic governance.",

          "authors": "Alejandra Rodríguez-Sánchez",
          "abstract": "Chetty et al. (2022) present compelling evidence that economic connectedness—the connection between people from low- and high-income backgrounds measured using Facebook data—is a strong predictor of upward social mobility in the United States. Their analysis, based on a global regression model, offers a powerful national perspective but implicitly assumes spatial uniformity in this relationship. Building on their work, this study reexamines that assumption by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) to the same datasets. GWR enables coefficients to vary by location, uncovering spatial heterogeneity in the association between economic connectedness and mobility. Our findings reveal considerable regional variation: while strong positive associations are evident in areas like the Northern Plains, weaker or even slightly negative relationships emerge in the South and along the East and West coasts. These results suggest that the impact of economic connectedness may differ meaningfully across geographic contexts. Rather than contradicting the original conclusions, this study highlights the added value of spatially sensitive approaches, which can inform more nuanced and locally tailored policies aimed at enhancing upward mobility in diverse communities across the United States.",

          "abstract": "Arts and creative engagement is a recognised human right and offers significant benefits for young people. However, past research, predominantly from Western countries, shows arts engagement is often low and socially patterned. It was unclear if this holds globally or across in-school and out-of-school contexts. We analysed data from the OECD PISA which surveyed 441,183 15-year-olds across 73 countries, and found substantial variation in engagement. Notably: (1) Countries with higher in-school engagement rates also have higher out-of-school engagement rates. (2) Most students engage more in arts in school than out of school. (3) Individual-, school, and country-related factors may influence engagement. Schools hold the potential to equalise engagement in and outside school and thus reduce cultural, health and academic inequalities.",

          "abstract": "This book presents a theory of theory building and testing that builds on insights in Lipton’s 2004 book Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).  The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

          "abstract": "Do ideologically extreme candidates actively pursue small donations? The literature on money in politics debates whether \"small\" individual campaign donors are more ideologically extreme than large donors. This paper reverses the question, investigating whether extreme candidates request smaller contributions from potential donors. Using data from U.S. congressional candidates' fundraising platforms in the 2020 elections, I examine how campaigns typically present a set of suggested donation amounts to solicit money from potential donors efficiently. While party, in-state income levels, and the usage of major fundraising platforms mattered, ideological extremism had no bearing on the amounts candidates asked for. Given that solicitation amounts have been long and easily optimized through A/B testing, I interpret this as extreme candidates not finding it profitable to ask for smaller amounts, which is more aligned with the view that small donors are not more ideologically extreme than large donors.",

This study aims to interpret the policy shift by analyzing evolving U.S. public opinion on Gaza. Using Google Trends data from September 2018 to March 2025, it constructs innovative time series variables to capture the U.S. public agenda. The analysis reveals a structural shift in public sentiment beginning in October 2023. Prior to that, opinion was largely reactive to isolated extreme events. Afterward, discourse was driven by polarized narratives: (far)-left slogans such as “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea,” and far-right apocalyptic themes, proxied by interest in Jesus’ Second Coming. Moderate positions—such as “Gaza Genocide” and “Stand with Israel”—are generally marginal. These findings suggest a potential trajectory toward radical U.S. policy on the Israel–Palestine conflict. Future research should explore whether other Trump–Vance administration policies also reflect this apocalyptic public outlook.",
