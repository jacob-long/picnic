          "title": "Evidence of Convergent and Discriminant Validity between Sensory Processing Sensitivity and Other Individual Difference Measures",
          "authors": "Chloe L. Johnson; Adelaide Gleason; Jordan Ashton Booker",
          "abstract": "Sensory processing sensitivity (sensitivity) involves the ways people differ in being attentive and responsive to bodily, social, and environmental cues. We aimed to build evidence that sensitivity is complementary to other individual differences and measures of personality, yet is not redundant with measures of temperament, traits, character, and narrative identity. We recruited 774 young adults from the central U.S. (M age = 18.9 years; 60.9% women) and tested relations between sensitivity and other self-reports and narrative expressions of personality. Each dimension of sensitivity was significantly correlated with other measures of personality. These correlations were not so large as to suggest redundancy between measures. Further, sensitivity to emotional and physiological stimuli was related to the ways people changed expressions of narrative processing between the construction of positive-valence and negative-valence life stories. We discuss how findings reinforce theories about sensory processing sensitivity and personality, as well as the value of considering sensitivity as distinct yet complementary to other longstanding measures of personality.",

          "authors": "Kim Johnson",
          "abstract": "This project explores how mentorship and collaborative group assignments can enhance leadership development among Black/African American students in a psychology classroom. Students engaged in a series of peer mentorship and research-based activities supported by Social Identity Theory and the Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory. The findings suggest that classroom-based group initiatives can support academic achievement, a deeper understanding of culturally relevant expectations, and result in leadership growth and development.

          "title": "ADHD traits are not related to Multisensory Integration in a University Population",
          "authors": "Carolynn Hare; Anne-Marie Muller; Tyler C. Dalal; Elim Chan; Samantha Schulz; Ryan A Stevenson",
          "abstract": "In daily life, we are constantly bombarded with sensory information from multiple sources. Our ability to combine these cues into a single perceptual experience is known as multisensory integration. Research is starting to show that multisensory integration may be altered in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most studies have focused on clinical populations, leaving little known about how multisensory integration related to ADHD traits along a dimensional spectrum, consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach. The present study examined associations between ADHD traits and multisensory integration in university students using three different behavioural tasks (i.e., Sound-Induced Flash Illusion [SIFI], McGurk, and speech-in-noise). ADHD traits were assessed dimensionally, including overall ADHD traits, as well as inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive trait dimensions. Participants were also divided into High ADHD and Low ADHD trait groups for categorical comparisons. Results indicated no significant associations between overall, inattentive, or hyperactive-impulsive ADHD traits and performance on any of the multisensory tasks. Similarly, no group differences were observed between High and Low ADHD trait groups. These findings suggest that multisensory integration differences reported in previous research may emerge only when ADHD traits reach clinical severity, rather than existing across the broader continuum of traits. This study highlights the importance of considering both dimensional and categorical approaches when examining cognitive mechanisms in ADHD. Future work should explore developmental and contextual factors that may shape multisensory integration in clinically significant ADHD.",

          "title": "Bridging Real-world Summarization and Laboratory-based Memory Recall",
          "authors": "Hemali Angne; Snigdha Mishra; Guo Lin; Qiong Zhang",
          "abstract": "A fundamental question in psychology is how humans digest, retain, and reconstruct information. While this process has been extensively studied in laboratory-based memory recall tasks, we have missed opportunities to examine it under more naturalistic, real-world conditions. Summarization is a task that people routinely engage in every day, and it is also a long-standing challenge in the machine learning community. Researchers in machine learning have developed rich datasets of human summaries for model training, which represent a valuable and largely untapped resource for cognitive science researchers. In this work, we analyze 45,220 human summaries drawn from three large datasets, including news articles, autobiographical stories, and Reddit posts, and compare them with a dataset of narrative memory recall. We demonstrate a close relationship between human summarization and laboratory-based memory recall. We show that while summarization operates at a higher level of the event abstraction than memory recall, the two tasks share deep similarities. The process of summarizing is fundamentally constrained by the mechanisms of memory recall, displaying behavioral patterns that align with well-known memory biases. Conversely, memory recall takes the form of summarization, prioritizing more central and important information. Together, these findings bridge the real-world task of summarization and the rich literature on memory recall and lay the foundation for developing integrated theories of how humans digest and reconstruct information.",

          "title": "When happiness becomes aversive: A meta-analysis of fear of happiness in depression and anxiety",
          "authors": "Amanda C Collins; Chloe Coster",
          "abstract": "Objective: Many current interventions target reward deficits in depression and anxiety. However, fear of happiness, a construct representing reward devaluation may negatively impact the efficacy of these reward-based interventions. As such, the current meta-analysis sought to examine the associations between fear of happiness and psychopathology.\n\nMethod: We conducted a scoping literature review in July 2025 from various databases. We calculated the pooled Hedges’ g for each of the following meta-analyses: the association between fear of happiness and (1) concurrent depression, (2) longitudinal depression, (3) concurrent anxiety, and (4) concurrent anhedonia. We also conducted moderation analyses for culture, scale version, symptom severity, and demographics.\n\nResults: Twenty-six samples were included, representing 6,604 different individuals. We found large effect sizes for the cross-sectional associations between fear of happiness and depression (g = 1.117), anxiety (g = 0.999), and anhedonia (g = 0.837), and a small-to-medium effect size for the longitudinal association between fear of happiness and depression (g = 0.481). We also found stronger associations in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\n\nConclusion: Our findings provide evidence of strong concurrent and predictive implications of fear of happiness on depression, as well as concurrent implications on anxiety and anhedonia. Moreover, there were nuanced differences across cultures, symptom severity, and scale version, indicating that the clinical implications of fear of happiness may differ across populations. Nevertheless, these findings provide rationale for the assessment and treatment of fear of happiness among persons with depression and anxiety.",

          "authors": "Felix Strakeljahn; Claudia Calvano; Alexandra Brecht; Björn Schlier",
          "abstract": "Background: Various lines of research explore how psychosocial factors like gender dysphoria, minority stress, gender euphoria, and social support affect trans people’s mental health. Conceptualizations of these factors have continuously evolved, resulting in a diverse spectrum of ideas for research on stressors and resources, but also leading to a considerable risk of overlap and confusion. Thus, clarifying and distinguishing these factors is now crucial for improving research and mental health care in this population. This study aims to develop a comprehensive questionnaire on stressors and resources relevant to trans and non-binary individuals, designed for health services and therapy outcome research, and inclusive of all gender identities.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=483 trans adults; age range 18-62) filled out an online questionnaire of candidate items for a comprehensive questionnaire (A-JOURNEY) on stressors and resources as well as self-report measures for well-being and psychopathology to assess criterion validity. We used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis to identify the questionnaire’s factors and select items.\n\nResults: Analyses yielded a final A-JOURNEY questionnaire comprising 53 items that assesses nine stress factors and four resource factors. Extracted factors showed high reliability (𝛼=.77-.93) and correlated with mental health outcomes in the expected directions.\n\nDiscussion: The A-JOURNEY questionnaire provides a comprehensive tool for assessing stressors and resources in trans and non-binary individuals, streamlining evaluation without requiring multiple measures. While validation for change sensitivity is still required, it shows promise for advancing psychological and healthcare research and may enhance our understanding of how specific trans-specific stressors/resources affect mental health.",

          "abstract": "Language comprehension involves prediction, but what exactly can comprehenders predict? We ask if bilinguals can consciously predict upcoming code-switches between languages. If predictions focus on a sentence’s message, then listeners should not predict code-switches, which alter the language used but not necessarily the meaning. Alternatively, if listeners predict at many levels—including language—then they may predict code-switches. Here, we selected sentences from a corpus of spontaneous bilingual conversations that started in Spanish and removed the final word that would have continued in Spanish or code-switched to English. In two pre-registered experiments, Spanish-English bilinguals heard these sentence fragments and predicted the language of the omitted final word. They successfully predicted upcoming code-switches when given 30 seconds of context prior to their predictions (Experiment 1; N=94), but not when only hearing the sentence fragment (Experiment 2, N=115). This shows that bilinguals can predict upcoming code-switches when sufficient conversational cues are available.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas; Melanie B. Fessinger",
          "abstract": "Research Summary\nWe compared ratings provided by 355 judges and 372 laypeople on the ethicality of various prosecutorial behaviors and whether they should be investigated as possible misconduct. Most prosecutorial behaviors were sourced from exoneration cases and varied from highly egregious misconduct (e.g., manipulating exculpatory evidence) to more questionable in nature (e.g., opposing a defense expert witness on Frye grounds). Results showed that laypeople had generally stricter ethical standards—perceiving acts as more unethical (d = 0.36) and more worthy of investigation (21 of 27 acts; 77%) compared to judges. Notably, however, this varied based on individual acts. For some acts, specifically those with clearly established legal rules, judges had stricter ethical standards instead. Overall, our data showed wide variation in ethicality and investigation judgments across individuals, across respondent type, and across specific acts. \nPolicy Implications \nLaypeople were more skeptical of prosecutorial discretion than judges—a skepticism that may be justified given that many of the behaviors stemmed from wrongful conviction cases. Yet, as experts, judges are in a better position to identify and report misconduct. This discrepancy between who perceives and who reports misconduct may partly explain why misconduct is seldom investigated or sanctioned. Laypeople, however, are not powerless to mitigate such injustices. As jurors, awareness of misconduct can protect them from being unduly influenced by improper prosecutorial tactics. As members of the court of public opinion, laypeople shape narratives about justice processes, apply pressure for institutional accountability, and can mobilize collective action when official outcomes clash with public values. Most critically, as voters, laypeople influence the platforms on which prosecutors run and who ultimately gets elected, which can help drive more ethical institutional norms within prosecutors’ offices. Our results highlight the challenges facing prosecutorial oversight and accountability, underscoring the roles that judges and laypeople can play in addressing them.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI systems, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have recently emerged as significant contributors to creative processes. While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we extend the regularized Bayesian estimator of multilevel latent variable models (Dashuk et al., 2024) to improve the estimation of the between-group parameter βb in two-level latent variable models with covariates. Specifically, we allow for the inclusion of covariates and optimize the estimator’s accuracy in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Simulation results indicate that the regularized Bayesian estimator consistently outperforms both standard and transformed maximum likelihood (ML) estimators, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes and low intraclass correlations. While the estimator achieves lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and relative bias, it exhibited poorer coverage rates and less reliable standard errors compared to ML estimators. To address these limitations, we propose some strategies. Furthermore, a transformed ML estimator is utilized to enhance the accuracy of the estimation of the covariate parameter γ. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how to apply the extended regularized Bayesian estimator to a real dataset using the MLOB package in R.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have examined how the COVID-19 pandemic affected dream recall, dream content, and nightmares. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to the individual and situational factors associated with pandemic-induced changes in dreams. The threat simulation theory of dreaming predicts that threatening situations in our waking life (situational factors) influence threatening dream content. At the same time, individual differences predispose some people to be more prone to experience threatening dreams more frequently than others. Using a large Finnish sample of prospective dream diaries, we analyzed the relative importance of individual (e.g., belonging to COVID-19 risk group, life satisfaction, depression symptoms) and situational factors (e.g., daily COVID-19 worry, COVID-19 media consumption, negative and positive emotions) to determine the best predictors for threatening events and COVID-19 related threatening events in dreams. Random forest analyses revealed that individual factors were consistently better predictors than situational factors for both threatening events and pandemic-related threatening events in dreams. Lower life satisfaction was the only statistically significant predictor for threatening events, and fewer positive emotions in the past two weeks the only statistically significant predictor for pandemic-related threatening events, in dreams. These findings suggest that the propensity to experience threatening dream content, including pandemic-related threatening events, is more of a stable trait rather than a daily fluctuating feature of dreams. In the light of the threat simulation theory, it could be argued that individual variation in the proneness to simulate threatening events adaptively interacts with daily experiences to modulate threatening dream content.",

          "abstract": "In a predictive processing framework, religiosity and spirituality (R&amp;S) have been linked to increased reliance on prior beliefs and decreased prediction error monitoring. In addition, R&amp;S might be differentially related to processing exteroceptive and interoceptive information. The present study aimed at manipulating different components of the predictive processing model (prior beliefs and prediction error monitoring) in interoception, and evaluating the resulting changes in the implicit R&amp;S. In a variant of the heartbeat discrimination task (HDT), we used a sham transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol to induce prior beliefs about a decrease or increase of the heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1). Prediction error monitoring was modulated by manipulating error feedback reliability in the same HDT (Experiment 2). Results showed that the point of subjective equality and the decision criterion shifted towards the direction of the induced prior compared to the baseline condition only in the direction of the decreased heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1), while the sensitivity decreased with unreliable error feedback compared to reliable one (Experiment 2). Crucially, implicit S, but not R, that were measured after the HDT increased following the prior beliefs induction; no significant change was observed after the unreliable error feedback. The effects in Experiment 1 were modulated by the prevalence of autistic personality traits. Together, the results support the predictive coding account of R&amp;S where increased reliance on prior beliefs, but not on prediction error monitoring, has a crucial role in the R&amp;S experiences, and demonstrate the differential input of interoceptive signals in the R&amp;S.",

          "authors": "Martin Brunner; Franzis Preckel; Oliver Lüdtke; Lena Keller",
          "abstract": "Gender differences in reading comprehension and motivation can contribute to disparities between genders in educational and occupational success, as well as in societal participation. Previous meta-analyses on gender differences in reading have had several limitations: They investigated only student samples, lacked recent international effect size estimates, and focused on printed texts and a narrow set of motivational constructs. To address these gaps, we synthesized representative individual participant data from international large-scale assessments conducted between 1990 and 2023, spanning 130 countries and including both student and adult populations (total N = 6,365,416). Overall, females outperformed males in reading comprehension (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.17) and reported higher reading motivation (SMD = 0.22). Moderator analyses provided novel evidence that the magnitude of these gender differences varies systematically by age, assessment format, construct operationalization, and contextual factors. Gender differences in both reading comprehension and motivation were more pronounced during adolescence but decreased for motivation and diminished for comprehension in adulthood. Gender differences in reading comprehension were smaller for digital than for printed texts, and gender differences in task values were larger than those in self-beliefs. From 1990 to 2023, motivation differences declined, whereas comprehension differences increased overall but narrowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater national prosperity and higher participation of women in management positions and tertiary education were associated with larger advantages for females in comprehension, whereas motivation differences decreased as national prosperity rose. These findings provide the most comprehensive and robust evidence on gender differences in reading with important implications for research, practice, and policy.",

Most studies on human exploration used overly simple tasks that isolate variables but poorly reflect problems humans evolved to solve–limiting the generalizability of the results. To address this limitation, we introduce the Lockbox paradigm, a novel, ecologically valid, and challenging task that requires active exploration and physical interaction.\nData from 263 participants interacting with the Lockbox across three different interaction modalities of varying interaction costs, reveal a remarkable ability to adapt and solve problems efficiently in complex scenarios. By comparing the interaction modalities, we demonstrate the critical role of cost variations, such as physical and temporal costs, in driving attentiveness and shaping exploration strategies. These findings provide important insights into human exploration strategies, with potential applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.",

Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an AI model? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

Results indicate that while perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy in guessing targets’ outcomes (win, loss, or draw) from facial displays of emotion, they struggled to distinguish between losses and draws. Further, although emotions (positive vs. negative)appear to act as cues for outcome detection, fEMG data reveal no significant pattern of activation linked to outcome accuracy. These findings highlight facial display of emotion as a communicative tool for contextual information and the role of experience, societal and cultural norms in constructing subjective yet socially expected reactions across individuals.",

          "authors": "Xue-Fei Yan; Zhihao Ma",
          "abstract": "Science-related populism, as a specific form of populist attitude toward scientific authority, has attracted increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Although the SciPop Scale has been proposed to measure this attitude, its cross-national validity and measurement invariance remain underexplored. Moreover, the impact of scoring approaches corresponding to different measurement philosophies on the interpretation of the SciPop Scale has not yet been examined. Using data from the “Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism” (TISP) project and the Swiss Science Barometer, this study analyzes a sample of 69,341 participants across 68 countries and regions, as well as a nationally representative Swiss sample of 1124 participants, to examine the psychometric properties of the SciPop Scale. The results indicate that: first, the SciPop Scale demonstrates high reliability, with a four-factor structure being the most widely applicable optimal model; second, full measurement invariance is achieved across sex, age, education, residence, political orientation, and religiosity, while partial invariance is observed across geographic regions, economic development levels, cultural values, and political regimes. However, overall cross-national comparability remains limited, though approximate invariance can be attained through measurement alignment. Third, different scoring methods yield inconsistent identification of the weakest dimension. Fourth, when examining criterion validity, alignment-adjusted scores based on the Bollen approach consistently outperform those based on the Goertz approach, showing greater explanatory power for cross-national or cross-group comparisons. Taken together, this study not only provides evidence for cross-national applicability of the SciPop Scale but also engages with broader questions regarding the measurement philosophy of populist attitudes. The choice of scoring method is not merely a technical decision; it directly shapes how the structure of populism is understood and interpreted.",

          "abstract": "In September 2023, Storm Daniel struck northeastern Libya, causing severe flooding, widespread destruction, and substantial loss of life. In the aftermath, the health and well-being of older adults have been a major concern for researchers and policymakers. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the post-disaster health outcomes of older adults affected by this natural disaster. This study aims to first compare the health status of older adults who were affected by the flood to those who were unaffected using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting, approximately 1.5 years after the disaster, and then examine the impact of primary and secondary stressors on health outcomes among flood-affected older adults, identifying potential risk and protective factors. Results suggested that, for most health outcomes, there were no significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups. Notably, older adults who experienced the flood reported significantly lower levels of loneliness and better psychological health-related quality of life, suggesting effective recovery and strong resilience. However, injuries, the loss of close family members or friends, and structural damage to homes were significantly associated with poorer health and well-being. However, some counterintuitive findings also emerged, with certain stressors showing associations with better post-disaster health outcomes. In sum, our findings provide support for the inoculation/maturation hypothesis and challenge common assumptions about older adults’ vulnerability in disaster contexts.",

Access to evidence-based treatment remains limited. This study introduces and evaluates Internet Cognitive Therapy for Prolonged Grief (iCT-PG), a therapist-assisted digital intervention adapted from iCT-PTSD.\nObjective:\nTo assess preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of iCT-PG, and its impact on key cognitive maintenance mechanisms of PGD.\nMethods:\nEight adults meeting diagnostic criteria for PGD completed the 12-session iCT-PG programme over 14 weeks. The intervention targeted loss-related memory characteristics, negative grief appraisals, a sense of social disconnection, and unhelpful coping strategies, and used a personalised digital modular approach and therapist support through weekly calls and messages. Outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up using validated measures.\nResults:\nAll participants completed treatment. Large reductions in PGD symptoms and comorbid symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were observed. At post-treatment, 87.5% (7/8) demonstrated both reliable improvement in PGD symptoms on the Reliable Change Index, and recovery below clinical cut-offs. There was no reliable deterioration on any measure. Process measures showed large effect sizes, with the strongest improvements in loss-related memory characteristics. Therapeutic gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Average therapist time was approximately 10 hours per participant.\nConclusions:\niCT-PG was feasible, well-accepted, and associated with substantial clinical improvement. The intervention successfully targeted mechanisms known to maintain PGD, supporting its theoretical foundation. Though uncontrolled and small in sample size, findings support further evaluation in larger trials to determine efficacy and scalability.",

A previous study found no evidence for this effect, potentially due to the use of standardized threat word lists with suboptimal personal relevance. \nObjectives:\nThe present study aimed to test the hypervigilance hypothesis using individually tailored threat words to enhance ecological validity. \nMethods:\nAcross four pre-registered reaction time experiments, we assessed attentional bias in patients with atopic dermatitis using a spatial cueing task. We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases. These findings do not support the hypervigilance hypothesis. \nConclusions:\nIn combination with an earlier negative report, we conclude that there is currently no evidence that attentional bias, as assessed by the spatial cueing task, plays a central role in the psychological burden associated with atopic dermatitis.",

However, successive systematic reviews have identified a lack of well-validated measures that capture ageism according to contemporary consensus definitions and that can be used to illuminate ageism experiences across the world. To address this gap, the WHO Ageism Experiences Scale was developed; however, to date it has not been validated in Arabic and there is limited knowledge about its functioning in humanitarian settings, where issues related to ageism may be exacerbated. The present study, therefore, conducted the first psychometric evaluation of the new Arabic translation of the scale in Libya, including participants who were directly affected by the recent devastating floods. As relevant, results supported the factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, convergent validity and concurrent validity of the subscale scores, including in participants affected by the floods.

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

However, so far, these beliefs have been mainly explored with self-report and response conflict measures where expectation-confirming (vs. violating) judgments elicit faster responding. The present lab study (N = 57) applied a novel approach – the random generation paradigm – to understand how pre-existing social assumptions determine which information is retrieved from memory when prompted by different social categories. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine (hypothetical) people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ estimates of gender proportions. Together, these findings offer a new, and widely applicable, method for exploring cultural beliefs and help clarify how social information is sampled from memory when making social judgments.",

          "authors": "Johannah Völler; Juan Linde Domingo; Javier Ortiz-Tudela; Carlos González-García",
          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are characterized as a risk factor for self-harm within the Integrated-Motivational Volitional (IMV) model. However, it is unclear how ACEs relate to self-harm as it unfolds in daily-life, and research investigating potential protective factors in the association between ACEs and self-harm is scarce. Here, we investigated whether ACEs were associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), and whether parent-child or peer attachment relationship quality influenced this association. Additionally, we explored whether specific types of ACEs were differentially associated with self-harm. \n\tMethods: A cross-sectional study using retrospective questionnaires to assess ACEs, lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviours, and paternal, maternal, and peer attachment relationship quality, and ESM to assess daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, 10x/day for 6 days. N=1014 adolescents (Age, Mean (SD) = 14.05 years (1.91), 66.66% female) were recruited from the general population via schools across Flanders (Belgium). \n\tResults: Multilevel analyses demonstrated associations between ACEs and lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, that were attenuated by a high-quality maternal attachment relationship. Specific types of ACEs (e.g., sexual victimization) were more strongly associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours.\n\tConclusion: The study provides evidence for ACEs as a pre-motivational phase variable within the IMV model. Clinicians are encouraged to consider exposure to ACEs and the potential of maternal relationships to buffer their impact in the prevention and management of adolescent self-harm.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nDigital mental health platforms often consist of many different forms of self-care exercises. To our knowledge, whether the number of choices presented to the users affects their uptake and experiences and poses negative consequences (i.e., not choosing any exercises, choice dissatisfaction) for users, especially those experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms or unpleasant state emotions have not been empirically investigated.\n\nObjective:\nThe present study investigated the impact of choice set size on practice decisions, completion, satisfaction, and subjective experiences, as well as potential moderators including depression and anxiety symptoms, state emotions, and motivational and decisional attributes on these choice outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nParticipants were recruited through university mass email and social media, and 652 participants were included in our analyses. Participants completed questions regarding anxiety and depressive symptoms, state emotions, and other psychological attributes. Then, they were randomly assigned to 1-choice, 4-choice, and 16-choice conditions, in which they may choose a self-care activity to practice or decide not to practice. Finally, they completed questions regarding completion, satisfaction, engagement, attitude, and perceived improvement in psychological state.\n\nResults:\nPresenting multiple choices resulted in a higher likelihood of practice (ORs = 3.12, 95% CI [2.08, 4.67] and 3.83. 95% CI [2.55, 5.76], ps &lt; .001) and better decision satisfaction (16-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.56], p &lt; .001; 4-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.05, 0.43], p = .033) compared to presenting with a single choice. Tentative evidence indicates anxiety symptoms and state emotions were meaningful moderators. Specifically, for individuals with more anxiety symptoms and intense negative emotions, presenting a larger choice set (16 choices) resulted in more positive chosen exercise satisfaction, better attitudes towards chosen activity, and higher perceived improvement in mental health state after the activity, when compared to presenting with smaller choice sets (anxiety: β = -0.38, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.06] to -0.51, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.18], state emotions: β = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.66, 0.03] to -0.60, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.28]). No evidence was found for moderating effect of motivational and decisional attributes. \n\nConclusions:\nThe moderation results were contradictory to prior research and our expectation that a larger choice set may result in worse outcomes than a smaller choice set for people who were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress. We speculated a possible reason for these findings may be that people with more anxiety symptoms and unpleasant emotions may have stronger need to reduce these uncomfortable symptoms and emotions, and being presented with more choices on self-care activities, there may be a higher possibility that these self-care activities can address their distress.\n\nRegistration:\nOpen Science Framework puwxb; https://osf.io/puwxb/",

We investigate how moment-to-moment smartphone behavior corresponds to the perception of automaticity, with implications for the measurement of habitual behavior more generally. Contrary to expectations, duration – rather than frequency – of smartphone behavior emerged as the more consistent predictor of situational habit perception at both within- and between-person levels. However, these links varied by the type of behavior, with sessions and episodes (but not glances) relating to perceived automaticity. Additionally, home screen and gateway app use were not associated with perceived automaticity. Our results generate new insights – and deep questions – into the nature of real-world media habits.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a type of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) that is useful for evaluating the factor structure of measurement scales based on data from multiple studies. Modeling the factor structure is just one example of many potentially interesting research questions. Analyzing covariance matrices allows for the evaluation of measurement properties across studies, such as whether indicators are functioning the same across studies. For example, are some indicators more indicative of the common factor in certain types of studies than in others? The additional analysis of means of the observed variables opens up many other research questions to consider such as: ‘Are there mean differences in mental health between clinical and non-clinical samples?’. To answer such questions, it is necessary to analyze both the covariance and the mean structure of the indicators. Meta-analytic CFA with means is applicable when the studies included in the meta-analysis used the same indicators, measured on the same scales. In this paper, we present and illustrate a method to incorporate the means of variables in MASEM analyses of such datasets. We focus on meta-analytic CFA, with the aim of testing differences in latent means across studies. We provide illustrations of the comparison of latent means across groups of studies using two empirical datasets, for which data and analysis scripts are provided online. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method relates to other analysis options such as multigroup or multilevel structural equation modeling.",

Poorer parental monitoring and supervision, more inconsistent discipline, more corporal punishment, more family dysfunction, male sex, and lower family socio-economic status significantly predicted higher odds of being in the medium decreasing trajectory.

Across three studies comprising 429,980 responses from 1,159 human participants and 4,068 large language model (LLM) agents, we tested whether LLMs use emotions to guide altruistic punishment in ways comparable to humans. In Study 1, humans (n = 1,017) and four LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, o3-mini, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) exhibited emotion-behaviour coupling: unfair allocations elicited stronger negative emotions which, in mediation analyses, predicted higher punishment. In Study 2a, prompting reasoning-optimised LLMs (o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1) to self-report their emotional valence and arousal significantly increased punishment, and this causal effect was replicated in humans (Study 2b, n = 142). Alongside these parallels, LLMs were less cost-sensitive and showed stronger emotion-mediated effects than humans, revealing a “hyper-fairness” tendency. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that modern LLMs move beyond emotional knowledge to active emotion utilisation, while highlighting the potential and safeguards for emotionally intelligent AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Everyday decision making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and developing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that arise specifically in multialternative decisions. This study, based on preregistered procedures, investigated such nonnormative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a “max versus next” decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally accounted for a well-known nonnormative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multichoice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by identifying two critical time windows in confidence constructions: Confidence is based on sensory evidence collected shortly after stimulus presentation and evidence gathered right after decision making. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics underlying multichoice irrationalities.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception entails the integration of multiple acoustic cues that unfold asynchronously. While conventional work posits that listeners immediately update higher-level interpretations as cues become available, emerging evidence suggests that processing of certain speech sounds (e.g., voiceless sibilant fricatives) may be buffered, in which categorical judgments are temporarily withheld until the arrival of subsequent cues (such as a following vocoid). This study examined the mechanisms underlying this buffered integration, testing whether its release is triggered by specific incoming information or by a fixed temporal threshold. Additionally, we examine potential sources of this buffering effect. Using the Visual World Paradigm (VWP), we tested this by manipulating frication duration for /s/ and /ʃ/ to canonical, doubled, and tripled lengths. Participants (n=56) completed a VWP task to determine when recognition of a fricative occurred, and a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task to assess categorization profiles and determine whether these profiles predict individual differences in buffering. The VWP results replicated prior findings: for canonical-length fricatives, listeners delayed processing until frication offset. For double-length fricatives, this buffering was extended, with listeners withholding decisions until the entire fricative duration had elapsed. When fricative lengths were tripled, partial commitment emerged during the frication period, yet final decisions remained contingent on later cues. These results suggest that buffering is largely governed by the availability of acoustic information over time, though listeners may integrate partial information at extreme durations. VAS results revealed that listeners with greater sensitivity to secondary cues showed faster recognition. Together, these findings underscore the flexible nature of speech perception, highlighting how listeners strategically modulate processing to optimize cue integration.",

This paper examined the use of ASReview and ChatGPT for screening, data extraction, and quality ratings compared against a traditional systematic review to explore potential efficiency, accuracy of information, and consistency of judgements compared to human reviewers. \n\nMethods\nThree screening simulations were conducted using ASReview with different amounts of training data (1, 3, or 5 irrelevant/relevant records). A standardised set of prompts were developed and uploaded to ChatGPT for data extraction and coded for accuracy against the primary studies.  For quality ratings, Cochrane’s guidance for the Risk of Bias 2.0 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tools were provided to ChatGPT, with their respective templates.\n\nResults\nIn all simulations ASReview prioritised relevant studies within the first 800 records (approximately 17% of the dataset). When extracting, ChatGPT sometimes omitted information, though further detail was provided with additional prompting. Few instances of inaccurate information were observed. Consistency of quality ratings was low to moderate, depending on the domain of bias. \n\nConclusions\nAI tools can reduce the time required for screening through effective prioritisation of relevant articles and might also support data extraction by quickly locating relevant information in a manuscript. They should, however, be approached with caution for more complex tasks (e.g., quality ratings). In any case, the use of AI requires careful testing and validation of outputs.",

          "abstract": "How do people make sense of other people, who are simultaneously psychological beings and physical objects? Across the cognitive sciences, researchers have studied theory of mind (making sense of other people’s behaviors in terms of their mental states, or ‘naive psychology’) and physical reasoning (making sense of physical events in terms of their underlying mechanics and dynamics, or ‘naive physics’), as two separate processes. In this paper, we describe two key ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind, which articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together. We propose that from early in human development, people navigate the social world by dedicating two distinct but interacting systems for reasoning about other agents’ ethereal minds and their physical bodies.",

          "authors": "Vipul Nair; Mehul Bhatt; Jakob Suchan; Erik Billing; Paul Hemeren",
          "abstract": "Studies in visual cognition highlight the importance of visual, spatial, and auditory cues in influencing human attention. Such cues often tend to be indicative of actions or events, thereby serving as predictive indicators in both passive observation as well as in interactive engagement. Our research focuses on visual attention in passive observation, particularly examining the manner in which visual, spatial, and auditory cues ---henceforth visuoauditory cues--- influence attention on everyday multimodal interaction.  We systematically develop a visuoauditory event model for investigating visual attention in naturalistic embodied settings. Rooted in this event model, we explore the influence of five select visuoauditory cues ---namely, speaking, gaze, relative motion, hand action, and visibility--- on visual attention. Our analysis utilizes eye-tracking data from 90 participants observing 27 carefully designed naturalistic event scenarios and correlating their attentional metrics with the select visuoauditory cues in the backdrop of the developed event model. Findings reveal strong associations between attention and both {intra-modal (irrespective of other cues) and cross-modal (combined with other cues)} cueing effects, thereby highlighting the nuanced interplay amongst the cues influencing attentional patterns. We develop a systematic and generalized method for analyzing interactions and behavioral parameters, thereby characterizing the impact of visuoauditory cues on attentional dynamics. Our methodology, combined with the obtained insights into the attentional cueing effects, provides an analytical framework explicating the manner in which everyday (interactive) events directly drive attention under naturalistic conditions. This facilitates not only the precise modeling of behavior and attention allocation but also offers a high-level `experimental lens' for examining interactions in relation to behavioral parameters. Taken together, our methodological and behavioral findings are well-positioned to benefit multiple fields, particularly by advancing human-centered design across diverse application domains. Lastly, towards promoting open-science and for wider dissemination, the complete experimental basis of this research -e.g., event-scenarios, high-quality annotated data, data-set supplementary- have been independently documented together with instructions to use and access experimental data.\n\nwww. https://codesign-lab.org/cognitive-vision/multimodal-cues",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that sustained visual attention operates rhythmically, as if the visual system periodically samples stimuli in the environment. Here we present evidence for rhythmic sampling of internal representations of targets and distractors up to one second after visual stimulation offset. Twenty participants performed an anticipatory object-based visual attention task involving a short-lasting (50 msec) target object image. This task was made more challenging by the overlaid presentation of a distractor object image. We conducted a decoding analysis on stimulus-evoked EEG to measure target and distractor information over the stimulus epoch, which extended almost 1000 msec beyond the visual stimulus offset. We found that the magnitudes of target and distractor information represented in brain activity after the offset of the visual stimuli oscillated in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). This oscillatory period accords with previous characterizations of rhythmic attentional sampling of continuously visually presented stimuli. Moreover, greater target-distractor theta band phase differences correlated with improved task performance. Our findings show that: 1. Attention separately samples target and distractor representations in sensory memory; 2. These separately sampled streams of information may mutually inhibit one another; and 3. Target discrimination improves when target and distractor sampling rhythms are desynchronized.",

Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific).

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from 104 older adults with insomnia disorder enrolled in a clinical trial examining the impact of CBT-I, Behavioral Therapy (BT), and Cognitive Therapy (CT) on insomnia severity. Participants were randomized to six sessions of BT, CT, or CBT-I (combined BT and CT).

Linear-mixed effects models examined the impact of treatment on memory and SWA. Regression analyses examined relationships between changes in SWA and memory following the treatment. Results: Improvements were identified in immediate memory (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, and Figure Recall). The analysis did not reveal significant changes in SWA following treatment. However, there was a significant positive association between improvements in List Learning and increases in SWA.

Parents and teachers can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, but only if they associate excessive hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, with ADHD. \nObjectives:\nThis study was designed to determine how parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD-related behaviours, as compared with Canadians. It also explored the influence of ADHD-specific knowledge and attitudes on their perceptions. \nMethods:\nWe sampled parents and teachers from Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Canada (n = 380), using four brief vignettes about a child exhibiting behaviours consistent with four mental health conditions. After reading each vignette, participants rated their perception of the children’s behaviours and then completed ADHD knowledge and attitudes scales. We analyzed the data using a series of multilevel models. \nResults:\nOur findings indicate that although parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD symptoms as indiscipline or low motivation more so than Canadians, this country-level difference was non-significant when controlling for knowledge of ADHD; attitudes had no discernible impact. \nDiscussion/Conclusion:\nCountry-level differences appear to be strongly shaped by variation in knowledge about ADHD, highlighting psychoeducation as a critical first step toward improving parents’ and teachers’ accurate identification of symptoms. This, in turn, could benefit children with undiagnosed ADHD by increasing the likelihood of earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, sociocultural differences in interpreting symptoms as illness may further contribute to contrasts between Trinidad and Tobago and Canada.",

To address this, we developed the 67-item Comprehensive Paranormal Belief Scale (CPBS), derived from 29 existing measures, and administered it to an undergraduate sample (N = 287). The CPBS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = .97) and acceptable-to-good reliabilities for 12 subscales (αs ranging from .71 to .87). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a bifactor structure comprising a general paranormal-belief factor alongside five specific dimensions: Psychic powers, Superstition, Supernatural beings, Material divination, and Traditional religious beliefs (CFI = .93, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .075). Hierarchical regressions revealed that psychological variables, particularly psychosis proneness and experiential thinking, accounted for substantial incremental variance beyond socio-political factors (ΔR-squared ranged from 7.9% to 31.1%), among which spirituality emerged as the strongest predictor. However, distinct predictor profiles for individual dimensions also emerged, further illuminated by canonical correlation analysis. The debated status of traditional religious beliefs within the paranormal domain is also discussed.

          "abstract": "With growing interest in ecologically valid stimuli and the proliferation of recognition and classification algorithms, environmental sounds are increasingly a topic of interest and study. However, there is a lack of consensus as to which sound categories should be selected, and which exemplars should represent these categories. Indeed, many existing datasets include only one exemplar per sound class. This is not characteristic of the actual acoustic environment and can lead to brittle and unrepresentative computational solutions and experimental results. Importantly, the existing literature provides relatively little information about how human listeners perceive the recognizability, similarity and representativeness of acoustically and perceptually varying sounds. Here, we introduce the Environmental Sounds (EnviSounds) dataset. It provides data from over 1000 human listeners performing different tasks (recognition, similarity judgement, goodness of fit) on 53 commonly encountered environmental sound categories of human, natural and man-made sounds, each represented by 10 different exemplars. We provide behavioural indices of within-class similarity and goodness of exemplar for all samples. Furthermore, we include normative data for recognition and identification latency, accuracy, and imageability, enabling researchers to select items for experiments based on pre-defined criteria across these dimensions. With this dataset, environmental sounds can be considered at various levels of complexity: sounds produced by the same sources varying in their acoustics (within-class acoustic variability) and acoustically similar sounds produced by different sources (between-category confusion). The dataset can be used for specifying training sets with individual sound sources, defining the categorical boundaries, or providing additional variables to building prediction models.",

          "abstract": "Humans readily infer others’ feelings from how they move, yet the computational principles\nthat support this ability remain debated. Two prominent accounts propose either direct motor\nmatching or predictive coding mechanisms. Here we combine motion-capture, behavior asses-\nsments, and fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis to test whether an observer’s own motor reper-\ntoire operates as an embodied prior during affective action perception. We quantified motor\nsimilarity between each observer and stimulus kinematics and examined its impact on neural\nrepresentations within the action observation network. Motor similarity sharpened affective\nrepresentations in inferior frontal gyrus: cross-validated classifiers trained on high-similarity\ntrials decoded valence reliably above chance and outperformed classifiers trained on low-simi-\nlarity trials. In contrast, motor similarity attenuated univariate BOLD responses in inferior pa-\nrietal lobule, consistent with reduced prediction error under more precise priors. Behaviorally,\nobservers judged motorically dissimilar interactions as more intense, indicating greater per-\nceptual salience when observed kinematics diverge from one’s own repertoire. Affective inten-\nsity further modulated neural precision in inferior frontal gyrus, revealing an interaction\nbetween social salience and embodied priors. Together, these converging neural and behavio-\nral results adjudicate between competing accounts by demonstrating a principled double dis-\nsociation: representational sharpening in inferior frontal gyrus without increased activation,\nalongside attenuation in inferior parietal lobule under higher similarity, supporting a hierar-\nchical predictive coding framework for social perception. Beyond action observation, our re-\nsults show that a person’s own movement repertoire calibrates neural representations of affect,\noffering a general principle for efficient embodied inference.",

          "abstract": "Biased information processing plays an important role in mental disorders. This study investi-gates biases in value-based decision making and how links to psychological resilience can be accounted for by individual differences in the cognitive and neural processing of affective in-formation. Decision making was studied in 82 people (41 female, 41 male; age: 18–37 years) using a cost-benefit integration task. Neural activity was recorded via fMRI, cognitive pro-cessing modeled with an evidence-accumulation model. Choice bias was positively associated with self-reported resilience (particularly the facet ‘acceptance’) – and this association was me-diated by differences in the neural processing of affective information during decision making: Participants with a more positive bias and higher resilience showed stronger increases in neural activity in response to loss in ten prefrontal and parietal brain regions – and stronger decreases in response to gain in the right inferior frontal junction. Cognitive-computational modeling re-vealed that more positive biases were associated with lower sensitivity to and lower valuation of negative information – along with relatively higher sensitivity to and higher valuation of positive information. Notably, higher valuation of positive information was associated with stronger neural responses to negative information in dACC and bilateral insula. Finally, bias and resili-ence were associated with differential functional connectivity between prefrontal seeds, midbrain, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that stronger activation of brain regions associated with cognitive control – specifically in response to negative information – promotes a positive cognitive bias in affective decision making that may support resilience to mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "This study demonstrates that urban migration is a key driver of AI acceptance in e-commerce. Using survey data from 784 Chinese consumers, we show that migrants from small to large cities exhibit significantly higher AI acceptance than non-migrants, and that this acceptance fully mediates their greater purchase intention. The effect is sequentially transmitted through enhanced self-esteem. Personality traits also play a role. Openness and conscientiousness increase acceptance, whereas neuroticism reduces it. However, the positive effect of openness is attenuated among individuals who remain in small cities. Gender dynamics reveal an asymmetry: men report higher overall AI acceptance but lower purchase intention toward female AI presenters. Finally, both greater monthly expenditure and broader product category diversity enhance AI acceptance, although among migrants the benefit of high expenditure diminishes when combined with high diversity, a pattern we refer to as the “complexity paradox.” By integrating environmental transitions with psychological traits, this study extends the Technology Acceptance Model and provides actionable insights for targeting migrants and optimizing AI influencer design.",

This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

We assessed symptom improvements associated with treatment elements, represented by modules within modular psychotherapy.\n\nMethods: Data from six clinical trials of the MATCH modular psychotherapy were combined (N=490; 5403 sessions; 6-15 years) to test effects of modules grouped into seven common treatment principles: Feeling Calm (e.g., relaxation strategies), Increasing Motivation (e.g., contingency management), Repairing Thoughts (e.g., cognitive restructuring), Solving Problems (e.g., problem solving), Trying the Opposite (e.g., exposure), Engagement/Psychoeducation (e.g., building rapport), and Future Planning (e.g., planning skill use). Multi-level models with autoregressive covariance controlled for previous symptoms, session number, and baseline symptoms; accounted for temporality with each session occurring prior to associated outcomes; importantly, we modeled associations between outcomes and between- and within-person use of treatment principles. Measures included weekly youth- and caregiver-reported internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms, plus idiographic top problems.\n\nResults: A between-person effect linked Future Planning (B’s=-.369 — -.368; p’s&lt;.05) to better outcomes. Better within-person effects were observed for Increasing Motivation (B’s=-0.087 — -0.057; p's&lt;.05), Trying the Opposite (B’s=-.087 – -.056); p’s&lt;.05), and Future Planning (B=-0.146; p&lt;.001). Six outcomes showed worse within-person effects for Engagement/Psychoeducation (B’s=.036 — .099; p’s&lt;.05); efforts to build engagement drove this finding; those efforts were associated with less use of skills-focused principles.\n\nConclusions: Increasing Motivation, Trying the Opposite, and Future Planning were associated with especially good outcomes; therapists’ engagement attempts were associated with less focus on skill-building, and poorer immediate outcomes.

          "abstract": "Research indicates autistic defendants are treated more leniently than non-autistic defendants. However, it is unclear whether this is caused by positive perceptions of autistic people, or because autism is a relevant mitigating factor. Across two studies we tested how mock jurors evaluated autistic defendants in autism relevant and irrelevant criminal cases to better understand when and why autistic defendants receive leniency. Further, we provided some of the participants with educational information about ASD allowing these participants to recognise autism as a relevant mitigation for criminal cases for which autistic traits can be a risk factor (assault and stalking cases, but not burglary cases).\nDefendants with ASD only received lower sentences when autism was a relevant mitigation (assault and stalking), but not when autism was irrelevant (burglary). Thus, participants did not simply give preferential treatment to autistic defendants, but considered how ASD was related to the offense. However, providing information about autism weakened these effects, indicating educating people about autism may not always benefit autistic defendants.\nOur study highlights the importance of nuanced messaging about autism. While explaining how autistic characteristics can explain criminal behaviour may reduce perceptions of criminal responsibility, it may also imply greater dangerousness or risk of reoffending.",

          "abstract": "How do we create new language? Drawing on the observation that some languages—such as Pirahã—are almost entirely without a number system, this work explores what other features of human language could be fundamental yet remain unrealized. We propose the super language framework, a modular approach for iterating new forms (e.g. phonetic or morphological containers) and interpretations (e.g. semantic or pragmatic functions) on top of any base language. The resulting augmented variants are organized into a typology serving as a roadmap for experimentation. As a simple proof of concept, we present StegaPhone, a super language prototype that hides binary data within deliberate mispronunciations (e.g. “swim” vs. “svim”), thereby extending a phonetic layer into a parallel communication channel. To operationalize the framework, we outline a transformation engine—a rewrite-based system capable of covering the space of possible language modifications in a standardized, invertible manner. We argue that this “tip of the spear” architecture enables rapid language development and productive feedback loops across the domains in which it may be applied. Finally, we situate the significance of such a heuristic approach by considering the central role of language in communication, cognition, machine interfaces, and beyond, underscoring how new features have, and can continue, to impart transformative capabilities onto their operators.",

This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

          "abstract": "A vast literature suggests that gender cues and emotional expression interact to shape emotional\njudgments of faces, despite earlier evidence indicating independent processing. Specifically, studies\nconsistently reveal that male faces are more likely to be perceived as angry, while female faces are\nmore likely to be perceived as happy. These biases have been attributed to socially-learned\nassociations between sex and emotion or physical resemblance between facial cues. However, most\nstudies in this area have used limited and non-diverse stimuli, such as white, computer-generated\nfaces, which have been criticised for their limited generalizability. Additionally, most related\nstudies make gender-based inferences using binary categories of gender, which disregards the\nvariety in facial sex-typicality between women's and men's faces. Given these two considerations,\nthe present study investigated whether the two sex-expression biases replicate using a more\necologically valid and racially-diverse stimulus set of and how varying masculinity and femininity\naffect these biases. Consistently, the results illustrated faster categorisation of anger in male faces\nand happiness in female faces. Feminising faces also enhanced happiness recognition regardless of\nsex, while masculinisation did not significantly influence anger recognition.

          "abstract": "Background: Explanatory frameworks for mental disorders have an important effect on stigmatisation and clinical attitudes, with mechanistic biological explanations often yielding mixed or negative effects on prognostic optimism and empathy. Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]). These showed very large mean effect sizes, of 1.07 SD (95% CI [0.65, 1.50]) and 0.76 SD CI (95% CI [0.38, 1.17]). In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

Parents' responsive linguistic input reduces uncertainty in label-referent associations and provides information at moments of infants' increased attention and receptiveness. While infants frequently lead the dyads’ focus of attention, parent speech has been shown to scaffold infants’ attention towards fixated objects. So far, however, little is known about the qualitative characteristics of parent speech during such interactions, and their effects on infants' attention. Here, we analysed the role of the content and communicative intent of caregivers' speech to their 18-month-old infants (N = 31) during free play when infants or parents led an interaction, and when parent speech sustained infant attention. Interactions were most likely to be infant-led, both temporally and topically, and parents' topically aligned, but not misaligned speech sustained infants' attention. Qualitative analysis of speech types revealed mostly object- and play-focused speech in interactions with familiar objects, but a broader range of speech types and more questions in interactions with novel objects. We hypothesize that speech in interactions with familiar objects is structured by shared experience, whereas the lack of common ground with novel objects induces parents to use more varied speech to engage their infants.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

Workplace conditions can either safeguard or intensify these challenges, with implications for maternal mental health and wellbeing. Aim: To explore the psychosocial experiences of mothers returning to work following maternity leave, focusing on the experience with workplace support and sleep deprivation. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using an open-ended online survey. Twenty-five mothers in the UK with an infant under two years of age who had recently returned to work or were return following maternity leave. Participants were recruited via mother-and-baby groups, social media, and personal networks using purposive sampling. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with analytical attention to maternal mental health, workplace structures, and sleep-related challenges. Findings: Five interrelated themes were developed as follows: Making Ends Meet, Losing Myself; The Bittersweet Return; Workplaces That Work (or Don’t); Running on Empty; and This Isn’t Just My Struggle. Conclusions: Returning to work within the first two years postpartum is shaped by financial necessity, identity negotiations, disrupted sleep, and highly variable workplace support. Findings highlight the need for compassionate, flexible, and inclusive workplace policies that recognise the ongoing caregiving demands of new mothers and support their health and wellbeing during this transition.",

          "abstract": "Motor learning underlies our ability to acquire and perfect movements across all domains of human behavior. Historically, research in this field is rooted in two distinct pathways: basic research investigating fundamental mechanisms of how we learn movement skills and applied research developing strategies to enhance skill acquisition in real-world contexts. Despite their natural complementarity, these approaches developed largely in isolation, eventually leading to a disconnect between the basic and applied research traditions. This separation is evident in citation patterns, conference attendance, and journal preferences. Here, we scrutinize this divide and identify pathways for reconnecting these traditions to advance both our understanding and enhancement of motor learning.",

          "abstract": "Living a meaningful life is a fundamental human drive and work often shapes this experience. While modern challenges can erode workplace meaningfulness, individuals may find fulfillment by linking their careers to broader societal contributions. Across three studies, we examine a psychological pathway to workplace meaningfulness and job satisfaction: impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB; i.e., high concern for the welfare of all future generations) and legacy motivation. Study 1 (N=973) shows that undergraduates who endorse IIB are more likely to pursue careers benefiting future generations, with legacy concerns mediating this link. Study 2 (N=795) finds that professionals with greater intergenerational concern report higher job satisfaction via legacy motivation and work meaningfulness. Finally, a pre-registered experiment (Study 3; N=1,240) demonstrates that reflecting on one’s intergenerational impact increases legacy motivation, meaningfulness, and, in turn, job satisfaction. Findings highlight prosocial, future-oriented framing as a psychological anchor for sustaining workplace meaningfulness amid uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Povilas Karvelis; Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu",
          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

Of cognitive factors, pseudoscientific beliefs, lower scores on the actively open-minded thinking scale, and higher preference for anecdotal information were related to increased tendency to believe in epistemically suspect claims related to COVID-19. Of social factors, lower trust in governmental institutions and science and scientists, and the use of alternative media were associated with the endorsement of epistemically suspect claims about COVID-19. Men were more likely to endorse epistemically suspect claims than women, and the support decreased with age. The present results suggest that epistemically suspect beliefs about COVID-19 are not generally common among the Finnish population. The results suggest that battling the spread of health-related misinformation, like COVID-19 conspiracy theories, may require actions that target different cognitive and social factors, such as the thinking style of individuals; trust felt towards governmental institutions, science, and mainstream media; and the content circulating in social and alternative media.",

          "abstract": "Effective self-regulated learning depends on metacognitive monitoring and control abilities, which allow learners to recognise what they do not know and adjust their learning behaviour to address knowledge gaps. However, children’s metacognitive abilities are still developing, which can hinder their ability to select relevant information effectively. This work examines whether providing feedback on children’s knowledge tests can assist their metacognitive monitoring and control processes, improving their ability to target information-seeking to fill knowledge gaps. In two experiments, 5-9-year-old children (N=203) completed a word-learning task on a tablet. They were then tested on their knowledge of the novel word-object associations and asked to report their (un)certainty in their answers. In the first experiment, children received feedback after each test trial. In both experiments, children received summary feedback at the end of the test. Afterwards, they could select some of the objects to hear their labels again and were tested on their recognition of the label-object associations once more. In both experiments, feedback boosted children’s ability to strategically seek information to fill their knowledge gaps. Moreover, when given feedback after each test trial, children based their uncertainty judgments on their previous performance. While this resulted in younger children’s uncertainty judgments to better reflect their performance, older children’s judgments were less accurate than without feedback. Importantly, children’s information-seeking was better guided by feedback than by their own subjective uncertainty, indicating that feedback provides a valuable external means for metacognitive control. Overall, the findings underscore the role of feedback in fostering the development of metacognition and self-regulated learning in childhood.",

          "abstract": "Intelligent systems—from autonomous vehicles to decision support tools—are reshaping everyday activities, yet their adoption is often tempered by users’ perceived risk. Perceived risk significantly influences users' decisions to adopt or reject such systems, highlighting the critical need to understand and mitigate them. However, existing measurement tools for assessing perceived risk remain inadequate, limiting effective intervention and research efforts. To address this gap, we developed and validated a multidimensional scale of perceived risk in intelligent system interaction, focusing on three representative safety-critical domains: autonomous vehicles, medical decision support systems, and financial decision support systems. Step 1 involved item generation based on literature analysis. Step 2 employed exploratory factor analysis to refine the scale structure (N = 644). In Step 3, confirmatory factor analyses and additional validation procedures (N = 639) confirmed a robust six-factor model: Third-Party Risk, Operational Cost Risk, Social Appraisal Risk, Probability and Severity Risk, Affective Risk, and Performance Integrity Risk. The final scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including reliability, discriminant validity, and predictive validity for user trust, satisfaction, and intention to use. This scale offers researchers and practitioners a rigorously validated instrument for diagnosing perceived risk in safety‑critical intelligent systems and guiding targeted mitigation strategies that can enhance acceptance, usability.",

First, concurrent Think-Aloud analyzed with large language models (LLMs) surpasses classic cognitive models and neural networks in predicting behavior, showing that verbal reports contain generative information beyond behavior alone. Second, Think-Aloud generalizes across individuals with only a few examples, reflecting shared cognitive patterns. Third, Think-Aloud guides LLMs toward more human-like reasoning. Together, these findings position Think-Aloud as a scalable complement to behavioral measures, reopening a foundational debate in cognitive science and informing human-aligned AI.",

          "abstract": "Although absolute pitch (AP) is often celebrated as a rare musical gift, Western tonal music relies on relative pitch (RP), where meaning depends on intervals to the tonic. This contrast furnishes a natural test bed for cognitive control: AP is an automatic, stimulus-bound code, whereas RP requires context-dependent computation. We tested 50 non–music-major students spanning the AP proficiency continuum on a movable-Do solfa-naming task under three tonal contexts of rising difficulty (fixed C major, fixed B major, randomly shifting keys). AP gave an overall advantage, yet error pattern and response time analyses showed systematic strategy switching among AP possessors: (i) AP use in C major, (ii) pitch name transposition in B major, and (iii) interval/chord listening in random keys, with individual differences. Non AP participants relied on RP across conditions. Thus, scale note identification recruits adaptive strategy selection governed by AP proficiency, tonal context, and cognitive load, illustrating cognitive control in a naturalistic musical task and motivating tailored ear training in music education.",

          "abstract": "People often predict how they might feel in the future, with varying degrees of accuracy.  Such affective forecasts can centre around periods of time (e.g., tomorrow, next week) and/or specific events (e.g., an upcoming meeting). Affective forecasts for quotidian events or periods of time are the building blocks of everyday decision-making. Yet, most affective forecasting research has focused on forecasting accuracy for rare and consequential events, such as election results and romantic break-ups. Therefore, in two intensive longitudinal datasets, we tested everyday forecasting accuracy in general and in relation to specific unpleasant events. In Study 1—a week-long experience sampling study—participants (N=209) provided (i) one weekly forecast about their feelings over the next week, and (ii) daily forecasts about their feelings the next day. Participants also rated their (i) daily affect each evening, and (ii) their momentary affect nine times each day. In Study 2—a two-week daily diary—participants (N=69) nominated an upcoming unpleasant event each day and forecasted their affect in relation to that event. Each evening, participants rated how they felt when this event occurred. We found that participants could predict when a day/event would make them feel better/worse than usual, showing relative accuracy, but sometimes made small errors in forecasting their absolute affect levels, showing absolute inaccuracy. These findings suggest that people make smaller forecasting errors in everyday life than for major events, which likely aids everyday decision making, for example by informing the use of future-oriented affect-regulation strategies (e.g., situation selection).",

Acceptability of DMHIs might differ among patients with differing level of symptoms and relational difficulties. This study investigated how a person’s psychological profile, including their level of mental health symptoms, epistemic trust, and attachment security, predicts their acceptance of AI-based interventions (avatars, chatbots) versus human-delivered teletherapy. \nMethod. Using cluster analysis on survey data from 1,612 (potential) patients and clinicians recruited via Prolifc, we identified three distinct psychological profiles: “Avoidant-not trusting,” “Secure-trusting-healthy,” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic.”\nResults. Results showed a paradoxical pattern: Individuals in the two most vulnerable clusters (“Avoidant-not trusting” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic”) demonstrated significantly higher acceptance of AI-based DMHIs. In contrast, the psychologically healthier “Secure-trusting-healthy” cluster showed the lowest AI-based DMHI acceptance and the highest acceptance of teletherapy. Also, having therapy experience as provider or patient was associated with lower AI acceptance in general. \nConclusion. These findings suggest that AI-based interventions may be uniquely suited to reach individuals who struggle with human-to-human therapeutic relationships, thereby serving as a critical entry point to care for those who need it most. However, those vulnerable people might also miss out on the relational learning that takes place in human-based therapies.",

          "abstract": "As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item–skill pairs in grades K–5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83–94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.",

Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]).

In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "authors": "Junsang Park; Hye Rin Kim; Sungjae Lee; Ryan D. Duffy",
          "abstract": "Access to mental health care is shaped by two interdependent dimensions: availability and affordability. Prior research has emphasized shortages of psychiatrists and provider counts, but has rarely considered affordability alongside availability or included the broader psychotherapy workforce. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing over 460,000 psychotherapists listed in the Psychology Today directory, which provides consumer-facing data on fees and insurance acceptance. We constructed county-level indices of availability (providers per 100,000 residents) and affordability (ten-session cost relative to disposable income) across 2,565 U.S. counties. Results show persistent rural–urban disparities: provider density was highest in metropolitan cores and lowest in rural and conservative counties, while financial burdens were systematically greater outside large metropolitan areas, especially in the South. Although availability and affordability frequently overlap, important divergences emerge, including counties with providers present but financially inaccessible. Regression analyses reveal that income is the strongest predictor across both indices, with political partisanship and racial/ethnic composition also shaping access. By integrating supply and cost, this study empirically reframes accessibility as multidimensional and identifies regions most affected by dual disadvantages. Findings highlight affordability as a distinct axis of accessibility and underscore the need for targeted workforce and financial interventions, including Medicaid expansion.",

          "abstract": "The users’ subjective experience of a technology’s transparency is a crucial variable in human-computer interactions, shaping trust, satisfaction, and use. Technology transparency refers to different types of information, such as what the technology currently does, how it gets its results, and why. Depending on the use context, more or less transparency can be helpful and desired from a user experience perspective, posing a design challenge and making it important to assess and contrast both users' transparency perceptions and needs. In three studies (N1 = 191, N2 = 23, N3 = 73), covering different technologies, user groups, and methodological approaches, we developed the TechTra Scales — including TechTra-N for measuring users’ transparency need and TechTra-P for users’ transparency perception. Results support the relevance of differentiating between needs and perceptions, the scales’ applicability and sensitivity to different technology interactions, and their validity. Moreover, we showed good scale properties and a high use intention of practitioners, underlining TechTra’s significance for research and industry.",

          "abstract": "Menstrual distress is common among menstruating people and can have a profound negative impact on mental health and well-being. Romantic partners can support dealing with emotional and physical stress, yet their role in dealing with menstrual distress specifically remains underexplored. Adopting a biopsychosocial perspective, this qualitative study aims to shed light on the experience of menstrual distress within romantic relationships. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 individuals (aged 19-59, living in Austria), who were in romantic relationships (n = 23 heterosexual, n = 2 homosexual, n = 5 open, n = 6 committed, n = 17 monogamous, n = 3 queer, n = 1 casual). Indeed, romantic partners play a crucial role in shaping both the impact of and coping mechanisms for menstrual distress. Due to the intimate nature of romantic relationships, partners influence experiences of menstrual distress, whether actively engaging with the topic or not. Supportive relationships fostering authenticity, communication, and teamwork enhance coping, whereas negative partner responses can perpetuate negative stereotypes, stigma, and symptom trivialisation. To enhance individuals’ and couples’ well-being, educational campaigns should raise menstrual health awareness early, and couples may benefit from guidance in managing the challenges effectively.",

          "abstract": "In a recent landmark effort, an international collaboration of cognitive scientists produced Psych-101, the largest behavioral dataset on human cognition described in natural language, comprising over 10 million human decisions across 160 psychological experiments. Building on this resource, the authors fine-tuned a pretrained large language model (LLM) to predict human choices in these experiments, called Centaur. While Centaur demonstrates impressive predictive performance—especially compared to domain-specific cognitive models—we find that much of its advantage stems from leveraging sequential dependencies in human choices. Over-reliance on such dependencies risks marginalizing the task-driven mechanisms that are also central to explaining human behavior. By reanalyzing the original Centaur model through controlled experiments that isolate task information and choice history, we find that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models even when no psychological task is provided, yet underperforms in other tasks where choice history is removed. These findings suggest that Centaur may have learned a shortcut that is insensitive to psychological tasks.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 20th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i.e., perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, despite the fact that their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the foundations of these assump-tions and examines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreasing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Additionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable. More fundamentally, when these assumptions are violated, the TRC becomes underidentified, meaning that multiple, substantively different data-generating process-es can yield the same coefficient, thus undermining its interpretability. These findings call into question the TRC’s suitability for applied settings, especially when traits fluctuate over time or measurement conditions are uncontrolled. Alternative approaches are briefly discussed",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including teletherapy and artificial intelligence (AI) powered mental health interventions, such as chatbots and AI avatar-based therapies, have become increasingly prominent, enhancing accessibility and continuity of care while reducing costs. Although these tools are technically feasible and more widely available, the real-world uptake relies on the support of clinicians. Research suggests that factors such as clinicians’ demographic information, professional experience and general attitudes towards technology, influence therapists’ acceptance of DMHIs. The study investigated clinicians’ attitudes toward these DMHIs. A total of 678 clinicians participated, completing various measures on demographics, professional background, AI usage, and acceptance of AI-based intervention formats. Results indicated that technological factors, especially positive attitudes towards AI and previous mental health chatbot experience, were the most significant predictors of clinicians’ levels of acceptance, explaining a substantial portion of the variance in the acceptance of both AI chatbot (34%) and AI virtual therapist (38%) interventions. Understanding these predictors of clinicians’ acceptance is crucial for developing effective digital therapeutic tools and encouraging clinicians to integrate emerging technologies into mental healthcare. Further training and exposure to new technologies should be provided in graduate programs.",

Whereas certain anxieties in neurodivergence (e.g., social and general anxiety) have received much attention, scant research has considered mathematics and statistics anxiety. In this study, 1,383 university students (679 neurotypical, 704 neurodivergent individuals) – matched on age, gender, education level, and country of origin – completed measures assessing various types of anxiety (including mathematics and statistics anxiety), attitudes toward mathematics, self-efficacy, and cognitive reflection. Results showed that neurodivergent students exhibited higher anxiety levels across measures, including mathematics and statistics anxiety. However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work.

          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

An online experiment with UK Premier League supporters (N = 900) tested the effects of ingroup versus outgroup identity appeals on recycling intentions. Across all conditions, reported intentions were high (&gt;88%), with no consistent advantage for ingroup appeals. To assess real behavior, we tested the same group identity-based recycling interventions in a football season-long field experiment at a Norwegian Premier Division stadium (N = 5,712), where visiting fans from 14 clubs were exposed to either an ingroup or an outgroup appeal. Results showed that ingroup appeals alone did not significantly increase recycling rates. However, when combined with a visible group-level social comparison framed as inter-club competition, recycling rates nearly tripled. Two follow-up experiments (N = 3,063) confirmed the key psychological mechanism: a motivation to contribute to the ingroup's success. These findings demonstrate that leveraging social identities can increase PEB in public settings, offering a novel theoretical link and practical strategies to encourage sustainable consumer behavior.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive skills tend to grow and change in interdependent ways across development, yet it remains unclear whether (a) early patterns of cognitive coupling depend on social-skill development and (b) whether individual differences in such coupling have predictive value for later behavioral outcomes. We addressed these questions using eight repeated assessments from the NICHD–SECCYD longitudinal study, tracking children from early childhood through adolescence. Using continuous-time structural equation models, we modelled dynamic, reciprocal interactions among cognitive (e.g., vocabulary, attention, memory, executive functioning) and social (e.g., assertion, cooperation, responsibility, self-control, peer competence) domains from age 4.5 to 15 years. Cognitive traits showed stronger overall growth and rank-order stability than social traits, whereas social-emotional skills displayed tighter internal coupling. Executive functioning emerged as a central connector across domains, showing robust cross-domain associations with multiple social skills. Children who exhibited more behavioral problems at age 15 had weaker early cross-domain trait correlations—particularly between (rather than within) cognitive and social domains—indicating lower early developmental integration. By adolescence, these children showed increased cohesion within the cognitive domain but reduced coupling with social traits, suggesting a shift toward domain-specific rather than integrated development. These findings highlight how early differences in the co-development of cognitive and social abilities may shape later behavioral adjustment, supporting a dynamic, systems-level view of developmental risk and adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Effective visual perception surmounts noise, partial information and dynamic changes in stimuli, resulting in perceptual completion that is often studied using illusory contour (IC) stimuli. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from humans yield a characteristic response – the ICeffect – the VEP difference between responses to the presence vs. absence of ICs with multiple phases at ~150-200ms and ~240-400ms post-stimulus onset. To address how motion signals and an individual’s capability to discriminate motion may contribute to perceptual completion as indexed by the ICeffect, we recorded 128-channel VEPs from 20 healthy adults. On each trial, they indicated which of two stimulus arrays was perceived to move (through linear changes in stimulus size), independently of the presence/absence of ICs. Participants were sub-divided based on a median split in task performance: those “adept” and “non-adept” at detecting moving stimuli.  Over the 240-329ms post-stimulus period, responses from “adept” individuals were characterized by distinct topographies depending on whether stimuli were moving, whereas for “non-adept” individuals the same topography characterized responses to both moving and static stimuli. Furthermore, the VEP topography characterizing responses to moving ICs positively correlated with an individual’s motion discrimination accuracy. Source modelling of this ICeffect included regions of the lateral inferior occipital cortices, parahippocampal cortices extending into the insula, the precentral cortex, and middle frontal cortex and underscores the role of both low-level and high-level cortices in IC perception.  Collectively, these data highlight the interplay between motion discrimination and perceptual completion processes.",

          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

          "abstract": "Visual foraging lies at the intersection of visual perception, decision-making and action planning. An attractive feature of this paradigm is that it generates a rich stream of sequential decision data. However, this presents a number of challenges for analysis. To this end, we have developed FoMo, a robust and flexible generative model for spatial-sequential data. Building upon initial work by Clarke et al. (2022b), we present FoMo 2.0, which incorporates spatial structure allowing us to model organised spatial behaviours. We test the model over a range of secondary data sources and show that incorporating these parameters improve model accuracy, predominantly due to improvements for a subset of participants who use grid-following strategies. FoMo therefore allows us to explain results that would previously have been categorised as outliers. A real strength of this generative modelling approach is that it can account for individual differences across the wide range of summary statistics that have previously been used to explore human and non-human animal behaviour, providing a unified framework for analysing these data.",

          "authors": "Marco Sama; Moaz Shoura; Olivia P. Lewandowska",
          "abstract": "Single-graded submissions are the norm for undergraduate level writing assignments. These do not allow for students to take feedback into consideration to refine their literacy skills, leading to modest progress during post-secondary education. Feedback may be seen as judgmental, with no way to improve their writing. Last, this style of writing does not reflect the real-world editorial process like peer-review. ESL students or those from marginalized demographics may be at a further disadvantage when graded on their writing. To address this, we developed and implemented a standardized writing assignment structure that modelled scientific peer review, dubbed the incentivized improvement method (IIM). Student submitted an initial draft that was evaluated based on the effort of submission, irrespective of errors. The rubric was open-ended and students received very little guidance on their initial submission, but were rather told to explore what they believed was appropriate to include in their work, which fostered creative and student-driven learning. Initial submissions received extensive comments from graders and students revised their work for an additional set of marks. After piloting this system in smaller courses, the IIM was implemented in two large undergraduate statistics courses (total N = 361). An anonymous survey recorded feedback from students (N = 143) across both classes. Overwhelmingly, students agreed that the IIM assisted in improving their writing, critical thinking, and developing additional literacy skills relative to single-submission assignments. Graders also noted that the quality of revised submissions exceeded expected academic performance. Notably, ESL students found the IIM quite effective in developing their English language skills. Importantly, many students’ qualitative feedback indicated that they would prefer the IIM in other STEM-related courses. In conclusion, the IIM, a standardized revision-based writing assignment, is an effective method to improve literacy skills in a diverse undergraduate student population.",

          "abstract": "The success and failure of human coordination critically depend on the ability to anticipate and adapt to both one’s own and others’ actions. While theoretical models emphasize the central role of predictive mechanisms, empirical studies often rely on simplified tasks that do not capture the sensory, motor, and social complexity of real-world joint action. Consequently, it remains unclear which among the many behavioral, cognitive, physiological, demographic, and relational factors truly contribute to coordination success.\nHere, we introduce a quantitative framework to address this gap by identifying key predictors of performance in a fast-paced ball-hitting task, performed both individually (individual-action) and in a turn-taking format with a partner (joint-action). Using high-resolution multimodal tracking of eye and body movements and heart rate, combined with machine learning and Bayesian modeling, we show that coordination success is primarily associated with the similarity in predictive styles between partners, rather than with general anticipatory ability alone. Well-coordinated pairs—defined by sustained, accurate ball exchanges—exhibited similar timing and patterns of anticipatory saccades in the individual-action task and were more synchronized in their predictions of both their own and their partner’s actions during joint performance. In contrast, demographic and relational variables (e.g., gender, height, familiarity), as well as global physiological and motor activity (e.g., overall movement, heart rate), showed minimal association with coordination outcomes.\nBy reverse-engineering the behavioral signatures of successful coordination, our study highlights alignment in action anticipation as a key mechanism and offers a data-driven foundation for improving joint performance in both human–human and human–robot interaction.",

          "abstract": "Music and language are both hierarchically structured: syllables combine into words, and meters are superimposed on musical beats. Statistical Learning (SL) is a learning mechanism that drives speech segmentation and word learning through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables. Individual differences in SL ability are predictive of further language development, and the current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; beat/meter perception in rhythmic stimuli) is a mechanism correlating with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm, yielding a 4/4 meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed standardized tasks measuring RA and were asked about their solo and joint (parent-child) engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a relationship between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This relationship was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting overlapping neural mechanisms for processing items at hierarchically similar levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appears to have a positive effect on infant RA, paving the way for further studies on this topic.",

          "abstract": "Remembering past events usually takes less time than their actual duration—events are temporally compressed in memory. A recent study found that this compression is not systematic but emerges when continuous events exceed approximately 9 s. Unexpectedly, however, remembering shorter events (3-6 s) took more time than their actual duration. Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind this increased replay duration of short events. In Experiment 1, we developed a corrected measure accounting for recall initiation time – the time needed to access the beginning of the event. With this correction, the longer replay times for short events disappeared, suggesting the effect was partly due to unmeasured recall initiation time. In Experiment 2, we examined the potential role of a central tendency bias by exposing participants to different ranges of event durations. Replay duration was influenced by the event’s relative position within the duration range, consistent with a central tendency bias. However, for events longer than 9 s, temporal compression occurred consistently across all conditions. Together, these findings suggest that while central tendency influences replay duration, temporal compression systematically emerges when events exceed a few seconds, likely reflecting memory capacity limits in representing continuous experiences.",

          "abstract": "Canada has welcomed over 100,000 Syrian refugees since 2015, many of whom have faced displacement-related challenges that shape their socio-emotional well-being. Refugee children, in particular, are at heightened risk for socio-emotional difficulties due to their developmental sensitivity to adversity, exposure to traumatic events, and resettlement stressors. Assessing children’s socio-emotional well-being often relies on both parent-reports and child self-reports; however, discrepancies between these reports commonly occur, and the factors influencing such discrepancies are not well understood, particularly in displaced populations. The present study examined predictors of parent-child discrepancies in reports of socio-emotional well-being and explored whether such discrepancies were associated with children’s learning outcomes. Participants were Syrian refugee children (N = 55, Mage = 14.42) who were resettled in Canada for an average of six years. Results revealed that children consistently self-reported more socio-emotional problems than their parents reported. Moreover, an extended period of displacement significantly predicted greater parent-child discrepancies, suggesting that resettlement-related factors and acculturation influence parent-child discrepancies. Interestingly, discrepancies were not associated with children's learning outcomes. The findings suggest that, while parent-child communication barriers may contribute to discrepancies, differences in how socio-emotional constructs are understood and reported by parents and children. These findings underscore the importance of including multiple informants in socio-emotional well-being assessments and carefully considering cultural and contextual factors when designing assessments, specifically given the complex dynamics in displaced families. Future research is important to advance the literature to determine whether assessments of socio-emotional well-being should be adapted for specific population, as suggested by the present findings.",

          "abstract": "Attention plays a critical role in reading and lies at the core of the theoretical debate between parallel and serial processing. However, direct measurements of attention have long remained elusive. Recently, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) has shown promise in directly measuring covert attention allocated to parafoveal words. RIFT involves flickering the background of the target word(s) at an imperceptible frequency (≥60Hz), but imperceptibility does not necessarily equate to the absence of a cognitive effect. The current study examined the potential impact of the RIFT paradigm on eye movements. High- and low-frequency target words were embedded in one-line sentences and displayed randomly in three condition blocks: no tagging, invisible tagging at 60Hz (i.e., RIFT) and visible tagging at 30Hz. Linear Mixed-Effect modelling and Divergence Point Analysis revealed a robust frequency effect, with high-frequency words processed faster than low-frequency words, but no significant differences across the three conditions in terms of its magnitude or onset latency. Overall fixation durations (irrespective of lexical frequency) did not differ between the no tagging and RIFT conditions, but were significantly longer in the visible tagging condition, suggesting that deliberately drawing attention to the tagging area actually slowed down reading. Furthermore, a post-experiment questionnaire indicated relatively low RIFT awareness. These findings suggest that RIFT is a valid tool for measuring attention during that does not interfere with word processing and highlight its potential for application in ecologically valid settings involving eye movements.",

Information shared by cultural products can concern topics related to the natural world and, benefitting from scientific knowledge, could contribute to the achievement of the so desired sustainable development. However, information about nature in cultural products may also have negative effects and accentuate the psychological distance from environmental issues. This article aims to review and discuss studies that highlight both the positive and negative effects of nature-related communications in the cultural entertainment products of visual mass media. The focus is on visual media because they have the potential to effectively and intuitively communicate complex concepts such as environmental issues. We essentially point out the negative psychological effects related to the representations of nature disseminated by such products, and propose a classification of these effects based on the Model of the undesirable effects of communication campaigns. Our results highlight a categorization of a wide range of negative psychological effects, of social and personal character, that can be generated by cultural products that aim to raise awareness of environmental problems. The present review provides a new dimensional perspective that can be used, on the one hand, by researchers of nature representations to frame the phenomenon and, on the other hand, by producers of visual cultural products to avoid the inclusion of involuntary messages with potentially negative effects.",

          "abstract": "Emotional eating (EE) - eating in response to emotions rather than hunger - has high clinical relevance, yet its underlying mechanisms (how?) remain poorly understood. Further questions relate to interindividual differences (who?), and the specific foods (what?) around which EE occurs. To address ‘how’, we investigate whether reaction time-based food approach biases – reflecting motivational tendencies – covary with affect in daily life. To address ‘who’ and ‘what’, we consider trait EE alongside hedonic and goal-related food characteristics. In 76 participants with dietary goals, we measured positive and negative affect and approach bias towards goal-congruent and -incongruent foods on nine midday assessments using ecological momentary assessment and a mobile approach-avoidance task; hedonic food characteristics were assessed with food-specific craving ratings in the evening. Trait EE was assessed using the Salzburg Emotional Eating Scale. There was no direct association between affect and approach bias, nor one moderated by goal-congruency. Instead, affect and approach bias covaried on days with high craving: negative affect was linked to higher approach bias, while positive affect was linked to lower approach bias, especially in participants reporting more intake during negative affect or less intake during positive affect (trait EE), respectively. Our results indicate temporally dynamic relationships between affect and approach biases (how?) that did not emerge as a function of specific food characteristics (what?) but on high craving days (when?) – particularly in trait emotional eaters (who?). Hence, eating behavior might be altered through food approach tendencies during hedonic states opening avenues for mechanistic research and context-sensitive eHealth treatments.",

This study aimed to validate its French version and use it to identify emotional profiles among young French people (18-30 years old, N=1650). Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature. This study thus provides a validated instrument assessing climate emotions in French-speaking contexts, with potential applications in interventions and research settings – including the study of climate emotion profiles.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the propagation of ideologically charged misinformation in India’s digital sphere, emphasizing the roles of prior exposure and authoritarian dispositions. A sample of 401 adult students (Mage = 20.81, SD = 2.24) reported perceived awareness, sharing intention, and sharing tendency for pro-right, pro-left, anti-right, and anti-left misinformation content on social media. Descriptive analyses revealed a selective diffusion tendency of misinformation rather than a uniform spread. Pro-right narratives were largely disregarded, whereas anti-right claims attracted the greatest engagement, consistent with negative partisanship. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that prior exposure to ideologically congruent content significantly predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond demographic controls, supporting the view that exposure fosters normalization of falsehoods. Right-wing authoritarianism predicted greater willingness to share pro-right and anti-left misinformation, while left-wing authoritarianism selectively predicted anti-right sharing, indicating asymmetrical dispositional pathways. Importantly, effect sizes from chi-square tests were modest, and many participants refrained from sharing content even when they judged it credible. These findings challenge alarmist accounts of an unchecked misinformation epidemic and dismiss assumptions that misinformation is primarily right-driven. Instead, results suggest that misinformation often functions less as mass persuasion than as a tool of strategic antagonism, warranting theoretical frameworks that extend beyond simple left–right dichotomies.",

          "abstract": "During the processing of linguistic dependencies, the presence of a non-dependent word—referred to as a distractor—can sometimes complicate the identification of the correct subject. This phenomenon, known as similarity-based interference, provides a valuable testing ground for competing theories of sentence processing and has garnered significant interest in the field of psycholinguistics. One prominent theory, cue-based retrieval, suggests that the parser initiates a search for the relevant linguistic dependent at the retrieval site (e.g., the verb) based on a set of retrieval cues. In this work, we explore the use of lexicon-specific cues set by classifiers in the retrieval of noun dependents in Mandarin Chinese to provide evidence for the cue-based retrieval mechanism. A further open question is whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (so-called retroactive interference) or whether the distractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (so-called proactive interference). Previous work has suggested that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, i.e., that the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to influence the dependency completion process. Using self-paced reading and A-Maze tasks, and Bayes Factors for hypothesis testing, we found robust evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations. We discuss the theoretical implications of the current work for theories of retrieval and sentence processing in general.",

          "abstract": "Among the cognitive impairments characteristic of schizophrenia, deficits in cognitive control are particularly prominent. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the spatial patterns and task-induced blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) changes associated with attentional control deficits in participants with schizophrenia relative to neurotypical participants. We employed a cognitive paradigm that required participants to alternated between three judgment tasks (i.e., identifying colours, parity, or letter case), while being presented with stimuli comprised of  one (univalent), two (bivalent), or three (trivalent) dimension(s). Three cognitive modes were detected: (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Language (LAN), and (3) Default mode B (DM-B). Participants with schizophrenia showed impaired task performance, muted but sustained activations of the MD mode, hypo-activations of the LAN mode, and hyper-deactivations of the DM-B mode relative to neurotypical participants. Thus, attentional control impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are likely due to disrupted activity of the MD, LAN, and DM-B modes. Additionally, in participants with schizophrenia, the sustained activation of the MD mode in the Trivalent condition was associated with higher scores on positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), while the reduced activation of the LAN mode in the Trivalent condition and the pronounced deactivation of the DM-B mode in the Univalent condition were associated with higher scores on negative symptoms (i.e., poverty of speech and flattened affect). Our findings highlight the contributions of fMRI to individualized medicine due to symptom-specific effects, and identifying potential targets for neuromodulation techniques that aim to restore BOLD activity and improve cognitive function in schizophrenia.",

          "abstract": "Participants in creativity studies sometimes produce invalid data that is unusable for analysis, such as nonsensical or incomplete responses to idea generation tasks. Identifying such responses is a time-consuming yet necessary process to ensure robust results but also remains challenging to automate. We explore the efficacy of transformer language models (TLMs) for automatically detecting invalid creativity responses, using only the text prompt and response and no other metadata about the experimental session. We train a suite of transformers to detect invalid data for two creativity assessments: the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and a design problems task (DPT). We find that transformers generally outperform other baselines for both tasks. Further, we show that TLMs’ predictions are well calibrated to the quality of the participant response, ensuring that model failures will occur in a predictable way and that high-quality responses are unlikely to be labeled invalid. Finally, we conduct a fairness analysis based on language background—using an adversarial study where participants attempt to “break” the model by coming up with invalid responses that are nonetheless labeled valid. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods for cleaning creativity assessment data, using solely participant responses, in a reliable and unbiased way.",

          "abstract": "Enthusiasm for personalized psychological interventions far outstrips our understanding of how to best tailor these interventions to individuals. The first step in bridging this gap is to identify individual characteristics that predict intervention outcomes. Across three studies (N = 444; between 2023 and 2024), we address this issue by examining the role of prior beliefs in reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy common to many types of psychological interventions. In Studies 1 and 2, we instructed participants to reappraise negative stimuli in a way that was consistent with different beliefs. We found that more belief-congruent (versus less belief-congruent) reappraisals were more believable and more effective for regulating emotions. In Study 3, we asked participants to rank sets of standardized reappraisals. We found substantial heterogeneity in which reappraisals were preferred, and this heterogeneity was partially explained by people’s prior beliefs. This work suggests that, in the context of US-based participants, beliefs may be leveraged to systematically personalize reappraisal interventions.",

          "abstract": "The intensity of mental states varies over time. Within a given instance of a cognitive or emotional state, the strength of that state’s hold on the mind ebbs and flows. Although different instances of the same state will exhibit different temporal dynamics, certain states are associated with certain dynamics. For example, surprise tends to arise sharply, whereas tiredness generally accumulates gradually over time. This paper investigates the structure and correlates of people’s beliefs about these mental state dynamics. We measure these beliefs using a freeform drawing task in an online sample (Sample 1; N = 457), and preregistered replication sample (Sample 2; N = 1435). We observe that people attribute consistent, differentiable intensity dynamics to a wide range of mental states. These beliefs are optimally characterized by a replicable 3-dimensional structure. We go on to examine the correlates of these beliefs about intra-state dynamics (Study 2). We find that they are associated with variability in mental state similarity judgements, transition probability ratings, and natural language use. Together these findings show that people hold robust, structured beliefs about mental state dynamics, and that these beliefs are reflected in other facets of mental state understanding.",

The present study determines whether dog personality and behavioral traits can be used to predict herding performance. We began by replicating Wilson and colleagues (2022), who found that personality traits predict herding ability in Australian kelpies. We asked American owners of herding dogs to complete an online survey about their dog’s (n = 335) personality traits, behavioral traits, and herding ability. We grouped related personality traits together in a principal components analysis to create dog personality profiles. Next, we determined whether any dog personality profiles predicted herding ability. We partially replicate Wilson et al.’s (2022) findings, with similar personality profiles predicting herding ability. We then expanded on the previous study by creating a new set of profiles that also included behavioral traits. We found that both personality and behavioral traits predicted herding ability. We propose that herding dog handlers and breeders should focus on key personality and behavioral traits when making decisions about herding dog career paths and training efforts.",

While memory training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) each show potential to support neurocognitive function in older adults, their combined effect on cognitive outcomes remains an active line of research and effects on whole-brain network modularity remain unclear. Additionally, recent studies suggest that tDCS may accelerate the cognitive benefits of memory training. We tested whether five days of training working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), paired with anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, would enhance these memory domains and increase resting-state functional network modularity. 62 healthy older adults were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation during adaptive WM and LTM training, with resting-state fMRI collected at baseline, post-test, and follow-up 2-4 months after training. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in WM or LTM over time, and stimulation condition did not reliably modulate performance. Similarly, resting-state modularity did not change significantly across the training period, nor were there differences between stimulation groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that task-based modularity increased from post-test to follow-up in the active group, though this effect was not accompanied by behavioral gains. Further exploratory analyses revealed that across all outcomes, baseline measurements (irrespective of condition) emerged as strong moderators of change over the training period, emphasizing the importance of interindividual variability. By integrating memory training with tDCS and longitudinal fMRI, this study adds to the growing literature on stimulation-augmented cognitive training protocols and underscore the need for research on interindividual differences.",

          "abstract": "Researchers often want to measure a variety of constructs such as anxiety, discrimination, or loneliness in text data from surveys, interviews, social media, and electronic health records. Using large language models (LLMs) --while optimal for text classification-- remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around computational expertise, cost, privacy, and compute requirements. Therefore, some researchers prefer to use lightweight models for large datasets or interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios such as suicide risk detection. Lexicons offer simple baselines to LLMs by searching for relevant phrases --and can be used together with LLMs to guarantee capturing specific keywords in a deterministic way. However, building new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. This approach quickly measures most constructs relevant for this application, resulting in high content validity. This lexicon was able to accurately predict risk in crisis counseling conversations. After validating the lexicon with clinical experts, the lexicon outperformed the LIWC lexicon --which has low content validity for mental illness-- and performed similarly to some black-box deep learning models. Due to using an interpretable approach with high content validity, we discovered that active suicidal ideation and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation and depressed mood in this ecological setting. To simplify creating new lexicons for other research domains, we introduce a Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of LLMs. In sum, while we recommend using LLMs for text classification, they remain out of reach for many researchers. Our work demonstrates that LLMs --despite being black-boxes that might be challenging to use-- can counterintuitively create interpretable models by generating lexicons, when this is preferred. Furthermore, we highlight the broader application of lexicons beyond measurement, including their use in benchmarking LLM performance.",

          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

Here we propose that metacognitive awareness—an individual’s ability to understand and reflect on their own cognitive processes as well as those of their peers—plays a critical role in facilitating effective group work. This ability includes recognizing not only one’s own strengths and weaknesses but also understanding the knowledge states, skills, and needs of fellow group members. Metacognitively aware team members can leverage each other’s expertise, adjust their communication styles appropriately, and collaborate more efficiently. However, interaction can also have deleterious consequences, such as when one member chooses to dominate, when social conditions make group members reluctant to contribute or to evaluate others’ contributions frankly, or when the coordination among group members is sufficiently burdensome that it interferes with individual performance. Here we propose that effective group work results from harnessing the knowledge that is held in many minds by creating conditions for optimal sorting and evaluation of group suggestions through the effective exchange of metacognitive information. We examine the existing literature on group cognition across a number of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, organization, and management, and identify a number of key metacognitive strategies that exemplify this strategy and enhance group performance.",

Then, they may seek these contexts out more or less often respectively. However, the extent to which participants gain insight from this type of personalized feedback has not yet been quantified. In this study, we tested whether participants indeed gained insight from personalized feedback about their average positive affect in different contexts. We did this using a pre-post design, in which we compared estimates that participants made of their average positive affect in different contexts before and after receiving their personalized feedback to their respective personalized feedback (N = 133). For a subsample of participants (n = 77), we mistakenly provided feedback that was consistently higher than the actual average of their EMA data. We found that participants generally changed their estimates in the direction of both the ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ personalized feedback.

Emotion regulation difficulties showed both stability and meaningful fluctuations, increasing after stressors, co-occurring with negative affect, and predicting impaired affective recovery.

Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",

          "abstract": "The idea that better cognitive functioning helps to close the gap between goals and behaviour seems self-evident, yet empirical work has found surprisingly weak inter-individual associations between cognitive task performance and real-world, goal-relevant outcomes. Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level assessments of cognition. Leveraging a micro-task design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students (N=184, timepoints=9,248), we show that within person upswings in domain-general information processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal achievement across domains, even after controlling for other factors. A one standard deviation change in this cognitive capacity translated to the behavioral equivalent of ~40 minutes of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness. Our work addresses long standing controversies and highlights the power of intra individual analysis to reveal relationships missed by cross sectional approaches.",

This article examines how AI tools can strengthen MTSS, specifically, improvement to inclusive practices, data analysis, intervention implementation, progress monitoring, personalized learning, student engagement, and teacher efficiency. The article also examines potential risks related to using AI tools within MTSS such as ethical considerations, date security, data quality, bias potential, financial limitations, and professional development needs.

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions. Together, our results clarify that while confidence-driven information seeking adaptively increases decision accuracy for true news items, it is entirely ineffective in the context of fake news.",

Here, participants were presented with hypothetical AI products paired with different labels (graphical vs. text-based) conveying low to high DSDP levels. Expectedly, trust increased and anxiety decreased when an AI product reached a higher DSDP level. That is, labels effectively communicated DSDP differences. Text-based labels were associated with increased trust and decreased anxiety compared to graphical labels. Interestingly, when not provided with DSDP information via a label, participants attributed an intermediate level of (dis-)trust to AI products.

          "abstract": "Across cultures, humans reason about others’ mental states as being either phenomenal, reflecting shareable experiences, or intentional, reflecting agentive goals. Might our dissociated judgments of others’ mental states be linked to dissociated judgments of others’ gaze direction, one of our earliest social cues from infancy? We presented adults (N = 600) and 6- to 8-year-old children (N = 200) with direct, definitional descriptions as well as descriptions of example phenomenal or intentional mental states and asked them to choose whether a face with averted or straight-ahead gaze better matched the character in each description. Adults and older children chose the averted-gaze face for the direct phenomenality description but the straight-ahead-gaze face for the direct intentionality description. Adults showed the same pattern of responses for the indirect descriptions, but children chose the straight-ahead-gaze face for both types of indirect descriptions. A link between straight-ahead gaze and phenomenality present from human infancy may thus impact children’s judgments of others’ gaze direction. But by adulthood, language may come to evoke particular contexts in which a character’s inner experience may be more strongly linked to averted gaze. If, in adulthood, our social concepts have indeed been built on such prelinguistic intuitions and language, then these intuitions may continue to affect our mature, linguistically driven social reasoning.",

This study explored reported outcomes of use of Brain in Hand (BiH), an individualised digital support tool for neurodivergent people, using a mixed-methods design. Materials and Method: Eighteen employed neurodivergent adults (autistic and/or with ADHD) completed measures of anxiety and workplace productivity at baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews were conducted at both timepoints. Data were integrated with participant-defined goals and interpreted BiH engagement levels. Results: Many participants reported improvements in psychological wellbeing, daily structure and independence, and work outcomes. These changes aligned with reduced anxiety and increased self-rated productivity, particularly for those who engaged fully and whose pre-study goals were mostly met. Support-seeking confidence also emerged as a benefit for some participants. However, barriers to engagement limited positive outcomes for others. Conclusions: Findings suggest that BiH may effectively support many neurodivergent employees, but benefits depend on sustained engagement and enabling workplace environments. Person-centred integration of qualitative and quantitative data enhanced interpretive depth, helping to capture the varied workplace experiences of neurodivergent people engaging with digital interventions.",

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) targets transdiagnostic mechanisms such as cognitive fusion and low self-compassion, which may be particularly relevant for AjD.\nObjective: This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of a brief, guided, asynchronous internet-delivered MBCT (iMBCT) for AjD during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with internet-delivered progressive muscle relaxation (iPMR) and a waitlist control (WLC).\nMethods: Adults meeting ICD-11 criteria for AjD (N = 301) were randomized to iMBCT, iPMR, or WLC for four weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in AjD symptoms (ADNM-20) and remission rates. Secondary outcomes were changes in depression, anxiety, cognitive fusion, experiential avoidance, and self-compassion. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up. Mediation analyses tested cognitive defusion and self-compassion as mechanisms. \nResults: iMBCT produced greater reductions in AjD symptoms than WLC (η² = .17) and higher remission rates. Compared with iPMR, iMBCT yielded larger decreases in depression and anxiety. Cognitive defusion fully mediated iMBCT effects on depression and anxiety.

It is not the case that everyone else before was wrong about decline but this time we are finally right. We highlight how intuitions of the generational decline are due to researchers being odd. Judgments are further distorted by misperceptions of the present, idealized memories of the past, presentism, all producing comparisons between reality and fiction. Historical examples and contemporary data illustrate how technologies and practices unfamiliar to older cohorts are over-indexed as the villain and often misassigned. We argue that credible claims about secular changes require (a) broad time horizons that avoid arbitrary cutoffs; (b) preregistration to curb confirmation bias; and (c) strict tests of measurement invariance, broadly construed to include shifting diagnostics, reference groups, reporting norms. Re-analyses that honor invariance overturn canonical narratives (e.g., “reverse Flynn effects,” a “narcissism epidemic”). While people and societies do change, many trends are cyclical rather than monotonic. We conclude with a practical framework: before inferring decline, ask whether the change is measured, whether the past benchmark is accurate, whether the metric is comparable across time.",

          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird’s (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and control participants completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction time and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), as a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones was demonstrated in typical imagers. In aphantasics, this effect was less marked, but the difference between the groups is not substantial enough to be conclusively established. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia revealed a more significant slowdown within the latter group, suggesting that visual imagery, even in its weakest form, influences performance on such tasks. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses showed that participants in the visualiser cluster are the most impaired in this task. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

In Experiment 2, we applied bilateral continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) over the DLPFC and a control site to assess whether the DLPFC is critical for this attentional modulation.\nMethods: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design was used with two simultaneous adaptive staircases for valid and invalid trials to control task difficulty, while reaction times, signal detection theory metrics and metacognitive efficiency were measured. In Experiment 2, the same task was performed in two sessions spaced by a week following cTBS over the DLPFC or control cortices, adding non-parametric metacognitive and cognitive control measures.\nResults: In Experiment 1, objective performance was successfully stabilized while leaving subjective responses unconstrained. Reaction times, response bias, and metacognitive efficiency were all impaired following invalid cues. In Experiment 2, the same pattern was observed after S1-cTBS, but critically, DLPFC-cTBS erased these attentional effects, indicating that DLPFC disruption selectively impairs the modulation of metacognitive monitoring. Trial-history analyses further corroborated that the DLPFC supports conflict-adaptation across trials.\nConclusion(s): These findings suggest that the DLPFC does not generate perceptual contents directly but is essential for the top-down processes that shape metacognitive monitoring. Disrupting DLPFC function reduces attentional benefits and conflict-adaptation in metacognition, highlighting its critical role in linking expectations to self-evaluative awareness.",

          "abstract": "Empathy is a core feature of the human social experience, underpinned by the sharing of and understanding of others’ states. However, we know relatively little about its early development. Here, we used the emerging technique of infrared thermography, combined with behavioural observations, to investigate how young children (1-3 years old) respond to others’ distress. We measured the emotional reactions – including changes in facial skin temperature and behavioural responses – of N=30 typically developing children from British nurseries while they watched short video-vignettes of familiar and unfamiliar caregivers displaying emotional distress or neutral expressions. We hypothesised that children’s facial temperature change and behavioural responses (including facial expressions and self-directed behaviours) would be stronger to distress than to neutral stimuli. Based on the social bias of empathy, we hypothesised that responses would be stronger towards familiar individuals as compared to unfamiliar. Results confirmed that children’s thermal response at the nose bridge was stronger when observing someone in distress compared to the neutral control. Although model familiarity had only a weak effect, there was an effect of age, with younger infants showing stronger thermal responses to distress stimuli compared to older children. We found no effect on behavioural responses. We discuss implications of these results, including whether thermal-imagery may be a more sensitive measure of affective responding than behavioural measures, and the importance of using multiple methods. By combining physiological and behavioural measures, this study contributes to theoretical and methodological advances into understanding how internal affective processes map onto external measures in early childhood, shedding light on the development of empathy.",

Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making, it is well-known that low confidence in a decision promotes information seeking, which increases subsequent decision accuracy. It is unclear, however, whether these mechanisms generalize to more complex domains such as fake news detection. Here, we tested whether confidence also drives information seeking in the context of fake news, whether seeking information improves fake news detection and sharing intentions, and whether we find confidence-driven confirmation biases. In an online study, 314 US citizens indicated whether news headlines were true or fake and could request additional information before finalizing their decision. First, in line with findings from perceptual decision-making, confidence was the main driver of information seeking for both fake and true news. Yet critically, whereas confidence lawfully scaled with decision accuracy for true news items, we found a U-shaped relationship for fake news items: decision accuracy was lowest for intermediate confidence, indicating that for fake headlines confidence is not a reliable signal of headline veracity. Second, while information seeking increased decision accuracy for true news items, for fake news items decision accuracy remained at chance level even after information seeking. Sharing intentions for fake news remained equally unaffected by information seeking, and mostly increased for belief-congruent true items. Finally, we found a confidence-driven confirmation bias for beliefs, but not for sharing intentions. Together, our results clarify that while confidence-driven information seeking adaptively increases decision accuracy for true news items, it is entirely ineffective in the context of fake news.",

          "abstract": "Students with poor quality relationships (e.g., those lacking parent/carer support, peer support, and/or who are bullied by their peers) typically report lower wellbeing than their peers. Support from school staff may play a compensatory role for these vulnerable learners, but current evidence is meagre. Using data from N=25,977 adolescents (aged 12-15; 50.1% girls) from the #BeeWell study in Greater Manchester, England, we fitted a series of linear regression models to estimate the association between school staff support and psychological wellbeing; optimism; self-esteem; and, life satisfaction. These models were subsequently extended to explore potential moderation effects (i.e., whether the association between school staff support and wellbeing varies based on students’ level of parent/carer support, peer support, and/or exposure to bullying). Analyses revealed that higher levels of school staff support are significantly associated with higher levels of all four student wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed a complex picture, with the nature and magnitude of effects varying by relationship and wellbeing outcome.  For example, for self-esteem and life satisfaction, the association with school staff support is stronger for students reporting low (vs high) parent/carer support or who are exposed (vs unexposed) to bullying. In contrast, for psychological wellbeing and optimism, it is smaller for students reporting low (vs high) social support from peers. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of having supportive school staff for promoting student wellbeing. They also suggest that increasing school staff support is a potentially useful mechanism for bolstering the wellbeing of vulnerable students (e.g., those who are bullied).",

However, reproducible research is often considered more in the domain of professional research rather than an essential part of the curriculum. Commonly cited barriers are a lack of time within already busy curricula and a failure to recognise the benefits to all students as future consumers of research. In this chapter, we demonstrate how you can teach reproducible research skills at all levels of Higher Education. We will outline how we built and assessed a curriculum incorporating reproducible research skills for different programmes, and the opportunities and challenges that each target audience provides. In short, we aim to convince educators that all students can develop reproducible research skills given the right support and resources.",

          "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO), a pervasive psychological phenomenon characterized by the distressing perception that others are engaging in rewarding experiences from which one is absent, is increasingly relevant in the workplace. This study investigates both general and workplace FoMO across three culturally distinct countries: Poland, China, and the United States, focusing on their relationships with job satisfaction and alternative job search. Online survey data (N = 626) revealed unexpected cross-country differences: Poland reported the highest general FoMO, while China reported the highest workplace FoMO. Moreover, general FoMO negatively predicted job satisfaction, particularly among individuals who viewed their jobs as personally undesirable. Contrary to expectations, workplace FoMO positively predicted job satisfaction, especially for those in roles perceived as less desirable, suggesting that FoMO may function as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, workplace FoMO positively predicted alternative job search, while general FoMO did not. A mediation analysis showed that job satisfaction indirectly buffered the link between workplace FoMO and job search behavior. These findings underscore the complex, context-dependent nature of FoMO in professional settings and offer practical implications for managing digital engagement and employee retention in increasingly connected workplaces.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin, an evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide, plays a crucial role in various physiological and behavioural processes, offering potential therapeutic benefits for several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Despite its promise, oxytocin research has been marked by inconsistent results concerning its therapeutic applications and underlying mechanisms. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis is a popular approach to shed light on mixed findings in a body of literature; however, they can become quickly outdated as new evidence becomes available. Given these challenges, research on oxytocin and its biobehavioural outcomes is ideally positioned for the adoption of ‘living’ meta-analyses, which allow for the continuous integration of new data and updated conclusions. Here we introduce the Active Monitoring of Oxytocin Research Evidence (AMORE) platform (https://amore-project.org), which is a hub that aggregates articles and materials associated with living meta-analyses for biobehavioural oxytocin research. Developed through consensus among 24 expert researchers, a standardized framework was established that either requires or recommends practices ensuring transparency and rigor in living meta-analyses featured on the AMORE platform. Overall, AMORE has been designed to advance oxytocin biobehavioural research by the timely integration of emerging evidence through transparent living meta-analyses",

          "abstract": "The issue of “imposter” participants within qualitative research has become increasingly prevalent. The problem raises specific concerns for qualitive research around research inclusivity and diversity, alongside the challenge to data integrity and methodological rigour. Existing literature is dominated by case studies and commentaries with a need for multi-disciplinary guidelines that reflect the specific challenges and context of qualitative research. This study adopted a two-stage expert and evidence-based approach to develop guidance for researchers and organisations. Stage 1 was a mixed-method study with 184 qualitative researchers to establish the reach and impact of the problem, perspectives on the associated issues and potential solutions across disciplines, career stage and locality. Stage 2 involved a series of researcher and public workshops to develop and refine guidelines through an iterative analytical process. The resulting guidance for researchers and organisations is a flexible, supportive tool to enable a systematic and evidence-informed approach within their research practice. The guidance provides a framework for considering ethical, epistemological, methodological and practical considerations when determining how to mitigate the risk of imposter participants within qualitative research. It is hoped that the guidelines will inform wider understanding of the issue and encourage the adoption of evidence-based policies and processes.",

          "abstract": "The Arabic number system links number length with magnitude: longer numbers represent larger values. In numerical comparisons, interference arises when physical and numerical dimensions are misaligned, and processing improves with greater numerical distance. While ERP studies have dissociated numerical processing effects, evidence for early encoding of numerical information remains inconclusive due to confounding visual properties. In two ERP experiments, we examined whether number length influences early multi-digit number processing, independent of visual size, by using scribbled line patterns to control physical length. Experiment 1 (N=27) compared digit values in tie numbers to standard “555”, ignoring number length. Experiment 2 (N=27) judged number length, ignoring digit identity. Targets varied in number length and numerical distance, creating congruent and incongruent conditions. ERP results revealed enhanced parieto-occipital N1 negativity (~120–150 ms) for longer numbers, indicating early number length encoding regardless of visual confounds. Central P2p (~150–190 ms) reflected refined numerical distance processing. Centro-parietal P3 (~300–360 ms) showed congruity effects only when numerical magnitude was task-relevant. These findings reveal three distinct processing stages: early encoding (N1), refined magnitude comparison (P2p), and conflict resolution (P3). This novel neurophysiological evidence showcases the unique influence of number length and numerical syntax on magnitude evaluation.",

Psychometric analysis revealed good sensitivity, acceptable reliability and satisfactory indicators for several validity aspects (structural, convergent, divergent, nomological) – although powerlessness and hope showed consistently weaker indices. The Latent Profile Analysis conducted to identify emotional patterns revealed four distinct profiles, including three \"atypical\" ones (hostile, angry and affected) significantly associated with gender, political orientation or connectedness to nature. This study thus provides a validated instrument assessing climate emotions in French-speaking contexts, with potential applications in interventions and research settings – including the study of climate emotion profiles.",

Both discounting transgender men’s and women’s membership in the categories “male” and “female” and discounting the validity of nonbinary gender identities are forms of bias, and studying them will be essential to build a more nuanced understanding of stereotyping and prejudice. The authors review the literature on bias against transgender people and bias against nonbinary people, discuss the methodological and theoretical challenges in studying these biases, propose an approach for interpreting results in light of common (mis)categorization processes, and consider avenues for future research.",

Additionally, emphasizing “co-benefits” of sustainable futures, such as stronger communities and increased well-being, enhances support for climate solutions. Other key features determining the effectiveness of interventions are a sense of collective efficacy and hope in creating the imagined future, and a sense of identification with a movement striving towards positive change.

In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human–machine\ninteraction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we\nrigorously measure these biases?\nWe address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test &amp; Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling,\npre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks.

Prior research has frequently investigated the neural correlates of FA and OM states utilizing electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, focusing on changes in spectral power within theta and alpha bands. Yet the functional significance of these neural changes has remained unclear. Here we utilized a fully-within subject state induction protocol to more directly test whether EEG spectral power during FA and OM is differentially associated with subjective ratings of state mindfulness.  \nMethods: While continuous EEG was recorded, participants engaged in audio-guided FA and OM practices, as well as an active control condition (C), and then self-reported their state mindfulness afterwards. Linear mixed effects models were used to rigorously assess how condition-level variation in spectral power predicted state mindfulness scores across the three inductions. \nResults: Validating the approach, participants reported higher state mindfulness and decreased theta power during both FA and OM relative to C; additionally, reduced alpha power was found in OM relative to FA. Most importantly, increased theta power was associated with higher state mindfulness in FA and even more strongly in OM, whereas reduced alpha power was linked to higher state mindfulness selectively in OM. \nConclusions:  These findings add to the growing literature suggesting that FA and OM represent distinct mindfulness states. We further establish that the functional significance of theta and alpha power is context-dependent, clearly linking these neural measures to the subjective quality of specific meditation states and practices.",

In this work, we explore how recognition of items is impacted when temporal context change is operationalized implicitly through the order of presentation during the study phase. 57 participants, were exposed to a rotation judgment cover task for 15 randomly generated polygon items. Around half of the participants were presented with these items in a random order.

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift between mental sets in response to changing goals or environments, and it is known to decline across the adult lifespan. Competing accounts attribute this decline either to weaknesses in specific abilities such as inhibition or memory, or to more global challenges in managing the interaction between them. Efforts to disentangle contributing processes through targeted, single-function tasks have produced mixed findings, potentially due to confounding variability in stimuli and task demands.\nThe current work contributes to the field's understanding of cognitive flexibility decline by focusing on \\emph{inhibition} as both a subcomponent and as an independent process, given its central role in both specific-deficit and integrative theoretical accounts. In particular, we designed a unified task that engages both 1) cognitive flexibility through shifting requirements to encode task-relevant mental sets and inhibit them once they become outdated; and 2) discrete item-level inhibition of perceptual distractors. We tested 86 adults aged 18–73. Accuracy analyses revealed asymmetric interaction effects between aging and these two operations: while learning after a rule-switch worsened as age increased, inhibition of perceptual distractors inhibition improved. We then applied a computational model to quantify how memory precision and the inhibition of previously-relevant sets each contributed to performance.

          "abstract": "The present study investigated predictors of individual differences in linguistic knowledge and spontaneous language use in adults. Specifically, we examined the role of domain-general cognitive abilities—working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and processing speed—alongside implicit motivational factors, including achievement, power, and affiliation motives and activity inhibition. Linguistic knowledge was assessed through multiple tests covering receptive and productive vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and comprehension of fixed expressions, whereas language use was examined through participants’ written narratives in the Picture Story Exercise (PSE), analyzed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework. Network and path analyses revealed that auditory working memory positively predicted linguistic knowledge and analytic language use, highlighting its role in the sequential organization and consolidation of verbal material. Visual working memory was unrelated to knowledge but predicted more authentic language use, suggesting a link to imagery-based and self-referential expression. Nonverbal reasoning supported knowledge but was negatively related to authenticity, indicating a trade-off between systematic abstraction and spontaneity. Processing speed, while crucial in early language development, did not predict knowledge in adults and was negatively associated with narrative word count, suggesting that efficiency may reduce elaboration in spontaneous production. Contrary to our predictions, implicit motives and activity inhibition were unrelated to both linguistic knowledge and language use. Together, these findings underscore how distinct domain-general abilities shape static linguistic knowledge and dynamic language use, highlighting the need for integrative models of adult language skills.",

          "abstract": "The development of clinical and research competencies is central to readying the next generation of psychologists for professional practice. To meet emerging professional demands, training programmes must also now consider skill development beyond traditional research and clinical practice to equip graduates with contemporary competencies, including skills such as science communication. In this chapter, we discuss an Irish perspective on approaching this challenge, drawing on innovative methods we use to optimise competency development in undergraduate and postgraduate psychology education related to clinical topics. We explore how capacity-building in evidence synthesis methods and science communication can prepare students to facilitate the responsible and informed use of research evidence by others. Alongside this, we examine the clinical competency framework through examples and critically appraise considerations for training future psychologists. The discussion will highlight recommendations for training psychological scientists for the evolving professional landscape.",

          "authors": "Matthew Blanchard; Eugene Aidman; Lazar Stankov; Sabina Kleitman",
          "abstract": "When individuals collaborate, they often rely on momentary estimates of their own and their partner’s confidence (decision confidence) to guide collective decisions and achieve their goals. Through interaction, these confidence estimates tend to align over time. This  process is known as confidence matching. More stable, dispositional trait confidence is also emerging as a key factor shaping the dynamics and outcomes of collaborative action. We examined how trait confidence and type of communication impact the accuracy of dyadic decisions, decision confidence, and the dynamics of decision confidence, including confidence matching. \n\nIn this study, 210 participants completed general knowledge tests individually and collaboratively, forming 105 dyads. The tests were completed under three communication conditions: isolated (no interaction), passive (viewing the partner’s response and numeric confidence rating), and active (verbal discussion). Participants assessed as high-trait or low-trait confidence (controlling for cognitive ability) were allocated to three types of dyads: low-trait (two low-trait members), mixed-trait (one low-trait and one high member), or high-trait (two high-trait members) confidence dyads.\nTrait confidence moderated decision accuracy and decision confidence gains: dyads with mixed-trait or high-trait confidence showed greater decision accuracy improvements in the active than the passive communication condition compared to their individual decisions. Whereas low-trait confidence dyads benefited equally from active and passive communication. Collaboration increased decision confidence overall, especially for high-trait confidence dyads under active communication. Confidence matching occurred rapidly in both passive and active communication but predicted decision accuracy gains only in the passive condition where participants had limited social information. \n\nAlthough active verbal communication led to the greatest overall decision accuracy, these gains were not driven by confidence matching. Our findings highlight the critical role of trait confidence in shaping collaborative outcomes in dyads and extend previous research by showing that confidence matching occurs naturally during verbal communication.",

          "authors": "Matthew Blanchard; Eugene Aidman; Lazar Stankov; Sabina Kleitman",
          "abstract": "A collective intelligence factor (CI) was introduced by prior research to characterize the cognitive ability of groups. Surprisingly, individual intelligence did not predict CI. Instead, it correlated with individual social sensitivity, the equality of conversational turn-taking and the proportion of females in a group. However, these findings may depend on the type of tasks completed by groups. Our study re-examined these relationships by (1) testing the robustness of the CI factor in dyads using well-structured tasks guided by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence; (2) exploring the relationship between dyadic CI and metacognitive confidence, which is known to influence group processes and outcomes; and (3) identifying the psychological characteristics of distinct dyad types using Latent Profile Analysis.\nWe measured CI in 105 undergraduate dyads using three group tasks aligned with the broad abilities of the CHC model. Individual intelligence was assessed using Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. We also measured social sensitivity, proportion of females, equality of turn taking, working memory, and personality.\nResults indicated that individual intelligence and confidence were the strongest predictors of dyadic CI for well-structured tasks, contrasting with previous findings emphasizing social factors. While we replicated the relationship with social sensitivity, we did not replicate the findings for equality of turn taking or gender composition. Latent Profile Analysis identified three psychological profiles: dyads performing consistently high individually and collectively, those performing consistently low, and those performing better collectively than individually. Our ‘smarter’ dyads consisted of intelligent and confident individuals with higher social sensitivity.\nThese findings suggest that, in dyads performing well-structured tasks, individual cognitive abilities and confidence play significant roles in CI. This challenges the emphasis on social factors and underscores the importance of task selection.",

          "authors": "Simar Moussaoui; Adam Frost; Matthias Niemeier",
          "abstract": "Recent research emphasizes how working memory (WM) supports action in dynamic environments. But action almost always involves fast, “saccadic” eye movements that challenge WM representations, requiring spatial remapping and distorting spatial perception, especially along the saccade direction. To capture the impact of these distortions, we used a spatial WM task where participants, after a saccade or fixation, indicated remembered locations of memory items with a mouse. From the responses we extracted multiple measures of spatial error: response variability, shifts relative to the fixation point, rotations, compression and nonlinear distortions of space. These measures submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA) yielded two components: systematic and unsystematic spatial error both of which were correlated with established WM tasks, showing their relevance for WM fidelity. Systematic error revealed a centripetal bias, pulling towards spatial anchors like the fixation point and the memory array’s centre of mass. This suggests that systematic error reflects a spatial scaffold that encodes relational information but is inherently imprecise. Saccades increased both error components and amplified WM load effects. Notably, we found that distortions of systematic error were especially pronounced along saccade direction for items that were remapped across visual fields, implying that WM fidelity is more vulnerable when information needs to pass through the corpus callosum. Together, our findings are consistent with the idea of WM actively reconstructing spatial information. They offer new insights into how saccades and spatial remapping shape WM in a dynamic world.",

          "abstract": "Fairness is typically assumed to be in the moral domain, yet recent work shows that young children may not view unfairness as a moral transgression. We investigated whether this may be because the harm caused by unfairness is less salient than the harm caused by more prototypical moral transgressions. We found that both 4-year-olds and adults rated unfairness more seriously when the harm caused by the unfairness was emphasized rather than not emphasized. When asked to categorize unfairness as either moral or conventional, 4-year-olds did not systematically choose either category. Most adults, on the other hand, categorized unfairness with conventional transgressions. These findings suggest that perceptions of unfairness exist along a continuum and are influenced by the salience of the harm caused by unfairness. Highlighting the harm inflicted by unfairness may be an important way to move people, from an early age, to notice and correct it.",

          "abstract": "To address the reference issue, a refined conceptual framework, a parallax view, clarifies how multi-scale electric potentials, electric fields, current sources, and reference strategies interrelate. Electric potentials, introduced historically to simplify mathematics, are physically meaningful only when expressed as differences. The so-called zero potential at infinity is clarified physically by focusing on the electric field, an unambiguously real physical entity.\nMeasures of functional connectivity like coherence are affected by reference, volume conduction, and the spatial scale of description. Nonetheless, the common average reference (CAVE or CAR) yields robust information, even though coherence between specific electrode pairs is uncertain. CAVE’s strength lies in treating all electrode sites equally, without prior assumptions about brain sources or volume conductor models. \nCAVE may benefit more from increased electrode density and reduced inter-electrode spacing than from extending electrode array coverage to lower head locations. With average center-to-center spacing below about 2.5 cm, CAVE accurately represents recorded potential relative to the average potential over the underlying scalp—without implying that this average is zero. Electric field measurements can usefully supplement CAVE measurements, the proposed parallax view. \nHigh-density recordings enable accurate estimation of scalp tangential electric fields, an extension of simple bipolar recording to the entire array. Such measure provides estimates of electric field magnitudes and directions, expressed as contour maps and streaming vector maps, respectively. Field magnitude maps sometimes resemble Laplacian maps depending on sources; streaming vector maps provide directions and strengths of scalp currents.  Because electric fields are inherently reference-free, only volume conduction remains as a barrier distorting coherence and other measures of dynamic source behavior.",

          "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While a growing body of literature has sought to understand factors connected to LGBQ+ acceptance and support by religious individuals, these factors remain understudied in religious leaders. Extant findings on LGBQ+ support among non-religious and even religious individuals may not directly apply to religious leaders, given leaders’ unique roles as religious and spiritual authorities. METHOD: Using a nationally representative sample of religious leaders from the 2020 National Survey of Religious Leaders (N = 1,600), we tested preregistered hypotheses to examine overall levels of LGBQ+ support and psychosocial, religious, and spiritual correlates, as well as potential congregational moderators. RESULTS: Results reveal overall low LGBQ+ support among U.S. religious leaders, with psychosocial factors (e.g., identifying as White, woman, higher education, income) and religious/spiritual struggles associated with greater support, while greater religious fundamentalism and prayer are associated with lower support. Religious fundamentalism emerged as the strongest predictor of lower LGBQ+ support across all analyses. Although congregation size did not moderate this relationship, congregational racial composition and religious tradition did influence the strength of the fundamentalism and LGBQ+ support association. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Religious leaders represent a key stakeholder group in the pursuit of increased rights and support for LGBQ+ people, yet this study reveals a significant disconnect between their attitudes and broader population trends toward acceptance. Community and policy stakeholders should collaborate with religious institutions, denominations, and theological seminaries to promote interpretive frameworks that encourage theological nuance, which emerged as the primary barrier to LGBQ+ support.",

In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight.

In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning.

Both the book and the VSI are largely authored, peer-reviewed, and edited by individuals affiliated with an NGO. A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO.

          "abstract": "Chronic pain is a complex and persistent condition that is influenced by psychological, behavioral, and social factors. Emerging research suggests that long-term pain is not only driven by nociceptive inputs, but also by maladaptive cognitive processes, emotional dysregulation, and unhelpful behavioral patterns. Additionally, patient expectations and clinician communication significantly influenced treatment outcomes. This scoping review synthesizes interdisciplinary findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and empirical studies published over the past two decades and identified through databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Only English-language studies involving human subjects were included. The findings reveal that cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing and attentional bias, along with affective disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, are consistently associated with heightened pain perception and poorer recovery. Maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and reduced activity further contribute to disability. Patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy are strongly influenced by the alignment of expectations and the quality of provider communication. Integrated theoretical models, including the biopsychosocial model, fear-avoidance theory, and mindfulness-based approaches, offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing chronic pain. These psychosocial mechanisms highlight the importance of patient-centered strategies that address cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal dimensions. Future research should prioritize underrepresented groups, such as older adults, low-income populations, and culturally diverse communities, and focus on scalable theory-driven interventions tailored to their needs.",

As a result, both men and women prioritized income more when income variance was large than when personality variance was large. Focusing not only on traits themselves but also on the variance of each trait may further advance the understanding of mate choice.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thoughts are a window into one's mind, as they offer rich information about ongoing psychological processes and value systems. We accessed the contents of these thoughts using a free association paradigm combined with natural language processing techniques to examine how happiness is associated with what people think about and prioritize in daily life. Our analyses revealed that participants (n = 210 from the US/UK) with higher subjective well-being, particularly those with more frequent positive affect, generated thoughts semantically more similar to 'friend,' but not to 'money.' A similar pattern was also found in an independent sample (n = 350 from South Korea), showing consistency of the findings across different cultural contexts. Notably, the semantic similarity of participants’ generated thoughts to 'friend' predicted the extent to which participants prioritized social relationships over monetary gains in a realistic dilemma task. By exploring individuals’ minds with a computational approach, our work elucidates how the value of social relationships is manifested in spontaneous thought contents and everyday decisions, providing significant insights into the sources of happiness.",

          "abstract": "Less than half of insured Americans can access mental health care due to a variety of barriers, including low provider participation in insurance networks. Providers report insufficient reimbursement rates and administrative burdens as reasons they do not accept insurance. We examined the importance of these barriers as well as the extent to which reimbursement rates would need to increase for private practice providers to accept insurance. Private practice mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, mental health counselors, and social workers) completed an online survey containing two behavioral economic tasks. In the Criteria Ranking Task, providers (n = 326) ranked their most important barriers to not accepting insurance, reporting insufficient reimbursement rates as the most important, followed by administrative burdens. In the Hypothetical Demand Task, providers indicated the likelihood of accepting Medicare at various reimbursement rate increases with and without hypothetical administrative assistance. Doctoral providers (n = 188) reported considering accepting insurance if reimbursement rates increased 83% (Pmax = $188.97), while master’s-level providers (n = 112) reported 118% (Pmax = $168.51). If provided administrative assistance, participants indicated they would accept insurance following 100% rate increases (Pmax = $206.28) for doctoral providers and 169% rate increases (Pmax = $207.90) for master’s-level providers. Results support existing research findings that insufficient reimbursement rates and administrative burdens are the primary barriers to mental health providers accepting insurance. Policy efforts to increase access to mental healthcare must consider the incentives and burdens that impact providers and their decision to participate in insurance network.",

          "abstract": "The enterprise of developing a common model of the mind\naims to create a foundational architecture for rational behavior\nin humans. Philosopher Immanuel Kant attempted something\nsimilar in 1781. The principles laid out by Kant for pursuing\nthis goal can shed important light on the common model\nproject. Unfortunately, Kant’s program has become hopelessly\nmired in philosophical hair-splitting. In this paper, we first use\nKant’s approach to isolate the founding conditions of\nrationality in humans. We then establish the parallels between\nKant’s mechanics and the operations in currently used models\nof cognitive architecture. Finally, we argue that Kant’s\nphilosophy can pave the way for general intelligence and show\nhow they can be actualized in a memory system using high\ndimensional vectors to achieve specific cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "We explore replacing the declarative memory system of the\nACT-R cognitive architecture with a distributional semantics\nmodel. ACT-R is a widely used cognitive architecture, but\nscales poorly to big data applications and lacks a robust model\nfor learning association strengths between stimuli. Distribu-\ntional semantics models can process millions of data points\nto infer semantic similarities from language data or to in-\nfer product recommendations from patterns of user prefer-\nences. We demonstrate that a distributional semantics model\ncan account for the primacy and recency effects in free recall,\nthe fan effect in recognition, and human performance on it-\nerated decisions with initially unknown payoffs. The model\nwe propose provides a flexible, scalable alternative to ACT-\nR’s declarative memory at a level of description that bridges\nsymbolic, quantum, and neural models of cognition.",

          "abstract": "Computational models of distributional semantics can ana-\nlyze a corpus to derive representations of word meanings in\nterms of each word’s relationship to all other words in the cor-\npus. While these models are sensitive to topic (e.g., tiger and\nstripes) and synonymy (e.g., soar and fly), the models have\nlimited sensitivity to part of speech (e.g., book and shirt are\nboth nouns). By augmenting a holographic model of semantic\nmemory with additional levels of representations, we present\nevidence that sensitivity to syntax is supported by exploiting\nassociations between words at varying degrees of separation.\nWe find that sensitivity to associations at three degrees of sep-\naration reinforces the relationships between words that share\npart-of-speech and improves the ability of the model to con-\nstruct grammatical sentences. Our model provides evidence\nthat semantics and syntax exist on a continuum and emerge\nfrom a unitary cognitive system.",

ACT-R is a widely used cognitive\narchitecture that models many different aspects of cognition,\nbut is limited by its use of words as symbols to represent\nideas or stimuli. HDM replaces the symbols with holographic\nvectors. Holographic vectors retain the expressive power of\nsymbols but have a similarity metric, allowing for shades of\nmeaning, fault tolerance, and lossy compression. The purpose\nof HDM is to enhance ACT-R’s ability to learn associations,\nlearn over the long-term and store large quantities of data, and\nuse partial or fuzzy matching. To demonstrate HDM, we fit\nperformance of an ACT-R model that uses HDM to a\nbenchmark memory task, the fan effect.",
