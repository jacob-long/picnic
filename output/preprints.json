          "abstract": "The rigorous treatment of uncertainties in global environmental assessments is essential to characterise the scientific state of the art and to inform policy. Recognizing this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted a standardized assessment framework to promote transparency and consistency in reporting the level of confidence in its key findings — most prominently those featured in the Summary for Policymakers. However, applying this framework is challenging and often leads to confidence statements based on expert judgment rather than a transparent and replicable process. Here we recommend an updated framework for assessing uncertainties that is suitable for lines of quantitative ex-post policy evaluation evidence that inform Working Group II and III reports. The framework uses evidence synthesized from systematic reviews to support robust and transparent confidence statements and to provide a clear and traceable rationale for conclusions. Where such synthesized evidence is lacking, we offer practical guidance and outline intermediary steps for improving confidence assessments. Our approach provides a concrete and replicable pathway to enhance the level of transparency and the reliability of scientific assessments that inform climate policy.",

          "authors": "Tamas Nagy; Marton Kovacs; Alexandra Sarafoglou",
          "abstract": "Analysis blinding is a methodological approach designed to protect the confirmatory status of an analysis by concealing crucial test-relevant aspects of the data from the analysts. This article introduces the vazul package for R, which provides a comprehensive suite of tools for implementing masking and scrambling techniques. We discuss the theoretical foundations of analysis blinding, particularly as a complement or alternative to preregistration. \n  \n  The package allows researchers to maintain analytic flexibility while safeguarding against bias. By using vazul, data managers can easily generate blinded datasets that preserve essential distributional properties while obscuring associations or labels that could lead to biased decisions. We provide detailed examples of vector-level, data-frame-level, and row-wise blinding operations, and demonstrate how the package handles complex data structures such as hierarchical or repeated-measures designs.",

          "authors": "Serge P. J. M. Horbach; Auste Valinciute",
          "abstract": "In light of persistent challenges to the quality and integrity of the research record, new practices of monitoring research are emerging in the form of scientific sleuthing. While quickly developing into a sizeable community of actors that is prominently engaging in scientific quality control, the role of scientific sleuths is both contested and poorly conceptualised. This paper addresses this by positioning sleuths in the context of institutionalised actors involved in the research monitoring process, including peer reviewers, research integrity officers and science journalists. It argues that while sleuths share characteristics with each of these roles, they nevertheless form a distinct class of actors, most importantly because of the absence of formal structures of accountability. This has triggered comparisons of scientific sleuthing to vigilantism. We explore the extent to which sleuthing practices resemble acts of digital vigilantism and discuss implications for sleuths’ ability to uphold the quality and integrity of the research literature.",

          "authors": "Gonzalo Pablo Urcelay; José A. Alcalá",
          "abstract": "Uncertainty refers to the state in which the probability of an outcome following an event is unknown. Substantial progress has been made in terms of understanding how uncertainty modulates learning and decision making, however the effect of outcome uncertainty on the generalization of prior knowledge to novel situations has not been clearly documented. In two predictive learning experiments, participants experienced cue-outcome trials in which the probability that an outcome would follow a Gabor grating (vertical or horizontal) was deterministic (100%) or probabilistic (50% or 25%). Participants learned that one Gabor orientation predicted the outcome whereas the other did not. Following training, participants provided expectancy ratings of the outcome to the trained and to novel gratings at different orientations (generalization test). Experiment 1 documented that participants displayed more generalization to novel gratings when training was probabilistic. Experiment 2 replicated these results and further showed broader generalization when participants were trained with deterministic outcomes and then switched to probabilistic in the last training block, a manipulation that increased experienced prediction error and hence surprise. These results suggest that outcome uncertainty broadens generalization gradients, and this is mediated by unsigned prediction errors.",

In this paper, we 1) highlight how this trend in meta-science is at odds with norms established in the broader field of research synthesis, 2) explain how this practice greatly reduces our capacity to verify, reproduce, or build on meta-scientific research, 3) explore common arguments and justifications for anonymisation, 4) provide counterpoints to these common justifications, and 5) demonstrate the adverse practical implications and epistemic costs for both meta-science specifically and science generally. If anonymisation continues as a practice, meta-science risks normalising a standard for itself that it would rightly criticise in any other area of empirical research, undermining its capacity to guide reforms as the underlying evidence is rendered unverifiable.",

          "abstract": "Many people worldwide want to be less neurotic, and targeted interventions can elicit these desired changes. However, many prior interventions relied on a heterogenous mix of strategies––often chosen ad hoc or derived from varied theoretical perspectives––leaving the change mechanisms of neuroticism and of effective interventions unclear. To guide theory development and inform intervention design, we first detailed a multidimensional theoretical personality framework that can support future intervention research. Second, we systematically reviewed literature on nonclinical interventions for neuroticism and related constructs (k = 99 articles). We used the multidimensional framework to code information from studies, provide an overview of this literature, and identify limitations. Third, using the coded information, we developed a theoretically informed taxonomy of 19 intervention strategies for neuroticism-related constructs. The Taxonomy of Neuroticism Strategies (TONS) organizes intervention components focal to theorized personality change processes, serves as an interactive tool for intervention design, and offers a systematic framework to test change mechanisms. Fourth, we used three personality change theories to conceptually validate the taxonomy. Overall, by integrating prior empirical and theoretical research, we hope for TONS to offer a common language to guide future study designs and systematically test the mechanisms and consequences of intentional neuroticism change.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control is assumed to be a fundamental component of successful emotion regulation, yet it remains largely unclear whether individual differences in specific facets of cognitive control predict the frequency and effectiveness of specific emotion regulation strategies in daily life. This study investigated how two facets of cognitive control, i.e. discarding irrelevant negative information from working memory, and controlling interference from negative stimuli, relate to reappraisal, rumination, and suppression in daily life. We examined these associations in female participants with borderline personality disorder (BPD; n = 52), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 55), and healthy controls (HC; n = 55). All individuals participated in four experimental paradigms, and a 7-day experience sampling protocol measuring the frequency and effectiveness of reappraisal, rumination, and suppression in daily life. In line with previous studies, results of the experimental tasks showed heightened interference from negative stimuli and slower discarding of irrelevant negative information in individuals with BPD compared to healthy controls. Evidence for impairments in MDD was less clear. Notably, cognitive control measures provided negligible value for predicting daily life emotion regulation after accounting for diagnostic group. The frequency and effectiveness of reappraisal, rumination, and suppression were determined primarily by diagnostic group rather than cognitive control. This highlights limits of cognitive control measures regarding their ecological relevance and raises questions for interventions targeting cognitive control to enhance emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "The present two-wave longitudinal study examined the stability of self- and peer-reported victimization across the transition from primary to secondary school and the role of children’s peer group in this stability. A total of 193 students from 36 primary school classrooms in the Netherlands (60% boys; Mage T1 = 12.16 years) were followed as they transitioned into 37 secondary school classrooms. Their level of victimization before and after the transition was determined using self-reported questionnaires and peer nominations. We further determined whether any of their primary school classmates transitioned to the same classroom in secondary school, and if so, whether these co-transitioning peers were friends in primary school, as determined by peer nominations. Multilevel analyses revealed that self-reported victimization was likely to continue if students co-transitioned to the secondary school classroom without peers, but not if they co-transitioned with peers, regardless of the friendship relation with them. In contrast, peer-reported victimization tended to be stable across all groups. However, it was more stable among students with co-transitioning non-friends than among those with a co-transitioning friend or without co-transitioning peers. Practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This work is concerned with the study of the long-term behavior of associative values of conditioned stimuli undergoing a discrimination training, as predicted by models of associative learning. The analysis applies to Rescorla and Wagner model (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972), Pearce’s model (Pearce, 1994), the Replaced Elements Model (Wagner, 2003), the Inhibited Elements Model (Thorwart &amp; Lachnit, 2020), and the Context-Dependent Added Elements Model (George, 2020). The main tools used are a kernel machine approach proposed by Ghirlanda (2015, 2018), and a theorem by Aguirre (2026) regarding asymptotic behavior of periodic linear difference equations. These tools will help provide a method to find asymptotic associative values predicted by models, aid in the study of structural constrains of models that may limit their predictions, and allow to study the role that may be played by parameters of the training. As a result of the theory developed, it is proven that the Replaced Elements Model, the Inhibited Elements Model, and the Context-Dependent Added Elements Model, will always predict that, with enough training, any possible discrimination training will be solved.",

          "authors": "Hannah Loenneker; Inga Liepelt-Scarfone; Klaus Willmes; Hans-Christoph Nuerk; Christina Artemenko",
          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Background. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has become increasingly feasible with technological advances, enabling the capture of dynamic fluctuations in symptoms and processes. EMA is ecologically valid and can reduce recall biases. However, there is a lack of thoroughly validated items. This study seeks to validate a set of items to assess key psychological processes in chronic pain in EMA.  \nMethods. The “Prozesse Chronischer Schmerzen ErfaSSen” (ProCEss; engl. „Assessing Chronic Pain Processes”) item set was developed for an EMA coverage model, i.e. a broad range of the day shall be captured instead of single momentary experiences. In multiple studies, practitioners (n = 18 + n = 12) and affected persons (n = 12 + n = 12) contributed to establishing content validity through an adapted Discriminant Content Validity Method and cognitive interviews. Findings from these studies informed the development of written and audio-visual comprehension aids, designed and evaluated in a healthy sample (n = 128) to replace extensive participant instruction procedures.\nResults. Across studies, both affected persons and practitioners rated the items positively with regard to content validity and clinical utility. Feedback of affected persons contributed to item refinement, and the item set was reduced from 29 to 25 items. The evaluation of the comprehension aids supported the comprehensibility of the item set.\nConclusions. The ProCEss item set is among the first validated instruments for assessing chronic pain processes using EMA in German. The current study supports its content validity. Other forms of validity have to be established in future research.",

          "abstract": "The perspectives on the genuine basis of self and self-consciousness are diverse. Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

However, translating complex ideas about psychological dynamics into formal models can be challenging without the right tools. In this tutorial, we introduce a approaches using R and the ctsem package to help researchers build and understand dynamic systems models that capture some of the complexity of psychological processes. We emphasize iterative model-building through simulations, model fitting, and visualizations of the model-implied dynamics alongside their fit to data. We begin with familiar linear models in lme4 and gradually transition to ctsem, which allows us to incorporate complexities such as state-dependent change, random fluctuation distinct from measurement error, covariate effects, interactions, and external inputs. These modelling concepts are illustrated using a running example of affect dynamics in couples therapy, demonstrating how key conceptual and methodological ideas in dynamic systems modelling come together. Our aim is to provide a general framework for understanding dynamic systems modelling and to encourage further exploration of theory-driven statistical approaches in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "During retrieval from episodic memory, individuals exhibit the \"Looking at Nothing\" effect (LAN), where they tend to gaze back at locations where the information was initially presented. Scholz et al. (2018) demonstrated that LAN could enhance memory performance not only through eye movements but also via covert attention shifts. Across 2 experiments, the aim of our study was to investigate whether this is also the case for retrieval from working memory. Participants encoded three word-pairs at three distinct locations. At retrieval, participants' memory for one word pair was assessed using auditory cues related to the target pair in both an immediate retrieval test (Experiment 1 and 2) or a delayed test (Experiment 2). We manipulated either the location of gaze (Experiment 1 and 2) or of covert attention (Experiment 1) during retrieval by introducing a digit tracking task at one of three locations: congruent (where the tested word pair was originally presented), incongruent (a different location), or central. We found evidence against any difference in memory performance between the cue conditions. Attending the location at which memory information has been perceived appears to not lead to a benefit in memory performance for either working or long-term memory in an associative recognition task with word pairs.",

          "abstract": "Kusano et al. (2025) argue that strict measurement invariance (MI) requirements may be ill-suited for cross-cultural psychology because they can obscure theoretically meaningful differences between countries. We share their call to move beyond MI as a gatekeeper and to focus on the substantive relevance of non-invariance. However, we question whether correlating country-level scale scores with external indices separates construct-relevant factors from method biases. In a simulation calibrated to their empirical setting, we show that scalar non-invariance (threshold/intercept shift) (a) attenuates and destabilizes country-level correlations, (b) inflates correlations when bias aligns with the construct, and (c) suppresses associations when bias opposes it. We also outline a causal perspective on MI that treats non-invariance as theoretically informative and motivates explicit models of its causes. Using this causal view, we argue that adjusting for demographic covariates at the composite score level does not remedy item-level non-invariance.",

To minimize these effects, it is crucial to understand how EMA design factors influence inattentive responding and, consequently, the quality of the collected data. This study contributes to this aim by investigating how response format, as a more subtle design choice, affects inattentive responding in EMA.  We re-analyzed data from two experimental EMA studies, in which surveys were administered either in a Likert-type or a visual analogue scale (VAS) format in between-subjects designs. Each dataset was analyzed with one of two state-of-the-art confirmatory mixture modeling approaches to examine whether response format is associated with differences in (a) the overall level of inattentive responding and (b) its associations with two fatigue- and attention-related contextual factors: the cumulative number of EMA study days and time of day. Across datasets and analytical approaches, we found indications that Likert scales yield up to 3 percentage points higher rates of inattentive responding than VASs, though the temporal patterns varied across studies. In Study I, differences were observed in overall inattentiveness levels, with parallel increases across EMA days. In Study II, initial inattentiveness was comparable between formats, but the Likert format showed a steeper increase over time. Implications for EMA design are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study explored perceptual sensitivity to spectral and temporal acoustic features in music recognition among BaYaka hunter-gatherer children. Using an interactive, non-competitive game (Move to Match), we tested song recognition under various forms of audio degradation to identify which musical dimensions are crucial for recognizing familiar songs. BaYaka children demonstrated robust recognition of songs across unaltered, spectrally degraded, and temporally degraded versions, highlighting sensitivity to multiple acoustic dimensions. We suggest that songs may be recognized despite degradations because of spectral contour processing, rather than pitch and rhythm cues alone. Moreover, recognition performance decreased for duration-degraded songs (“plinks”), as the brevity constrains the cues available to listeners. However, song identification of (spectrally degraded) plinks far exceeded chance levels and outperformed Western adults performing similar tasks. This suggests that onset-transients and spectral shape, contributing to timbre perception, might serve as reliable markers for identifying musical sounds. We discuss the possibility that music cognition evolved for reasons beyond social bonding to support identification of personal contributions within musical exchanges through timbre, which may hold importance in cooperative contexts. As one of the first experimental studies of music perception in hunter-gatherers, this work demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted methods for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are pervasive in everyday life and pose well-documented public health risks, yet little is known about how lay perceptions of EDC risks are structured and how they vary across exposure routes and regulatory contexts. Drawing on the psychometric paradigm of risk perception, we conducted a large cross-national survey (N = 1,966) in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Participants evaluated 18 EDC-related activities across nine canonical risk attributes, ranked perceived health risks by exposure route (consumption, inhalation, dermal contact), and reported perceived severity, susceptibility, general exposure, institutional trust, and sociodemographic characteristics. Across all three countries, risk perceptions exhibited a robust two-dimensional structure corresponding to affective-dread and cognitive-controllability dimensions. However, the relative salience of these dimensions varied systematically: cognitive-controllability cues accounted for more variance in Denmark, whereas affective-dread cues were more prominent in the UK and US. Perceived risk also varied consistently by exposure route, with consumption judged the most risky, followed by inhalation and dermal contact, a hierarchy that showed minimal cross-country variation. At the individual level, greater knowledge of EDCs consistently predicted higher perceived severity, while gender, age, income, parenthood, and institutional trust showed context- and outcome-specific associations. By extending the psychometric paradigm to chronic, diffuse chemical hazards embedded in everyday activities, this study demonstrates that EDC risk perceptions reflect stable affective-cognitive dimensions while remaining sensitive to exposure routes and governance contexts, offering theoretically grounded insights for risk communication and policy design.",

Proficiency in motor skills is crucial for maintaining autonomy and enhancing quality of life in older adults. Nonetheless, recent findings indicate that alterations in sleep patterns due to aging may greatly hinder the consolidation of motor memory, thus speeding up the decline of motor abilities. In this context, motor learning is modulated/affected not just by internal neural processes but also by the quality and organization of sleep, especially the preservation of slow-wave and REM sleep. Interruptions in these sleep stages seem to hinder the neurological changes required for enduring enhancements in motor skills. This synthesis emphasizes the importance of recognizing the relationship among sleep, aging, and sensorimotor plasticity, while suggesting effective intervention strategies like improving sleep or specific therapies to alleviate age-related motor deficits. These findings originate from a pre-registered systematic review of 21 research articles extracted from 740 sources indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We investigated these effects on motor learning and whether these effects vary by task type, complexity, sleep effect, and age. This review seeks to enhance our comprehension of age-suitable empirical studies on sleep-related motor memory consolidation among healthy groups by synthesizing results from various research projects.\nKeywords: Motor learning, sleep, motor-memory consolidation, aging, neuroplasticity.",

          "abstract": "Social media feeds present users with a rapid stream of posts, but little is known about how attention is distributed across content while scrolling. This study investigates attention during passive social media use using detailed behavioural log data collected from a simulated,\nInstagram-like platform. More precisely, we recorded fine-grained measures of dwell time, navigation, and engagement. Analysing over 42,000 image-viewing episodes across more than 1,000 browsing sessions, we show that attention in feed environments is fleeting, with most posts viewed for less than a second and only a small minority receiving sustained attention. Variability in dwell time was primarily attributable to individual differences rather than to systematic content features, contextual factors, or social reinforcement cues. Attention declined over the course of browsing sessions, with longer dwell times occurring during deliberate exploration or overt interaction. These findings suggest that everyday social media use consists largely of momentary micro-exposures rather than sustained message processing. By documenting the temporal constraints under which attention unfolds during scrolling, this study provides descriptive foundations for more realistic theories of exposure and media effects and illustrates the value of simulated platforms for high-resolution analyses of attention in digital environments.",

We further examined whether the gender of the respondents and the form of their university (sport university compared to general education universities) predicted their attitudes. We found that men hold more negative attitudes than women toward LGB+ athletes, especially toward men (compared to women) LGB+ athletes. There is no effect of environment (sport university compared to general education university) on personal attitudes. Results for perception of others’ attitudes reveal similar patterns. However, students in the sport university perceive stronger LGB+ negativity toward both men and women LGB+ athletes compared to students in the general education university. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of how gender and environment might shape negativity toward LGB+ athletes and provide a starting place for future intervention.",

Exploration is recognised as a key cognitive process supporting adolescent development and wellbeing but how real-world exploration relates to emotional adjustment during major life transitions remains unclear. To address this question, we tracked adolescents entering high school and university (N=64) over the first three months of transition using continuous smartphone geolocation and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). \n\nWe quantified daily exploration as the dispersion of time in a day across locations (“roaming entropy”) and the number of newly visited locations (“novelty”) and assessed in-the-moment affect, autonomy and new social connections using EMA. On days when individuals visited more novel locations than usual, they reported higher positive affect, lower negative affect and more new social connections. Novelty was a stronger predictor of these outcomes than roaming entropy. Associations between exploration and positive affect were more pronounced in university students than in high school students, consistent with greater autonomy during this transition. Greater anxiety and depressive symptoms were not associated with lower exploration, but attenuated the positive associations between novelty, affect and perceived autonomy. \n\nThese findings link theories and laboratory studies of adolescent exploration and mental health to naturalistic behaviour, showing that engagement with novel environments during major transitions is linked to positive emotional and social experiences. Importantly, these associations were weaker when depression and anxiety symptoms were greater. Real-world exploration may therefore represent a behavioural pathway supporting adjustment as young people navigate environmental change.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been widely recognized as a significant risk factor, yet few studies have deciphered the key components of early adversity exposure that lead to addiction outcomes.  \nObjective: This study aimed to compare the predictive utility of the type of adversity (adversity classification model) and the dose-response effect of exposure (the cumulative risk model) for drug addiction, and to examine the mediating role of alexithymia in the relationship between childhood adversity and drug addiction symptoms. Participants and Setting: Participants were 461 male drug addiction offenders recruited from a detoxification center in a southwestern province of China.\nMethods: Participants completed self-report measures assessing childhood adversity, alexithymia, and drug addiction symptoms. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted under both the adversity classification and cumulative risk models. Model fit was compared using likelihood ratio tests. A path mediation model was constructed to assess the mediating role of alexithymia. Results: Compared to the cumulative risk model, the adversity classification model better predicts drug addiction. Specifically, emotional neglect and parental incarceration were significantly related to drug addiction. Regarding the role of alexithymia, difficulties in emotion recognition and description partially mediated the effects of emotional neglect on unconscious drug cravings and automatic behaviors. In contrast, parental incarceration showed a direct association with automatic behaviors, but this effect was not mediated by alexithymia. \nConclusions: Types of childhood adversity explain the psychological mechanisms of drug addiction more effectively than the cumulative adversity exposure. In particular, emotional neglect contributes to addiction through difficulties in emotion processing, highlighting the importance of early emotional development in prevention and intervention efforts.",

Participants received either anodal stimulation, which increases the excitability of neurons, or sham stimulation, and subsequently rated metaphorical (e.g., Passion is a storm), literal (e.g., A gorilla is an ape), or nonsensical (e.g., Depression is a party) sentences on comprehensibility. Participants who received anodal stimulation rated metaphors to be less comprehensible than participants who received sham stimulation. No effects were observed for literal or nonsensical sentences. In addition, word-level semantic characteristics affected metaphor comprehensibility ratings but not literal or nonsensical sentences.

Specifically, faculty perceived these “alternative” statements to be weaker DEI statements, and perceived the applicants who submitted these statements to be less competent, less hireable, and less likable. Furthermore, faculty were less likely to recommend–often by a large margin–that the applicants behind these “alternative” statements pass an initial screening and be advanced for further review. Evaluative penalties were most severe toward DEI statements focusing only on viewpoint diversity actions and efforts (Studies 1-4), but also manifested for statements focusing only on rural diversity (Study 6), or only on socioeconomic diversity (Study 7). Findings for disability diversity (Study 5) were mixed. These studies provide novel insight on how DEI statements are perceived and evaluated by university faculty.",

Here, we show people also systematically link social groups to concepts across nonsocial domains, such as women to wine and harps, men to beer and drums. These seemingly nonsocial objects form a hidden architecture of stereotypes, which we bring into view. By asking participants, ``If X were a Y, what Y would it be?\", we mapped 100 social groups across eight semantic domains such as beverages, musical instruments, and color, and found that these cross-domain mappings closely mirrored the perceived warmth and competence of social groups. By further randomly assigning participants to reason through counter-stereotypical cross-domain mappings using the prompt “If X were a Y, it would be y,” we shifted their subsequent justifications toward portraying the target groups as more competent and warmer than they otherwise would have. Analogical reasoning that emphasizes structural similarity was more effective at changing evaluations than associative reasoning based on contextual or surface-level similarity. Our findings suggest that stereotypical traits can be emergent properties of rich associative networks, and that manipulating which everyday objects people link to social groups-even seemingly irrelevant ones-can change how people make sense of social groups.",

Our results revealed that learners who successfully updated their verb biases showed greater growth in anticipatory looking patterns upon hearing the verb in ambiguous test sentences. Greater prediction errors operationalized by the mismatch between learners’ initial verb bias and the subsequent training predicted greater learning. Finally, individuals who predicted more in a separate comprehension task showed greater changes in anticipatory looking behavior and ambiguity resolution in the verb bias learning task.

Reviewing 95 papers that report relationships between age/tenure diversity and team performance, we find a fundamental mismatch: while most hypotheses appear to be concerned with diversity as variety (maximized with many different groups), most measures reflect separation (maximized with two polarized groups). The most widely used measures—the coefficient of variation and standard deviation—reflect separation, while existing variety measures require discretizing the continuous variable, losing distance information. Here, we propose a measure that captures variety on a continuous variable using all available information: the Coverage &amp; Evenness Index (CEI). Compared to established measures, we show that it produces an intuitive ordering of teams and increases statistical power, as shown through a simulation. By adopting the CEI, diversity researchers can reduce false negatives, improve comparability across studies, and generate findings that more faithfully test their hypotheses. We provide R code for calculating the CEI in the divMetrics package.",

          "authors": "Achiel Fenneman; Alan Sanfey; Sarah Malamut",
          "abstract": "We can guide our decisions in novel situations by drawing on our past experiences (episodic memories). While at times we can retrieve relevant episodes via cued recall, other situations may require a process of memory search. But what mechanisms underlie this search? In this work we synthesize six key principles concerning the storage and retrieval of episodic memories, and build on these principles to propose a cognitive mechanism which allows for the retrieval of relevant past experiences through a process of cascading recall. In this process, observing a stimulus triggers the cued recall of a past event.  If this memory does not provide sufficient information to warrant a decision, then it next reinstates all the memory’s constituent features. These features then form the inputs to sample an additional memory in a subsequent recall step, which in turn reinstates its own features and so forth. This process continues until a suitable past experience is retrieved. We provide empirical support for key predictions of this cascading process through three online experiments in which participants interacted with unfamiliar stimuli. The results indicate that participants rely on cued recall of similar past experiences (experiment 1), and on indirectly related experiences when cued recall is not informative (experiment 2). Additionally, participants were substantially more likely to retrieve a predicted memory, and did so faster, when relying on cued recall versus cascading memory search (experiment 3). We conclude by discussing how this cascading recall process bridges several influential models of memory-based decision-making, as well as offering promising directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Valter Prpic; Stefano Pileggi; Federico D'Atri; MAURO MURGIA; Carlo Fantoni; Dražen Domijan",
          "abstract": "The existence of a conceptual link between numbers and space is a fundamental question in numerical cognition and has been highly debated in recent years. Although Spatial-Numerical Associations (SNAs) have traditionally been investigated using bimanual response settings, recent studies have moved towards unimanual paradigms to avoid potential measurement artifacts. For instance, an influential line of research adopted a modified Implicit Association Test (IAT) in which numbers and arrows were presented sequentially. However, SNAs consistently emerged only when spatial and magnitude codes were explicitly contrasted, questioning the idea that numbers are inherently represented in a spatial format. To further investigate this issue, we designed a modified flanker task in which spatial and numerical stimuli were presented simultaneously. When arrows were task irrelevant (Experiment 1), no significant SNA emerged. By contrast, when participants judged arrow direction and numerical magnitude conjunctively (Experiment 2), the paradigm revealed extremely large SNAs compared to existing literature. Overall, our results provide no evidence for a purely conceptual spatial–numerical link, suggesting that robust SNAs require explicit spatial codes combined with semantic number processing. Finally, the large effect size of group-level SNAs, together with remarkable mixed-model-derived psychometric properties, indicates the modified flanker task as an ideal paradigm for studying individual differences and effect modulations. We suggest that this paradigm has the potential to further advance the research on SNAs by overcoming limitations of previous bimanual and unimanual paradigms and, consequently, by helping to disambiguate mixed results in the literature.",

We investigate whether practice-based instruction improves programming skills relative to traditional lectures and which features of practice make it effective. In this preregistered experiment (N = 250), we compared three approaches for an introductory programming lesson: watching a video, code tracing visualizations, and writing code with immediate, AI-generated feedback. Participants who engaged in practice-based instruction performed significantly better than those who watched the video on a novel code-generation test, with the highest performance among learners who practiced writing code. Practice-based instruction also resulted in reduced distraction and increased interest. Whereas video and code tracing conditions led to overconfidence about programming abilities, code writing led to underconfident self-assessments. These findings suggest that active practice, particularly generative practice with feedback, supports learning with advantages in cognitive processing, metacognition, and interest in programming.",

          "abstract": "Beat perception—the ability to extract a regular pulse from rhythmic sequences—is a foundational component of human musicality and a key mechanism supporting synchronization, dance, and collective music-making. Research across neuroscience, developmental psychology, and comparative cognition demonstrates that beat processing exhibits four defining characteristics: it is near-universal across human cultures, emerges spontaneously in early development, engages domain-specific predictive timing mechanisms, and appears largely species-specific. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that newborns, and even late-gestation fetuses, respond to rhythmic regularities using predictive neural processes that cannot be explained by simple interval timing or statistical learning alone. Across infancy and childhood, these early predispositions are progressively refined through auditory experience, motor development, and musical enculturation, ultimately supporting the flexible, hierarchical beat-based timing seen in adults. Comparative studies reveal that while non-human primates and other species can detect isochrony or local temporal violations, they typically fail to induce a beat, highlighting a dissociation between evolutionarily conserved timing abilities and the specialized predictive mechanisms characteristic of humans. Together, findings from phylogeny and ontogeny suggest that beat perception reflects an early-emerging, biologically prepared capacity that is further shaped by experience. Understanding its developmental and evolutionary bases offers crucial insight into the origins of human musicality and the neural architecture supporting temporal prediction.",

While new pedagogical approaches and AI-driven learning technologies are rapidly deployed, the empirical paradigm of classroom-based research remains slow, fragmented, and ethically constrained, often generating evidence only after large-scale implementation has occurred. Here, we argue that education requires a paradigmatic shift toward agent-based educational science: a research framework in which educational theories are formalized as interacting agents and environments, enabling in silico experimentation on developmental processes that are otherwise slow, risky, or infeasible to test empirically. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence make such a shift practically achievable for the first time. As a concrete instantiation of this paradigm, we introduce Student Development Agents—computational agents designed to generate longitudinal developmental trajectories under counterfactual educational environments. Rather than replacing empirical research, agent-based educational science reconfigures its role, enabling predictive, ethical, and cumulative theory building in the science of learning.",

This qualitative comparative case study examined what shapes the educational experiences of autistic pupils in secondary schools with Specialist Resource Centres (SRCs) versus comparable mainstream settings without specialist provision. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems framework, the study explored how multiple layers of influence – ranging from classroom practices to societal attitudes – interact to support or undermine inclusion.\nData were collected across seven secondary schools (five SRC schools, two mainstream schools without SRCs) in South-East England via interviews with pupils, parents, and staff. Findings revealed that SRCs functioned as protective microsystems, providing predictable environments, visible support, and trusted relationships that buffered pupils from sensory and social demands. Key protective features included consistent staffing, flexible policies, and normalised support-seeking. However, systemic challenges – including workforce shortages, inadequate mental health services, and resource limitations – constrained the impact of even the most effective school initiatives. The study underscores that effective inclusion requires coordinated support spanning immediate school environments to broader policy frameworks, with implications for admission criteria, staff training, and inter-agency collaboration.",

          "authors": "Joerg Fingerhut",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I address how the arts contribute to knowledge and understanding by defending an Affective Aesthetic Cognitivism (AAC). AAC is an empirically informed theory model, concerning the role of affect and emotions in sustaining the transformative, cognitive impact of the arts.  The relation of our art engagement to our drive for knowledge might at times seem rather indirect. We do not mainly engage with art for educational purposes but rather for pleasure (e.g., when we rewatch a movie or TV show we love) or for emotion regulation (e.g., when we go to an art exhibition when we are bored). Aesthetic Cognitivism in philosophy and psychology, in contrast, focuses on the epistemic outcomes of our art engagement. It provides a theory about the value of the arts not “as sources of delight, amusement, pleasure, or emotional catharsis, but as sources of understanding.” (Brewer 2025, 1). The proposed AAC in this chapter goes one step further by integrating affect and cognition, arguing that the emotions are not a byproduct but a significant driver of the epistemic impact of the arts. The claim of AAC is therefore not just that the emotions accompany epistemic changes, or that they motivate cognitive engagement (they do that as well), but that specific aesthetic emotions play a constitutive role in how understanding through the arts is achieved. \n\tI first discuss the more general impact of art and cultural artifacts on our habits of perceiving and distinguish them from epistemically valuable cognitive gains; this gives me the opportunity to revisit some central claims of Aesthetic Cognitivism. I then examine how affect and cognition have been related in aesthetic psychology and, starting with Berlyne’s (1960, 1970) work on curiosity that recent psychology has been amended to cover more specific emotions. The main part of the chapter analyzes two recent empirical approaches to Aesthetic Cognitivism. An attempt at a taxonomy of aesthetic impacts (Christensen et al., 2023) and an assessment of viewers’ affective and cognitive experiences in a museum context (Miller et al., 2025). I propose some conditions that empirical studies must meet to speak to Aesthetic Cognitivism and AAC respectively. Overall, these studies suggest that when people actively engage with artworks their emotional involvement is not merely reactive or pleasure-based, but contains different expansive experiences that closely connect to shifts in perspective and the generation of understanding.",

This mixed methods research proposal aims to address significant gaps in autism and trauma research. Autistic women and gender-diverse individuals face significant barriers in autism research. Existing diagnostic and treatment models are based on male-centric frameworks, leading to underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and inadequate support for this population. While validated trauma interventions for autistic people are scarce in general, autistic women and gender-diverse individuals are almost absent in these studies. To address these gaps, this thesis has 4 main sections; 1) a literature review on existing research, 2) a survey on expert perspectives in this context, 3) A scoping review on methodologies for mind-body treatments in this population, 4) proposed randomised controlled trials on mind-body therapies for this population and 4b) proposed interviews evaluating the lived experience of this population before, during and after the trials. The integration of expert knowledge, quantitative outcomes and lived experience in this research challenges gender biases in autism care and adds to the development of autism-informed trauma treatments.

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to sycophantic behavior, uncritically conforming to user beliefs. As models increasingly condition responses on user-specific context (personality traits, preferences, conversation history), they gain information to tailor agreement more effectively. Understanding how personalization modulates sycophancy is critical, yet systematic evaluation across models and contexts remains limited. We present a rigorous evaluation of personalization's impact on LLM sycophancy across nine frontier models and five benchmark datasets spanning advice, moral judgment, and debate contexts. \nWe find that personalization generally increases affective alignment (emotional validation, hedging/deference), but affects epistemic alignment (belief adoption, position stability, resistance to influence) with context-dependent role modulation. When the LLM's role is to give advice, personalization strengthens epistemic independence (models challenge user presuppositions). When its role is that of a social peer, personalization decreases epistemic independence. In this role, extensively personalized user challenges causing LLMs to abandon their position at significantly higher rates. Robustness tests confirm that the effects are driven by personalized conditioning, not by additional input tokens per se or demographic information alone. Our work provides measurement frameworks for evaluating personalized AI systems, demonstrates the necessity of role-sensitive evaluation, and establishes a novel benchmark to assess goal alignment.",

Drawing on cultural psychology frameworks, this study examines how parents of young children in low-resource settings coped with adversity situated within the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Using a constructivist qualitative design, in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 parents of children under six years of age living in economically marginalized urban contexts. Data were analyzed through Reflexive Thematic Analysis, guided by Kirmayer’s (2007) model of sociocentric and cosmocentric selves. Sociocentric coping reflects a relational orientation in which well-being is understood as collective, caregiving is morally central, and emotional regulation is oriented toward preserving family harmony. Cosmocentric coping reflects an orientation toward higher-order forces through which uncertainty is accepted, distress externalized, and endurance cultivated. The study challenges individualistic models of coping and highlights how care, endurance, and meaning-making are collectively organized in contexts of structural vulnerability. The paper contributes to cultural psychology by extending theoretical understanding of coping, resilience, and parenting as culturally mediated processes and calls for a contextually grounded model of parental coping to inform culturally responsive interventions and policies promoting family and child well-being in low-resource settings.\nKey words: cultural coping, parenting, sociocentric self, cosmocentric self, Covid 19, low-resource setting, crisis, family stressors",

William’s “Temporal Need-Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study the psychological responses to ostracism via social inclusion vs. exclusion phases, previous studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves being derived from the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attention is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s Temporal Need-Threat Model, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feeling. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, with gaze proportion toward faces varying throughout the Cyberball game, but most likely independent of participants’ social pain.",

          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology frequently combine exploratory data analysis (EDA) with confirmatory data analysis (CDA). In multiple linear regression, this practice often involves using the same dataset both to select predictors and to conduct statistical inference. This leads to invalid post-selection inference (PoSI), a violation of classical statistical assumptions that can produce biased standard errors, distorted p-values, and inflated Type I error rates. As a result, conclusions drawn from such analyses may be misleading or overstated. This paper provides a comprehensive and didactical review of the problem of invalid PoSI arising from data-driven variable selection in multiple linear regression. We illustrate how standard inferential procedures fail after model selection and demonstrate these issues through simulation studies conducted under different model specifications. We also discuss several established statistical approaches for obtaining valid inference after model selection, highlighting their assumptions, strengths, and limitations.\nOur goal is to make the issue of invalid PoSI accessible to applied psychological researchers and to offer practical guidance for conducting statistically valid inference following variable selection.",

          "abstract": "This study explored perceptual sensitivity to spectral and temporal acoustic features in music recognition among BaYaka hunter-gatherer children. Using an interactive, non-competitive game (Move to Match), we tested song recognition under various forms of audio degradation to identify which musical dimensions are crucial for recognizing familiar songs. BaYaka children demonstrated robust recognition of songs across unaltered, spectrally degraded, and temporally degraded versions, highlighting sensitivity to multiple acoustic dimensions. We suggest that songs may be recognized despite degradations because of spectral contour processing, rather than pitch and rhythm cues alone. Moreover, recognition performance decreased for duration-degraded songs (“plinks”), as the brevity constrains the cues available to listeners. However, song identification of (spectrally degraded) plinks far exceeded chance levels and outperformed Western adults performing similar tasks. This suggests that onset-transients and spectral shape, contributing to timbre perception, might serve as reliable markers for identifying musical sounds. We discuss the possibility that music cognition evolved for reasons beyond social bonding to support identification of personal contributions within musical exchanges through timbre, which may hold importance in cooperative contexts. As one of the first experimental studies of music perception in hunter-gatherers, this work demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted methods for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Background\nRising skin cancer rates emphasise the need for sun protection measures. While sunscreen is a widely accepted protective measure, its use faces barriers such as perceived inconvenience and forgetfulness. Free sunscreen dispensers aim to mitigate these barriers and promote sunscreen use in various environments. As children are an important target group for skin cancer preventive efforts, placement of sunscreen dispensers at primary schools offers potential to promote sunscreen use. However, to date, their value remains underexplored. \n\nMethods\nA mixed-method study design was applied to evaluate the use and implementation of sunscreen dispensers at three primary schools in the Netherlands. Structured observations (n=1040), guided by an observation checklist, were conducted to assess dispenser use in practice. Additionally, group interviews with pupils (n=112) were carried out to explore their perceptions regarding the dispensers and their motives for (non-)use. Individual interviews (n=6) with school stakeholders (i.e., management, teachers, and facility staff) were conducted to identify perceived facilitators and barriers to implementation.\n\nResults\nObservations revealed that sunscreen dispenser use varied from 6.8% to 42.7% across schools and times. In total, 29.9% of users were encouraged by teachers. Both pupils and stakeholders were positive about the dispensers. Pupils’ main motive for dispenser use was prevention of harmful consequences of the sun, while motives for non-use included weather conditions, no perceived need, and impracticalities. Implementation was facilitated by the ease of use of sunscreen dispensers, supportive environments, and information provision, but hindered by practical concerns and pupils’ need for assistance. \n\nConclusion\nSunscreen dispensers were positively evaluated by pupils and stakeholders, their use depending on several contextual and behavioural factors. Integrating sunscreen dispensers into a comprehensive educational approach for skin cancer prevention at primary schools is key to overcome practical barriers",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation involves integrating spatial cues with prior spatial knowledge to remember locations and maintain orientation. This study examined the influence of spatial priors (pre-existing knowledge about spatial parameters) using a spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality. We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities are present in many software systems, putting those who entrust software with their data in harm’s way. Many vulnerabilities are avoidable since they are not new and are well-described. Despite this awareness, they remain widespread. One hypothesis for their persistence is that they represent software blindspots, problems that are implicit in the mental models of developers and thus escape attention (Brun et al., 2023; Oliveira et al. 2018). Our current understanding of how cognitive influences secure coding is limited, and we address this by extending the hypothesis by suggesting differences in decision making approaches alter the ability to detect vulnerabilities. Through an empirical study and power analysis, we show the potential value of dual processing theory, where individuals make decisions using one of two cognitive systems: a default system reliant on heuristics and intuitive mechanisms, and a more deliberate and computational interventionist system. This preregistered study replicates key predictions from previous blindspot research, extends the analysis towards cognition, and models effect sizes of variables that might impact software security. We complement this analysis with data simulations to expose the sampling scale of empirical studies that would be necessary for highly powered work in this domain.",

Although the results revealed various situational predictors, the strongest was the presence of other people. People who characteristically welcomed accountability tended to experience more pleasant emotion and meaningfulness and less unpleasant emotion. Similarly, when people welcomed accountability more than was typical for them, they tended to experience more pleasant emotion and meaningfulness, but also more unpleasant emotion. These findings offer important insights into how welcoming accountability manifests across situations and establishes its relationships with different aspects of well-being.",

          "abstract": "The ability to detect and learn from errors is critical for adaptive behavior across the lifespan. In motor learning, errors drive accurate movements by updating internal forward models that predict sensory consequences. However, the developmental trajectory of the neural mechanisms underlying error processing in motor learning remains largely unknown. Here, we recorded EEG in children (8–10 years), adolescents (13–15 years), and adults (20–35 years) during a goal-directed drawer-opening task requiring movements at a target speed to obtain a reward at the end of the movement. The task dissociated predictive processing of internal errors, reflected in an error-related negativity (ERN)-like component, from postdictive processing of external errors, reflected in a feedback-related negativity (FRN)-like component. Unlike previous cognitive studies, our results showed significant ERN-like and FRN-like components already in 8-year-olds, with no significant differences across the age groups, suggesting early development of predictive and postdictive error processing. Exploratory analyses revealed a more pronounced late frontal positivity in children compared to adolescents and adults, indicating that external feedback may remain more salient at younger ages. This study highlights children’s ability to monitor performance internally and externally during motor learning and underscores the value of supporting both self-monitoring and feedback-based learning in motor skill acquisition across ages.",

This mixed-methods study surveyed 126 staff from six secondary schools, assessing autism-specific training, perceived inclusiveness of school environment, experience with autistic pupils, neurodiversity-affirming attitudes, personal connection to autism, and staff role. Teacher self-efficacy and intentions for inclusive practice were measured using adapted scales, and hierarchical multiple regression identified significant predictors. Autism-specific training, perceived quality of the inclusive environment, years of experience with autistic pupils, classroom teacher role, and neurodiversity-affirming attitudes predicted higher self-efficacy. Together, these explained 42.1% of the variance. Intentions for inclusive practice were predicted by neurodiversity-affirming attitudes and training, explaining 27.5% of variance. Thematic analysis of open-text responses revealed practical adjustments including clear communication, sensory adaptations, and emotional regulation supports, alongside challenges such as resource constraints, complex classroom dynamics, and inconsistent institutional support. Findings highlight the value of targeted autism-specific training and fostering neurodiversity-affirming attitudes, supported by inclusive school environments, to strengthen teacher capacity and sustain inclusive practice.",

This study presents the Children’s Voices on School Well-Being (CV-SWB), a mixed-methods instrument designed for children aged 3 to 12 years. The CV-SWB includes 21 items rated on a three-point Likert scale with visual support, complemented by open-ended questions eliciting children’s justifications. The instrument was individually administered to 548 children from preschool and elementary education in 12 schools in Spain. Exploratory factor analyses supported a five-factor structure: Belonging and Fairness, School Liking, Daily Relationships, Adult Care, and Conflict and Victimization, with evidence of measurement invariance across age and gender. Qualitative analyses revealed coherent thematic domains in children’s explanations, converging on personal relationships, school atmosphere, self-perception, and academic aspects, supporting the interpretability of children’s responses. Practice or Policy: The CV-SWB provides researchers and practitioners with an appropriate tool to assess school well-being from children’s perspectives from early schooling. By integrating quantitative ratings with children’s verbal explanations, the instrument facilitates a comprehensive and child-centered understanding of school experiences, informing early educational practices and policies promoting well-being and participation in preschool and elementary settings.",

          "abstract": "Social robots are increasingly integrated into everyday environments, yet effective human-robot interaction remains challenging as robots often fail to engage social cognition the same way human partners do. Here, we examined the degree to which physical features impact the degree to which robots are being perceived as agents ‘with a mind’. For that purpose, we took all robot stimuli currently contained in the Anthropomorphic Robot Database (ABOT; n = 251) and examined the degree to which they trigger mind perception (N = 300). Consistent with prior findings, robots were generally attributed more agency (capacity to act and plan) than experience (capacity to sense and feel). Body components significantly explained variance in the perception of agency, especially in interaction with facial features; for experience, on the other hand, variance was significantly explained by body components, face and surface details. Increasing human-likeness boosted perceptions of both dimensions, but the trajectories differed: experience followed a cubic function, plateauing at medium levels of human-likeness, while agency followed a quartic function with a dip around 75% human-likeness—a pattern resembling the un-canny valley. Our results indicate that in order to create specific levels of agency (e.g., for surgery robots) and experience (e.g., for companion robots), a general increase of human-likeness might not suffice; instead, targeted design of individual physical features is crucial for convey-ing specific mental capacities. Our ratings linking physical robot features to dimensions of mind perception are made available, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers to experimentally manipulate perceptions of agency and experience.",

Here, we studied how curriculum learning (the use of different training regimes) influences the way that mental (or ‘cognitive’) maps are formed. We investigated how the order in which people learned one-step transitions impacted their subsequent ability to perform multi-step inference using the cognitive maps they had formed. Participants learned one map with a curriculum that grouped information by rows and columns (‘grouped curriculum’) and another that selected transitions for training in a spatially disjoint way (‘disjoint curriculum’). Subsequent multi-step navigation was performed better after training using the disjoint curriculum. We hypothesise that learning under a grouped curriculum results in mental fragmentation of the learned maps, which impairs subsequent navigation across rows and columns. By contrast, learning one-step transitions in a pseudo-random order facilitates subsequent integration of learned information into a mental map to enable adaptive behaviour.",

In different conditions, the target, a distractor or neither of them could be physically salient. Targets at the high-reward location did not enhance search performance. In contrast, and contrary to our initial expectations, salient distractors at the high-reward location interfered less with the discrimination of the task-relevant targets, reflecting gating mechanisms at the high-reward location. Exploratory analyses showed that, across participants, the degree of target and salient distractor gating at the high-reward location correlated with each other.

Existing hypotheses on the development of narcissism have focused on familial and parental environments that act to make siblings in a family more alike. However, the relative importance of shared environments as opposed to other environmental and genetic sources is still unclear. Using a large extended twin family design, we found that parents’ and children’s narcissism scores were correlated, but this association was entirely genetically driven. Across age and measures, genetics and individual-specific environmental factors each explained 50% of the variance in narcissism and there was no evidence of environmental sources shared within families. This finding calls for a fundamental shift in the search for the origins of narcissism, including extra-familial environmental factors (e.g., educational and occupational pathways, experiences with peers, and romantic partners).",

In block one, participants were assessed on their baseline pain detection threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), and their conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses. In the second block, participants underwent the same procedures again but were randomly allocated to imagine the dominant leg cuff as being made of bubble-wrap (benign imagery condition; n = 36) or metal wire (threat imagery condition; n = 35). In between blocks, participants went to a separate room to interact with a piece of real bubble wrap or metal wire around their legs, facilitating mental imagery generation in Block 2. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, mental imagery impacted CPM effects for pain detection threshold (PDT), which was significantly reduced in the Wire relative to the Bubble-wrap condition. Mental imagery did not influence pressure pain tolerance (PPT). These results indicate that mental simulations of threat may reduce threshold-based conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses in healthy individuals.

We share their call to move beyond MI as a gatekeeper and to focus on the substantive relevance of non-invariance. However, we question whether correlating country-level scale scores with external indices separates construct-relevant factors from method biases. In a simulation calibrated to their empirical setting, we show that scalar non-invariance (threshold/intercept shift) (a) attenuates and destabilizes country-level correlations, (b) inflates correlations when bias aligns with the construct, and (c) suppresses associations when bias opposes it. We also outline a causal perspective on MI that treats non-invariance as theoretically informative and motivates explicit models of its causes. Using this causal view, we argue that adjusting for demographic covariates at the composite score level does not remedy item-level non-invariance.",

          "abstract": "Our capacity for attention is increasingly outpaced by the volume of information that is available through digital media, contributing to widespread concern that digital media use might compromise our ability to focus. We conducted a scoping review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies to map what the causal evidence on digital media and attention actually tests, investigating the study designs used (RQ1), the exposures, outcomes, and populations studied (RQ2), the operationalizations and theoretical frameworks employed (RQ3), the mediators and moderators assessed (RQ4), and points of convergence or divergence across studies. Across 94 papers (110 studies; Ntotal = 12,054), we found a heterogenous and diverging field. Most experiments assess immediate performance changes under additional stimulation (e.g., dual-task interference or device presence), whereas relatively few study sustained changes in attentional functioning. Many observed effects therefore reflect general multitasking costs rather than mechanisms unique to digital media. At the same time, different research traditions target different attentional components and implicitly test different mechanisms, making results difficult to integrate. Consequently, conclusions about digital media and attention depend strongly on how digital media use and attention are operationalized. Overall, we argue that the field has devoted limited attention to the central question motivating public concern: whether everyday digital media use produces enduring changes in attentional functioning. Progress will require a mechanism‑oriented, ecologically valid, and cumulative research that aligns theory, design, and temporal scope.",

In this review, I argue that episodic memory provides a powerful lens for understanding the functional organization of the default mode network (DMN). Recent research reveals that memory-related functions of the DMN are organized along at least two key dimensions— content and specificity. Distinct areas support memory for different types of content (e.g., object, spatial, and social information) and with varying levels of specificity (e.g., detailed episodes vs general schemas). Together, DMN pathways can support the diversity of episodic thought, imbuing multidimensional representations with subjective experience. By delineating how these pathways correspond with memory features, we can gain insight into how the DMN builds and updates internal narratives across cognitive domains.",

          "authors": "Sarah Cameron; Matt N Williams",
          "abstract": "Conspiracy mentality is theorised to be a broad predisposition comprising a conspiratorial worldview. While much is known about conspiracy mentality and unwarranted conspiracy belief, little is known about belief in warranted conspiracies and how it relates to conspiracy mentality. The present research addresses these gaps by examining how belief in warranted conspiracies relates to conspiracy mentality across two studies. Study 1 examined the relationship between conspiracy mentality and belief in warranted conspiracies. We also examined the fit of single and two-factor solutions for conspiracy mentality and warranted conspiracy items. In Study 1, 331 American residents recruited from Prolific first completed the warranted conspiracy belief measure, followed by the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire. Study 2 examined the relationship between conspiracy mentality, and both warranted and unwarranted conspiracies. As in Study 1, we tested the fit of a single and two-factor solution for conspiracy mentality items and warranted conspiracy items. In Study 2, 412 American residents were recruited from Prolific. They first completed the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, followed by either the General Conspiratorial Belief Scale or warranted conspiracy belief measure, depending on which of the two they were randomly assigned to complete first, followed by the other.  We found that although both relationships were strong and positive, conspiracy mentality was more strongly correlated with unwarranted conspiracy beliefs than with warranted conspiracy beliefs. Finally, in both studies, CFA revealed a single-factor solution was a poor fit for conspiracy mentality items and warranted conspiracy items, and that while a better fit, a two-factor solution was also poor. In contrast to the pejorative manner that high conspiracy belief is often portrayed in literature, our findings suggest that there may be value in having a high conspiracy mentality, in that those with higher conspiracy mentalities are more likely to be aware of warranted conspiracies. Furthermore, the poor fit of the one-factor solution extends prior research by showing that conspiracy mentality is distinct not only from unwarranted conspiracies but also from warranted conspiracies.",

          "abstract": "What determines whose welfare people consider in their moral decisions? We propose that people learn entity-specific moral weights through reinforcement learning (RL), where decision outcomes provide the learning signal. We formalize this in a computational model in which agents update their moral weights for different stakeholders based on whether considering those stakeholders’ welfare led to better- or worse-than-expected outcomes. To test this model, we simulate agents learning in market environments (which reward cooperation with strangers) versus non-market environments (which reward exploitation). We show that this mechanism is sufficient to explain two empirical phenomena linking market integration to prosociality: (1) cross-cultural variation in dictator game offers across small-scale societies, and (2) within-cultural variation in lost-letter return rates across 188 Italian municipalities. Together, our simulation results suggest that updating moral weights via RL may be an important mechanism of moral change at both the individual and the societal level.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Impulsivity and neural reward reactivity are considered important factors in the development and maintenance of substance use disorders (SUDs) and may be predictive of treatment response. However, relationships between treatment response, impulsivity, and reward reactivity are understudied in women with SUDs, where there may be unique clinical concerns such as higher incidences of trauma than men. Our study aimed to characterize relationships between neural responses to reward anticipation and changes in behavioral and clinical outcomes following treatment.\n\nDesign: Multimodal longitudinal, within-subjects study. Follow-up measurement took place one year after the start of a criminal diversion SUD treatment program.\n\nSetting: The study was conducted in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \n\nParticipants: Eighty-three adult women who completed a criminal diversion program that included comprehensive treatment for SUDs.\n\nMeasurement: The primary variable of interest was nucleus accumbens (NAc) reactivity to reward and loss anticipation during a monetary incentive delay (MID) task examined via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) early in treatment (baseline) and one year later (follow-up). Outcomes included measures of substance use severity, positive and negative urgency, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. \n\nFindings: At baseline, more severe substance use symptoms were associated with elevated NAc reward anticipation while greater PTSD symptoms were associated with lower NAc loss anticipation. Symptoms of PTSD, substance use, and urgency significantly decreased by one-year follow-up (η_p^2&gt;0.22). Increases in NAc reward anticipation over time were associated with lower urgency at follow-up, regardless of PTSD symptom levels (η_p^2&gt;0.03). Whole-brain analyses also showed that increased striatal reward anticipation over time was associated with lower positive urgency at follow-up. PTSD symptom severity moderated the relationship between changes in NAc loss anticipation and negative urgency.\n\nConclusions: Following a one-year SUDs treatment program , a sample of women showed lower impulsivity associated with increased striatal responses to reward anticipation. This suggests that NAc reactivity to anticipation of non-drug outcomes may offer a potential neural target for enhancing SUDs treatment outcomes for women, while loss-related reactivity may be particularly relevant in the presence of co-occurring PTSD.",

          "abstract": "Curiosity motivates the consumption of new information and facilitates memory for information encountered. Given the prevalent strategy of using social media metrics to boost engagement with new information, this paper examined whether social value norms can change curiosity and memory. Consistent with previous work, higher than usual levels of curiosity during information exposure was associated with better memory, such that people were more likely to remember the information when they reported higher than usual levels of curiosity. Across the three studies, high social value norms had weak or inconsistent effects on curiosity, while low social value norms consistently decreased curiosity. Surprisingly, low social value norms boosted memory, an effect that was observed across two of the three studies, indicating a role for low social norms to impact memory beyond their effects on curiosity. Together, these studies advance understanding of how social value norms shape information processing and memory, and reveal that low social value norms can influence memory for information in ways that are not fully explained by their effects on curiosity.",

Using four annual waves of longitudinal survey data from Australia (2021–2024; N = 2,778), we examined whether everyday climate actions predict collective action and policy support, and whether climate change risk perception, efficacy beliefs, and personal norms moderate these associations. Multilevel models showed that individual actions were consistently associated with greater collective engagement and stronger policy support within the same year. Moderation analyses indicated that individual actions more strongly predicted collective engagement among individuals higher in risk perception, efficacy, and personal norm. In contrast, the association with policy support weakened slightly at higher levels of these moderators. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models provided little evidence of systematic spillover across years, indicating that within-person changes in individual actions did not reliably predict subsequent changes in collective action or policy support. Overall, the findings challenged the crowding-out effect and suggested that increases in individual action do not undermine broader forms of climate engagement.",

          "abstract": "Physiological synchrony—mutual changes physiological activity between individuals—has become one of the most frequently studied yet variably-interpreted constructs in psychological science. Decades of research show that physiological synchrony is ubiquitous across relationship and social contexts, but consensus remains elusive about what it means psychologically. We advance an inferential framework for mapping observed synchrony to warranted psychological conclusions by importing classical principles of psychophysiological inference into the interpersonal domain. Building on Cacioppo and Tassinary’s (1990) logic of inference, we treat physiological synchrony as an empirical pattern whose meaning depends on three constraints: specificity (which psychological processes remain plausible given the physiological pattern and plausible alternatives), generality (the contexts, relationships, and timescales over which an interpretation should hold), and sensitivity (detectability of the theoretically relevant dynamics given measurement and modeling choices). We ground these constraints in principles of autonomic organization, emphasizing how physiological ambiguity and modes of control shape what synchrony can and cannot mean, and we use the Biopsychosocial Model of Challenge and Threat as a worked exemplar of how theory-specified multivariate profiles and motivational context strengthen inference. We further argue that model class is an inferential commitment: choices about sampling rate, observation window, preprocessing, and whether coupling is modeled as contemporaneous, lagged, or dynamical determine which forms of coordination are detectable and which interpersonal processes remain viable candidates for interpretation. By integrating contemporary synchrony approaches within this inferential framework, we provide conceptual and methodological guidance for clarifying when physiological synchrony supports strong psychological inference and for specifying the boundary conditions under which those interpretations should generalize.",

          "abstract": "Auditory feedback plays a critical role in developing and maintaining fluent speech. Although children are theorized to rely heavily on their auditory feedback, previous experimental studies are inconsistent, suggesting that additional factors may be at play. This study examines the role of individual differences in attention and sensory processing abilities on auditory feedback control of speech in children. To this end, 53 children ages 4-11 completed a frequency altered feedback (FAF) task where the pitch of their auditory feedback was manipulated and responses to the manipulation were measured to provide an index of the child’s reliance on their auditory feedback. To measure attention and sensory processing abilities, children completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART), and their parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) parent-report, respectively. Overall SSP scores, and scores in auditory, tactile, and sensory seeking domains were found to be associated with larger compensatory responses to FAF, while poorer SART performance was associated with slower vocal responses to down shifts. These results suggest that for children, greater sensory processing differences may promote increased reliance on auditory feedback for speech motor control, while attentional differences may be more important in the temporal processing of FAF.",

          "abstract": "Beat perception—the ability to extract a regular pulse from rhythmic sequences—is a foundational component of human musicality and a key mechanism supporting synchronization, dance, and collective music-making. Research across neuroscience, developmental psychology, and comparative cognition demonstrates that beat processing exhibits four defining characteristics: it is near-universal across human cultures, emerges spontaneously in early development, engages domain-specific predictive timing mechanisms, and appears largely species-specific. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that newborns, and even late-gestation fetuses, respond to rhythmic regularities using predictive neural processes that cannot be explained by simple interval timing or statistical learning alone. Across infancy and childhood, these early predispositions are progressively refined through auditory experience, motor development, and musical enculturation, ultimately supporting the flexible, hierarchical beat-based timing seen in adults. Comparative studies reveal that while non-human primates and other species can detect isochrony or local temporal violations, they typically fail to induce a beat, highlighting a dissociation between evolutionarily conserved timing abilities and the specialized predictive mechanisms characteristic of humans. Together, findings from phylogeny and ontogeny suggest that beat perception reflects an early-emerging, biologically prepared capacity that is further shaped by experience. Understanding its developmental and evolutionary bases offers crucial insight into the origins of human musicality and the neural architecture supporting temporal prediction.",

In small samples, however, these approaches may yield unstable estimates due to insufficient information in the likelihood, unless strong prior distributions are imposed. We address this problem by turning to the fundamentals of estimation via decision theory, showing that small-sample estimation can be viewed as an ill-posed decision problem in the sense that the decision function is sensitive to small changes in the data and, therefore, may not be continuous. We discuss how such ill-posed decision problems—both in IRT estimation and more broadly—can be regularized using neural network (NN)-based approaches that build a continuous map from observations into parameters. We formalize this approach within a general framework termed regularized decision theory and apply it to IRT models. Focusing on the 3PL, we study its properties via simulations.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, defined as a reduced capacity for pleasure or motivation for reward, is a core transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology and a key determinant of social functioning. Cognitive dysfunction, particularly verbal memory impairment, may contribute to anhedonia by reducing anticipatory pleasure, in turn decreasing social functioning. This study examined whether anhedonia mediates the relationship between verbal memory and social functioning in a large, population-based sample, and whether this pathway varies by sex, lifetime psychiatric history, or transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. Participants (N=8,576) were drawn from the UK Biobank. Verbal memory was assessed using the Paired Associate Learning test, anhedonia by frequency of disinterest/little pleasure, and social functioning by frequency of social visits. Participants with and without lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were matched on age, sex, and Townsend Deprivation Index. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses tested indirect effects of verbal memory on social functioning through anhedonia and the role of sex, lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, and Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) symptom dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, psychosis). Anhedonia significantly mediated the association between verbal memory and social functioning (a1 × b1 = 0.0024, 95% CI [0.0012, 0.0036], p &lt; 0.001), whereas the alternative model (verbal memory as moderator) was not significant. The mediation was stronger among males, individuals with psychiatric diagnoses, and those with internalizing symptoms. Findings support a transdiagnostic cognitive-symptom-function pathway linking verbal memory deficits to poorer social functioning through anhedonia. These results highlight memory-focused cognitive interventions as potential targets to enhance motivation and social outcomes across dimensional and transdiagnostic contexts.",

A total of 571 students completed validated measures of scientific reasoning, neuromyth endorsement, perceptions of science, critical thinking disposition, and epistemic orientation. Descriptive analyses revealed notable gaps in methodological understanding and a high prevalence of neuromyths. Participants correctly answered an average of 4.69 out of 11 scientific reasoning items and endorsed an average of 7.70 out of 12 neuromyths. The base regression model, including demographic and academic variables, was statistically significant but explained limited variance in correct beliefs about the brain. When epistemic orientations, critical thinking, and perceptions of science were added, overall predictive power increased. Scientific reasoning was the strongest positive predictor of accurate knowledge, whereas the belief that science is heretical was a negative predictor of accuracy, indicating greater susceptibility to neuromyths. Academic performance, which was significant in the base model, became nonsignificant when cognitive and epistemic variables were included, suggesting that its relationship is accounted for by more proximal factors.",

          "abstract": "Verbal fluency research has revealed much about how people search semantic memory, yet most studies use well-defined taxonomic categories (e.g., \"animals\") and rarely examine how retrieval changes when categories lack clear boundaries or shared features. In the present study, participants (N = 266) completed a verbal fluency battery based on Category Coherence Theory, spanning taxonomic, thematic (e.g., \"items at a party\"), goal-derived (e.g., \"things to save in a fire\"), and relational prompts (e.g., \"barriers\"). Because flexible semantic retrieval has been linked to creativity, we measured divergent thinking to test whether it shapes retrieval across category types, controlling for intelligence. Beyond fluency counts, we computed semantic search metrics using embedding-based approaches capturing local progression (forward flow), global semantic spread (divergent semantic integration), atypicality, and information-theoretic uncertainty (entropy). We found that category structure robustly predicted every metric. Fluency decreased monotonically as category coherence decreased (Taxonomic &gt; Thematic &gt; Goal-derived &gt; Relational), reflecting easier access to exemplars when category boundaries are clear. In contrast, other semantic search metrics peaked for intermediate-coherence prompts (thematic/goal-derived), suggesting that some constraint supports semantic exploration, but too much or too little hinders it. Divergent thinking predicted higher scores across all metrics, but it only interacted with category structure when fluency was controlled, suggesting creative individuals show richer retrieval when category coherence provides limited guidance. These findings demonstrate that semantic retrieval reflects both stable individual differences and category-imposed constraints, and that embedding- and information-theoretic metrics offer useful tools for characterizing semantic search across fluency contexts.",

Research shows that forming context-specific implementation intentions improves goal attainment relative to more general goal intentions. However, existing theoretical accounts remain largely descriptive and lack mechanistic precision. We introduce a computational framework that formalises intention formation as prospective decision-making. Here, an intention’s effectiveness emerges from the interaction of three components: (1) the subjective value of the goal, (2) the context-specificity of the intended action, and (3) metacognitive regulation of goal pursuit. This framework explains when and why different intention strategies succeed or fail and yields normative predictions about optimal intention formation across motivational and environmental conditions. By integrating social, motivational, metacognitive, and computational levels of analysis, the proposed framework unifies decades of social psychology research on self-regulation and advances formal accounts of long-term planning.",

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models.

To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered.

Across both data sets, all data modalities showed differential response to the US compared to US omission. In data set 1, there was evidence for responses to unexpected US omission in all modalities, but no responses were consistent with signed PE encoding. Similarly, data set 2 provided no evidence that US or US omission responses scaled with outcome probability, which is incompatible with PE encoding. In conclusion, all recorded psychophysiological signals responded strongly to US and less strongly to unexpected US omission, with no evidence of a signed prediction error encoding.",

          "authors": "Maugan Russell Lloyd; Scott Moffat",
          "abstract": "Navigation difficulties in older adults are well-documented and declining wayfinding abilities serve as an early indicator of cognitive impairment. Such deficits can reduce mobility, restrict life space, and predict both nursing home admission and mortality. A major factor underlying this performance decline is the tendency for some older adults to rely on egocentric (self-referential) navigation strategies rather than allocentric (external) spatial representations. However, it is unclear whether this reflects reduced ability to engage in allocentric processing or an avoidance of allocentric strategies for other reasons. Metacognitive monitoring plays a central role in strategy selection, yet its influence on navigation remains chronically underexplored. While older adults can effectively assess their memory performance in associative memory tasks, evidence is less clear for their ability to monitor visuospatial memory. Low confidence in memory abilities has been shown to lead older adults to use less cognitively demanding strategies, which may parallel their preference for egocentric navigation. Navigation research has uncovered strategy clusters: some individuals integrate spatial information into a cognitive survey representation, others tend to default to egocentric navigation, and some struggle with all strategies. Older adults may cautiously adhere to the safer, known route following costly mistakes: that this may be the less cognitively demanding strategy does not show lesser cognitive abilities. This review examines metacognition in navigation in older adults, drawing from non-navigation findings, addresses the role of metacognitive monitoring in navigation strategy selection, and explores the implications for interventions to improve spatial cognition in aging.",

Older adults and Republicans remained more likely to encounter such sites, though gaps narrowed, and Twitter/X’s role as a referrer increased.

          "authors": "Jeanne Brown; Meghan Clayards",
          "abstract": "Creaky voice has historically been associated with men's speech, supported by acoustic studies. Since around 2010, sociolinguistic work alongside public discourse has perpetuated greater creaky voice use by women instead, typically implementing impressionistic coding. This study investigates whether this recent shift can be attributed to perceptual social and acoustic biases related to (perceived) speaker gender and pitch (f0), respectively. Using a matched-guise paradigm, 40 Canadian English listeners rated the perceived creakiness of the same modal and creaky voices—altered to have ambiguously gendered formants and median f0s (115, 135, 155 Hz)—paired with female and male faces. Bayesian regression analyses revealed strong effects of voice quality and moderate effects of f0: creaky and lower-f0 stimuli were rated as creakier. No overall effect of face gender was found. However, a weak interaction between face gender and f0 suggests a possible gender prototypicality bias: at lower f0s, female faces were rated as slightly creakier than male faces and at higher f0s, male faces were rated creakier than female faces. These findings show that neither acoustic nor gender-based biases alone can account for widespread reports of women-led creaky voice use. Several possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Biased information processing plays an important role in mental disorders. This study investigates choice biases in value-based decision making and how links to psychological resilience can be accounted for by individual differences in cognitive and neural processing of reward and punishment signals. In a cost-benefit integration task, 82 participants (41 female, 41 male human subjects) weighed gains and losses associated with different features (color, shape) of compound visual stimuli. A positive choice bias in decision making was associated with trait acceptance as a facet of self-reported resilience – and this association was mediated by differences in the neural processing of value information as measured with fMRI: Participants with a more positive choice bias and higher trait acceptance showed stronger increases in neural activity in response to negative information (loss) in ten prefrontal and parietal brain regions – and stronger decreases in response to positive information (gain) in the right inferior frontal junction. Cognitive-computational modeling revealed that more positive choice biases were associated with lower sensitivity to and valuation of negative relative to positive information. Notably, higher valuation of positive information was associated with stronger neural responses to negative information in dACC and insula. Finally, choice bias and trait acceptance were associated with functional connectivity between prefrontal seeds, midbrain, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The stronger activation of brain regions associated with cognitive control, specifically in response to negative information, may reflect a stronger regulatory influence on the processing of negative information, potentially promoting a positive choice bias that supports resilience.",

One proposed bias—the age-based imitation bias—suggests that children preferentially imitate adults over peers because adults are presumed to have greater instrumental and conventional competence. Although supported by studies with young children from the post-industrialized west, this bias has not been examined across broader developmental ranges or diverse cultural contexts. Therefore, here we investigated adult versus peer imitation in 369 children aged 3–17 years from four communities: Congolese BaYaka, Congolese Bandongo, Scots, and Chinese Americans. Across instrumental and conventional tasks, we found no evidence that children preferentially imitated adults over peers. These findings suggest that, in the absence of contextual cues such as knowledge, expertise, or group membership, model age alone does not reliably shape children’s imitation, calling into question the primacy of adults in knowledge transmission.",

          "authors": "Joscha Dutli; Klaus Oberauer; Lea M. Bartsch",
          "abstract": "The semantic elaboration effect refers to the finding that semantic processing of words leads to better memory performance when the words are semantically congruent with the orienting questions with which they are studied. In Experiment 1, we were unable to observe the congruency effect that motivated the concept of elaboration. We ran a series of follow-up experiments (Exp. 2–5) that revealed a consistent pattern across test formats: We found robust congruency effects in recognition tests, but not in free recall. This result can be explained by the hypothesis that elaboration improves memory by establishing effective retrieval cues, and elaboration is effective only inasmuch as these retrieval cues are available at test. To investigate the retrieval-cue hypothesis further, we asked whether participants are able to freely recall the orienting questions as retrieval cues in Experiment 6. Recall of these questions was poor, providing a potential explanation for absent congruency effects in free recall. We formalized the retrieval-cue hypothesis in a computational model, applied it to Experiments 1–5, and found that the model can account for the congruency effects we observed. In Experiment 7, we directly tested the model’s prediction that the size of the congruency effect is determined by the probability of recalling the orienting questions as cues by letting one group of participants learn the orienting questions before the experiment. We found a larger congruency effect in this group compared to a control group that did not learn the orienting questions, further supporting the retrieval-cue hypothesis of elaboration.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose. Recent work in motor neuroscience suggests that well-learned actions are implemented as stable, stereotyped trajectories in neural state space. The purpose of this article is to propose a theory of stuttering that formalizes this idea for speech production and identifies a specific neural impairment underlying speech dysfluency.\nMethod. We advance a conceptual and computational framework in which the motor program for a familiar word corresponds to a stable neural trajectory with an associated basin of attraction. We integrate findings from primate motor control, human speech neuroscience, and basal ganglia physiology to specify the role of cortico–basal ganglia–thalamo–cortical (BGTC) circuits in initiating these trajectories.\nResults. We propose that fluent speech depends on the ability of the BGTC circuit to initialize the distributed speech motor network within the basin of attraction of the upcoming word’s motor program. Stuttering arises when this initialization process is unreliable or poorly coordinated, preventing the motor program from being executed until the neural state is corrected or the effective basin of attraction is broadened through compensatory mechanisms.\nConclusions. This basin-of-attraction framework provides a unifying account of diverse behavioral and neural findings in stuttering, aligns stuttering theory with contemporary dynamical systems approaches to motor control, and generates testable predictions for future neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies.",

          "abstract": "Uncertainty is a defining challenge in forecasting individual longitudinal data, yet existing methods address only fragments of the amount of uncertainty that accumulates across the forecasting pipeline. This paper offers a methodological synthesis that delineates the full set of components relevant to uncertainty in longitudinal psychological data and examines how major forecasting uncertainty frameworks, such as Bayesian and probabilistic models, resampling methods, conformal prediction, or quantile-based approaches, capture the underlying forecasting uncertainty. Using an illustrative forecasting pipeline, we show that so far, no existing framework provides comprehensive coverage, and that their strengths are fundamentally complementary. Our findings suggest that the most promising paradigm for quantifying forecast uncertainty in such pipelines is a Bayesian approach, in which multiple sources of uncertainty can be jointly propagated and coherently integrated into a unified posterior predictive distribution. Building on this analysis, we derive principled recommendations for constructing uncertainty-aware forecasting pipelines and identify methodological gaps that require targeted innovation, including unified frameworks that propagate all major uncertainty sources, improved handling of dependence and non-stationarity, and hybrid approaches. This synthesis establishes a foundation for advancing uncertainty quantification in longitudinal forecasting and for developing next-generation methods tailored to psychological time-series.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the development of primary school children’s error-related adjustments in reading and arithmetic. N = 622 children from 2nd and 4th grade were tested on two tablet-based academic tasks twice in six months: an arithmetic task composed of addition and doubling items with two answer options and a silent word reading task matching words with four pictorial answer options. Children in both grades showed robust post-error slowing (PES) in both reading and arithmetic, indicating reliable monitoring and strategy use in the form of upregulating cognitive control mechanisms. Overall, post-error slowing was larger in arithmetic than in reading, independent of grade and measurement point. Fourth graders showed larger PES than 2nd graders, especially at T1, and both grades’ PES increased from T1 to T2, suggesting that task experience, improving monitoring skills, and strategy discovery play an important role. In terms of the benefits of PES for performance accuracy, PES was linked to better accuracy after the error in the arithmetic task, particularly for younger children. This was not the case for reading. Results are discussed in terms of often overlooked educationally relevant strategies in arithmetic, possible strategy’s utilization deficiency, developing monitoring and cognitive control skills in this age range and differing processing demands across academic domains.",

We conducted a randomized field experiment with 269 Danish adolescents aged 13–17 years to test whether reintroducing decision points at moments of access can disrupt habitual social media use and reduce unintentional, habit-driven engagement. Participants’ smartphone activity was continuously logged across six weeks, yielding more than 1.2 million recorded interactions. After two weeks, participants were randomly assigned to one of three interventions delivered at app entry: reflection prompts, usage planning, or brief waiting delays.\n\nCompared with baseline, planning and waiting interventions reduced total daily social media use by 33.8\\% and 38.0\\%, respectively, whereas reflection alone produced no significant change. These reductions were driven primarily by changes at the point of access: adolescents attempted to open social media apps less frequently and, when prompted, were substantially more likely to abandon an access attempt before the app opened. When access did occur, engagement was consolidated into fewer but longer sessions, consistent with a shift away from frequent, automatic checking toward more deliberate use. Across all conditions, reduced use was not accompanied by declines in self-reported well-being, satisfaction, or social connectedness.\n\nTogether, these results demonstrate that introducing brief, autonomy-preserving decision points at app entry can reduce adolescents’ daily social media use by more than one-third, highlighting access-based frictions as a powerful and scalable lever for addressing habitual digital behavior.",

Using a spatially correlated bandit paradigm and computational modeling, we examined how humans adapt their search strategy across two environments optimized for different levels of generalization. Across three experiments, participants showed more generalization and more random exploration in environments with stronger spatial correlations. Moreover, they meta-learned to associate different degrees of generalization with different environmental cues.

In Great Britain, national monitoring has relied largely on risk-based measures such as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), limiting the ability to benchmark gambling harms against other health conditions. This study estimates impacts of gambling-related harm on health utility and capability using established health-economic methods.\n\nMethods\nWe analysed cross-sectional survey data from people who gamble (n=2,335) and affected others (n=2,306) in Great Britain. Gambling harm was measured using Gambling Harms Severity Index (GHSI-10; GHSI-AO-10 for affected others) and PGSI. Outcomes were health utility (SF-6D) and capability wellbeing (ICECAP-A). Indirect elicitation was implemented using propensity-weighted regression models, adjusting for demographic/behavioural covariates. Population burden was estimated by scaling observed decrements with national prevalence data.\n\nFindings\nIncreasing gambling harm was associated with significant, clinically meaningful decrements in health utility and capability. Severe harm (≥15) was associated with reductions of 31·7% (SF-6D) and 35·0% (ICECAP-A) – impacts similar in magnitude to long term conditions and substance related harms. Notably, affected others experienced impacts of a similarly substantial magnitude. At population level, substantive burden is driven by low- and moderate-severity harms, due to their greater prevalence.\n\nInterpretation\nGambling harm constitutes a population-level health burden with substantial impacts on affected others, who remain largely invisible to risk-based surveillance. When quantified using health-economic metrics, gambling harms warrant consideration alongside long-term conditions and other major public-health harms for prevention, commissioning, and resource-allocation decisions.",

          "abstract": "Across four studies (N = 1,300), we examined how social dominance orientation (SDO) relates to perceptions of gender discrimination in organizations. We propose a discrepancy account: discrimination judgments reflect perceived gaps between prescriptive and descriptive fairness norms, and higher SDO is associated with perceiving smaller gaps and thus lower discrimination perceptions. In Studies 1a and 1b, higher SDO was linked to lower perceived discrimination. Study 2 replicated this pattern and showed that, in hierarchical organizations, higher SDO corresponded to higher perceived descriptive fairness, which in turn related to lower discrimination perceptions. In Study 3, discrepancies across procedural and distributive norms fully mediated the SDO–discrimination association, with effects driven mainly by distributive norm discrepancies. The total indirect effect was larger in hierarchical than egalitarian contexts and remained when controlling for status-legitimizing beliefs. Together, these studies offer evidence for a novel mechanism underlying discrimination perceptions and implications for diversity initiatives.",

When judging the socialness of words, dyads showed a processing advantage for abstract social words that was absent in individual performance. In contrast, when judging the concreteness of words, dyads were less accurate for abstract social words than individuals, confirming that social interaction renders these words more concrete. Dividing the dyads by their level of social engagement based on mutual gaze patterns, revealed that the effects were driven by the more cooperative dyads. The findings demonstrate that language processing differs fundamentally between interactive and isolated contexts, where social interaction and engagement dynamically shape the interpretation of abstract concepts.",

          "abstract": "In the presence of pain, performance during imposed workload motor tasks may be maintained at the cost of a higher perceived effort (PE). This study investigated how experimentally induced thermal pain and naturally occurring muscle pain influence force production during a fixed PE task. Forty young adults performed intermittent isometric handgrip contractions at light (13/100) or hard (50/100) PE intensities across two visits. Each visit included an experimental condition, featuring thermal pain in block 1, and a control condition, with non-painful warm stimulation in block 2. Participants completed 10 blocks (five repetitions of block 1 and block 2), with force production and muscle electromyography continuously recorded. Participants rated thermal and muscle pain after each block. Force production was higher during thermal pain compared to control, with no interaction with PE intensity. Regression analysis showed that each one-unit increase in muscle pain (0–100 scale) corresponded to a reduction in peak force (0.37N), mean force (0.25N), and force integral (0.80N·s). During a fixed perceived effort task, thermal pain prompts an increase in force production, possibly reflecting attentional mechanisms related to exercise-induced hypoalgesia. In contrast, muscle pain is associated with reduced force output, likely because more force would perpetuate more muscle pain. Therefore, the type of pain has a varied effect on force production during voluntary motor tasks. This study questions the well-accepted inhibitory effect of pain on force production and encourages future research to use fixed PE tasks to fully appraise the effects of different type of pain on force production.",

          "authors": "Jens Dietrichson; Roopali Bhatnagar; Trine Filges; Mikkel Helding Vembye",
          "abstract": "The effects of preschool and school interventions typically fade out over time. To assess the implications of such fade-out for returns to interventions and for skill development theories, it is essential to know the mechanisms underlying fade-out. In this study, we reviewed and catego-rized potential fade-out mechanisms and developed testable hypotheses about the distribution of intervention effect sizes. We then evaluated the hypotheses using meta-analysis and data from 42 studies and 677 effect sizes examining the effects of school interventions targeting at-risk students on standardized tests in mathematics and reading. Our findings show that mecha-nisms linked to challenges of measuring and estimating effect sizes explain only a small part of fade-out. Fade-out appears to be a genuine phenomenon reflecting real changes in the skills of the intervention participants. Among skill-based mechanisms, we found evidence against the treatment group forgetting the skills they acquired in the intervention. We found the most sup-port for mechanisms predicting that the treatment group’s skills would grow, but more slowly than those of the control group after the intervention. The two most plausible mechanisms ex-plain the slower growth by the treatment group’s inability to build on the skills acquired during the intervention, and by negative side effects on parental and school investments for the treat-ment group. Because these mechanisms have different implications for the returns to interven-tions and for theories of skill development, future research should aim to distinguish their con-tributions to fade-out. We conclude by discussing study designs that can achieve this goal.",

          "abstract": "Accurately predicting the outcome of future events improves decisions in domains ranging from health to finance, yet prediction errors are common. One reliable way to improve accuracy is to engage with disagreeing views through dialogue, which can reveal weak assumptions and facilitate belief revision. However, people often avoid disagreeing exchanges because they are socially and emotionally costly or inconvenient to seek out. Here, we examine whether a disagreeing large language model (LLM) can provide the benefits of disagreement while sidestepping these interpersonal barriers. Across two experiments (total N = 807 adults making 4,564 predictions; Experiment 2 was incentivized and preregistered), participants: i) predicted the likelihood of various events, ii) discussed each prediction with an LLM by articulating their reasoning, and iii) submitted final predictions. Crucially, we manipulated the LLM’s stance during these discussions: it responded either supportively (agreeing) or critically (disagreeing) to participants’ reasoning. The results showed that, when initial predictions were erroneous, conversing with a disagreeing LLM produced more accurate final predictions than conversing with a supportive one. This advantage was primarily driven by directionally correct revisions, with participants shifting their final predictions more often toward the realized outcome. However, interacting with an LLM was not uniformly beneficial as it decreased accuracy when initial predictions were already accurate. These findings underscore the value of designing LLMs that challenge rather than affirm users’ views and opinions, while highlighting the importance of tailoring their responses to the expected accuracy of initial predictions.",

          "abstract": "Adaptively regulating achievement motivation and achievement emotions is critical for students in navigating their academic lives. Traditionally, motivational (MR) and emotional self-regulation (ER) have been studied in isolation from one another, and they both belong to separate research traditions within educational psychology. Given the conceptual as well as functional connections among motivation and emotions, however, it is likely that regulatory processes targeting these constructs are closely interwoven as well. Building on contemporary models in educational psychology and related disciplines, we propose a process-oriented model for conceptualizing and studying MR and ER as interwoven rather than isolated components of students’ self-regulated learning. The model centers on students’ interpretations of their motivational versus emotional regulatory needs as well as their adoption of regulatory goals as pivotal determinants of their subsequent selection, implementation, and monitoring of self-regulatory strategies. In integrating prior theorizing and empirical research from both MR and ER literatures, we identify potential intersections and conflicts among motivational and emotional components of students’ self-regulation in academic settings. Furthermore, we propose key questions for future research generated from our model, and outline avenues and challenges on the way towards integrative approaches to studying MR and ER from methodological, collaborative research, and practical perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Survey data are widely used to estimate the prevalence of belief in conspiracy theories and to test hypotheses about the correlates, causes, and consequences of these beliefs. However, concerns have been raised about how often endorsement of conspiracy theories reflects sincere belief. We examined sincerity in a survey of 1,044 Australians and found that endorsement of six pre-existing conspiracy theories was not rare, ranging from 10% to 19%, and that 7% endorsed two that were clearly contradictory. However, 10% of participants endorsed a novel and highly bizarre raccoon army conspiracy theory that we invented, almost certainly insincerity, and endorsement of this conspiracy theory was a strong predictor of endorsing pre-existing conspiracy theories, including the two contradictory ones. Moreover, 13% of participants reported that they had responded insincerely during the study, which was also a strong predictor of endorsing pre-existing conspiracy theories. Overall, our results suggest that anonymous online surveys can produce inflated estimates of the prevalence of belief in conspiracy theories, which raises serious questions about how studies of “belief in” conspiracy theories – and misinformation more broadly – have been interpreted.",

To our knowledge, this scoping review represents the first systematic mapping of chatbot architecture, delivery modalities, user experience (UX) outcomes, and risk mitigation strategies in purpose-built chatbot interventions. \nA systematic search of seven databases identified 1899 articles, from which 21 studies across 11 countries were included. Most interventions were early-stage, cognitive behavioural therapy-based, and delivered through non-embodied chatbots. Target conditions included depression, anxiety, dementia, eating disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. UX outcomes indicated moderate-to-high usability, therapeutic alliance, and user satisfaction, driven by convenience, personalization, and perceived empathy. However, engagement commonly declined, attributed to trust concerns and limited interactivity. Risk mitigation strategies incorporated technical controls, most frequently fine-tuning and prompt engineering, followed by risk classifiers and content filters, retrieval-augmented generation, and rules-based hybrid integrations. These safeguards were often implemented alongside human oversight, data security measures, and crisis referral pathways. Adverse event monitoring was rare, but some studies documented missed crisis cues and inaccurate content. \nFuture research is needed to evaluate efficacy, standardize safety and UX outcome measurement, and develop layered safeguards to enable integration into stepped or blended care.",

Participants learned a virtual environment through disparate routes and then made relative and absolute distance judgments, generated novel shortcuts, and drew a map of the environment to assess their knowledge of the spatial locations of each object. Both relative and absolute distance judgments demonstrated systematic biases based on the distance and learned connectivity between objects. The shortcut and map-drawing tasks revealed substantial individual differences, indicating that some participants could accurately integrate spatial knowledge across different routes. Altogether, our results support the labeled graph hypothesis and highlight considerable individual variability across spatial navigation tasks.",

This lack of diversity and representativeness of participants compromises the generalizability of psychological science. To address this issue, large-scale international collaborative projects have been initiated, and more data have been collected from non-WEIRD regions. However, it is unknown whether participants from non-WEIRD regions can represent their local population. In this preregistered report, we depicted the demographic profile of Chinese participants reported in 1, 000 empirical studies (n = 554, 794) published in five mainstream Chinese psychological journals and in 27 large-scale international collaborative projects (n = 29, 006, accounting for 2.12% of all participants). We found that age and sex were the most reported demographic variables, and other aspects of participants were less reported. The available demographic information revealed that Chinese participants were not representative of the population: most were young and well-educated people from east coast provinces (with the exception of Hubei province, which is located in central China). The demographic profile of Chinese participants in psychology is similar to their counterparts in many other countries and regions, suggesting the globalization of young and highly educated participants in psychological science. Together, our findings indicate that problems of representativeness are deeply entrenched in global psychological science and require coordinated cross-sector efforts.",

Results showed a benefit of supervision across species, which was particularly strong in learning the sparse categories. Moreover, both species benefitted from category structures that had multiple category-relevant dimensions (i.e., dense categories). In addition, human adults, who have a more advanced ability to attend selectively, showed faster learning and better generalization overall. Finally, attention was optimized to the category-relevant dimension in the sparse category only in human adults.

          "authors": "Owen W. Friend; Thanujeni Pathman; Alison Preston",
          "abstract": "Time is a central dimension of episodic memory which allows us to remember not only what happened and where from past events, but also when those events occurred and how they relate to one another. Adults can form hierarchical knowledge derived from episodic experience that includes precise timing details about individual events and information about temporal patterns that encode regularities across experiences, alongside factual knowledge about time (e.g., the months of the year). Young children’s temporal memory is more constrained, lacking both the level of local detail and limited global knowledge relative to adult temporal representation. Despite behavioral evidence for such developmental differences in temporal memory, we lack a unified model that explains how local and global temporal representation abilities emerge, interact, and are organized across development. Here, we propose a three-stage neurocognitive framework for the hierarchical development of temporal memory, resulting from increasing representational capacity across the hippocampal–frontoparietal memory system. Reviewing behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, we propose that: 1) young children’s temporal memory is initially local and event-specific due to functional immaturity of hippocampus;  2) older children and adolescents form and reinstate global knowledge of temporal regularities resulting from enhanced interactions between hippocampus and lateral frontoparietal cortex; and 3) adults flexibly deploy hierarchical knowledge of local details and generalities in new environments mediated by hippocampus and medial frontoparietal cortex interactions. This framework thus provides a unified, empirically-grounded model of temporal memory development, supporting increasingly complex temporal representations that enable adaptive behaviors at a variety of temporal resolutions.",

A total of 571 students completed validated measures of scientific reasoning, neuromyth endorsement, perceptions of science, critical thinking disposition, and epistemic orientation. Descriptive analyses revealed notable gaps in methodological understanding and a high prevalence of neuromyths. Participants correctly answered an average of 4.69 out of 11 scientific reasoning items and endorsed an average of 7.70 out of 12 neuromyths. The base regression model, including demographic and academic variables, was statistically significant but explained limited variance in correct beliefs about the brain. When epistemic orientations, critical thinking, and perceptions of science were added, overall predictive power increased. Scientific reasoning was the strongest positive predictor of accurate knowledge, whereas the belief that science is heretical was a negative predictor of accuracy, indicating greater susceptibility to neuromyths. Academic performance, which was significant in the base model, became nonsignificant when cognitive and epistemic variables were included, suggesting that its relationship is accounted for by more proximal factors.",

However, longitudinal studies on detailed residential greenspace and dementia incidence are yet limited, which this study examines, along with potential modifying effects of air pollution, road traffic noise, blue space, age, sex, and genetic risk profile in terms of carrying the APOE ε4 allele. \nMethods: Data were collected in the Swedish National Study of Aging and Care Kungsholmen and included 2993 dementia-free participants (mean age 73.1 years [±10.4 SD]) followed-up for 16 years, during which 477 (16%) developed clinically diagnosed dementia. Residential greenspace was assessed using satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within 100m, 250m, and 500m buffers. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of dementia incidence per interquartile range (IQR) increase in greenspace were estimated using Cox regression. Effect modifications of air pollution, blue space access, road traffic noise, age, sex and APOE-ε4 were tested through interaction terms (evaluated at p&lt;0.1).\nResults: Per IQR (=0.18) increment in greenspace within a 100m buffer zone was associated with around 20% reduced hazard of dementia (HR 0.79 [CI 0.64, 0.96]). Associations were attenuated and statistically nonsignificant for larger buffers. The beneficial effect of greenspace on dementia incidence was stronger among female (HR 0.69 [CI 0.54, 0.89], p interaction=0.082) than male participants (HR 0.93 [CI 0.71, 1.24]).

Mystical-type experiences during dosing sessions have been shown to predict the clinical effects of psilocybin treatment in depression, anxiety, and addiction. However, no studies have examined whether acute subjective experiences predict treatment response in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). \n\nMethods: Exploratory analyses were conducted using data from participants with treatment-resistant OCD who received psilocybin as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and subsequent open-label phase. Twenty-seven participants who received psilocybin (0.25 mg/kg) completed the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) and Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) the day following their session. OCD severity was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline and at 1- and 12-week follow-up.\n\nResults: Greater mystical-type experiences during psilocybin were associated with lower OCD symptom severity at 1- and 12-week follow-up, even after controlling for baseline OCD symptom severity and treatment condition. The Mystical subscale demonstrated the strongest and most consistent associations at both time points, while the Space–Time subscale was only associated with lower Y-BOCS at 12 weeks. The Positive Mood and Ineffability subscales were not significantly associated with post-treatment OCD symptom severity after correction for multiple comparisons. Challenging experiences were not significantly associated with post-treatment OCD severity. \n\nConclusions: Mystical experiences – particularly experiences of unity, sacredness, and transcendence – during psilocybin sessions are associated with greater OCD symptom reduction. These findings support attention to experiential quality in psilocybin-assisted therapy and have implications for optimizing treatment through dosing, set, setting, and integration practices.",

While prior research focuses on isolating the cause of developmental differences in syntactic parsing, there remains a more fundamental challenge of describing what structures are targets of developmental change, and when these effects emerge in processing. The current study investigates these questions in typically developing children, ages 4 to 9 years. Children heard spoken presentations of intransitives, transitives, and relative clauses while their eye-movements were measured to images of two events. Across a broad range of structures, children revealed distinct performance in off-line vs. on-line performance. While action accuracy increased with age for all sentence types, correct fixations after the disambiguating cues in sentences revealed age-related gains for intransitives, actives, and subject RCs. Critically, we found limited evidence of age effects in on-line interpretations of passives and object RCs. Together, our findings are consistent with an account of developmental parsing, whereby children solve bandwidth limitations in real-time processing by first mastering off-line interpretations before investing in more efficient on-line access.",

          "abstract": "Individuals of all ages face choices between immediate but smaller and delayed but larger rewards. In a decision process known as delay discounting, people tend to devalue options that are realized farther into the future. Several candidate cognitive mechanisms have been proposed to underpin such choices: inhibition (overriding a prepotent response), prospection (orienting to the future), working memory (manipulating information held in mind), reward motivation (activating behavior for reward), and time perception (subjectively judging time horizons). These mechanisms change through adolescence, in tandem with delay discounting decisions becoming more patient from childhood to adulthood. However, the cognitive mechanisms principally responsible for developmental increases in patience remain contested. By measuring delay discounting alongside indices of inhibition, prospection, working memory, reward motivation, and time perception in the same participants (N = 159, 10-20 years, collected in the United States), the present study examined whether these mechanisms – alone or in combination – explained age variability in reward- and time-based choice in different stakes contexts. Mixed- effects modeling revealed that patience indeed increased with age, especially for higher- than lower-magnitude decisions. Dependency modeling identified dissociable and overlapping drivers of age-related changes in delay discounting: prospection mediated patience in lower-magnitude decisions whereas working memory mediated patience in higher-magnitude decisions; time perception mediated patience in both. Although compressed time perception supported older participants’ more patient choices overall, distinct cognitive mechanisms may become available during adolescence to underscore willingness to wait for larger later rewards, depending on decision stakes. These findings advance understanding of how multiple constituent processes scaffold the development of value-based choice.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the design and theoretical motivation for the construction of a corpus of stuttered Brazilian Portuguese (BP) speech, to be analyzed within the framework of the Dynamic Model of Speech Rhythm (Barbosa, 2006). Stuttering is a fluency disorder characterized by recurrent disruptions in the temporal organization of speech, such as part-word repetitions, sound prolongations, and blocks. Despite the relevance of temporal aspects for the characterization of stuttering, there is currently no corpus in BP specifically designed to support rhythmic and prosodic analyses of stuttered speech. The proposed corpus aims to fill this gap through the systematic collection, acoustic analysis, and annotation of data from children, adolescents, and adults who stutter, encompassing a wide range of stuttering profiles. These profiles include different stuttering types and degrees of severity, co-occurrence with cluttering, covert stuttering, acquired stuttering, and speech produced before and after behavioral treatment. Within this phonetic model, stuttering is analyzed as part of a continuous rhythmic process rather than as a set of isolated disfluent events, allowing stuttered and non-stuttered intervals to be examined in terms of vowel-to-vowel (V–V) unit duration, rhythmic variability, and the organization of stress groups within a coupled-oscillator framework. The corpus design integrates clinical and acoustic variables, enabling a detailed investigation of how stuttering affects speech rhythm in BP.",

A large online sample completed a battery of\nperceptual and memory type object recognition tests alongside tests of low-level perception,\nmemory, and general intelligence. We specified preregistered structural equation models.\nResults indicated that perception and memory o tests form two separable factors, each tapping\ninto concurrently measured perceptual and memory abilities respectively.

          "abstract": "Background: Informed consent in psychedelic-assisted services is ethically complex, difficult to implement, and remains largely unstudied and unstandardized. \n\nObjective: The current study sought expert recommendations from experienced psychedelic facilitators on what constitutes informed consent best practices for supervised psychedelic experiences across various settings. \n\nMethods: Participants with expertise in facilitating psilocybin-assisted experiences or other expertise in the psychedelic field were recruited with purposive sampling. Qualitative interviews on informed consent best practices and recommendations were analyzed using Thematic Analysis. \n\nResults: Participants (N = 36; 71% white; 56% heterosexual; 53% female) reported facilitating psilocybin services (64%) for a mean of 15.2 (SD = 13.1) years in clinical trial, licensed service center, underground, or ceremonial settings. Participants viewed informed consent as a process (Theme 1), necessitating a strong therapeutic relationship, centering client empowerment, and occurring as an ongoing process. Potential risks and benefits should be comprehensively conveyed (Theme 2), including potential long-term psychological and social changes, and the potential for disappointing experiences. Participants recommended detailed consent processes around touch and boundaries (Theme 3), including explicitly establishing boundaries prior to psychedelic administration, maintaining those boundaries throughout, and recognizing subtle non-verbal cues that may indicate lack of true consent. Within facilitator trainings (Theme 4), participants emphasized cultivating a deep respect for client agency, and experientially learning relational and boundary setting skills. \n\nConclusions: Findings may inform practitioner training, consent practices in varied settings, and policy development for state-regulated psychedelic services.",

Here, we examine three potential aspects of metacognitive confidence judgments that could be similar across the distinct domains of memory and perception in adults (N = 236) and children (aged 4-7 years, N = 263; 122 girls and 141 boys) from Vancouver, Canada. Using episodic memory and perceptual tasks, we reveal that while confidence bias correlates across domains at all ages, confidence sensitivity and efficiency are both distinct. Crucially, children aged 6 and older can flexibly contrast confidence states across memory and perceptual decisions, indicating a shared internal metric of confidence. In contrast, 4-5-year-old children struggle with cross-domain comparisons, highlighting a developmental transition in metacognitive processing. Overall, findings highlight the distinct yet commensurable nature of memory and perceptual confidence, with domain-general processes emerging by age 6.",

          "abstract": "The application of social robots is changing learning landscapes, yet the environmental costs and social consequences of their deployment have received minimal attention. To effectively promote sustainable practices, it is crucial to identify how children’s knowledge of and attitudes towards sustainability and social equity evolve across different developmental stages. In this paper, we systematically investigated children’s understanding of robot sustainability and social equity through a survey study with 71 children aged 10-16 years. Our findings show that children’s understanding of sustainability and social equity informs a critical stance toward social robots, with more knowledgeable children demanding higher standards. By identifying age-related differences in children's knowledge and attitudes, this work provides a foundational understanding that can inform the design of age-appropriate technologies and curricula to foster a more responsible and sustainable future.",

          "abstract": "Most young people with mental health disorders do not receive any mental health care. Digital single-session interventions adapted from evidence-based treatments help address this problem by making potent therapeutic skills widely accessible. There is increasing demand and interest in developing digital single-session interventions, yet there is no guide to promote best practices. Objective: This paper guides readers through the development of effective, self-guided, digital single-session interventions for youth. Method: We convened eight researchers with extensive experience developing, testing, and disseminating digital single-session interventions for youth. This team collected and distilled lessons learned from over a dozen single-session intervention projects into this guide. Results: This paper has four parts: an introduction to demonstrate the value of single-session interventions, a step-by-step guide for developing effective single-session interventions, a case study demonstrating how we followed the steps in the development of a single-session intervention, and answers to frequently asked questions. The step-by-step guide breaks down the development process into five phases. During the preparation phase, we cultivate a single-session mindset. During collaboration, we assemble the right team to reach our target audience. During adaptation, we select an evidence-based treatment and a proven, standalone component to feature. During design, we create the content of the single-session intervention. Finally, during engagement, we use best practices to increase uptake and learning. These phases are summarized in a supplemental single-session intervention development checklist. Conclusion: This manuscript serves as a guide for the creation of effective, scalable, self-guided, digital single-session interventions for youth.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of depression during the preschool years is well established. However, the neural correlates of depressive symptoms during this developmental period remain relatively understudied. Prior work has suggested a concurrent association between left amygdala salience reactivity (i.e., reward and loss versus neutral) and depressive symptoms in early childhood. Replication and extension into the predictive utility of the amygdala and other relevant neurobiological correlates are now needed. The current longitudinal study conducted a conceptual replication and extension of prior work using task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a sample of 4-8-year-old children. We investigated whether reward-related reactivity in a priori regions of interest were associated with parent-reported early childhood depressive symptoms concurrently (N = 114; 54% female) and approximately one year later (N = 75; 53% female). Left amygdala salience reactivity and right caudate and medial prefrontal cortex reward reactivity (i.e., reward versus neutral) negatively associated with concurrent childhood depressive symptom severity. Only right caudate reward reactivity negatively associated with childhood depressive symptom severity one year later. Results replicate prior research suggesting an association between amygdala response to salient outcomes during reward processing and concurrent depressive symptom elevations in young children. They also provide novel information supporting the potential role of right caudate reactivity during reward processing as a biomarker of future elevations in depressive symptoms. These findings provide neurobiological insights into our developmental understanding of early emerging depressive symptoms and underscore early childhood as an important developmental period for understanding depression.",

          "abstract": "Fearlessness about death (FAD) reflects a reduced fear of dying that enables individuals to act on suicidal thoughts. Understanding how FAD changes in real time is critical because suicide risk can escalate within hours. However, little is known about processes that influence FAD within brief time periods. Painful and provocative events (PPEs), affective lability and impulsivity have each been linked to suicidal behaviour and may shape momentary increases in FAD, but prior studies have been largely cross-sectional. To address this gap, we enrolled 169 young adults with past year suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours to complete ecological momentary assessments five times per day for 21 days. Using multi-level modeling, we tested the impact of daily fluctuations in affective states (happy, sad, anxious, angry, ashamed, and hopeless) and impulsivity on same-day FAD, with daily engagement in PPEs as a mediator. Results indicated that greater daily lability in impulsivity, anger, sadness and shame was associated with increased same-day FAD. Contrary to hypotheses, these effects were not mediated by PPE engagement. Short-term increases in FAD may arise from rapid shifts in emotions and impulsivity, rather than experiences such as PPEs. Capturing these dynamic, within-person changes can refine suicide theory and improve real-time suicide risk assessment.",

          "abstract": "Skilled visual word recognition is influenced by morphological structure, as shown by the morpheme interference effect (e.g., Crepaldi et al., 2010), where nonwords with pseudo-morphological structure (‘earist’) are harder to reject as words than matched non-morphemic nonwords (‘earilt’). Less is known about how sensitivity to morphological structure develops, especially during adolescence. Here, we examine the developmental trajectory of the morpheme interference effect during adolescence and investigate whether it is modulated by reading experience. English-speaking adolescents (N= 664, aged 11-17 years) participated in a morpheme interference lexical decision experiment. Reading experience was captured at the individual-level (reading ability) and the item-level (suffix familiarity, as indexed by suffix frequency in children’s reading materials). We observed an overall morpheme interference effect, and the magnitude of the effect was influenced by reading experience such that the effect was more pronounced for better readers and for items with more familiar suffixes. There was some evidence that the effect increases with age. These findings indicate that reading experience shapes the emergence of sensitivity to morphological information in written words, with individual- and item-level factors working together to bring about expertise.",

          "abstract": "People often communicate social and moral expectations to one another in terms of rules. While these rules often seem simple (e.g. \"No walking on the grass\") people understand that much more is being communicated than it at first appears. In this paper we present a novel theory of how people understand moral rules and instantiate that theory in a computational cognitive model. We argue that moral rules are a special kind of speech act, directed at a group and expressing a summary of the agreement that rational actors would arrive at when navigating an interdependent choice problem.  Rules, on this conception, are therefore closely tied to their reasons, which reflect the interests of the parties to the agreement. This structure is very powerful: it allows people to interpret and apply rules flexibly in novel situations and edge cases. Specifically, we argue that when judging whether an action violates a rule, people reflect on the reason for the rule and harness mental models of agreement (and their heuristic approximations) to determine whether the action upholds or undermines the reason. Put simply, people ask whether the purpose of the rule would still be upheld if the rule permitted everyone to act in this way.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multilingual children in monolingual education systems are typically assessed against monolingual norms, complicating differentiation between normal multilingual development and genuine language disorders. When language experience is distributed across multiple languages, clinicians and educators struggle to determine whether multilingual learners need routine support or specialist intervention for developmental language disorders.\nAIMS: This study identified: (1) the cumulative societal language (SL) exposure threshold beyond which multilingual children perform within monolingual proficiency ranges, and (2) when cumulative SL experience no longer predicts SL proficiency.\nMETHODS: We examined multilingual learners (ages 5–9) across three societal languages (English, French, Dutch), assessing morphosyntax via sentence repetition and receptive vocabulary (breadth and depth). Binary partition and broken stick regression identified exposure-outcome thresholds while controlling for environmental and cognitive factors. Cumulative SL exposure was measured in month-equivalents.\nRESULTS: For morphosyntax, multilingual children required minimum 59 month-equivalent cumulative SL exposure to reach monolingual performance ranges. Diminishing returns occurred after approximately 57 months (4 years), beyond which morphosyntactic outcomes were no longer strongly exposure-constrained. For vocabulary breadth, no clear threshold emerged; significant differences persisted even at 94 month-equivalent exposure, with outcomes predicted more by cognitive factors and language experience richness than cumulative exposure. Vocabulary depth showed a threshold at 91 months, though sample limitations prevent firm conclusions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate domain-specificity: morphosyntax and vocabulary show different exposure-outcome dynamics. Multilingual children require approximately 93 month-equivalent cumulative SL exposure for full morphosyntactic competence comparable to monolinguals. Before 57 months cumulative exposure, difficulties are developmentally expected; specialist referral should occur if concerns persist beyond this threshold. These findings provide research-informed guidance for contextualizing assessment expectations based on multilingual backgrounds, moving from deficit-based comparisons toward recognizing expected developmental trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The \"aesthetic sadness paradox\" – the enjoyment of sadness in art – has long puzzled scholars. Recent studies with film and music suggest that the feeling of being moved might explain this paradox: People don’t enjoy sadness itself, but rather the experience of being moved, which sad art often elicits (Vuoskoski &amp; Eerola, 2017). We test this \"being moved hypothesis\" across a broader range of emotional aesthetic experiences, asking whether being moved mediates: (1) the enjoyment of sadness in static images, which express emotion differently than film and music do, (2) the enjoyment of happiness across artforms, and (3) beauty ratings across sad and happy artforms. In a pre-registered online study, 203 participants rated music excerpts, representational paintings, abstract paintings, and nature photos (12 each) in terms of liking, perceived sadness and happiness, and feelings of being moved. Linear mixed-effects models and nested model comparisons revealed that, for images and music, ratings of being moved fully mediate the effect of sadness on liking (100% mediation, all p &lt; 0.001) and substantially mediate the effect of happiness on liking (60-70% mediation across image types, all p &lt; 0.001). Results were very similar for beauty judgments. Individuals higher in empathy, aesthetic reward, and art expertise experience more enjoyment from sadness in images and music. Our results suggest that the feeling of being moved enables the enjoyment of emotional art across domains (paintings, photographs, music), helping to elucidate the relationship between emotion and aesthetic experience.",

In doing so, we examine how the predictions of PAM(-L2) and L2LP can be extended to a context of ongoing sound change in bidialectal and bilingual phonological acquisition.\n\nDesign: We focus on the context of Chongqing Mandarin, a variety of Southwestern Mandarin. There is an ongoing merger between [l] and [n] in Chongqing Mandarin, but these two sounds are phonemic in listeners’ second dialect (D2), Standard Mandarin, and second language (L2), English. We assess perceptual accuracy and directionality in D2 and L2.\n\nData: A total of 97 D1 Chongqing Mandarin speakers took part in AX discrimination and 2AFC tasks for /l/ and /n/ words in their D2 and L2. 7441 responses were analysed with mixed effects logistic regression modelling and correlation coefficients.\n\nFindings: D1 Chongqing Mandarin speakers could perceive the phonemic contrast of /l/ and /n/ above the chance level in their D2 and L2. Their perception was not biased towards [l] or [n] in D2 or L2 overall, but the perception bias in D2 was modulated by daily language use. The better speakers perceived the contrast in their D2, the better they perceived it in their L2 (R = 0.75).\n\nOriginality: Previous bilingual phonological research has mainly considered acquisition of either a larger or smaller phonological system from a stable L1.

          "abstract": "Maladaptive social behavior can be considered both a cause and effect of pathological anxiety. These difficulties may arise from both the cognitive demands of social interaction, such as managing uncertainty, and the distinctively social demands of interactions, such as managing social friction. Previous work has linked generalized anxiety (GA) to reduced learning from aversive events, particularly under uncertainty, and social anxiety (SA) to fear of negative evaluation. However, these distinct hypothesized effects have not been previously dissociated within a single experimental framework. In the current study, we used a novel task, the Asymmetric Social Exchange (ASE) game, to study how people reason under uncertainty about the hidden intentions of others and weigh the real personal costs and benefits of accepting interpersonal inequality, a major source of social friction. In a large sample of online participants (N = 723), we tested the hypothesis of a double dissociation between anxiety subtypes in behavior. Behavioral and computational modeling supported this: GA, not SA, was specifically related to perturbed learning under uncertainty through aversive overgeneralization. By contrast, SA, not GA, was related to increased sensitivity to social friction, increasing acceptance of unfair, disadvantageous outcomes. Our study combined a novel social decision-making task with computational modeling to identify dissociable cognitive mechanisms underlying GA and SA phenotypes.",

Thus, a systematic review was conducted in Covidence following PRISMA guidelines. The review showed language deficits on both narrative microstructure and macrostructure. Across studies, individuals with ASD typically were found to produce narratives that are shorter, lexically less diverse, and syntactically simpler than those of neurotypical individuals; morphosyntactic accuracy is often relatively preserved compared to macrostructural abilities, particularly in individuals without comorbid language impairments, though it remains vulnerable under high discourse pressure. At the macrostructural level, individuals with ASD include fewer complete story grammar elements, show weaker causal/temporal linking, use sparser mental-state vocabulary, and display greater referential ambiguity. Narrative difficulties in individuals with ASD arise from discourse planning and socio-cognitive difficulties, with local linguistic form though being relatively more preserved.",

          "abstract": "Prior research with children suggests that—by 6 years of age—they endorse a gender-intelligence stereotype, whereby brilliance is associated with men, not women. This stereotype aligns with adult perceptions and may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in fields viewed as requiring intrinsic aptitude (i.e., brilliance). Here, we examined whether gender composition within occupations is used by children as a cue to intelligence. Across two experiments with 6- to 10-year-olds living in the United States (U.S.) and tested online, we manipulated the gender composition of workers in novel jobs and assessed children’s trait inferences and social preferences about those jobs. In Experiment 1, children judged intelligence and niceness for groups with majority-male or majority-female workers. In Experiment 2, we introduced scenarios emphasizing brilliance, perseverance, or physical strength, and assessed children’s judgments about the groups using both direct and indirect measures of trait attributions and social preferences. Across both studies, children showed no evidence of associating male-dominated jobs with intelligence. Instead, their judgments reflected in-group gender bias (i.e., preference for the group with their own-gender majority) and domain-specific stereotypes, such as “female = nice” and “male = strong.” Within this contemporary U.S. sample, children’s stereotypes about intelligence appeared more context-dependent and socially motivated than a simple, global “male = brilliance” association would suggest. We discuss the importance of considering both social affiliation and trait-specific reasoning—as well as cultural and developmental context—when characterizing the emergence of children’s gender stereotypes.",

Participants complete a semi-structured interview about their beliefs and behaviors on a given issue guided by an LLM, evaluate LLM-extracted statements that summarize the beliefs they have expressed, and construct personal belief networks by creating supporting and conflicting relations between these statements on a visual canvas. We validate the tool in a two-wave study on meat-eating. Participants evaluate the experience positively, and both belief network content and structure show satisfactory reliability across the two measurement points.

Thus, we hypothesized that avoidance coping might explain why narcissism favors counternormative tendencies. We conducted four studies (total N = 2,643) in the United States and Poland to examine avoidance coping as a mediator of the relationship between narcissism and counternormative tendencies: conspiracy beliefs (Studies 1-4), willingness to conspire (Studies 2-4), cyberbullying (Studies 3-4), and catfishing (Study 4). All studies found a consistent positive indirect relationship between various forms of narcissism and counternormative tendencies via avoidance coping. These findings suggest that counternormative tendencies might reflect using maladaptive coping strategies.",

          "authors": "Aaron Goldman; Andrew Engelhardt; Robert Wiley; Christopher N. Wahlheim",
          "abstract": "Restating false information before correcting it reduces beliefs more than correcting it with only true information. However, correction effectiveness may also depend on the trustworthiness of sources, especially in the polarized political environment of the United States. Across two experiments, we examined the roles of correction format and source credibility on beliefs in false news headlines. Samples of Republicans and Democrats tested online read both true and false social media headlines as well as corrections of false headlines attributed to media sources associated with different political and ideological leanings (e.g., Fox News, CNN). The first experiment found that reminder-based corrections were more effective than corrections without reminders at reducing false beliefs across partisan affiliation and news sources, so the second experiment only used a reminder-based correction format. In both experiments, Democrats initially believed false headlines more when it was attributed to an ideologically congruent (liberal) source than an ideologically incongruent (conservative) source, but Republicans did not show this difference. Corrections reduced false beliefs to the same levels within party regardless of sources. For Democrats, the magnitude of belief change was driven by the initial headline source and not the correction source. Republicans’ magnitude of belief change, in contrast, was relatively consistent regardless of the sources. Recognized corrections were consistently associated with reduced false beliefs. Collectively, these findings show how the memorability of corrections of false headlines is a key determinant of their effectiveness in improving belief accuracy, across the dimensions of partisanship and news source trustworthiness.",

          "authors": "Keely A Dugan; Anqing Zheng; Matt Saxsma; D. A. Briley; R. Chris Fraley",
          "abstract": "Life events are theorized to play an important role in personality development (Roberts &amp; Nickel, 2017). Over the past two decades, research on event-related personality change has largely relied on a “candidate event approach,” estimating the effects of a small number of major life events modeled in isolation. Yet, recent meta-analytic evidence suggests that individual life events—even those that are intuitively impactful—tend to have very small effects on trait change (e.g., getting married, retiring; Bühler et al., 2024). People’s lives, however, consist of far more than a handful of “big days”; instead, they comprise a rich collection of experiences that may collectively shape who people become. Drawing inspiration from molecular behavior genetics—which moved beyond candidate gene studies towards polygenic models—the present study used analogous methods to model the poly-experiential nature of personality change. Using data from 4,904 adults who completed monthly assessments of the Big Five traits and 25 life events over two years, we conducted a poly-experience index (PXI) analysis and an Experience-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (ECTA), estimating the combined influence of many life events on trait change. PXIs accounted for 1-2% of the variance in trait change for neuroticism and conscientiousness—modest in absolute terms, but between 8 and 16 times greater than the variance explained by any single, “candidate” event. ECTA accounted for 1-2% of the variance in change for all Big Five traits except agreeableness. Implications of these findings for future research on life events and personality development are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Prior research with children suggests that—by 6 years of age—they endorse a gender-intelligence stereotype, whereby brilliance is associated with men, not women. This stereotype aligns with adult perceptions and may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in fields viewed as requiring intrinsic aptitude (i.e., brilliance). Here, we examined whether gender composition within occupations is used by children as a cue to intelligence. Across two experiments with 6- to 10-year-olds living in the United States (U.S.) and tested online, we manipulated the gender composition of workers in novel jobs and assessed children’s trait inferences and social preferences about those jobs. In Experiment 1, children judged intelligence and niceness for groups with majority-male or majority-female workers. In Experiment 2, we introduced scenarios emphasizing brilliance, perseverance, or physical strength, and assessed children’s judgments about the groups using both direct and indirect measures of trait attributions and social preferences. Across both studies, children showed no evidence of associating male-dominated jobs with intelligence. Instead, their judgments reflected in-group gender bias (i.e., preference for the group with their own-gender majority) and domain-specific stereotypes, such as “female = nice” and “male = strong.” Within this contemporary U.S. sample, children’s stereotypes about intelligence appeared more context-dependent and socially motivated than a simple, global “male = brilliance” association would suggest. We discuss the importance of considering both social affiliation and trait-specific reasoning—as well as cultural and developmental context—when characterizing the emergence of children’s gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Schemas, knowledge networks distilled from repeated experiences, play a significant role in guiding memory encoding and retrieval. Yet, despite decades of experimental research on schemas, there is currently no sensitive method for quantifying schematic content in memory narratives. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for scoring schematic content in narratives using natural language processing. Specifically, we propose an automated pipeline that builds “schema dictionaries” with word embeddings and uses those dictionaries to score each new text for the proportion of schematic words it contains. We validated this approach across three experiments. We demonstrate convergent validity by showing that schema dictionary scores correlate with subjective ratings of memory typicality, schema scores derived from generic scene descriptions, and scores based on human ratings of word relatedness. Further, we establish discriminant validity: schema dictionaries identify substantially more words in narratives elicited by the dictionaries' associated cues than in narratives for other cues. Finally, as predicted, we show that generic scene descriptions yield higher schema scores than specific autobiographical memories. Overall, this work provides a well-validated approach for automatically scoring schematic content in narratives. We provide open-source code to enable others to quantify schematic content in memory and imagination research.",

          "abstract": "People’s quantitative estimates, such as judgments about the height of a tower or the distance between two cities, can be influenced by external values, including random numbers in the environment or another person’s estimate. We reviewed three distinct but related phenomena in quantitative estimation: anchoring effects, advice taking, and hindsight bias. These effects are assimilative; that is, estimates are drawn toward the external value. They are also robust and they exhibit medium to large effect sizes. However, previous studies suggest that the reliability of their measurements differs considerably, ranging from low (anchoring) to high (advice taking). In this project, we compared the reliabilities of the three phenomena using open data (Study 1) and a new experiment employing a homogenized paradigm (Study 2). Homogenization involves controlling for differences in the informativeness of external values, computing assimilation scores, and using the same setting and knowledge domain. In Study 1, we found that, consistent with prior research, anchoring effects were largely unreliable, advice taking was reliably measured, and hindsight bias showed moderate reliability. This overall pattern was [reproduced] in [the simulation of] Study 2.

Across four studies (N = 4,406), participants rated the quality of political reasons supporting or opposing issue statements they had endorsed or rejected. Studies 1, 2, and 3 support H1: evaluators consistently discounted outparty reasons, including when contrapartisans shared the same stance, and the effect generalized to partisan leaners as well as self-identified Democrats or Republicans. Study 4 directly supports H2 by manipulating partisan source cues for the same reason. Evaluations tracked the presented label, reversing when partisan labels were swapped.

          "abstract": "Background: Previous research has shown that interpersonal trauma is associated with higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSD), with coping responses playing a vital role in individual differences in symptom presentation. The present online study examined differential associations between trauma type, coping styles, and trauma-related symptomatology to deepen understanding of variation in trauma-related symptomatology.\nMethods: The sample included N = 300 participants who reported a traumatic life event within the past 18 months, assessed with the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5). Events were classified post-hoc into interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma. Participants completed retrospective questions assessing posttraumatic coping strategies, current levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction.\nResults: The present study reports secondary analyses. Correlational analyses within both trauma groups revealed positive relationships between avoidant coping and trauma-related symptoms. Group comparisons revealed higher levels of trauma-related symptoms, lower life satisfaction, and greater use of avoidant coping strategies following interpersonal compared to non-interpersonal trauma. Furthermore, avoidant coping predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms within both trauma groups, and trauma type itself significantly predicted symptoms across the entire sample. Finally, exploratory analyses showed that avoidant coping partially mediated the relationship between trauma type and posttraumatic stress symptoms.\nConclusion: These findings underscore the important role of avoidant coping in the differential associations between trauma type and trauma-related symptoms. The results highlight potential targets for intervention and prevention efforts, particularly for individuals exposed to interpersonal trauma.",

We aimed to examine perceived facilitators and barriers to implementing a co-designed pilot financial incentive intervention for smoking cessation, targeting disadvantaged communities in Ireland. \n\nMethods: Three audio-recorded co-design workshops were held in communities that are nationally recognised as disadvantaged. As part of a larger mixed-methods study that used a nominal group technique to co-design a pilot financial incentive intervention for smoking cessation, we used a qualitative approach to specifically examine the potential facilitators and barriers to implementation. Applying the Theoretical Domains Framework, themes were developed, categorising these through both inductive thematic and deductive analysis using NVivo 15.\n\nResults: Themes were developed to categorise perceived facilitators and barriers. Perceived facilitators included: establishing clear intervention guidelines, implementation training for staff, fair distribution of tasks, face-to-face consultations for rapport-building, incentives for smoking cessation being more defendable when appropriately targeted, minimal intervention promotion to reduce public backlash. Perceived barriers included: an inability to account for all potential intervention challenges, disruption to work dynamics if training needs are not planned for, increased workload among staff, concerns about introducing biological-testing, concerns that some clients will game the intervention, public disapproval, limited technological resources, incurred travel expenses.\n\nConclusion: Potential facilitators and barriers of the co-designed intervention were identified prior to commencement, informing subsequent strategy for design and implementation.\n\nKey words: Financial Incentives, Smoking, Intervention, Barriers, Facilitators",

          "abstract": "Help-seeking behavior (HSB) is an important social interaction, serving as a catalyst for collaboration, connection, and collective problem-solving. This behavior plays a critical role in various domains, including, but not limited to, education, mental health services, and healthcare. With these different approaches to HSB, there is no common account, which could limit dialogue across fields and hinder the development of a shared understanding. It also limits the generalizability of research findings to HSB in everyday contexts. The urgency of addressing this gap is underscored by recent evidence showing that people often underestimate others’ willingness to help, which critically undermines social cohesion and effective problem-solving. Thus, in this narrative review, we aimed to contribute to the development of a unified account of HSB. Grounded in an interpersonal examination of affective dynamics, we proposed a framework composed of contemplation, execution, and resolution. We drew on empirical and theoretical evidence to illustrate how this framework can comprehensively account for the unfolding and development of HSB. This framework was formulated to offer a flexible yet coherent structure for conceptualization and discussion across domains and for examining this behavior in day-to-day interactions.",

          "authors": "Teerawat Monnor; Kerstin Preuschoff; Giuseppe Ugazio",
          "abstract": "Prosocial behavior is widely recognized for its benefits. Promoting it as a preferable trait is likely to yield positive outcomes. Yet, such a generalization would not be effective for understanding its construct, as research increasingly shows its multifaceted nature. It is also shaped by a wide range of factors, with task difficulty being particularly important in ecological settings. Although prior work has shown that this demand can lead to proself bias or disengagement, it remains unclear how to account for this variation across individuals and how it operates when the benefit is neither only self- nor other-directed but mutual. Here, we adopted an appraisal-driven emotional reward approach to examine the self-other tension of benefit more comprehensively across degrees of task difficulty. To provide an empirical basis for this account, multi-agent experimental sessions were conducted, where each involved 3-5 participants. They completed multiple trials of a modified effort-based slider task to earn a monetary reward benefiting themselves, an anonymous partner, both, or none (the control condition). In each trial, they also rated their perceived importance (PI) in succeeding at the beginning and satisfaction (SAT) afterward. With data from 51 qualified participants, the results validated that both the benefit conditions and task difficulty significantly alter SAT. Notably, PI profiles across benefit conditions remained relatively stable across levels of task difficulty, in contrast to SAT. Satisfaction tracked PI, aligned with appraisal theories, but only in the easy-task condition. The two appeared negatively correlated in the difficult-task condition. This effect of task difficulty on changing the PI-SAT dynamics should raise caution that prosocial tendencies assessed in lab-based situations—relying on data from successful trials—may be limited in explaining prosocial actions in real-life contexts, which are generally accompanied by task challenges and demands. In addition, a process-level investigation was conducted using moderated mediation analysis to examine causal relationships among PI, SAT, and success rate (SR), as formulated by the appraisal-driven approach. The results suggested potential mediation and moderation effects of SR. Taken together, this study demonstrated that prosocial behavior unfolded differently across levels of task difficulty and proposed an appraisal-driven emotional reward framework that could be evaluated to examine prosocial dynamics in more ecological settings.",

In Study 1 (n = 735), we found that political narcissism (but not political identification) among conservatives and liberals predicted belief in both anti-liberal and anti-conservative conspiracy theories. In Study 2 (n = 658), we introduced a novel measure that more directly portrays liberals and conservatives as conspiring agents and found that political narcissism was positively associated with believing in conspiracies, accusing both out-group and in-group members. In Study 3 (n = 1197), we demonstrated that the relationship between political collective narcissism (both among liberals and conservatives) and belief in conspiracy theories with in-group members as conspiring agents was mediated by the party-over-nation orientation. Our findings suggest that collective narcissists not only endorse out-group conspiracies but also in-group conspiracy beliefs, especially when such beliefs serve strategic goals.",

          "authors": "Teerawat Monnor; Kerstin Preuschoff; Giuseppe Ugazio",
          "abstract": "Prosocial action often arises from empathizing with another person’s aversive experience. Yet, this empathic reactivity can be emotionally taxing, reducing their likelihood of taking action and deteriorating their action proficiency. These conflicting influences have been divided into compassion and personal distress to describe the promoting and demoting effects of such an empathic experience, respectively. Although this framework has provided insights and has been applied in the development of training programs to promote compassion and cultivate a prosocial mindset, studies have also revealed additional nuances. For example, the induced stress could also have a promotional effect by increasing the sense of urgency. Therefore, another framework is needed to address these flexible influences of the empathic experience. In this study, we aim to contribute to filling this gap by proposing an appraisal-driven account, demonstrating that perceived importance (PI) can largely account for how prosocial action unfolds and that active regulation is necessary to explain behavioral adaptation arising from prosocial motivation. To facilitate this process-level examination of the perception-to-action mechanism, we adopted a hybrid approach that combines hypothesis validation with explanatory investigations to address the large number of variables involved. The former focused on validating the effects of PI on affective stress, while the latter investigated PI-driven impact on behavioral outcomes. To establish an empirical basis for these, we employed a redesigned computer-based, effort-based slider task, and asked participants to complete it to rescue their session partner from potential threats (i.e., electric stimulation and monetary loss). Self-report, performance-based, and psychological scale data were collected. Based on data from 53 qualified participants, we validated that PI led to affective stress, and that an increase in PI impaired task performance. Yet participants showed performance improvement despite high stress, especially in reaction time, during high-stakes task conditions (i.e., the difficult-task and high-threat conditions). Specifically, lower-altruistic populations reported greater increases in stress. In conclusion, we validated, in part, and provided supporting evidence for the appraisal-driven account of prosocial behavior. We believe that it warrants further validation and examination to elucidate the nuances of empathy's impact on prosocial behavior, particularly in more ecologically valid settings.",

          "abstract": "Although disability identity has been widely examined among individuals with disabilities, relatively little is known about whether heterogeneous disability identity profiles exist among university students with disabilities from a quantitative perspective. In addition, limited research has examined how such heterogeneity relates to key psychosocial experiences in higher education, including university-related self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Therefore, this study aimed (a) to identify heterogeneous profiles of disability identity using the well-validated Disability Identity Development Scale (DIDS) and (b) to examine associations between these profiles and university-related self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Latent profile analyses and analyses of covariance were conducted using data from 211 university students with disabilities in the United States. Results identified three disability identity profiles: a profile characterized by higher anger and frustration alongside moderate engagement with the disability community (Class 1), a profile characterized by lower engagement with the disability community (Class 2), and a profile characterized by consistently higher levels of disability identity across domains (Class 3). Approximately 80% of participants belonged to Class 2 or Class 3. Higher disability identity was associated with greater social self-efficacy and stronger sense of belonging, particularly in terms of university affiliation and relationships with faculty and staff. Overall, the findings support a psychosocial and relational model of disability identity and underscore the importance of recognizing heterogeneity in disability identity development among university students. The results have implications for researchers, educators, and institutions seeking to foster more inclusive, relationally responsive learning environments in higher education.",

          "abstract": "Working longer hours is associated with negative outcomes in health and wellbeing. While effects of occupational stress on the brain have been observed, there have been no investigations into the effect of amount of time spent at work on brain function to date. We examined the effect of length of working week (in hours) on task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 8,528 and 7,589 participants, respectively, from the UK Biobank. Analyses were conducted to treat working hours as both a continuous and a categorical (lower versus higher hours groups) variable. Covariates relevant to length of working week were selected using random forest machine learning and were systematically adjusted for in a sequential manner. No association with length of working week was found for task-based fMRI, as reflected by activation in the amygdala, fusiform face area, and insula during an emotional face matching task. For resting-state fMRI, greater continuous length of working week was found to be positively associated with within-network connectivity in the somatomotor network, but did not predict connectivity within or between any other network. The observed association may suggest compensatory or adaptive somatomotor connectivity changes in the face of increased job demands. All other within- and between-network connectivity metrics showed no significant relationship with working hours, following optimal model selection and correction for multiple statistical tests. When looking at uncorrected p-values, significant statistical associations with resting-state fMRI tended to become non-significant once demographic factors were adjusted for, suggesting that associations between length of working week and brain function are frequently accounted for by these covariates, with the sole exception of somatomotor connectivity. Overall, this suggests that length of working week, as just one employment factor, does not show strong associations with fMRI metrics, when related variables are adjusted for. Interventional studies, and analysis of additional factors such as burnout and shift work may shed further light on neural markers of occupational wellbeing.",

However, less is known about other-perceptions of EI. In our study, a sample of 163 adults completed standardized measures of narcissism, trait EI, and ability EI. Additionally, up to two close others (N rater = 296) provided other-ratings of EI. We found that individuals perceived as emotionally intelligent often did not necessarily perform well on ability-based EI tests. Other-perceptions aligned more closely to self-perceptions of trait EI. Vulnerable narcissism correlated negatively with other-rated overall EI and most subfactors, while grandiose narcissism only correlated negatively with other-rated emotionality and well-being. We replicated both, the negative relationships between grandiose narcissism and (ability) emotion management and between vulnerable narcissism and self-rated trait EI. Importantly, we found some evidence that grandiose narcissism predicted negative other-perceptions of emotionality even after controlling for ability EI and self-rated EI, suggesting that individuals with high grandiosity may be uniquely seen as lacking empathy and emotional understanding. Our findings might be helpful for informing strategies to mitigate the negative interpersonal effects of narcissistic traits.",

          "abstract": "How does learning about historical violence inspire prosocial action today? Prior work has focused on whether such experiences are (emotionally) impactful but seldom tested the mechanisms of impact. We propose a framework of actor-specific emotional pathways connecting knowledge of historical violence to contemporary upstanding intentions: empathy for victims, moral emotions toward exemplars (e.g., admiration), and toward perpetrators (e.g., guilt). We tested this in a pre-registered study among Dutch youths (N = 1,371) participating in a Holocaust museum program, using Structural Equation Modeling to compare post-visit responses to a control group. We found that the program increased empathy for victims, positive emotions toward exemplars, and negative emotions toward perpetrators compared to the control group. However, only the “victim path” (empathy) mediated the program’s effect on upstanding intentions against antisemitic bullying. These findings highlight the central role of victim-centered narratives and inform educational efforts to foster present-day moral engagement.",

          "abstract": "A significant component in regulatory approval of diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) models is the use of reader study evidence, diagnostic performance studies of radiologists on a curated set of images. Retrospective MRMC (multi-reader, multi-case) reader studies of AI use are commonly conducted in the field of medical AI, though they tend to overestimate AI performance and underestimate human performance through the use of aggregated metrics. Further, there has been limited investigation into the impact of diagnostic AI models on radiological decision-making, with few if any cognitive modelling studies undertaken. This has serious implications, as the evidence base needed for implementation of models is lacking verified cognitive research. As such, this paper explores a lost opportunity to model diagnostic reader studies to ask: what can reader studies teach us about radiologist adaptation to AI models?\nIn this study, we used a 2021 reader study of a commercially available Australian diagnostic system by Harrison.ai, consisting of 20 expert radiologists reading 1163 cases. We fit hierarchical signal detection models at the individual and pathology level to a reader study of 20 expert radiologists over 1163 cases and 127 pathologies. Our modelling results indicated that radiologists at the pathology and individual level had increased discriminability with AI, though with a more liberal response bias, leading to higher false positive rates. Further exploratory analysis based on these results indicated that disease coverage rates became homogenised with AI, as well as different AI-generated segmentations potentially influencing correct rejection rates. We provide real-world interpretations of these findings.",

Seminar leaders introduced open science principles and practices in a 20-minute presentation and a week later students delivered a group presentation including critical reflection on the implementation of open science practices within the health psychology literature. The change in scores between before and after the teaching intervention was measured using a questionnaire evaluating students’ open science knowledge and attitudes.\n\nResults: There were baseline differences in most of the open science knowledge and attitude items between students enrolled in a psychology degree program compared to students enrolled in other programs. Following the teaching intervention, students demonstrated improved knowledge about code sharing and user participation. However, study program was better predictor of changes in attitude item scores than the intervention. \n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that a teaching intervention as short as 20 minutes can impact students’ knowledge about and attitude toward open science practices. Moreover, students’ prior knowledge and attitudes had some influence on the results of the intervention. \n\nTeaching Implications: A short introduction to open science practices combined with student activity can enhance students’ knowledge and impact their attitudes towards open science. For the development of teaching materials, students’ pre-existing open science knowledge and attitude should be considered. It is also important to update course materials to accommodate new methods and discussions around open science.",

          "abstract": "Background: Individual climate change mitigation behaviours (CCMBs) can meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet many people report uncertainty about what actions to take and difficulty changing established habits. Scalable, digital behavioural interventions remain largely untested. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness and acceptability of Sustainable Choices, a five-week, internet-delivered intervention designed to promote CCMBs and psychological well-being.\n\nMethods: Adults in Sweden (N = 694) were randomized 1:1 to Sustainable Choices or a waitlist control. The primary outcome was CCMBs at post-intervention, assessed with the Climate Mitigation Behaviour Scale (CLIMBS) and analysed using item-response-theory–derived latent scores in mixed-effects models under an intention-to-treat framework. Secondary outcomes included well-being (SWEMWBS), climate-related worry (GAD-2), low mood (PHQ-2), and meaning and purpose (PROMIS-6a). Follow-ups were conducted at 1, 3, and 6 months. Complier Average Causal Effect analyses examined dose–response relations, and acceptability was assessed through adherence and satisfaction.\n\nResults: Compared with controls, the intervention produced significantly greater increases in CCMBs on the CLIMBS general factor (d = 0.34, p &lt; .001), with improvements in food, consumption, and engagement domains but not mobility. Meaning and purpose increased relative to controls (d = 0.23, p = .004), whereas changes in well-being, worry, and low mood were not significant. Engagement showed robust dose-dependent effects: each completed module increased CCMBs by 0.09 points, and full adherence yielded a 0.45-point gain. Satisfaction was high, with 84% recommending the course.\n\nConclusions: Sustainable Choices achieved small-to-moderate improvements in climate mitigation behaviours and enhanced perceived meaning and purpose. Fully digital behavioural interventions may provide a scalable complement to broader climate strategies, meriting further evaluation in diverse populations and with objective behavioural measures.",

Iterated reference games provide a window into such skills, requiring rich communication as participants converge on mutually understandable names for initially novel referents. Some early experiments are interpreted as evidence that 4-5-year-old children cannot converge on the mutually understandable names needed to succeed in an iterated reference game. Here, we revisit young children's referential communicative abilities using a simpler, child-friendly paradigm. Across 82 pairs of children (N=158), we found that 4-5-year-olds could successfully establish reference with each other. Children were 81% accurate, and they often used descriptions similar to their partner's. These findings suggest that children’s capacity to construct effective referring expressions in novel contexts emerges earlier than previously thought, consistent with the view that children show early pragmatic competence in supportive contexts.",

          "authors": "Joerg Fingerhut",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that aesthetic emotions are epistemic emotions. This claim helps resolve an apparent contradiction that relates to the concept of aesthetic disinterestedness. On the one hand, disinterestedness—being free from desires, practical concerns, or intense motivational involvement—is often regarded as central to aesthetic experience and appreciation. On the other hand, we nonetheless engage with artworks with a strong drive to explore them, by developing attachments or by emotionally impactful emotional episodes. I will argue for a distinct way to navigate this tension: Disinterestedness is not a phenomenal property of an aesthetic attitude or pleasure. It rather concerns at what an aesthetic emotion is directed—its formal object. This object is not a pressing material or social concern, but rather cognition itself. It is in this sense that disinterestedness can be understood as central to aesthetic emotions, which, so my argument will go, are also epistemic emotions.\nTo substantiate the philosophical argument, I will discuss central features of emotions and draw on Kant’s theory of fine art, before relating this to experimental work on art engagement in a Philosophically guided supplementary Analysis (PgsA) of existing studies. The results indicate that emotions which reliably track artistic value are also associated with enhanced cognitive processing, reflection, and experiences of insight. More specifically, the data are consistent with the wonder hypothesis, according to which the emotion of wonder may play a central role in tracking artistic goodness. More broadly, the paper outlines an Affective Aesthetic Cognitivism that comprises emotions, cognitive expansion, and artistic value as core elements in theorizing about the transformative potential of art. \n\nKeywords \nAesthetic emotion; Epistemic emotion; Aesthetic cognitivism; Disinterestedness; Wonder; Art and Cognition; Neuroaesthetics",

To capture the\npsychology of urban life, I focus on aesthetic emotions that help explain the experiences of beauty,\ninterestingness, and belonging. Methodologically, I likewise argue for a middle way that combines\nphilosophical reflection with empirical research on the psychology and neuroscience of the built\nenvironment.

          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

Back-of-card images presented to the participant were identical across all five positions, and no target information appeared in any client-accessible form. A line-by-line code audit confirmed no pathway through which target information could reach the participant. Under these conditions, 106,996 participants contributed 35,945,094 trials from 2002–2018. Overall, they found the target in slightly fewer steps than expected by chance (mean = 2.9975 vs. 3.0; z = −10.73, Cohen's d = 0.0018). Although the deviation was extremely small, its direction and magnitude were estimated with high precision.\n\nPermutation tests preserved both the observed distribution of user click patterns and the exact distribution of generated targets while disrupting only the trial-level pairings between them. The observed mean fell more than 10 standard deviations below the permutation null mean, ruling out explanations based on interactions between user behavior and target distributions. Additional analyses found no evidence that target autocorrelation, duplicate records, pseudorandom algorithm artifacts, or behavioral strategies accounted for the effect.\n\nA preregistered analysis of data collected from 2021 – 2026 on an independently developed web platform found a consistent below-chance effect across approximately one million trials. However, data irregularities found in this study’s dataset precluded treating it as a satisfactory replication; it is best interpreted as convergent evidence, with primary evidential weight resting on the first study.\n\nAcross both datasets, a small but precisely estimated deviation from chance was observed under conditions designed to preclude access to target information.

This study examines how memory demands influence consumer decision quality across adulthood. In a task designed to mimic online shopping, 100 adults aged 25–80 chose products based on hypothetical consumer ratings that were compared either simultaneously with all rating information available (simultaneous trials) or after a delay which required recalling product ratings from memory (memory trials). Decision accuracy was lower on memory trials, and this memory-related cost was more pronounced with age. Older adults performed comparably to younger adults on simultaneous trials, so there was not an overall effect of age on decision quality. Unexpectedly, a subset of older adults spontaneously adopted a simplifying “summation” strategy, combining multiple attributes into a single composite value, reducing memory load. While this strategy defied task instructions, it may reflect the tendency for some older adults to adaptively compensate in real-world consumer contexts. These findings highlight how age-related memory abilities and strategic adaptation jointly shape consumer decision quality in memory-dependent contexts.",

We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction.

Participants received two alternative questions and could identify the more informative question based on its uncertainty (Unc) and probability of appearing at test (PTest). Despite the simplicity and transparency of the task, participants systematically deviated from the normative strategy. Computational modeling showed that most participants underweighted Unc and PTest and relied more strongly on PTest vs Unc. Strikingly, a substantial minority systematically preferred theleast-informative question, suggesting that they incorrectly reasoned about how uncertainty impacted informativeness. Moreover, in the absence of external feedback, sub-optimal strategies were amplified over time.

Results show that identical messages accompanied by either negative or neutral imagery increased worry about heatwaves and strengthened beliefs that climate change is exacerbating heat waves, whereas the same messages accompanied by positive imagery did not.

          "abstract": "Single-session interventions (SSIs) have become increasingly popular\npsychotherapeutic interventions in recent years due to their potential in providing a therapeutic\nand problem-focused experience in one encounter. However, less focus has been given to\ndissemination and implementation outcomes for SSIs within existing healthcare settings. This\nstudy evaluated the effectiveness and suitability for broad implementation of a personalized\nSingle Session Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (SSCBI) for depression and anxiety,\ndelivered in a university-based training clinic in Singapore. Using a mixed-methods design,\nadult therapy clients (N = 24) completed pre-treatment and follow-up measures assessing\ndepression, anxiety, and cognitive and affective subjective well-being. Quantitative analyses\nshowed reductions in both symptoms of depression (d = 0.94, p &lt; .001) and anxiety (d = 0.45,\np = .038). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clients (n = 9) and clinicians (n =\n9), and thematic analysis identified twelve key themes mapped to five implementation\noutcomes: acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and adoption. Both clients and\nclinicians reported high acceptability of the intervention, highlighting its structure, relevance,\nand utility in supporting coping skill development. Clinicians felt the protocol was feasible and\nappropriate for clients with relatively less complex presentations, with full protocol adherence\nachieved across all therapeutic sessions. Recruitment (63.5%) and completion (78.1%) rates\nexceeded the pre-registered feasibility benchmarks. These findings provide preliminary\nevidence supporting our personalized SSCBI as an effective and scalable brief psychological\nintervention, particularly suited for resource-limited settings. Future research should\ninvestigate its longer-term impact, cost-effectiveness, and broader applicability in community\nand primary care contexts.",

          "authors": "Ryno Kruger; Cassandra Levy; Stella F. Lourenco",
          "abstract": "Prior research with children suggests that—by 6 years of age—they endorse a gender-intelligence stereotype, whereby brilliance is associated with men, not women. This stereotype aligns with adult perceptions and may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in fields viewed as requiring intrinsic aptitude (i.e., brilliance). Here, we examined whether gender composition within occupations is used by children as a cue to intelligence. Across two experiments with 6- to 10-year-olds living in the United States (U.S.) and tested online, we manipulated the gender composition of workers in novel jobs and assessed children’s trait inferences and social preferences about those jobs. In Experiment 1, children judged intelligence and niceness for groups with majority-male or majority-female workers. In Experiment 2, we introduced scenarios emphasizing brilliance, perseverance, or physical strength, and assessed children’s judgments about the groups using both direct and indirect measures of trait attributions and social preferences. Across both studies, children showed no evidence of associating male-dominated jobs with intelligence. Instead, their judgments reflected in-group gender bias (i.e., preference for the group with their own-gender majority) and domain-specific stereotypes, such as “female = nice” and “male = strong.” Within this contemporary U.S. sample, children’s stereotypes about intelligence appeared more context-dependent and socially motivated than a simple, global “male = brilliance” association would suggest. We discuss the importance of considering both social affiliation and trait-specific reasoning—as well as cultural and developmental context—when characterizing the emergence of children’s gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "This study examined latent profiles of perfectionism in adolescence by integrating three perfectionism dimensions, trait anxiety, academic self-concept, and positive and negative affect. Participants were 365 first-year secondary education students (46% males, 54% females; M = 12.4 years, SD = 0.57) who completed validated self-report measures. Latent Profile Analysis identified four distinct perfectionism–adjustment profiles: Adaptive, Self-Critical, Socially Prescribed, and Non-Perfectionist. Profiles differed in socio-emotional adjustment and academic achievement, with Adaptive and Self-Critical students performing similarly and Socially Prescribed students achieving lower grades. Multigroup analyses confirmed that profile structures were equivalent across genders. The study advances theory by separating SOP-Striving and SOP-Critical in a person-centered framework and offers practical implications for interventions, highlighting the importance of emotional regulation, strengthening academic self-concept, and providing support tailored to each profile’s specific needs.",

          "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a core feature of many personality disorders. Dozens of dispositional aggressiveness scales exist with their own idiosyncratic factor structures, but they can be distilled down into six factors: Relational, Angry, Violent, Retaliatory, Intimate, and Alcohol. Yet it remains unknown how this comprehensive factor structure might change or remain stable at relatively high levels of aggressiveness — knowledge with considerable relevance to the study of personality pathology. To examine this, I used factor mixture modeling on self-report data from 1,447 diverse undergraduates from a Minority Serving Institution, which combined the person-centered and variable centered approaches of profile and factor analyses. Analyses revealed three latent profiles that were initially characterized by high (~14% of sample), medium (~41%), or low (~45%) levels of all six aggressiveness factors. Looking at the profile-specific factor solutions, five of the six original factors re-emerged with considerable similarity across profiles. These factors’ profile-specific configurations and correlations portrayed a shift, in which more aggressive profiles were characterized less by angry tendencies towards retaliation and more by their antagonistic traits.",

          "abstract": "Background: Major global policy organizations (including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Economic Forum) increasingly treat mastery (and closely related factors) as cross-cutting priorities for health, education, and workforce success. These frameworks call on governments to cultivate environments that enhance people’s sense of mastery. Despite this growing consensus, a critical gap persists: we lack longitudinal, cross-cultural evidence necessary to validate mastery as a global target for health and social policy.\nMethods: To address this gap, we used an outcome-wide longitudinal design and analyzed nationally representative data from 23 countries/territories (N=207,919) to evaluate if baseline mastery predicted 56 health/well-being outcomes approximately one year later. \nResults: Higher baseline mastery was prospectively associated with better outcomes across 48 (of 56) outcomes. Associations were largest for psychological and relational well-being outcomes; associations with entrenched structural roles (e.g., employment) were minimal. Further, benefits were not uniform across countries/territories and amplified in contexts with higher human development index scores (HDI, a summary measure of health, education, and living standards). The correlation between HDI and breadth of mastery’s benefits was r=0.81. And the breadth of mastery’s benefits was also greater in more individualistic contexts (r=0.86).\nConclusions: Mastery is a robust predictor of subsequent well-being across diverse contexts, but its influence appears context-dependent, with broader benefits in higher HDI and more individualistic settings.",

          "abstract": "Background. People in a suicidal crisis feel forced to choose among coping, waiting passively, or attempting suicide. They must continually decide whether to persist in their efforts to cope or quit.  One hypothesis is that suicidal behavior reflects a preference for immediate escape over longer-term prospects, but findings from delay discounting studies have been mixed. Importantly, these studies relied on hypothetical choices without real waiting and did not require people to re‑evaluate ongoing actions as events unfolded. We examined (1) quitting vs. re‑engagement after setbacks and (2) calibration of persistence in depression and attempted suicide. \nMethods. Adults from a mid‑ to late‑life depression cohort (N=277; 87 attempters, 59 ideators, 63 depressed, 68 controls) completed the Willingness‑to‑Wait task, in which brief persistence (~3 s) maximized reward, whereas longer waits were counterproductive. Immediate quitting was modeled with multilevel logistic regression; quitting latency with Cox mixed‑effects models. Exploratory analyses examined attempt lethality and age of first attempt. Sensitivity analyses accounted for impulsivity, cognition, and personality.\nResults. Suicide attempters were more prone to quit immediately after a prior-trial failure than other groups. Once a wait began, attempters and depressed non-suicidal participants over-persisted relative to controls. Earlier age of first attempt, but not attempt lethality, was linked with stronger loss-triggered quitting and overpersistence. Findings were robust to confounds. \nConclusions. Depression was associated with maladaptive overpersistence, whereas suicide attempts were additionally predicted by loss-triggered disengagement. Behavioral interventions targets aimed at improving re-engagement after failures may help people problem-solve more effectively in a suicidal crisis.",

          "abstract": "The social content of paranoid delusions (that others are ‘out to get me’) has led some to propose that paranoia stems from specific abnormalities in social cognition. For instance, in ‘social hallucinations’ paranoid perceivers are more likely to falsely attribute harmful intention and agency to unstructured, randomly moving visual patterns. However, recent work has revealed that paranoia is marked by domain-general changes in belief updating that affect learning and inference across all contexts. Whether domain-general changes in paranoid cognition are sufficient to explain social hallucinations—without invoking breakdowns in specifically-social cognitive processes—has not been systematically investigated. To test this possibility, across two experiments we examined probabilistic reversal learning and perceived animacy in chasing displays in individuals with high and low levels of paranoia. Participants completed one of four probabilistic reversal learning pre-training conditions (social/non-social × easy/hard) before a perceived animacy task where high confidence false alarms indicated an individual’s proneness to social hallucinations. High-paranoia participants showed increased win-switching in probabilistic reversal learning and elevated high-confidence false alarms in perceived animacy, with atypicalities in general learning behaviour predicting the severity of social hallucinations —suggesting linked mechanisms. Hierarchical Gaussian Filter modeling revealed context-dependent mechanisms: when volatility was salient, prior volatility beliefs (μ₃) linked win-switching, social hallucinations, and paranoia; when social context was salient, meta-volatility learning rates (ω₃) mediated these relationships. These findings are consistent with a picture where social hallucinations have their genesis in domain-general belief updating deficits, advancing our mechanistic understanding of how paranoid percepts and cognitions arise.",

          "abstract": "Prediction error (PE) is the degree of conflict between predictions and new information. For a binary reward outcome, PE may be signed (positive if the outcome was correctly predicted and negative if the outcome was incorrectly predicted), or unsigned (absolute value of “surprise”). Using a “variable choice” paradigm, De Loof et al. (2018) examined the role of PE in one-shot learning of unknown translations of known words, showing associative memory for the translation to be greater when (financial) reward was more unexpected, and lesser when an expected reward was not received (i.e., signed PE); an effect they replicated in several subsequent studies. However, previous work on PE in declarative memory has assumed that memory is greater when an outcome is more unexpected (i.e., unsigned PE). We replicated De Loof et al.’s paradigm with and without financial reward, and found that memory was explained slightly better by unsigned PE (Experiment 1A-1B). However, we then identified a potential confound in the paradigm which could explain results without any role of PE. Simulations confirmed this possibility, and we designed and tested a modified version of the paradigm (Experiment 2). Results were inconsistent with the PE account and suggested that findings from variable choice paradigms might be an artefact of the experimental design. Overall, we conclude that variable choice paradigms may not be well suited to investigate the role of PE in one-shot declarative learning, and that the purported role of signed PE in declarative memory requires further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Near misses are negative gambling outcomes that are close to the desired win. Previous research has shown that individuals experiencing gambling problems (PG) cognitively process these events differently than normal controls. Especially reward-related brain areas have been shown to exhibit abnormal activation patterns in PG. The current study aims at investigating group differences between individuals experiencing gambling problems and normal controls during near misses and full loss experiences. It also tests risky decisions immediately after these gambling outcomes as revealed by fMRI methods using a “wheel-of-fortune” paradigm. Additionally, behavioral measures were taken. Group differences were observed in prefrontal areas that have previously been associated with reward, conflict, and response inhibition, as well as in the amygdala and in the putamen. While individuals experiencing gambling problems consistently showed stronger brain responses to the feedback categories of full losses compared to near misses, controls showed the opposite pattern. During decisions to continue gambling or quit a trial, PGs showed stronger brain responses in reward-related orbitofrontal areas and reported a stronger urge to gamble on. Gambling scores measured by questionnaires corroborated this specific activation pattern in decisions to gamble on. Taken together, the results might indicate that individuals experiencing gambling problems experience enhanced conflict, impaired inhibition, and increased reward anticipation after near misses.",

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) constitute a highly scalable, low-barrier approach for early intervention. In this study, a micro-randomized trial was conducted to investigate the proximal (short-term) and distal (longer-term) effects of different EMIs based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).\nMethods: 72 participants at increased risk for developing mental disorders comprised the sample (67.6% female). They completed a 16-day intervention phase during which they received four pre-ecological momentary assessments (pre-EMA) at semi-random moments each day assessing proximal outcomes negative (NA) and positive affect (PA). Each day, two randomly-selected pre-EMAs were immediately followed by an EMI. Thirty minutes following each pre-EMA, NA and PA were assessed again. Before and after the intervention phase, distal outcomes symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were assessed.\nResults: Multilevel models showed proximal improvements in PA following EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT. NA decreased following positive psychology; ACT specifically improved NA during moments of higher NA at pre-EMA. The CBT-based EMI neither improved NA nor PA. Distal improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were observed.\nDiscussion: This study provides support for the beneficial immediate effects of EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT on affect; symptoms of psychopathology and well-being improved on a distal level. Future research should further investigate the benefits of different EMIs in crucial moments (e.g., high momentary NA) to develop adequate just-in-time support.",

The type of effect that is manifest is contingent upon the activation state of the reflexive oculomotor system at the time the effect is generated. However, early work assessing the perceptual effects of IOR using temporal order judgments (TOJ; Posner, Rafal, Choate &amp; Vaughan, 1985; Maylor, 1985; Klein, Schmidt &amp; Muller, 1998) showed no effect on arrival time judgments, suggesting IOR was, in these studies, acting at a post-perceptual information processing stage. We examined this theoretical and empirical inconsistency in a TOJ task, wherein participants were required to make either a prosaccade (output form) or antisaccade (input form) in response the onset a spatially uninformative peripheral cue, and subsequently execute a TOJ or speeded colour identification response. We found inhibited perceptual processing for the first time affecting TOJs when the input form was generated, but no inhibitory effect on perception when the output form was generated.

Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. These mechanisms are (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate, or (3) upvaluing unchosen actions. A systematic parameter search and a policy gradient meta-learning algorithm both show that agents can adaptively increase variability with each of those strategies. Next, we fitted our model on existing datasets with humans, pigeons, and rats as subjects in adversarial environments.

          "abstract": "Background: By studying how individuals in an \"at-risk\" state of psychosis learn about threat and safety cues – specifically, how they develop and unlearn fear responses to neutral cues - we might better understand the mechanisms leading to heightened arousal and fear that are characteristic of acute psychotic episodes.\nMethods: At-risk individuals (N = 88; of which 28 fulfilled ultra-high-risk criteria on the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States interview and 60 scored above a predefined threshold in the Community assessment of Psychic Experiences questionnaire) and healthy controls (N = 44) underwent a standardized and validated differential fear conditioning paradigm including an acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. The main outcomes of interest were the late positive potential, fear-potentiated startle, and self-reported ratings of valence, arousal, fear, and expectancy elicited by the conditioned stimuli (CS).\nResults: The at-risk group exhibited diminished fear learning, evident in significantly reduced differentiation between the CS+ vs. CS- in the valence ratings, compared to controls. Additionally, they demonstrated impaired fear extinction, evident in valence and arousal ratings, in which their CS differentiation showed a slower reduction than the controls. There were no group differences in late positive potential responses.\nConclusion: At risk mental states appear to be associated with problems in distinguishing dangerous from safe stimuli and a diminished ability to adjust affective responses to conditioned stimuli based on new information, while the late-positive potential and fear-potentiated startle are unaltered. Early interventions could focus on recalibrating subjective emotional evaluations of fear-associated events.",

In this study (N = 152 participants, 93.9% women, 4.7% men, 1.4% other, Mage = 19.57, SDage = 3.25), we investigated how facial characteristics (i.e., gaze direction) and individual traits (i.e., Big Five and schizotypal personality traits) modulate behavioral responses to the perception of approaching emotional facial expressions (angry, fearful, sad, and neutral faces). We assessed motor responses using force plates to investigate spontaneous postural adjustments. Results show that angry and fearful faces elicit defensive responses characterized by backward body sway (i.e., avoidance). Although facial features further qualified those defensive reactions with averted gazes in fear stimuli eliciting a relative approach, we did not find conclusive evidence for the role of personality in these responses. Results are discussed in light of socio-functional and appraisal models of emotion perception. The present study underlines the relevance of studying postural sway to assess adaptive avoidance of threatening social stimulus.",

However, it remains unclear whether these alterations reflect vulnerability or state effects of active depression, and which behaviours support sustained recovery after remission.\n\nObjective\n\nTo dissociate state-like, trait-like, and remission-related alterations in reinforcement learning and value-based decision making in depression.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\n\nUnmedicated adults (N=195) were recruited between 2013 and 2019, including individuals with current depression (n=49), individuals remitted from depression (n=50), first-degree non-depressed relatives of individuals with depression (n=36), and healthy controls (n=60).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\nParticipants completed a 4-armed bandit (4AB) reinforcement learning task under volatile uncertainty and a gambling task assessing value-based decision making under risk. Computational parameters indexing reward and punishment learning rates, outcome sensitivity, and decision noise (4AB), and risk aversion, loss aversion, and inverse temperature (gambling) were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian modelling with Bayesian model averaging. Group differences and associations with symptom dimensions derived from confirmatory factor analysis were examined.\n\nResults\n\nParticipants were 68.7% female, mean age=27.3 (SD=8.9). Punishment learning rate differed significantly across groups (F₍3,191₎=5.43, p=.001), driven by lower punishment learning rate in the remitted participants compared with all other groups. The remitted group also had lower lapse rates, indicating less random choice (F₍3,191₎=4.37, p=.005). By contrast, in the gambling task depressed and at-risk participants had higher inverse temperature relative to controls (F₍3,191₎=2.93, p=.03), suggesting more consistent use of values to guide choices. Reward and punishment sensitivity (4AB) and risk and loss aversion (gambling) did not differ across groups. Among non-depressed participants, lower punishment learning rates were associated with greater apathy (r=-0.18, p=.033) and anhedonia (r=-0.18, p=.035).\n\nConclusions and Relevance\n\nThese findings suggest a dissociation between state-, trait-, and recovery-associated computational phenotypes in depression. Reduced learning from negative outcomes appears specific to remitted depression, possibly reflecting adaptive changes that support sustained recovery without medication. Computational measures of learning dynamics may help clarify mechanisms of recovery and inform targets for treatment and relapse prevention.",

          "abstract": "Perception is shaped not only by current sensory inputs, but also by recent stimulus history – a phenomenon known as serial dependence (SD). Perceptual adaptation is a form of repulsive SD, whereby perception shifts away from the previously experienced stimuli. Vestibular and visual self-motion perception exhibit perceptual adaptation, both within and across the two modalities. However, it is unknown whether this requires directed attention to the self-motion stimuli. In this preregistered study, 61 participants experienced a series of vestibular or visual self-motion stimuli. Before each stimulus, the participants were cued to perform either a distractor task (to divert attention away from the self-motion stimulus) or to discriminate their self-motion heading (right or left of straight-ahead). We tested whether several \"prior\" stimuli with biased headings, but with diverted attention (distractor task), would nonetheless lead to adaptation in heading perception on the following trial. Experiment 1 tested this within each modality separately; Experiment 2 tested cross-modal adaptation. Significant adaptation was seen in both uni-modal conditions (vestibular and visual) and in both cross-modal conditions (visual→vestibular and vestibular→visual). The adaptation magnitude was only modestly, albeit significantly, reduced in comparison to previously published results with attended stimuli. Thus, repulsive adaptation to self-motion stimuli persists without directed attention, even across modalities. The observed cross-modal effects likely point to the inherent linkage between visual and vestibular self-motion processing.",

Analyses revealed no robust overall differences in psychopathology or dark personality traits, directly refuting maladjustment stereotypes. CNM practitioners reported significantly higher scores in sexual sensation seeking, resilience, autonomy, and personal growth, alongside lower personal distress. Importantly, intersectional analyses indicated that LGTBIQA+ monogamous individuals exhibited the highest levels of anxious attachment and psychopathology, suggesting CNM may buffer these negative outcomes within the LGBTQIA+ community. \nConclusions\nThese findings challenge deficit-based narratives, indicating that CNM is not associated with elevated psychological risk but is linked to psychological strengths.

          "abstract": "Error monitoring is a key cognitive control process that enables individuals to evaluate their actions and detect failures in goal-directed behavior. A well-established neural correlate of error monitoring is the error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential that emerges within 100 ms of an incorrect response. A landmark study by Hajcak et al. (2005) found that ERN amplitude is modulated by the motivational significance of errors. In Experiment 1, errors in high-reward trials elicited larger ERNs than those in low-reward trials. In Experiment 2, ERNs were larger when participants were subject to social evaluation compared to a no-evaluation condition. The present study aims to conduct a high-powered (at least 126 participants after exclusions for both Experiment 1 and 2), multi-lab replication of this research as part of the #EEGManyLabs initiative (Pavlov et al., 2021). We will manipulate motivational context via points-based monetary incentives and social evaluation using a flanker task. We predict more pronounced ERN amplitudes in high- versus low-reward trials, and under social evaluation compared to the control condition. By testing the robustness of these effects, this study will critically assess whether motivational significance consistently modulates early error processing. If successful, the replication would strengthen the claim that the ERN functions as a motivationally tuned signal, integrating error detection with goal-relevant context. If not, it would raise important questions about how motivation interacts with error monitoring. In either case, the study will offer valuable insights into the motivational dynamics of cognitive control, with implications for both theory and experimental research.",

          "abstract": "Football club engagement in identity leadership has been found to positively contribute to fan-club relationships and spectator feelings of safety at matches. However, limited research has explored how clubs show identity leadership in their communication with fans. To address this, we conducted a Framework Analysis of Facebook posts and emails to supporters from two football clubs (Hibernian FC and Liverpool FC) across three weeks of the football season (N = 780). Our analysis identified that football club communications often use content from players and managers to define what it means to be a group member (i.e., a ‘Red’ or a ‘Hibee’) (entrepreneurship), to acknowledge and demonstrate delivering on the opinions and expectations of supporters (advancement), and to promote the importance of supporters to the club (impresarioship). We conclude that football clubs illustrate identity leadership via official communication channels, but that the content of these messages predominantly come from players and managers (i.e., those who can be considered prototypical group members). These insights are key for the development of club communication guidance designed to promote positive fan-club relationships.",

          "abstract": "Living with chronic pain presents significant challenges and disruptions, thus motivating the use of coping strategies to manage pain and its impact in everyday life. Yet how individuals cope with chronic pain and why some people show better functional outcomes is not clearly understood. Previous literature on coping has often focused on describing different coping strategies and their comparative effectiveness, often with the assumption that some are overall more adaptive. Existing theoretical models of coping often lack descriptions of how factors unfold over time and assume relationships between factors remain stable. However, pain coping is not only influenced by continuously changing internal and external contextual factors, but by changing interactions as the process reiterates over time. Moreover, the short- and long-term efficacy of different coping approaches depends on individual appraisal and changing contextual demands. In this review, we first synthesise selected theoretical models of coping in health-related stress or pain that were identified through a systematic search. Next, we present the ‘Dynamic Interaction Model of Coping in Chronic Pain’ which builds on concepts from the stress and coping literature to address gaps in the selected models. Specifically, we outline how five central factors: 1) controllability, 2) predictability, 3) salience, 4) resources, and 5) motivation, interact in a dynamic coping process guided by updating predictions, feedback, and expectations. The model outlines putative pathways of moment-to-moment and long-term adaptations to chronic pain, and potential targets for intervention.",

Across two studies, we investigated how lingering romantic attachment to an ex-partner affects value-based decision-making under different types of uncertainty (future-oriented versus probabilistic). In Study 1 (N=144), we showed that stronger romantic attachment to an ex-partner led to making riskier decisions under affective influence, resulting in suboptimal decisions that accumulated to indirect costs exceeding $50 during an hour-long experiment. In Study 2 (N = 419), we found that stronger residual feelings toward an ex-partner are associated with steeper devaluation of future rewards. Specifically, individuals who struggled to move on from a breakup discounted future rewards such that their value diminished by half approximately two weeks earlier than those less attached. These findings may have practical implications for informing relationship counseling and economic policy, as nearly half of those who experience a breakup in the past year may be significantly affected, potentially  perceiving future-oriented investments (e.g., monetary savings) as less desirable than those who have moved on.",

In a within-subjects design, participants listened to instructions either using a shared feature or enumerating coordinates of individual objects We find that there is no one way of referring that is universally more effective, but that the optimal way of referring depends on the type of common feature and the number of objects. When the shared feature is prominent, such as color, and multiple objects need to be identified, referring to it results in shorter identification times and fewer errors. In contrast, when the shared feature is less salient, such as pattern, referring by location tends to be better.",

Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified two overarching themes that promote positive fan-club relationships: the importance of communication and club action on fan concerns. The communication theme split into two subthemes: club communication to fans, and opportunities for fans to communicate back to their club. Identity leadership dimensions, specifically identity entrepreneurship and advancement, cut across all themes.

          "authors": "Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "I propose that imagery's origins lie in interoceptive processing, the phylogenetically ancient system linking internal bodily states to valence, emotion, and motivational salience (Craig, 2009; Barrett, 2017). Interoceptive signals inherently specify survival-relevant goals: hunger with approach, threat-arousal with avoidance, sexual arousal with pursuit. This makes interoception the necessary foundation for any planning system because planning requires knowing what you are planning for: which bodily states and emotions to pursue or avoid. Motor imagery emerged first, extending forward models to enable offline action planning. Because survival-relevant motor actions already involved interoceptive states, motor imagery inherited interoceptive integration from these forward models. Motor imagery worked well for first- person action planning directly coupled to immediate motor execution. However, as social complexity increased, organisms needed to simulate scenarios involving others; tracking rival alliances, predicting dominance conflicts, monitoring mating competitors. Here, organisms faced a discriminability problem rooted in the low-dimensional nature of autonomic arousal (Barrett, 2017). The same autonomic pattern can occur across different social situations (dominance encounters, rival conflicts, mating opportunities) that demand distinct behavioral responses. Visual imagery evolved to solve this discriminability problem by binding distinctive sensory features with interoceptive states. This binding makes simulations goal-directed: imagining a dominant rival automatically activates the associated arousal pattern and avoidance tendency, while imagining a mating opportunity activates approach motivation. Mental simulations therefore evolved as multimodal representations where sensory and interoceptive components are bound during construction itself, creating images that inherently possess valence and motivation, not as subsequent responses to neutral sensory simulations but as constitutive features of mental images themselves (cf Silvanto &amp; Nagai, 2025).",

Research has mainly focused on youth prevalence, with limited attention to occupational drivers in informal work settings. Physically demanding jobs may encourage tramadol use to manage pain and fatigue.\nObjective: To examine occupational patterns and drivers of non-medical tramadol use among artisans, small-scale miners, and farmers in the Western Region of Ghana.\nDesign: Analytical cross-sectional study using secondary data from a previously published community-based survey.\nSetting: Wassa Amenfi West Municipality, Western Region of Ghana.\nParticipants: 300 respondents engaged in informal occupations, including artisans, small-scale miners, and farmers.\nMeasurements: Self-reported lifetime tramadol use, frequency, daily dosage, duration of use, and co-consumption with alcohol and energy drinks. Occupation type was the main independent variable. Covariates included age, sex, education, marital status, alcohol use, and energy drink consumption. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to examine associations between occupation and tramadol use patterns.\nFindings: Non-medical tramadol use was highest among small-scale miners (87%) and artisans (78%), compared to farmers (63%) [2,12]. Daily use, higher dosages, and longer duration were more common among miners and artisans (p&lt;0.01). Co-use with alcohol and energy drinks was also more frequent in these occupational groups. Occupation type was significantly associated with patterns of tramadol use.\nConclusions: Non-medical tramadol use in the Western Region of Ghana is strongly influenced by occupational demands. Workers use tramadol to cope with pain, fatigue, and productivity pressure rather than solely for recreational purposes. Interventions should address workplace conditions, improve access to pain management, and strengthen regulation of informal drug markets.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Research on inhibitory processes in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is essential, as these mechanisms constitute the neurocognitive substrate of executive functions such as self-control, emotional regulation, and behavioural adaptation, processes that are fundamental for personal autonomy and social inclusion. These mechanisms are particularly vulnerable in populations with NDDs associated with intellectual disability, such as Williams syndrome (WS) and Down syndrome (DS). Although executive deficits in these syndromes are well documented, the specific profile of impairment across different inhibitory components (perceptual, cognitive, and motor) remains fragmented. A precise delineation of the impairment profile for each of these components is indispensable for advancing the understanding of the cognitive bases of these disorders and for developing specific evidence-based intervention programmes.\n\nMethods. The sample consisted of four groups of 27 participants each: an experimental group with WS, an experimental group with DS, and two control groups (CG) of individuals with typical development (TD), each individually matched to one of the clinical groups. To examine cognitive and motor inhibition processes, two inhibition tasks were administered: the Day–Night task and the Go/No-go task, respectively.\n\nResults. In the Day–Night task, the WS group showed significantly lower performance in interference conditions than both the DS group and its matched CG, whereas the overall performance of the DS group did not differ from its CG. In the Go/No-go task, both the WS and DS groups committed a higher proportion of omission errors (associated with inattention) than their respective CG, with the DS group showing a higher proportion than the WS group. However, the difference in the proportion of commission errors (associated with impulsivity) between the clinical groups was not significant.\n\nConclusions. Results from the Day–Night task indicate cognitive inhibition difficulties in the WS group, whereas no clear evidence of such difficulties was observed in the DS group. The Go/No-go task results suggest that both WS and DS groups may present deficits in sustained attention, while their motor inhibitory capacity does not show clear evidence of impairment.\n\nKeywords: Executive functions; cognitive inhibition; motor inhibition; Williams syndrome; Down syndrome",

          "abstract": "As worries mount over AI-generated misinformation, questions remain about its influence on people’s thinking and how this influence can be mitigated. The present study investigated the efficacy of an active, versus passive, source-focused inoculation to reduce trust in AI-generated information and its effects on relevant beliefs. Participants (N = 400) read either a misleading AI-generated article about the dangers of nanoparticles in sunscreen, or a neutral control article. The misleading article was either preceded by a passive inoculation explaining how AI-generated information can be misleading, an active inoculation that additionally included an educational activity, or no intervention. The misleading AI article significantly influenced participants’ beliefs about nanoparticles in sunscreen. Both passive and active inoculation reduced general trust in AI-generated information, as well as the impact of the specific misinformation on beliefs, with active inoculation demonstrating larger effects; however, neither intervention eliminated the influence of misinformation on beliefs. These findings suggest that source-focused inoculation is more effective at reducing the impacts of AI-generated misinformation when it incorporates an active component. However, the continued influence of the misinformation even in the active-inoculation condition calls for alternative or combination interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background\nSocial cognitive deficits are common across many psychiatric conditions and contribute to broader social dysfunction. One hypothesized mechanism involves altered basic visual processing, which may disrupt the perception of low-level social cues and, in turn, compromise broader social cognitive processes. Here, we examined relations between basic visual processing and different levels of social cognition in a transdiagnostic youth sample.\n\nMethods\nA sample of 148 youth, ranging from healthy individuals to individuals with neuropsychiatric diagnoses and significant social dysfunction, completed two measures of basic visual processing (contrast sensitivity and visual integration) and a battery of social cognition tasks spanning lower-level (gaze perception) to mid-level (emotion recognition) to higher-level (theory of mind) social cognition. We used a four-level path model to test whether basic visual processing predicts gaze perception, which in turn predicts emotion recognition, which predicts theory of mind.\n\nResults\nPoorer contrast sensitivity and visual integration were associated with less precise gaze perception, which was, in turn, associated with worse emotion recognition, which was associated with worse theory of mind. This four-level path model demonstrated good fit and showed superior fit compared to alternative models.\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest that basic visual processing influences the perception of basic social cues (e.g., gaze direction), which subsequently impairs more complex social perception and inference. Notably, this study extends prior observations from individuals with chronic schizophrenia to a transdiagnostic youth sample, indicating that altered basic visual processing may be a shared mechanism contributing to social cognitive deficits across psychiatric disorders and illness stages.",

          "authors": "Lindsey Tepfer; Mark Allen Thornton",
          "abstract": "Inferring others’ thoughts is a challenging task, but the results of such inferences play major roles in everyday interactions. Prior research has shown that knowledge of others’ mental states informs judgements of their personalities and future behavior. However, such studies have faced a tradeoff between internal and external validity, which has made it difficult to differentiate the inference of mental states from the process of using mental state knowledge. This study uses films featuring internal monologue narration – spoken audio representing what a character is thinking – to overcome this challenge. In each of two films, we identified clips featuring internal monologues and silenced different halves of these clips to create two versions of the same film with different mental state content. Participants were randomly assigned to watch one version of each film in the fMRI scanner (N = 28) or online (N = 200), with the latter making ratings of the main characters’ traits throughout the film. We find that access to the same mental state information aligns participants’ brain activity while listening to monologues and in subsequent clips. This suggests that the context of knowing the characters’ thoughts shapes narrative processing. Internal monologues also causally shaped online ratings of characters’ traits and correlated neural pattern similarities that emerged spontaneously in the brains of scanner participants. Effects were observed across lateral temporal cortex, as well as in prefrontal and parietal regions. Together these findings show how mental state knowledge, independent of inference, shapes downstream social cognition in naturalistic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs) are positive, everyday supports and opportunities that are theorised to promote adolescent wellbeing and buffer adversity. We used the youth-co-designed #BeeWell survey to provide the largest contemporary, population-based estimates for adolescents in England, examine social patterning, and test the latent structure of BCEs. Items were mapped to the 10-item BCE framework. We derived a 0–10 BCE count using prespecified thresholds for single items and data-driven cut-points for multi-item scales, and factor-based domain scores from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The analytical sample comprised 120,645 pupils from 291 schools. Regression models estimated associations with gender/sexual identity, ethnicity, special educational needs, free school meal eligibility, neighbourhood deprivation, and school year. BCEs were common yet unequally distributed. Prevalence was highest for free time (92.7%) and a positive home environment (87.1); the upper-tail rule yielded lower prevalences for multi-item scales (e.g., self-esteem 19.2%). The BCE count was approximately normal. In adjusted models, sexual and gender minority pupils and cisgender girls reported fewer BCEs than cisgender heterosexual boys. Socioeconomic disadvantage, special educational needs, and older school years were associated with fewer BCEs. Ethnic differences were mixed (Asian and Black pupils higher than White; Chinese lower). Factor analyses supported three domains: School Connectedness, Home/Community Support, and Psychosocial Wellbeing, with Parent/Carer relationships retained as a correlated observed indicator. A dual-metric approach, using counts for surveillance and domain scores for targeting, can inform policy and practice to strengthen belonging and trusted adult relationships in schools, sustain community provision, and reduce participation barriers for disadvantaged pupils.",

          "authors": "Hui Yun LI; Ho Nam Cheung",
          "abstract": "AI chatbots are rapidly becoming a common place where adolescents first disclose personal experiences, because the interaction is private, always available, and often feels lower-stakes than telling another person. Recent U.S. evidence suggests that about one in eight adolescents and young adults already use generative-AI chatbots for mental health advice, which makes AI disclosure a realistic candidate for a stepped-care “Step 0” contact-an upstream, pre-service entry point that occurs before any formal assessment or treatment, and that could be bridged to professional help-seeking when need is indicated. The key question is not only whether youth disclose to AI, but which internal processes make AI disclosure more likely, and therefore how Step 0 should be interpreted across different young people. Daydreaming styles provide a tractable map of self-generated thought that should shape disclosure tendencies. Classic work differentiates positive-constructive daydreaming (pleasant imagery and future planning), guilty-dysphoric daydreaming (negative, guilt- and fear-of-failure content), and poor attentional control (fleeting thoughts and difficulty sustaining focus). These styles plausibly influence what becomes salient enough to externalise and the motive for using an AI “listener” (elaboration and meaning-making versus offloading distress or fragmented attention). Self-compassion then acts as a regulator of threat and shame: it is associated with reduced shame-proneness and more adaptive emotion regulation, which can lower the impulse to externalise distress for relief while supporting clearer articulation when inner material is constructive. This regulatory pattern may differ in ADHD, where spontaneous mind wandering and attentional control problems are pronounced. Using a large online survey of youth from the United States and Hong Kong (N = 2,115), we tested these pathways via structural equation modelling with multi-group analyses (ADHD vs peers). Youth with ADHD differed markedly in daydreaming styles and self-compassion, and the daydreaming to AI disclosure pathways diverged by group. Self-compassion was context-dependent: it predicted reduced AI disclosure in ADHD, but in the general population it amplified disclosure linked to positive-constructive daydreaming while constraining disclosure linked to guilty-dysphoric and poor attentional-control daydreaming.",

          "abstract": "Spatial representations of the objects in our environments are necessary for effective goal-directed actions. These representations can be produced with respect to the self (i.e., egocentrically) and/or to surrounding objects (i.e., allocentrically). For the latter, one (spatial) factor of influence is landmark proximity to target. This factor shapes allocentric representations and informs future memory-guided actions, in both impoverished and rich scenes. More recent work has suggested that cognitive factors (e.g., object semantics) can also influence allocentric coding. While these factors have been shown to separately affect allocentric coding, here we investigated how both spatial and cognitive factors affect allocentric coding in naturalistic environments. In a memory-guided virtual reality (VR) experiment, semantically-related targets (i.e., local objects, which are movable and manipulable, such as a cup) were presented on congruent or incongruent anchors (i.e., large, immovable objects, predictive of local object locations). After an imperceptible anchor shift (or not), a target had to be placed in its remembered position. Placement performance results indicated that anchors were, indeed, used to build up spatial target representations. Additional placement behaviour analysis further revealed that proximity-to-anchor shaped spatial coding, with similar effects across semantic anchor modulations (i.e., semantically congruent and incongruent anchor shifts). Taken together, we found that spatial target representations are differentially sensitive to contextual factors (i.e., spatial vs. cognitive).",

          "abstract": "Recent research in speech perception highlights categorization consistency—the degree of trial-by-trial variability in response—as a more informative metric of individual differences in speech categorization over how gradient underlying category structure individuals have. However, its relevance to broader language functions remains unknown. In Experiment 1, English-speaking adults (n=57) completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, rating a speech continuum on a continuous scale, alongside two language assessments. Results showed that a greater consistency in speech categorization strongly predicted better language abilities (accounting for 29% of the variance), whereas categorization gradiency showed no such relationship. Experiment 2 (n=76) added a VAS task in which participants performed the same task with images from a visual continuum, to determine whether the observed effects reflected domain-general categorization mechanisms. Replicating and extending the findings of Experiment 1, speech categorization consistency again emerged as a robust predictor of language outcomes, with an even larger effect size (~40% of the variance). Critically, commonality regression revealed that a substantial proportion of variance in language performance was uniquely attributable to speech, but not visual, categorization consistency. These provide compelling evidence for a speech-specific and robust link between speech categorization consistency and general language function.",

The present study provides the first nationally representative data on ACEs in Serbia while critically examining current scoring practices and proposing a novel normalized scoring system. Data were collected from a stratified national sample of adults in Serbia using the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ; WHO, 2018). Thirteen ACE domains were assessed with binary and scaled items. Prevalence was calculated using two recommended WHO scoring methods (binary and frequency), and a new normalized scoring approach in which each domain was rescaled to a 0–1 range. Criterion validity was tested against trauma-related symptoms and physical health outcomes. Prevalence estimates varied dramatically depending on the scoring method: physical abuse was reported by 50.2% (binary) versus 7.8% (frequency), and emotional abuse by 78.8% versus 23.9%. Binary scoring suggested that over half of respondents experienced four or more ACEs, while frequency scoring indicated that 37% reported none. The normalized scoring approach produced more nuanced distributions and showed consistent associations with both trauma symptoms and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and neurological problems. Findings underscore the need for standardized ACE scoring methods. The proposed normalized approach enhances psychometric clarity, facilitates cross-cultural comparability, and improves the utility of ACE assessment for epidemiological research, clinical practice, and public health interventions.",

Using the 2023 Plasticity of Well-Being Summer Workshop as a case example, we explored how academic spaces might be intentionally designed to nurture scholars’ whole selves rather than reinforce norms of hierarchy, productivity, and disconnection. Analyzing focus groups and interviews among 30 participants, organizers, and speakers, we employed a collaborative autoethnographic methodology to highlight how the workshop enabled vulnerability, authenticity, and a sense of belonging rarely experienced in traditional academic settings. Guided by two research questions: (1) how do organizers and speakers describe their experiences and intentions planning and implementing the conference? and (2) what elements most contributed to the conference’s success? Organizers described intentionally centering the voices of emerging scholars, broadening representation, and reducing power dynamics to create conditions for relational learning. Findings are presented through the themes of resisting the status quo, broadening representation, redirected power and hierarchy, authentic connections, and physical and psychological nourishment. Findings underscore that well-being is not merely an individual pursuit but emerges through relational and structural care. Implications of the study suggest reimagining conferences as spaces of collective care offers a promising pathway for promoting well-being in academia.",

          "abstract": "While increasing age has been consistently associated with a safer driving style, the role of driving experience and its interplay with age remains insufficiently understood. Using a large community-based sample of drivers, this study aimed to clarify the relative, joint, and interactive contributions of age, driving experience, and gender to the propensity to engage in dangerous driving behaviors. The frequency of such behaviors was assessed using the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI). The sample included 1,882 drivers (50.9% men) with a mean age of 38.11 years (range 18–79), a mean driving experience of 15.94 years, and a mean annual mileage of 6,000–9,000 km. Results indicated that increasing age was associated with a reduced propensity for dangerous driving behavior, but only after sufficient driving experience had been acquired. Furthermore, greater driving experience predicted higher dangerous driving behavior in younger and middle-aged drivers, while remaining unrelated in older drivers. Notably, this pattern was more pronounced among men than women. The observed interaction may be explained by the fact that novice drivers, regardless of age, possess lower driving skills due to their limited experience, which may encourage a more cautious driving style, offsetting the greater risk-taking typically observed in youth. However, once sufficient experience is gained, younger drivers demonstrate a marked tendency toward greater risk-taking behavior. These findings emphasize the need for multifactorial approaches that account for the interactions among contributing variables to guide the implementation of effective road-safety measures.",

Correlated-factor, higher-order, and bifactor graded response models were compared, with bifactor models providing the best overall fit across domains. General factors accounted for substantial proportions of reliable variance, although the degree of subscale specificity varied. Several subscales, including Adaptability, Social Skills, Hyperactivity, Somatization, Withdrawal, and Learning Problems, retained meaningful domain-specific variance, whereas others were largely saturated by their respective general factors. Item-level results indicated well-ordered thresholds, strong discrimination, and high measurement precision in clinically relevant regions of the latent traits. These findings clarify the structure of the BASC-3 TRS, provide evidence supporting the composite scores as defensible indicators of broad behavioral and emotional functioning, and identify the subscales for which the psychometric evidence most strongly supports meaningful and interpretable score use.",

          "abstract": "Does merely knowing that one will engage in conversation with an AI versus a real human differentially evoke anticipatory anxiety? Here we tested this question experimentally by asking participants to report their anticipatory anxiety and experiential expectations prior to engaging in each of two conversations: one with real humans and another with LLM-powered AI agents, with both held through the same real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech interface. Then, to evaluate how outcomes aligned with expectations, participants reported their actual experiences following each conversation. Results revealed significantly lower anxiety in anticipation of a conversation with AI partners compared to human partners, though this effect only emerged after initial novelty subsided. Strikingly, participants underestimated the hedonic favorability of AI conversations, ultimately liking them and feeling better after them than the human conversations in spite of relatively similar expectations. These findings support the notion that anxiety in anticipation of social interaction is substantially evoked by being perceived by another human, rather than the act of conversation itself. As social AI agents become pervasive across social domains, understanding the similarities and differences in the ways we relate to them will be important for maximizing the benefits they can provide and minimizing their potential for harm.",

          "abstract": "It has long been debated in Theory of Mind research and epistemology what the primary cognitive attitude in our folk psychology is: belief or knowledge? In contrast to traditional “Belief First” accounts, recent “Knowledge First” epistemology and “Factive Theory of Mind” accounts consider knowledge ascription basic, primary and not reducible to, or derived from, belief ascription. So-called Gettier cases play an important role in this debate: Cases where an agent has justified true beliefs that we are intuitively hesitant, however, to consider knowledge. In the present studies, we tested how robust such Gettier intuitions (an agent has a justified true belief that p but falls short of knowing that p) are in adults under stringently controlled conditions; and we implement the first developmental test of these intuitions in children (5-8 years). Across three studies participants saw novel video-based vignettes that were modelled after standard change-of-location False Belief tasks. In different conditions, an agent had True Belief )full access( about the location of an object, a false belief, or a Gettier-case true belief. Results revealed that Gettier intuitions proved to be robust in both adults and children: they virtually always ascribed knowledge in the True Belief condition, and virtually never in the False Belief condition; in the Gettier cases, they ascribed knowledge sometimes, but much less so than in the True Belief condition. In addition, when asked to predict what the agent in the vignette would do (where they would search for the target object), adults did revert to belief ascription in all conditions but were slower and less certain in the Gettier conditions. Taking together, these findings constitute evidence in support of Knowledge First or Factive Theory of Mind accounts.",

          "abstract": "This cross-sectional quantitative study examined sectarian differences in perceived religious discrimination and psychological resilience among Sunni and Shia Muslims in Karachi, Pakistan. It was hypothesized that (H1) Shias would report higher discrimination, (H2) Shias would exhibit greater resilience despite this, and (H3) discrimination would predict lower resilience in Sunnis but not Shias. A purposive sample of 200 adults (100 Shia, 100 Sunni) completed the Religious Discrimination Scale (α = .904) and Brief Resilience Scale (α = .820). Shias reported higher discrimination (M = 2.45) than Sunnis (M = 1.33; d ≈ 1.70) and greater resilience (M = 4.08 vs. 3.39; d ≈ 0.90). Discrimination predicted lower resilience in Sunnis (β= –.47, p = .008) but not in Shias (β ≈ –.01, p = .914). Findings highlight Shias’ collective resilience and support sect-specific psychosocial interventions.

          "abstract": "The reporting of the sources of our statements—whether we have, e.g., seen something or been told something—plays an important role in communication. The inaccurate reporting of sources is often associated with the spread of inaccurate beliefs, as when rumors are attributed to a non-existent credible source. Experiments have revealed that participants display a substantial amount of flexibility in the reporting of sources, in particular by attributing to themselves ideas they have acquired from others. However, these participants belonged to large-scale societies, and they spoke languages without grammatical evidential marking. Both factors might increase flexibility in source reporting. To test whether members of small-scale societies speaking languages with evidential marking also display flexibility in source reporting, we conducted two experiments with Quichua and Cha’palaa speakers in Ecuador. In both experiments, some participants acquired a belief through social transmission, and then had to communicate this belief to another participant. In doing so, very few participants mentioned the social source of their belief, whether explicitly, or by using the relevant evidential markers. These results show that flexibility in source reporting is a cross-culturally robust phenomenon, and that grammatical evidential marking does not appear to strongly affect this flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Prosocial behavior is vital for societal well-being. However, people often display it selectively, treating certain individuals more favorably than others. Such selectivity reinforces social inequalities, highlighting the need to understand its roots. Prior research focused on the situational factors driving selective prosociality (e.g., group membership), largely neglecting person characteristics of actors. To close this gap, we systematically investigated the dispositional basis of selective prosociality across four pre-registered studies applying two different incentivized behavioral paradigms. We studied the predictive power of basic (HEXACO, D) and specific, theoretically-relevant personality traits for selective prosociality (Studies 1–4) and assessed its temporal stability (Study 3). We also compared selective prosociality (i.e., selectivity in giving to different recipients) with general prosociality (overall giving) regarding their personality correlates and stability. Findings show that selective prosociality is linked to certain personality traits, which are largely distinct from those linked to general prosociality. The dark factor of personality was the strongest positive predictor of selective prosociality across studies, followed by right-wing authoritarianism. Furthermore, social dominance orientation was positively correlated with selective prosociality, whereas openness was negatively correlated in three out of four studies. Selective prosociality also showed moderate stability over four weeks (rs = .58), supporting its conceptualization as a trait-like construct. Additionally, a thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed that selective prosociality was driven by attitudinal preferences. Our findings provide evidence for a dispositional basis of selective prosociality, suggesting some individuals are consistently more selective than others and offering theoretical insights into the construct and its drivers.",

          "abstract": "High-quality data is essential for interpreting findings from eye-tracking experiments. However, manufacturer specifications are often limited to spatial accuracy and precision values obtained under ideal conditions. These metrics are insufficient for evaluating performance across a wider range of eye movements (e.g., smooth pursuit, microsaccades, blinks) that are critical in many research paradigms. While SR Research’s EyeLink 1000 Plus is widely considered a reference instrument, a comprehensive, independent evaluation of its direct competitor, the VPixx TRACKPixx3 (introduced in 2020), is so far missing. This study addresses this gap by directly comparing the two devices using an extended version of the benchmark proposed by Ehinger et al. (2019), which we supplemented with a new text reading task. Through simultaneous recordings across eight tasks, we evaluated key performance measures including accuracy decay, fixation durations, pupil dilation, smooth pursuit tracking, and the classification of microsaccades and blinks. Our findings indicate that the overall performance of the two eye-trackers is comparable. A key difference emerged at the sample level: The TRACKPixx3 produces substantially smoother sam-\nple data due to a non-deactivable and undocumented internal filter, which has the potential to distort saccade kinematics and fixation onsets. Conversely, the EyeLink 1000 Plus exhibited slightly weaker performance on some metrics, an outcome we attribute to our specific recording setup which, due to practical constraints, was suboptimal for this device. Although the EyeLink 1000 Plus remains a de-facto benchmark, our evaluation establishes the TRACKPixx3 as a viable and competitive alternative for high-precision eye-tracking research.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control enables individuals to prioritize goal-relevant information while suppressing competing, irrelevant inputs. The Stroop task has long served as a key paradigm for studying conflict processing, yet research has often focused primarily on the mismatch between word meaning and ink color (information conflict) while overlooking the competition between the color naming task and the automatic tendency to read (task conflict), and it is unclear how independent these conflicts are. This study examined the temporal and neural dissociation between task and information conflict using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a low-control Stroop design optimized to elicit both conflict types. Across two experiments, participants named the ink color of congruent, incongruent, neutral-word, and non-word stimuli while EEG was recorded. Cluster-based permutation analyses revealed distinct electrophysiological signatures for the two conflict types. Task conflict was associated with early neural responses, including posterior positivity around 180ms and a robust centro-frontal positivity around 250ms. In contrast, information conflict elicited a later sustained posterior positivity peaking around 700–800ms. Critically, both the amplitudes of the 250ms and late posterior components uniquely predicted trial-level reaction time, indicating that both conflict types contribute to behavioral slowing. These findings were replicated in a second study, which equated stimulus frequency between the non-words and the other stimulus categories. Together, the results provide converging evidence for temporally and functionally distinct neural mechanisms underlying task and information conflict, supporting domain-specific accounts of cognitive control and clarifying the time course by which different conflict types influence behavior.",

          "abstract": "Aging is typically associated with characteristic changes to cognitive function, personality, and political orientation. While online data collection for psychological research has greatly increased in frequency, there has been little systematic examination of whether online samples are appropriate for studying aging. Here, we examine whether typical age-related differences in cognitive function, personality and political orientation are replicated in online samples. We measured cognitive performance using tests of vocabulary, processing speed, memory, and attention developed by the TestMyBrain Project; personality using the Big Five Inventory; and political orientation following the ANES survey format. At least 200 participants each were sampled from three crowdsourcing websites (Amazon MTurk, CloudResearch MTurk Toolkit, and Prolific) and three panel recruitment websites (Lucid, CloudResearch PrimePanels, and Qualtrics Panels). On all six platforms, consistent with established norms, age was positively correlated with vocabulary performance and negatively correlated with processing speed. Additionally, in all six samples, consistent with prior studies, age was associated with higher Agreeableness, lower Neuroticism, and greater political conservatism. There were some differences between crowdsourced and panel samples, however. Performance on cognitive measures was broadly better for crowdsourced samples. The correlations between age and Openness and Extraversion differed between crowdsourced and panel samples, with trends in panel samples likely more comparable to the ground truth. Finally, MTurk produced some discrepant effects of age on cognition relative to other crowdsourced platforms. Beyond these differences, though, our results are broadly encouraging for the prospect of studying aging via online experiments.",

          "authors": "Wayne Kepner",
          "abstract": "Current frameworks for understanding addiction recovery rely on linear outcome metrics, stage models, or additive resource inventories that inadequately capture what is distinctive about the recovery process. Meanwhile, dynamical systems approaches to addiction, while capturing nonlinearity, are missing what may be recovery’s most defining feature: that the system is continuously rewritten, not only by each recovery attempt but by the passage of time itself. This paper introduces viability theory, a branch of mathematics developed to study constrained dynamical systems, as a formal framework for addiction recovery, and extends it to account for the recursive, self-modifying character of the recovery process. We propose that recovery constitutes a viability kernel (i.e., safe zone): the set of states from which a person can maintain functioning within livable constraints over time, given the choices and strategies available to them. Recovery capital serves as the underlying resource base that determines both the shape of the viable safe zone and the menu of options available to the individual. Three features distinguish this framework from existing models. First, recovery is reconceptualized as a process of recursive self-modification, not a dynamic one. The way the person’s life evolves, the limits of what they can endure, and the choices they can actually make are continuously reshaped both by prior recovery experience and by the temporal evolution of the person’s physiological, social, and structural circumstances, thereby rewriting the viability safe zone itself. Second, the viability boundary (i.e., danger zone) is functionally unknown to the person operating within it, creating a condition of high epistemic uncertainty. Third, boundary violation produces catastrophic collapse rather than gradual degradation, consistent with the phase-transition dynamics observed in relapse. This framework unifies recovery capital theory, dynamical systems approaches to return to use, and the lived phenomenology of recovery under a single formal apparatus, while making explicit that recovery operates by a different principle than the linear and dynamical systems models that precede it.",

Here, we propose that hippocampal-supported analogical reasoning constitutes a key mechanism underlying relational abstraction and semantic generalization. Building on evidence from neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and theoretical models, we argue that the hippocampus contributes to semantic cognition not by storing semantic content, but by extracting and reusing relational structure across experiences. Analogical reasoning provides the functional link between episodic experience and semantic knowledge, enabling inference, prediction, and flexible generalization. Integrating this account with existing models of semantic representation, semantic control, and predictive coding offers a mechanistic framework for understanding how meaning is constructed and deployed across contexts.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms are commonly used for self-harm and suicide-related help-seeking, yet their role in suicide prevention remains underexamined. Synthesising eleven years of empirical research (2014–2025), this review examines the use of social media for self-harm and suicide prevention, focusing on platform-based interventions, user-led practices, and evidence on safety, acceptability and efficacy. In April 2025, a systematic search of five databases identified studies published since 2014. Extracted data included details of the prevention activity or intervention examined and any reported outcomes. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. From 16,476 records, 75 studies met inclusion criteria and were classified as reporting either: intervention development or format (17%), intervention evaluation (19%), user experiences (34%) or online behaviours (29%). Social media-based interventions included purpose-designed social networking interventions, programs combining AI-driven risk detection with in-platform interventions, and educational campaigns promoting safe online communication about self-harm and suicide. Community-led practices such as sharing recovery stories and suicide-related peer support provided social connection and emotional relief, though these benefits coexisted with risks including exposure to graphic and instructional content. Users described social media platforms as important avenues for suicide-related help-seeking, particularly when offline clinical support was inaccessible. Few studies evaluated intervention effectiveness or measured changes in self-harm or suicidal behaviour, and most relied on small, non-representative samples. This review reveals a broad range of user-led suicide prevention activities alongside a growing number of platform-based suicide prevention interventions. Rigorous longitudinal and experimental research is needed to determine efficacy and guide safe implementation in real-world settings.",

          "abstract": "Recent research shows that young children frequently report non-ordinary experiences, including extra sensory perceptions, out-of-body experiences, and states of self-transcendence, reflecting relational, pre-linguistic, and weakly individualised forms of consciousness. This paper integrates qualitative studies of children’s experiences with contemporary altered states of consciousness (ASC) classification schemes, applying the eight-dimensional model of altered consciousness (Fort et al., 2025). Phenomenological parallels are identified between childhood experiences and adult ASCs, including vivid imagery, bodily dislocation, self-boundary dissolution, timelessness, heightened affect, and altered cognitive control. We propose that early transcendental modes of awareness may form an experiential template that mimics adults’ pursuit of ASCs through meditation, psychedelics, sensory deprivation, and spiritual practices. Adopting a lifespan perspective, the paper highlights the need for systematic developmental and neuro-phenomenological research to better understand continuities between childhood consciousness and adult altered states.",

Findings on the clinical utility of this therapy are specific to personality pathology and are promising to date, although still limited to small sample sizes. This chapter presents the three levels of conceptualization used as well as the treatment structure. The case conceptualization aims to help the clinician distinguish a basic personality organization from a maladaptive structure emerging from persistent failures to adapt to social environments. Subsequently, the most prominent traits are explored, intersecting an ontogenetic and phylogenetic understanding of how these traits channel experience in a patient's interpersonal situations. To assist the clinician, three recurring interpersonal styles have been identified, corresponding to the three super-spectra commonly described in modern psychopathology.

          "authors": "Simone Cheli",
          "abstract": "The survival of humans, and primates in general, largely hinges on predicting the social behavior of others. Consistently, the human brain is specialized for detecting salient sensory characteristics (e.g., facial expressions or tone of voice) and processing representations of others' intentions. This functional and neuroanatomical specialization, often referred to as ‘social brain’, is well-established and has found extensive application in diverse fields over the past 25 years. While comparative ethology confirms that the phylogenetic growth of the neocortex is directly associated with increased social complexity in primates, evolutionary psychopathology shows that the most distinctive disorders of Homo sapiens are associated with impairments in the very mentalizing function characteristic of the social brain. In this chapter, an evolutionarily informed model of the social brain is presented to support the conceptualization and treatment of human psychopathology. More precisely, this model highlights the importance of considering evolutionary trade-offs between traits that favor either individual or collective fitness, and underscores the interpersonal perspective as the sole essential one on salutogenesis and psychopathology in humans.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Negative metacognitive bias, underestimating one’s abilities, is consistently linked to psychopathology, yet prior work has often collapsed anxiety/stress and depression or examined depression alone. We tested the unique associations of depression, anxiety/stress, and PTSD with metacognitive bias in post-9/11 veterans. Methods: Veterans from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS, N=601; 90% male; M_age=34.31) completed DASS-21 (depression, anxiety/stress), CAPS-IV (PTSD), WHODAS-II Understanding/Communicating (self-reported cognition), and an objective cognition composite (assessment of executive function, memory, attention). Bias was computed as self-report minus objective cognition. A subsample (n=239) repeated testing ~2 years later. Results: At time 1, more negative metacognitive bias was associated with greater anxiety/stress (r=−.41), depressive (r=−.37), and PTSD symptoms (r=−.31) (all ps&lt;.001). In a simultaneous model, anxiety/stress (β=−.29 p&lt;.001) and depressive symptoms (β=−.12, p=.045) explained unique variance, though PTSD symptoms did not (β=−.03, p=.524). Longitudinally, changes in bias were uniquely predicted by symptom changes in anxiety/stress (β=−.33, p&lt;.001) and PTSD (β=−.16, p=.001), but not depression (β=−.10, p=.137). Conclusions: Across cross-sectional and longitudinal models, anxiety/stress emerged as the most consistent correlate of metacognitive bias, with weaker contributions from depression and PTSD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the self-report vs. objective cognition gap, and the need to further understand the temporal relationship between anxiety/stress and metacognitive bias.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Social Processes in Wellbeing (SoWell) study is an (intensive) longitudinal twin study designed to examine relationships between social and environmental factors, mental health and wellbeing over time, and to address the genetic contribution to these associations.\n\nMethods: A total of approximately 14,000 individuals from the Norwegian Twin Registry (NTR) will be invited to participate in the study. Comprehensive assessment of individual characteristics, wellbeing, mental health, social factors, and environmental factors will be conducted using a baseline online survey. Two longitudinal follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12 months after baseline. In addition, participants will be invited to take part in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) component of the study. The EMA data collection comprises four measurements per day for 30 days (yielding up to 120 observations per person) to collect data on mental health and social and environmental factors in daily life. The SoWell data collection can additionally be linked to previous studies conducted in the NTR and population registry data, facilitating longitudinal analyses of how social and environmental factors relate to mental health and wellbeing over time in daily life, across months, and over years. The genetically informative twin sample allows for analyses which account for unmeasured confounding and yield insights into genetic and environmental underpinnings of mental health, wellbeing, and socio-environmental influences.\n\nDiscussion: The SoWell study aims to provide new knowledge about how social and environmental factors relate to mental health and wellbeing over time. The study will integrate comprehensive measures of both wellbeing and mental health problems and is well-suited for conducting genetically informed analyses. An integrated longitudinal survey and EMA approach in a genetically informative sample represents an innovative design with unprecedented opportunities for studying associations between mental health, wellbeing, environmental and genetic factors.",

          "abstract": "Low confidence in the integrity of elections is a growing concern in the US, and questioning election integrity has become a core part of Republican identity in recent years. These beliefs appear to be the result of an uninformed or misinformed electorate. However, despite growing evidence that factual information can shift political beliefs even on contentious issues, election integrity beliefs have so far proven unusually resistant to information-based approaches, arguably because they are tightly linked to partisan identity and reinforced by a polarized information environment. To examine whether election integrity beliefs are indeed resistant to corrective information, we develop and test an informational treatment that provides a high volume of politically balanced accurate evidence on election integrity. Immediately prior to the 2024 general election, we randomly assigned N = 871 Republicans to either the experimental group or a control group engaging with general political information. The treatment substantially increased participants’ overall beliefs about the integrity of US elections, retrospective beliefs about the integrity of the 2020 election, and prospective beliefs about the expected integrity of the upcoming 2024 election (.6 &lt; ds &lt; .8). Furthermore, a follow-up shows that the effects persist two weeks later, following the 2024 election. These findings demonstrate that even beliefs closely tied to partisan identity are responsive to credible factual information.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. The Shift-of-Strategy (SoS) approach aims to obtain concealed information from semi-cooperative suspects by prompting them to shift toward more forthcoming counter-interrogation strategies. While previous studies on the approach have shown promising results, important questions remain about how it functions in diverse contexts. This paper reports three studies addressing these questions. Aim. Study 1 (N = 159) tested two SoS variations designed to maintain suspects’ engagement and motivation to appear credible during interviews. Study 2 (N = 60) examined the approach in a repeated-interview context simulating an evolving investigation. Study 3 (N = 75) compared the approach’s effects on disclosures from innocent and guilty suspects. Methods. Within each study, participants completed a mock crime procedure and were thereafter interviewed as mock suspects. Following the interview, participants provided assessments of their experiences of being interviewed. Results. Study I suggest that the SoS approach’s efficacy is robust to procedural variation, though the tactics aimed at maintaining suspect motivation did not improve the approach. Study 2 revealed an important boundary condition; the approach’s effectiveness was limited when initial evidence was scarce. Study 3 demonstrated that innocent suspects were forthcoming regardless of their assigned interviewing condition, whereas guilty suspects disclosed more previously unknown information under SoS. Conclusion. The findings demonstrate that the SoS approach is robust to variation, but its effectiveness is reduced when evidence is sparse. Importantly, the approach does not appear to disadvantage innocent suspects. Together, the studies refine our understanding of how the SoS approach functions across different interview contexts.",

          "authors": "Josianne Kollmann; Sophie Charlotte Reckels; Nadja Contzen",
          "abstract": "Microplastics contaminate the environment, including water, soil, and air, and have also been found in the human body. Currently, however, there is only scientific evidence of a danger to aquatic ecosystems at high concentrations of microplastics, but no evidence of a present danger to human health. Based on the high level of scientific uncertainty and the assumed temporal distance of negative consequences due to the increasing pollution of microplastics, it could be assumed that people perceive a high psychological distance regarding microplastics pollution, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions. Moreover, an additional dimension, namely biological distance, might be relevant in this context, as, to date, the evidence suggests a danger only to aquatic ecosystems but not humans. This study therefore investigated the perceived psychological distance of microplastics pollution on the four conventional dimensions (spatial, social, temporal, hypothetical distance), and on the proposed biological dimension. Additionally, it was investigated whether psychological distance can explain public concern about microplastics pollution for oneself, for others, and for nature, and whether psychological distance can, either directly or mediated by concern, explain people’s willingness to engage in mitigation activities, specifically their behavioural intentions to reduce pollution and their willingness to pay for mitigation policies. This was analysed in an online sample of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 707) using Structural Equation Modelling. The results showed that, on average, a low distance towards microplastics pollution was perceived, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions, contrasting the current scientific evidence. Further, lower psychological distance was associated with greater concern for oneself, for others, and for nature, as well as with higher behavioural intention to reduce pollution, both directly and mediated by concern for nature. Willingness to pay, however was only explained by psychological distance but not by concern. Overall, the findings show that low perceived psychological distance can explain public concern regarding microplastics pollution, and that it may motivate people to engage in mitigation activities, even if they are not concerned about themselves or humans in general. Yet, the study also indicates that, next to concern, other factors might play a role in mediating the relationship between psychological distance and willingness to engage in mitigation activities.",

          "abstract": "By exploring the boundaries of systems, we learn about their capacities and their forms. We believe that studying edge cases of what human cognition can do is an important supplement to studying prototypical human cognition. This paper describes a class of experiences we call  induced sensory experiences, which we think are (1) rare, (2) trainable, and (3) singularly effective in certain kinds of problem solving. People consistently report non-drug-induced hallucination-like experiences in religious and spiritual contexts. These sensory experiences are often induced through explicit training and practice designed, in part, to invoke them. Here, we report the results of a survey extending this phenomenon to the case of professional and highly trained mathematicians. We document the prevalence of  powerful, sensory or quasi-sensory experiences of non-physical objects.  In short, we find them to be extremely common: Individual mathematicians nearly universally describe experiences and activities that closely match the pattern of induced sensory experiences. These sensory experiences can be seen as an achievement of mathematical thinking: they tend to develop with time and experience in a domain, and many participants find them to be unique in some way to mathematical thinking. These experiences were not reported to be rare. Mathematicians reported having meaningful amounts of control over their visualization.  Finally, explicit belief in the ‘reality’ of these objects was largely unrelated to any measures of sensory vividness or control. Altogether, we believe this work demonstrates how humans are able to build complex and abstract reasoning out of sensorimotor components through extensive training.",

          "abstract": "Nonparametric propensity score methods are being used more frequently in social research to address misspecification bias in parametric methods such as linear regression. However, these methods can still be vulnerable to misspecification if the propensity score is estimated using parametric methods. Various methodological innovations have been developed to reduce or eliminate misspecification bias in propensity score methods; however, they are underused in sociological research. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of these innovations compared with that of standard methods. The results show that while some of the more recently developed extensions or alternatives to propensity score methods can substantially reduce misspecification bias, some are biased even in the absence of misspecification. In addition, most methods are subject to bias amplification due to \"hidden dual misspecification\", a problem previously overlooked in methodological research. Among the estimators evaluated, entropy balancing was the most successful in both eliminating regular misspecification bias and reducing bias amplification. The covariate balancing propensity score and augmented inverse probability weighting performed well. This study concludes that these estimators deserve more attention in applied social research.",

          "abstract": "En esta disertación nos proponemos examinar críticamente la evolución reciente de la medición de la práctica deportiva en España a partir del análisis comparado de las encuestas oficiales de hábitos deportivos desde 1975 hasta 2025. A tal efecto, se hallan e interpretan los escenarios y las disquisiciones acaecidas a partir de la de 2015, identificando la ruptura metodológica introducida en 2015, que trajo consigo una discontinuidad en la serie histórica que compromete la comparabilidad longitudinal y puede estar produciendo una sobreestimación de los niveles reales de práctica deportiva. A partir de la revisión de los instrumentos de medición, las categorías de frecuencia empleadas y la forma de presentar los resultados —especialmente en términos de minutos acumulados de actividad—, planteamos que parte del aumento informado en la práctica responde a cambios en la definición y operacionalización del fenómeno más que a las transformaciones sociales y económicas equivalentes. Para demostrar la hipótesis, comparamos estos resultados con otros indicadores estructurales del sistema deportivo español —empleo, gasto público, gasto de los hogares, tejido empresarial y licencias federativas— que no muestran expansiones acordes con el supuesto incremento abrupto de la práctica desde 2015. Asimismo, apoyándonos en la discusión con otros estudios secundarios, comparamos los resultados sobre esta variable en la Encuesta de Hábitos Deportivos con los de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud, evidenciando con ello las divergencias en la estimación del cumplimiento de las recomendaciones de actividad física de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Estas diferencias las identificamos como una disfunción que da cuenta del resultado de marcos conceptuales y metodológicos distintos más que como reflejo de una mejora homogénea del comportamiento deportivo de la población española en los periodos observados. Finalmente, subrayamos la necesidad de reforzar la dirección científico-técnica de estas operaciones estadísticas mediante la participación de los profesionales de las Ciencias de la Actividad Física y del Deporte, así como de orientar las políticas públicas en función de las cifras agregadas, así como de un análisis riguroso de la demanda de actividad física y de las barreras de acceso en los distintos grupos sociales, amén de la realización estudios ulteriores basados en la comparación de casos y el rastreo de procesos que pongan el acento en la combinación de los factores que explican la práctica deportiva. El trabajo concluye con la premisa de que medir mejor esta variable es una condición imprescindible para diseñar políticas deportivas y de salud pública más eficaces.",

This study examines gender disparities in social capital among job seekers using eighteen waves of the German Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) and a novel causal decomposition approach (Yu &amp; Elwert 2025). We distinguish between access to social capital (available network resources), activation (received job search resources), and returns (outcomes such as wages, job satisfaction, and job interviews). While women in the general population have more limited access to weak ties and high-status contacts, these differences narrow substantially among active job seekers. Consistent with this pattern, women and men receive similar levels of network-based job search support. Crucially, we find no evidence of a gender-specific returns deficit in wages or job satisfaction and only limited evidence for job interviews. Overall, the findings suggest that gender inequalities in job search outcomes are not primarily driven by differential access to, activation of, or returns from social capital.",

          "abstract": "Studies have documented adverse effects of unemployment on various health outcomes, yet it remains an open question whether these effects are causally related to changes in health-related behavior. We focus on physical activity as a potential mediator and whether changes in physical activity can explain how unemployment impairs health. Competing theoretical perspectives suggest that unemployment may either restrict or increase physical activity.   We use thirteen waves of the German panel study \"Labor Market and Social Security\" (N_it = 57,124; N_i = 13,123) as well as fixed-effects models in combination with mediation analysis techniques. Based on time-distributed fixed effects models, we assess temporal dynamics. We find a negative total effect of unemployment on self-rated health (β = -0.063; p &lt; 0.01). At the same time, unemployment increases physical activity (β = 0.173; p &lt; 0.001) and physical activity positively affects health (β = 0.046; p &lt; 0.001). We also find a positive indirect effect (IE= 0.008; p &lt; 0.001) that partly counterbalances the negative unemployment effect—implying that the effect is 13 percent stronger net of physical activity. The indirect effects hold for all phases of unemployment. Physical activity suppresses part of the health deterioration associated with unemployment. The temporal effect patterns suggest that increased available time, rather than stress relief, explains the rise in physical activity.",

          "abstract": "What is the effect of experiencing good or bad macroeconomic environments on political and economic attitudes? Despite decades of research, this central question in political economy remains unsettled. We advance this debate in two ways: by examining the effects of both positive and negative macroeconomic environments simultaneously, and by focusing on their cumulative impact over individuals’ lifetimes. We address this question by examining how lifetime exposure to macroeconomic positive and negative periods shapes political and economic attitudes in Latin America. We combine annual GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project (1896–2022) with nearly 700,000 individual responses from Latinobarómetro and LAPOP (1995–2021) to construct life-course measures of positive and negative periods for respondents in 18 countries. Our identification strategy compares cohorts within country–year using models with country, survey-year, age, cohort, and survey fixed effects. Repeated positive macroeconomic periods systematically shift individuals toward the right on a left–right scale and improve subjective economic evaluations. In contrast, repeated negative periods do not produce a consistent leftward shift; instead, they increase economic insecurity, dissatisfaction with democratic performance, and anti-elite sentiment. Support for democracy as a principle remains stable. We confirm the generalizability of our main findings by replicating our analyses in 104 countries using the Integrated Values Survey (1980-2022).",

          "abstract": "This article develops a Crisis Cascade Framework to explain how sequential systemic shocks generate durable transformations in global governance. Conceptualizing global governance as a complex adaptive network, it theorizes crises as sequential mechanisms—rather than exogenous disruptions—that reconfigure institutional connections through three phases: trigger, framing struggle, and topological reconfiguration. The framework identifies four competing Governance Imperatives during crises—Efficiency, Security, Legitimacy, and Scientific Rationality— whose competitive prioritization shapes institutional responses. Drawing on the U.S. War on Terror, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis shows how security-driven pruning, institutional bypass, and crisis-induced fragmentation accumulate over time. These processes produce path-dependent erosion of coordination capacity despite growing institutional density. The article explains why contemporary global governance has become simultaneously more interconnected yet less governable: crisis cascades produce structural fragmentation rather than cyclical recovery, creating a 'topological trap' of stable fragmentation that undermines coordination capacity in an era of polycrisis.",

          "abstract": "How does foreign direct investment (FDI) affect informal employment in the Global South? Existing scholarship has produced inconsistent findings, in part because it treats FDI as a homogeneous developmental input. We advance a “compositional framework” that links national labor market outcomes to distinct multinational corporate motivations: resource-seeking FDI creates enclave economies with limited local labor market integration; market-seeking FDI generates backward linkages that facilitate formalization; and efficiency-seeking FDI pursues labor cost arbitrage through flexible, informal employment arrangements. Using a novel dataset of 16 Latin American countries (2000-2018), we employ a relative-shift regression framework to isolate compositional effects from aggregate scale effects. Results reveal that, relative to market-seeking (service) investment, both resource-seeking (primary) and efficiency-seeking (manufacturing) FDI significantly increase informal employment, while aggregate net FDI inflows show no association with informality.

          "abstract": "Human choices are often both multi-dimensional and interactive. For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh their education, and the weight placed on education may depend on other factors such as their age, country of origin, and employment history. We develop a response-adaptive experimental design that summarizes the range of effects of one attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our approach changes several aspects of the experimental design based on the ex ante choice to study the heterogeneous effects of one focal attribute (i.e., education). We update treatment assignment probabilities over the course of the experiment to search for the attribute vector at which the focal attribute has the most positive and most negative effects. By summarizing the full range of effects that exist, our approach complements existing approaches to conjoint experiments that typically aggregate over heterogeneity by marginalizing. We illustrate through two online experiments and provide customizable code infrastructure via a Docker container that other researchers can use to deploy adaptive randomization in online conjoint experiments.",

          "authors": "Aaron Helmbrecht",
          "abstract": "Truth is the first casualty of war.1 Russia has prioritized information warfare in its aggression toward Ukraine and the West, refining it for the digital age. The aim of information warfare is to manipulate an enemy’s psychic condition. Security analysts tend to apply semantics to the study of information warfare, attempting to combat lies with truth. Discourse analysts know that you’re supposed to fight manipulation with pragmatics. This makes discourse analysts uniquely qualified to combat the threat. This paper presents a pragmatic theoretical framework for discourse analysts to identify manipulation in political discourse as Russian information warfare. The framework is applied in a generic qualitative inquiry of current and historical political discourse. Results advance “false consciousness” as the most pragmatically plausible theory to widely discussed research questions about Trumpism and Russian influence in Western politics over alternative theories such as “nativism, authoritarianism and populism,” “ideological asymmetry,” and “lesser evilism.”",

          "abstract": "Why should bonds issued by the same sovereign trade at different yields when they differ only in their label? This paper proposes that the greenium — the yield compression observed on green bonds relative to their conventional counterparts — is the monetised value of a diagnostic sign. Drawing on the mathematical semiotics of Kockelman (2025), I construct an ontology for the bond market in which the green label functions as a diagnostic instrument linking observable signs to hidden states of the world. The value of the labelling regime, 𝒱(S), measures the welfare gain an investor obtains from conditioning decisions on the label, relative to a world with no labels at all. This quantity depends on the reliability of the sign, the investor's prior uncertainty, and the stakes of misclassification; in the limit of pure greenwashing it collapses to zero. I then analyse the Deutsche Finanzagentur's twin bond concept as a natural semiotic experiment: by issuing matched pairs of securities identical in all financial dimensions, the twin architecture brackets the credit channel and isolates the greenium as a pure semiotic residual — the price of a posterior shift over what the bond funds, scaled by the investor's alignment preferences. The observed greenium is not a primitive market datum but a product of metapragmatic labour.",

Despite growing evidence, data on the feasibility of integrating PRS into routine hereditary breast cancer assessment remain scarce, particularly within European clinical pathways. Systematic evaluation of operational requirements, patient and provider acceptability, and organizational impact is essential prior to any broader implementation. This single-arm feasibility study will be conducted at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy) and is expected to enrol approximately 700 women attending the Medical Genetics Clinic. Eligible participants comprise: unaffected women with a documented family history of breast cancer or known pathogenic variants associated with hereditary breast cancer predisposition; women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing oncogenetic counseling for contralateral risk assessment. All participants will be offered testing for pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition genes and PRS, and integrated risk estimates will be generated using the CanRisk model. The primary outcome is the feasibility of implementing PRS within the clinical workflow, assessed through a validated questionnaire administered to participants and healthcare professionals. Secondary outcomes include PRS uptake, perceptions of the integrated pathway, impact on risk category reclassification, and qualitative insights into risk communication processes. This study will generate empirical evidence on the operational, organizational, and perceptual considerations associated with incorporating PRS-enhanced risk assessment into hereditary breast cancer services in Italy. By characterizing feasibility and acceptability, the findings will support the refinement of clinical pathways and inform the sustainable integration of PRS into routine preventive care.",

          "authors": "Torbjörn Rolandsson",
          "abstract": "While recent work has charted how journalistic values are inscribed into recommender systems, less is known about how such systems reshape news work after their implementation. Through an ethnography conducted at the Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Radio (SR) between 2018 and 2023, this paper examines how distinctiveness was operationalized through an algorithmic system for news distribution. The study shows how SR made their public service obligation to remain distinct and actionable through a classificatory schema for metadata annotation that prescribed the production of radio news intended to evoke a sense of radiophonic authenticity – sonic expressions conveying place-specificity and presence. Post-deployment, reporters oriented their work toward producing such authenticity through less deskbound reporting and creative sonic practices. The paper argues that the algorithmic system’s primary organizational effects did not stem from computational sorting, but from how its classifications valorized certain practices and embedded journalistic work in a feedback loop of data that facilitated continuous auditing and managerial interventions. These findings highlight the plasticity of public values in algorithmic environments and show how their production is accomplished through algorithms and people acting together, mediated by classificatory schemas that can substantially reorganize journalistic workflows.",

          "abstract": "This paper draws on ethnographic observations of Astrid, the Content Management Systems at the Swedish Public Broadcaster SVT, to examine how software design practices shape digital news work. Drawing on material-semiotic perspectives, the paper frames news workers as users, configured through design work. This dynamic unfolds through a process wherein designers draw on knowledge-generating techniques to generate insights about users, which produces an ideal imagined user, that designers subsequently tend to recreate by constraining the interpretive flexibility of an artefact. At SVT, the Astrid team was both agential in prescribing and defining desirable forms of work, while also acting as organizational intermediaries who translated several concerns into material design, which ultimately redrew the distribution of responsibilities and authority in SVT newsrooms. Journalistic work was collectivized through a co-writing feature, and editors' capacity to intervene in journalistic production processes was enhanced. The results reveal design as a practice that can reshape foundational aspects of news work by relying on understudied practices of knowledge production. The paper concludes by relating these insights to debates on AI in newsrooms, arguing that the relational framework of user configuration provides a useful lens for understanding power dynamics between designers, technological systems, and news workers.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To examine the quality and patterns of miscarriage reporting across different surveys administered in Great Britain (GB).\n\nDesign: Comparative descriptive analysis of pregnancy and miscarriage data collected by four surveys following different methodological approaches including cohort, cross-sectional and household panel surveys.\n\nSetting: Great Britain \n\nPopulation or Sample: 29,426 pregnancies reported by 12,648 women in 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps, Understanding Society (UKHLS), and the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3).\n\nMethods: We compared the formulation of pregnancy and miscarriage questions across the surveys, as well as several miscarriage and pregnancy prevalence indicators to understand which approaches may lead to improved miscarriage reporting.\n\nMain Outcome Measures: Using self-reported information on past pregnancies from each survey, we examined the average number of reported pregnancies, the proportion of women reporting one or more miscarriage(s), the distribution of all pregnancy outcomes and more specifically the proportion of miscarriages among all pregnancies, and the age-specific miscarriage prevalence.\nResults: The share of miscarriages among all reported pregnancies ranged between 14 and 21%, and between 18 and 24% of all women reported at least one miscarriage. While the prevalence of miscarriage rates was similar across surveys, UKHLS systematically reported the lowest prevalence, while Next Steps recorded the highest. The prevalence of miscarriage substantially increased after age 34 in all surveys, however with disparities across surveys for pregnancies in the early 40s. \n\nConclusions: Overall, GB surveys provide miscarriage estimates consistent with previous clinical studies but with some heterogeneity across surveys. These differences can be attributed to incomplete collection of pregnancy histories and variation in the age and cohort composition of study populations. Researchers should pay careful attention to questionnaire design, and possible recall issues when using survey data for miscarriage research. Providing clear definitions of miscarriage may reduce heterogeneity in responses.",

Within this context, the human protagonist and the main narrator of the novel, Genly Ai, points out the complexities of Gethenian society. In this regard, Le Guin uses ambisexuality to underscore the implications of binary gender norms on society constructing a world excluding gender-based tension between men and women. According to that, The Left Hand of Darkness can be associated with almost all theories and assumptions in gender studies. Judith Butler’s idea of gender performance perfectly goes parallel with the criticizations of Le Guin. This article revolves around the diverse discrimination and inequalities between gender roles.",

Moreover, existing research focuses on majority populations and largely overlooks the impact of exposure for minorities. Using linked geocoded US census records from 1880 to 1900/1910, we examine childhood outgroup exposure and subsequent marriage patterns for over 400,000 American, German and Irish men. To account for residential self-selection, we use machine-learning to identify “ethnic” neighborhoods and compare individuals living within the same residential contexts but having different next-door neighbors. In majority-minority dyads, outgroup exposure is consistently associated with a higher likelihood of marrying a member of that group, as well as a lower likelihood of ingroup marriage. The evidence is less robust for minority-minority dyads but nonetheless supports an overall pattern wherein childhood experiences can serve to erode ethnic group boundaries.",

          "authors": "Olivia Alliott; David Ogilvie; Lucy Grace Anderson; Richard Patterson; Kate Garrott; Emma Carey; Cornelia Guell; Jenna Panter",
          "abstract": "Background: Population health interventions may change physical, social or fiscal environments to shift health behaviours and often operate within a complex system of interacting factors. Systems methods are frequently suggested as a way to provide an overview of the interactions that determine behaviours or actions and may help to understand how or why interventions might (or might not) change health. However, there are few examples of how these methods have been used in empirical evaluations of public health interventions. \n\nMethods: We describe our application of a qualitative complex systems approach to evaluate a population health intervention: traffic restriction schemes, often referred to as School Streets, where motor vehicle access outside schools is restricted at pick-up and drop-off times. We intended to use systems methods across our evaluation; here we describe how we use these methods to build theory. Following the five-step approach outlined by Alvarado et al., (2023), we produced research propositions, systems archetypes and a causal loop diagram to understand the underlying system in which traffic restriction schemes are implemented and their potential impact on school-based active travel.\n\nResults: In bringing together diverse and multi-disciplinary evidence from different stakeholders we identified unanticipated systems interactions such as increased initial tensions and conflicts between users of different active travel modes (e.g. cyclists vs pedestrians). Using causal loop diagrams and systems archetypes, we developed research propositions focused on funding and implementation, safety, habit formation and the potential for unintended consequences. \n\nConclusions: Taking a complex systems approach has deepened our understanding of how traffic restriction schemes interact with their broader context and helped us develop a guiding theoretical framework for our ongoing evaluation. We intend this work to stimulate discussion, offer insights for future evaluations of population-level health interventions, and encourage public health researchers to adopt systems methods in their own evaluations.\n\nKey words: Complex systems approach, population health intervention, traffic restriction schemes, School Streets, Active travel, Causal loop diagrams, Systems archetypes, Qualitative systems methods, public health evaluation",

          "authors": "Oliver Maor",
          "abstract": "This exploratory study examines organized sexual events in Germany as structured leisure formats rather than as expressions of identity, morality, or relationship ideology. Using event descriptions, registration data, pricing information, and post-event participant comments published on a dominant German online platform, the analysis shifts attention from individual motivations to recurrent organizational configurations through which sexual practices are enabled. The dataset comprises 137 publicly advertised events conducted on three comparable Saturdays in late summer and fall 2025, enabling comparison with a prior 2023 sample. Quantitative analyses show that admission pricing, including gender-differentiated prices and age-related discounts, has no measurable effect on participant composition. Multivariate analyses identified four largely independent structural dimensions—demographic composition, participation structure, pricing relations by gender, and absolute pricing—and a three-cluster typology distinguishing large party-oriented events, couple-centered standard formats, and niche events with a large surplus of men. No evidence of a stable participant cohort across years is found. Qualitative analyses of event descriptions and participant comments indicate that sexuality is treated as a situational and pragmatic practice. Evaluations of events in the participants’ comments focus primarily on organizational coherence, spatial layout, music, catering, and staff performance. Sexual encounters are mentioned selectively, mainly where organizers explicitly curate sexual practices as part of the event design. Overall, the findings suggest that organized sexual events operate as bounded social settings in which the event format defines the purpose of participation, allowing sexuality to be enacted as a routinized form of leisure activity embedded in the spatial and service setting.",

          "abstract": "Background: Active travel to and from schools offers important health and environmental benefits, yet car use remains dominant, contributing to congestion, pollution and safety risks. Schemes to restrict private motor vehicles are increasingly being implemented around schools to address these issues, but evidence on how they might work to impact the school journey across different contexts is limited.\n\nAims and Objectives: To explore the mechanisms through which schemes might influence school travel behaviour and how the impacts vary across different contexts.\nMethods In-person walk-along and online interviews were conducted with 24 families, five teachers and four local authority representatives across three regions (Perth and Kinross, Haringey and Sheffield) across the United Kingdom between September 2024 and April 2025. Ethnographic observations were also carried out. Transcripts were analysed drawing on Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, guided by realist evaluation principles and ethnographic observations to identify contexts, mechanisms and outcomes using NVivo.\n\nResults: Common context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified reflecting congruent narratives across participants. For example, In contexts where families previously relied on driving for the school journey (Context), increased inconvenience functioned as a mechanism (Mechanism), encouraging a shift towards hybrid journeys and or a full shift to active travel (Outcome). CMOs were broadly captured by two themes: i) considering change and adapting routines: how families responded to schemes, and ii) navigating challenges and building momentum: how schemes evolved in practice. Participants highlighted the potential for schemes to promote active travel to school, improving experiences of the journey and their health, while also noting unintended consequences such as displaced traffic, pushback from some community members and challenges for families with specific access needs. These experiences showed how supportive infrastructure, meaningful consultation and framing around children’s health and safety shape the impact and acceptability of the schemes.\n\nConclusion: The capacity for schemes to promote healthier and more sustainable school travel, while also generating unintended consequences, suggests that effective implementation requires supportive infrastructure, sustained community engagement and alignment with broader policy priorities.\n\nKeywords: active travel; school journey; traffic restriction schemes; school streets; qualitative research; public health",

Theoretically informed by a structuration approach, I reconstruct (1) how researchers reflexively monitor, rationalise, and motivate their mobility actions and (2) how these processes relate to contextual settings in terms of individual life course and career perspectives and macro-level factors, e.g. such as the funding and scholarship landscape or unfavourable conditions in source countries. The analysis draws on 16 qualitative interviews and survey data from 1,532 foreign-educated post-doctoral researchers at German Higher Education Institutions. Based on a triangulation approach, I identify five distinct mobility rationales: ‘Consciously focused’, ‘Exiles’, ‘Sojourners’, ‘Opportunity oriented’ and ‘Familistic established’. The typology serves as a heuristic for science and higher education policymakers to design target-group specific measures for attracting researchers and fostering mobility.",

However, while the legislative intent is clear, significant gaps remain in translating these ambitions into tangible, accessible environments for children with disabilities. Although some advances have been made to address the physical barriers to play, the same progress has not been seen in purposeful design to include people with blindness and low vision (BLV) and their families.

          "abstract": "This chapter traces the evolution and persistence of electoral gender quotas, focusing on India's transformation from categorical rejection to constitutional mandate. Early women's movements opposed reservations, viewing them as incompatible with formal equality and too closely associated with caste-based reservation policies. Drawing on constitutional debates, government records, and other primary sources, I show that quota adoption required the intersection of egalitarian pressure and strategic elite incentives. The chapter then addresses persistence and three reasons why quotas are rarely withdrawn despite being designed as temporary measures. First, quotas fail to eliminate root causes of discrimination; Second, attitudinal change requires longer time horizons than anticipated; and Third, implementation creates new political constituencies that render withdrawal costly. India's trajectory -- comprising women's mobilization, political upheaval, and expanding caste-based reservations -- culminated in the 1992 local quota laws. With nearly three decades of implementation easing the entry of approximately 700 million women into local political office, India provides a model case for understanding gender quotas and their consequences for women's descriptive and substantive representation.",

          "abstract": "A minority of Australian languages contrast stops at the same place of articulation – oppositions described in a variety of ways: e.g. fortis vs lenis, geminate vs singleton – but not well understood due to a lack of instrumental data. To shed more light on these contrasts, acoustic phonetic properties of stops were analyzed in medial pre-vocalic environments in Kamu, Larrakia, Warlmanpa, and Warumungu. In all four languages, stops at the same place of articulation are differentiated primarily by duration, and also degree of voicing estimated using Harmonic Ratios. There is a degree of correlation between voicing and duration, but duration is found to be the property that most consistently differentiates stop modes. These data suggest that the opposition in these languages is best characterised as a length contrast, and that these stop oppositions are realized with complex interactions between duration and voicing.",

          "abstract": "As political landscapes become more inclusive, long-established stigmatization dynamics based on hierarchical power structures evolve. This study examines how language related to disgust is used in the Colombian Senate following the 2022 presidential elections, a period marked by increased representation of traditionally marginalized groups within the legislative context. Disgust-related language, typically weaponized by elites against historically stigmatized outgroups in asymmetrical power scenarios, takes on new implications in this setting. Using word  embeddings to analyze semantic associations, I identify political minorities within the government coalition as emerging “disgust-relevant” groups. These findings challenge traditional expectations by revealing that disgust-related language can extend beyond social stigmatization to target individuals who embody multiple dimensions of ideological opposition. Notably, the analysis suggests that disgust relevancy compounds across intersecting identities, with female senators affiliated with left-leaning ideologies exhibiting a higher likelihood of being verbally and semantically linked to disgust. Additionally, this methodological approach offers a framework for detecting language-based violence in political\ntext, highlighting its relevance for protecting democratic discourse.",

This account is an elementary school teacher's account in Jakarta, Indonesia, with 111,000 followers by 2024. The research method uses qualitative content analysis with directed content analysis techniques, where the analysis category comes directly from six theoretical concepts. The three uploads with the highest engagement in 2024 are analyzed. The results of the study show that the six approaches do not appear in a balanced manner. Andragogy and cybergogy appear consistently in all uploads, while peeragogy appears on two uploads. Pedagogy, heutagogi, and geragogy are not indicated. This research is the first research in Indonesia to apply the six-gogy framework in reading teachergram content. This finding also has policy implications, that platform-based teacher training has the potential to be developed through the use of teacher-influencer content. Instagram in this context serves as a knowledge intermediary platform that facilitates the production, exchange, and legitimacy of teachers' professional knowledge outside of formal institutions.",

However, limited evidence exists regarding their national effects. I investigate SWF effects on GDP per capita ($ US 2024) and domestic savings share of GDP in Norway and Singapore, the two open economies with the largest SWFs, and Australia, a negative control unit with a much smaller SWF. The analysis estimates that Norway’s Government Pension Fund SWF added $816,089 per capita over the analysis period ($28,141/Year) to resource-rent pruned GDP per capita and 9.69% to domestic saving share of GDP (1995-2023). Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes. The findings indicate that robust mandatory SWF-steered savings in open economies can accelerate economic growth beyond standard Solow model steady state equilibrium by adding a non-depreciating compound growth function to domestic investment.",

          "abstract": "Voter opposition to dense housing development contributes to America’s housing shortage. Prevailing explanations emphasize homeowner self-interest and “NIMBYism.” We argue that sociotropic aesthetic judgments powerfully shape housing policy preferences. First, as motivation, we show that homeowners in already-dense areas largely support dense development in their neighborhoods, contrary to prevailing theoretical predictions, and that their distinctive aesthetic tastes likely contribute. Second, our evidence suggests that many voters oppose development due to sociotropic aesthetic concerns: for example, most voters think dense development doesn’t aesthetically “fit” in less-dense neighborhoods, even other than their own; likewise, people in dense neighborhoods are more supportive of dense development on their own block than in low-density neighborhoods. Finally, descriptively and with experiments, we show that aesthetic concerns are widespread, not pretextual, and causally affect support for development. Our findings offer a new lens for understanding housing policy preferences and suggest novel solutions for addressing America’s housing shortage.",

This paper conceptualizes moral rhetoric as a form of moral representation and explores the demand side of such moral representation. Do voters want parties to use moral rhetoric? Based on insights about the link between morality and politics, I argue that moral rhetoric is preferred by a broad set of voters, including copartisans and non-copartisans. Specifically, moral rhetoric is likely to be favored by not only supporters of the party, but also non-supporters with strong moral convictions about politics. Using original surveys in six countries and additional studies in the UK, I find evidence in support of my argument that moral representation is wanted by voters beyond the party base. Unlike extant work, the paper points to the unifying potential of morality in politics. It also opens up a way to empirically study moral representation in politics.",

          "authors": "Saul Alamilla; Sammie L. Haskin; Sherry C. Wang",
          "abstract": "Educational attainment is a critical social determinant of health, yet relatively little research has examined how long-run academic patterns at the school level evolve through periods of macro socioeconomic disruptions or shocks. This study investigates longitudinal academic trajectories among public high schools in Georgia across 17 years (2004-2020), spanning the Great Recession (GR), using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify patterns in ACT performance and college scholarship eligibility. We also estimated the joint evolution of these outcomes. Differences in trajectory shape indicated academic pathways diverged in heterogeneous ways during the GR era, rather than exhibiting a uniform response across schools and communities. These distinct sets of trajectories were strongly patterned by socioeconomic and racial school and neighborhood composition—with schools serving higher-income and majority-White populations more likely to sustain higher academic achievement and access to merit-based aid, while schools serving more economically disadvantaged and racially minoritized populations were more likely to experience persistently lower or declining trajectories. Dual-trajectory analyses further show strong conditional associations between academic performance and scholarship eligibility, such that schools with more favorable achievement trajectories also had substantially higher probabilities of sustained access to merit-based financial aid. These findings indicate that long-run academic trajectories are patterned by existing social and institutional inequalities, with disparities remaining evident during periods of macro socioeconomic disruption. By highlighting heterogeneity in schools’ academic pathways before, during, and after a major economic downturn, this study underscores the importance of approaches that capture such heterogeneity for appropriate educational equity and community health planning.\nKeywords: academic trajectories; social determinants of health; structural inequality; educational inequality; Great Recession; group-based trajectory modeling; public high schools",

          "abstract": "Objective: To examine how dual-income parents coordinate coparenting schedules, how couple-level work characteristics shape these patterns, and how they relate to shared and individual well-being.\nBackground: Drawing on structural symbolic interactionism and time-geographic perspectives, this study conceptualizes coparenting as a dyadic process in which role expectations are enacted within structurally constrained daily time. In this context, demanding work characteristics constitute a key structural constraint.\nMethod: Using nationally representative 2009, 2014, and 2019 Korean Time Use Survey data of 758 dual-earner parents, we identified dyadic coparenting schedules using multichannel sequence and cluster analyses. Multinomial logistic regression and dyadic structural equation models assessed how couple-level work characteristics (work schedule irregularity, commute timing, and work hours) predicted coparenting schedules and how these schedules related to shared and individual well-being.\nResults: Five coparenting schedules emerged: mother-centered care with morning–evening peaks (47%), evening shared care (24%), mother-centered all-day care (12%), father-centered evening care (10%), and transition to shared care (7%). Shared caregiving clusters were more likely when wives worked longer, more irregular, or later schedules than husbands. These clusters reported lower shared time pressure and higher shared life satisfaction, with fathers benefiting beyond shared effects.\nConclusion: Understanding work constraints requires a couple-level perspective that foregrounds gendered dynamics in how paid work and caregiving are coordinated. Workplace and policy interventions that address these gendered dynamics may more effectively support coparenting.",

          "authors": "Gareth David Jones; Alexandra Curtis; Jimmy James; Jeremy Corcoran; Jamie Gibson; Jade Sampford; Nicola Peat; Matthew Fuller; Gareth Lee Jones; Sophie Badcock",
          "abstract": "Background: Global demand for rehabilitation is high and projected to rise, driven by an increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, population aging, and a rise in demand for quality. Patients expect quality interventions delivered by experts, managers implore more for less, while clinicians including physiotherapists strive for support for professional agency from employers. The increasing demand necessitates effective rehabilitation interventions essential to improve patient outcomes, yet marginalization and the worst forms of managerialism pose real threats to clinical excellence.\nMethods: In 2013, we introduced a physiotherapy rehabilitation team manifesto in response to a shift towards prioritizing transactional metrics over clinical development outputs, which we deemed a threat to the quality of care. The manifesto consisted of seven declarations to strengthen clinical governance We evaluated its impact by comparing standardized clinical output counts (e.g. abstracts, publications, grants) and Advanced Practice (AP) proxy measures as independent and dependent variables, respectively, between the pre-manifesto (2004-2013) and post-manifesto decades (2014-2023). \nResults: There was a significant increase in total clinical outputs in the decade post manifesto which included 101 peer-reviewed publications. AP proxy measures improved post manifesto, with significant proportional rises in post-graduate education enrollments (11(19%) pre-manifesto and 48(81%) post-manifesto), and publication first/last authorship by team members (5(45%) pre-manifesto and 61(76%) post manifesto), indicating evolving research and networking skills. We argue that semiotic mediation, where achieving outputs enhances rehabilitation quality through social discourse, combined with Kanter's structural empowerment theory, provides a framework that explains our positive outcomes. \nConclusion: The manifesto fostered a supportive structure that empowers physiotherapy clinicians to contribute, innovate, and feel valued. To combat excessive managerialism and ensure a flourishing clinical workforce, we next recommend scaling the manifesto to other physiotherapy specialties and redesigning it as policy in partnership with managers.",

          "abstract": "Women rely on intra- and inter-generational transfers for wealth accumulation more than men, yet the role of inheritance in closing gender wealth gaps remains poorly understood. Using Swedish registry inheritance data from 2002–2004 combined with panel data on individual wealth portfolios and labor income from 1999–2007, we examine how wealth and income evolve upon inheriting. Inheritance leads to larger relative increases in women’s net wealth compared to men, however the difference disappears in the long term. Differences in portfolio composition as well as unequal inheritance of productive assets, in the form of business ownership, may play a role. We find evidence indicative of structural barriers to financial resource accumulation over the lifecycle rather than inherent gender differences in investment preferences. The disparity in wealth accumulation post-inheritance is reinforced by gendered labor supply responses. Daughters reduce their paid labor supply more than sons, seemingly to provide unpaid eldercare. Given these findings, inheritance alone should not be viewed as an effective mechanism for reducing gender wealth inequality. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of large-scale, geographically disaggregated data on armed conflicts, protests, and similar events has opened new avenues of research, but has also introduced significant data quality challenges. A notable yet often overlooked issue involves observations with “known geographic imprecision” (KGI), where event locations are unknown and instead arbitrarily assigned by dataset authors. Although this issue is widely recognized and accounts for up to a quarter of observations in datasets like UCDP GED, it is rarely addressed by users. This paper presents a stochastic method derived from the multiple-imputation literature, employing spatio-temporal Gaussian processes and leveraging latent actor-conflict features in the data to enhance location accuracy. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that this approach substantially enhances the accuracy of these observations and improves predictive performance beyond the state-of-the-art when applied out-of-sample. Additionally, an adapted version of the UCDP GED dataset that employs this new procedure is provided, showcasing the practical application and benefits of the methodology.",

Due to the increased risk of loneliness and the social barriers people with LD encounter, companion chatbots could be of particular added value to their lives. To gain insight into the social meaning these relationships might have, this study adopted an inclusive approach in which an academic and a non-academic researcher with a LD collaborated. Through interviewing six people with LD, we have found that they use companion chatbots in differing ways. Such as a daily companion, an interactive diary, to find support and as an imaginary character with which they could engage in fantastical stories. The chatbot offers people with LD a way to participate in specific social interactions that are less accessible (or even impossible) to them in the real world, due to social norms and institutional realities. While the chatbot does add value to their daily lives, none of them rate the chatbot evenly valuable as relationships to real people, due to its lack of essential human characteristics. By adopting a posthumanist framework, this paper comes to understand that companionship to chatbots by people with LD should therefore be understood differently than human to human relationships. It is a way to engage in non-normative social interactions that help to address and navigate daily societal and institutional life.",

The report places a particular focus on developments compared to the first survey at the beginning of 2025. Overall, attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) remain ambivalent among the population, but show slight shifts toward greater awareness, more differentiated assessments, and increasing acceptance, especially among working people. The latter report more frequent personal benefits from AI, while the perception of societal risks is cautiously positive. In the world of work, the affective attitude toward AI remains stable and positive, while individual cognitive assessments are developing moderately toward more positive assessments, for example, with regard to income, career opportunities, and skill requirements. Job insecurity remains low overall; general concerns about AI replacing human labor are declining slightly. At the same time, the professional use of AI is increasing, especially generative AI, and is expanding from routine tasks to more complex and creative ones. Overall, the results point to a gradual transition from uncertainty to a more experience-based engagement with AI, with AI increasingly being perceived as collegial support, although existing ambivalences have not been completely resolved.",

Results show that parental loss occurs, on average, by age 33, with fathers dying earlier than mothers. Inequalities are marked: the poorest are twice as likely to lose a parent by age 25 and nearly three times more likely to experience a child’s death by age 65 than the richest. Gender differences are also substantial; by age 70, 36% of women are widowed compared with 9% of men.

          "abstract": "This study examines religious affiliation and age group influences on virginity beliefs among Malaysian adults, corresponding to Gift, Stigma and Process metaphors. Malaysians are majorly religious. Religiously, premarital sex is often stigmatized, because virginity considered as marriage gift except in Buddhism tends towards secularism while non-religious hold individual perspectives; young adults face virginity-related tensions, while most older Malaysians hold traditional views on virginity. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 Malaysian adults, using adapted Virginity Belief Scale (VBS), measuring three frames via mean value (higher mean value, stronger frame endorsement). Respondents were divided into four religious affiliations (Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism) and No religious affiliation and six age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 or above) and. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests conducted, with pairwise comparisons conducted on significant frames. For religious affiliation, significant differences showed across all frames, for gift (H = 45.076, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ𝐻2 ≈ 0.098) and stigma (H = 116.523, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ𝐻2 ≈ 0.27), for both endorsement Hinduism showing highest while Buddhism lowest for both, and Christianity/Islam/non-religious affiliation intermediate. Significantly weak differences for process frame (H = 9.508, p = 0.050, ƞ𝐻2 ≈ 0.013). Age groups showed significant differences for the gift frame (H = 45.375, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ𝐻2 ≈ 0.097), lowest in 25-34, highest in 65 or above and significant differences for the stigma frame (H = 132.216, p &lt; 0.001, ƞ𝐻2 ≈ 0.31), highest in 35-44 and lowest in 25-34 while age groups showed no significant differences for the process frame (H = 9.135, p = 0.104, ƞ𝐻 2≈ 0.0099). To conclude, this study among Malaysians found that gift and stigma frames varied with religious affiliation and age groups, weakly varied process frames for religious affiliation. While stable process frames among age groups suggested a more universal developmental perspective on virginity.",

          "authors": "Scott Oatley; Dharmi Kapadia",
          "abstract": "Social class analysis has been a vital component of sociologists’ research agenda for many decades, informing our understanding of social inequalities. However, current measures of social class are, by their neo-Weberian design determined by employment status and occupation. Consequently, measures of social class that are determined by employment relations restrict sociological understandings of social class to concepts related to working life. The study of later life – research that focuses upon the study of ageing and its impacts – typically focuses on individuals that have left the world of work and have entered a retired or semi-retired portion of their lives. To apply current measures of social class to the study of later life presents several challenges. Sociologists are often forced to use a ‘legacy’ class measure that uses an individual’s last recorded occupation prior to retiring. This is problematic, as legacy occupation may not reflect an individual’s current social class location. This paper seeks to remedy these problems by adopting a Bourdieusian inspired framework based on Capitals, Assets, and Resources (CAR) to construct a relevant social class measure for the study of later life. First, we set a theoretical foundation for the construction of this new measure of social class in later life. Then, using multiple correspondence analysis and latent profile analysis, we identified a five-class model of social class for use in later life. Our five-class model constitutes a small but very privileged Elite; followed by an established middle and culturally engaged high earners which make up a decently sized middle class; most respondents fall into a traditional working class with the rest making up a sizeable precariat class. We find a stark composition of social class membership characterised by a sizeable Traditional Working Class and a large Precariat population with a small middle class and tiny but exceptionally privileged Elite. Our findings from formal statistical modelling on determinants of security, stability, and prospects in later life demonstrate that CAR based approaches present clear points of stratification across social classes. This clarity is possible without having to rely on legacy based measures that are tied to forms of employment relations. We also find evidence to support the use of both legacy and CAR based measures of social class in the analysis of later life.",

          "abstract": "This study addressed a critical gap in the literature concerning the specific cognitive challenges and cultural intricacies involved in non-alphabetic language learning. The research examined user patterns and insights related to digital learning platforms, particularly Quizlet Plus, in supporting Japanese language acquisition. Employing a rigorous mixed-methods approach, quantitative access patterns were analysed and in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 second-year Japanese language learners at Australian universities. The study investigated how Self-Determination Theory (SDT) principles—autonomy, competence, and relatedness were operationalised through personalised study paths, real-time feedback, and community-driven resources on Quizlet Plus. The findings revealed that while the platform effectively supported primary vocabulary retention and grammar acquisition, it fell short in fostering the deeper contextual understanding and cultural competence required by more advanced learners, particularly when the challenges of the three Japanese scripts: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji were involved. The study proposed strategic enhancements to bridge this gap, including AI-driven adaptive feedback and culturally responsive learning paths, to create a more comprehensive and practical learning experience. These findings had significant implications for the future design of digital language learning tools, suggesting new directions for research to optimise educational outcomes across diverse linguistic contexts.",

          "authors": "Gareth David Jones; Alexandra Curtis; Jimmy James; Jeremy Corcoran; Jamie Gibson; Jade Sampford; Nicola Peat; Matthew Fuller; Gareth Lee Jones; Sophie Badcock",
          "abstract": "Background: Global demand for rehabilitation is high and projected to rise, driven by an increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, population aging, and a rise in demand for quality. Patients expect quality interventions delivered by experts, managers implore more for less, while clinicians including physiotherapists strive for support for professional agency from employers. The increasing demand necessitates effective rehabilitation interventions essential to improve patient outcomes, yet marginalization and the worst forms of managerialism pose real threats to clinical excellence.\nMethods: In 2013, we introduced a physiotherapy rehabilitation team manifesto in response to a shift towards prioritizing transactional metrics over clinical development outputs, which we deemed a threat to the quality of care. The manifesto consisted of seven declarations to strengthen clinical governance We evaluated its impact by comparing standardized clinical output counts (e.g. abstracts, publications, grants) and Advanced Practice (AP) proxy measures as independent and dependent variables, respectively, between the pre-manifesto (2004-2013) and post-manifesto decades (2014-2023). \nResults: There was a significant increase in total clinical outputs in the decade post manifesto which included 101 peer-reviewed publications. AP proxy measures improved post manifesto, with significant proportional rises in post-graduate education enrollments (11(19%) pre-manifesto and 48(81%) post-manifesto), and publication first/last authorship by team members (5(45%) pre-manifesto and 61(76%) post manifesto), indicating evolving research and networking skills. We argue that semiotic mediation, where achieving outputs enhances rehabilitation quality through social discourse, combined with Kanter's structural empowerment theory, provides a framework that explains our positive outcomes. \nConclusion: The manifesto fostered a supportive structure that empowers physiotherapy clinicians to contribute, innovate, and feel valued. To combat excessive managerialism and ensure a flourishing clinical workforce, we next recommend scaling the manifesto to other physiotherapy specialties and redesigning it as policy in partnership with managers.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Katrin Schwanitz; Lydia Palumbo",
          "abstract": "Leaving the parental home is a key transition milestone, often coinciding with the adoption of major adult roles. Reaching it off-time may diminish young adults’ well-being due to non-compliance with the normative ages defining the ‘right’ time to leave. Indeed, the concept of ‘failure to launch’ in the literature underscores the crucial role of home-leaving timing on well-being, yet empirical investigation into the causal link between transitioning off-time and subjective well-being remains limited. This study, therefore, investigates how off-time home leaving and returning home relate to life satisfaction. Using rich prospective panel data spanning over thirty years from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and Understanding Society (UKHLS), we employed fixed-effects regression models to esti-mate within-individual changes in life satisfaction associated with these residential moves. We also conducted an additional, exploratory analysis focusing on young adults who had not yet left home, examining changes in life satisfaction around objective and subjective social age thresholds. The main analyses yielded non-significant findings for both off-time home leaving and returning home. Crucial-ly, the exploratory analysis revealed a notable —yet modest— pattern for non-leavers: life satisfaction experiences a significant decline (0.17 points) in the years approaching and following the objective age threshold. These findings suggest the psychological cost of delayed independence is not driven by the residential move itself, but by the failure to meet internalised social timetables. We conclude that the pressure of age-graded norms is a more critical driver of young adult well-being than the event-timing of the transition.",

          "authors": "J.M. Bailey",
          "abstract": "Global fertility rates are currently converging toward unprecedented lows, with digitally mature nations exhibiting Total Fertility Rates (TFR) far below the replacement threshold. While standard economic models attribute this decline to the quality-quantity trade-off, they fail to explain why fertility remains suppressed despite significant pro-natalist financial interventions. This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework—the Compression Wave—to explain this demographic-evolutionary paradox. Synthesizing longitudinal demographic data with cultural evolutionary theory, I argue that digital maturity acts as an environmental mismatch that hijacks evolved status-seeking heuristics. Drawing on Richerson and Boyd’s Big Mistake hypothesis and Henrich’s Collective Brain, I demonstrate how the shift from vertical (parent-to-child) to oblique and horizontal (teacher- and peer-driven) cultural transmission creates a Status Trap. In this trap, individuals are evolutionarily seduced into a runaway positional arms race for digital prestige, modeling their lives after childless teachers rather than fertile parents. This process results in the systematic unlearning of the domestic social operating system—the specific cultural heuristics required for low-friction child-rearing. The paper concludes by proposing a Reflexive Turn, suggesting that the same digital maturity that induced the collapse—specifically via Large Language Models (LLMs)—may offer the only viable mechanism for re-synthesizing the lost cultural buffers necessary for demographic sustainability.",

While influential in monitoring performance, engagement, and compliance, these approaches provide limited insight into how responsibility for learning is structurally distributed through pedagogical design, as accountability is inferred primarily from learner behaviour rather than institutional design decisions. This study examines institutional design responsibility as a distinct evaluand within educational evaluation by developing and applying the 5C Rubric, an artefact-based framework for analysing how responsibility for learning is embedded in course design. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and Self-Regulated Learning, the rubric operationalises five interrelated design principles: Coherence, Cognitive Load, Competence, Completion, and Connection. Applied to a semester-long corpus of educator-generated course artefacts, the analysis identifies a recurring structural pattern in which alignment and mastery progression are consistently embedded, while accountability, reflective integration, and load-sensitive scaffolding remain unevenly institutionalised. The study contributes an artefact-based and ethically proportionate approach to evaluation and accountability in technology-enhanced higher education.",

          "abstract": "Publication practices in the social sciences act as a filter that favors statistically significant results over null findings. While the problem of selection on significance (SoS) is well-known in theory, it has been difficult to measure its scope empirically, and it has been challenging to determine how selection varies across contexts. In this article, we use large language models to extract granular and validated data on about 100,000 articles published in over 150 political science journals from 2010 to 2024. We show that fewer than 2% of articles that rely on statistical methods report null-only findings in their abstracts, while over 90% of papers highlight significant results. To put these findings in perspective, we develop and calibrate a simple model of publication bias. Across a range of plausible assumptions, we find that statistically significant results are estimated to be one to two orders of magnitude more likely to enter the published record than null results. Leveraging metadata extracted from individual articles, we show that the pattern of strong SoS holds across subfields, journals, methods, and time periods. However, a few factors such as pre-registration and randomized experiments correlate with greater acceptance of null results. We conclude by discussing implications for the field and the potential of our new dataset for investigating other questions about political science.",

          "authors": "Michael Jacob",
          "abstract": "Computational neuroscience has yielded powerful tools for analyzing brain structure and function, yet its foundational commitments to information theory and algorithmic modeling leave a critical philosophical gap: the question of how value, meaning, and purpose relate to neural activity. This paper approaches that gap historically and philosophically, by tracing three paradigms in the study of neurodynamics: oscillatory decomposition, nonlinear dynamical systems, and emerging vitalist-teleological perspectives. Electrophysiology serves as a recurring case study: from Hans Berger's initial recordings, through Walter Freeman's application of chaos theory to olfactory dynamics, to contemporary evidence that subcortical arousal signals shape the global geometry of brain activity. Through this history, successive generations of researchers have been drawn toward holistic and normative interpretations of brain signals, even as their analytic methods have resisted such readings. To overcome this gap, the interpretive lenses of the humanities are explored as conceptual resources for bridging the normative and dynamical dimensions that the history of neuroscience has kept apart. This prospect is specifically considered through musicology, particularly the philosophies of Langer, and Tomlinson, as a domain where form, temporality, and significance are theorized without recourse to encoding and decoding. Instead, a musical lens reframes neurodynamics as global, emotive forms sculpted by the recursive play of anticipation and fulfillment, nested within the vital metabolism of living organisms. This reframing does not abandon the mathematical tools of dynamical systems science but situates them within a richer conceptual ecology, one that may open new avenues for addressing normativity at the intersection of neuroscience and the humanities.",

Drawing on a mixed-methods study of job seeking computer science students, the report documents the wide range of human, institutional, and internet- and AI-based resources students use, how frequently they rely on each, and how useful they perceive different sources to be. The findings show that students assemble overlapping support ecosystems rather than relying on a single source, combining peer networks, industry contacts, online tools, and college-provided resources. While colleges offer substantial support, the report highlights misalignments between institutional resources and students’ needs across different stages of the job search, as well as equity concerns related to access to paid tools and professional networks. The report concludes with implications for educators and institutions seeking to better coordinate job search support and attend to students’ well-being during the college-to-work transition.",

          "abstract": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is widely promoted as a catalyst for agricultural transformation in developing countries, yet empirical evidence on its efficiency effects remains limited and mixed. This study examines the association between foreign direct investment and coffee production efficiency in Uganda, with particular attention to regional heterogeneity and policy context. Using a panel of five coffee-producing regions over the period 1995–2024, we estimate technical efficiency scores through stochastic frontier analysis and subsequently analyze their relationship with FDI exposure using fixed-effects panel regressions.\nThe results indicate that foreign direct investment is positively and significantly associated with coffee production efficiency, reflecting improvements in the use of existing inputs rather than expansion of cultivated area. On average, a one percent increase in FDI inflows is associated with an approximately 0.07–0.09 percent increase in production efficiency. However, these efficiency gains are unevenly distributed across regions, with stronger effects observed in relatively mature coffee-producing areas. Complementary factors including technology adoption, infrastructure, capital formation, and governance quality are also positively associated with efficiency, conditioning the magnitude of investment-related gains. In addition, the relationship between FDI and efficiency strengthens following the implementation of Uganda’s National Coffee Policy, highlighting the role of institutional reforms.\nThe findings suggest that while foreign investment can support efficiency-enhancing growth in smallholder-based agricultural systems, its benefits are neither automatic nor uniformly distributed. Effective investment strategies therefore require complementary public investments and institutional frameworks to promote inclusive and regionally balanced agricultural development.",

I argue that persistent oil revenue shortfalls strain social contracts in oil-exporting states, compelling governments to enact targeted governance reforms under tightening fiscal constraints. I exploit the sudden emergence of the U.S. shale oil industry as an exogenous supply shock to examine how oil exporters adjust to sustained revenue declines. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find governments exposed to the shale revolution did not respond through broad political liberalization or public goods retrenchment and instead adopted targeted reforms. Systematic evidence on specific reform uptake and a case study indicate these reforms protected public goods provision and curtailed private capture, consistent with a political survival motive driven by rising mass public threats. The findings point to an asymmetric resource curse, in which oil shortfalls generate political responses distinct from those produced by windfalls.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study provides the first systematic longitudinal analysis of the influence of paternal involvement in family life – across childhood and adolescence – on the gender-role attitudes of children by the age of 14 or 15.\nBackground: Recent research suggests that, in post-industrial societies, paternal involvement in family life is increasing. Although previous studies of paternal involvement have considered paternal influences on children’s cognitive or socio-emotional development, such studies have not yet addressed paternal influences on children’s attitudes toward gender. Relatedly, previous studies on the intergenerational transmission of gender attitudes have analyzed maternal influences, but have neglected the significance of paternal influences. This study engages both strands of the research by analyzing the effects of paternal behaviors on children’s attitudes toward gender roles.\nMethod: Multivariate linear regressions models were estimated on data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC); a survey with biannual observations over 10 years for 2,796 children born between 1999-2000. \nResults: Fathers’ time spent on childcare during childhood was associated with gender-egalitarian attitudes in children by the age of 14 or 15. The most powerful predictor of children’s gender-role attitudes, however, was the amount of time fathers spent on housework during children’s adolescence, both absolute and relative to the amount of time mothers spent on housework. Fathers’ unpaid labor at home was as relevant for children’s gender-role attitudes as mothers’ paid labor in the workforce. These results held after controlling for maternal domestic behaviors and for the gender-role attitudes of both parents. \nConclusion: Father involvement in childcare and housework during childhood and adolescence play an important role in shaping children’s gender-egalitarian attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Socio-economic inequalities in political participation are well documented, with elected assemblies typically overrepresenting older, highly educated men. In recent years, protest movements and movement-based parties have entered electoral politics across Western democracies, raising questions about whether such actors broaden access to political office for underrepresented groups. This paper explores these questions through a descriptive analysis of representatives elected for the Norwegian anti-road toll movement party Folkeaksjonen Nei til Mer Bompenger (FNB) in the 2019 local and regional elections. Drawing on an original survey of local and county councillors, the study examines the socio-demographic characteristics and prior political and civil society experience of FNB representatives, comparing them to representatives from established parties elected to the same assemblies. The findings indicate substantial continuity in recruitment patterns: FNB representatives were predominantly male, relatively old, comparatively well educated, and often politically experienced prior to their election. While some differences between parties are observable, these are modest in magnitude and do not suggest a fundamental departure from established patterns of political recruitment. Taken together, the results suggest that movement parties emerging from protest politics do not necessarily function as broad pathways into formal political office for traditionally underrepresented groups.",

The study examined the perceptions, attitudes, and usage behavior of 1,657 German respondents (1,119 working, 538 non-working) at the beginning of 2025. The predominantly ambivalent attitudes toward AI among the population show only minor differences between working and non-working respondents. In the world of work, employed people initially express a rather positive affective attitude toward AI, but this is relativized when it comes to the concrete assessment of individual working conditions. While respondents see potential for AI to reduce workloads and improve health protection, they are critical of AI's impact on data protection, social contacts, and co-determination. Specific concerns about job loss or career prospects remain limited so far. At the same time, there is evidence of increasing, predominantly voluntary use of AI in the workplace. Overall, the results point to still unstable and context-dependent attitude patterns characterized by a high degree of ambivalence.",

          "authors": "Ana Cristancho; Ben Bradford; Krisztián Pósch",
          "abstract": "Drawing on deterrence theory, the War on Terror institutionalised a security framework centred on the use and threat of force as the primary means of addressing terrorism. Its core premise — namely, that increasing the threat of coercion necessarily produces stronger deterrent effects and greater compliance — has, however, rarely been questioned. Challenging the assumption of perfect rationality implicit in the presumed linearity between ‘severity’ and compliance, critics argue that the threat of ‘maximum coercive power’ embedded in militarised interventions may fail to achieve its intended aims and instead generate backlash effects by eroding legitimacy and placing non-state actors in a ‘loss frame’, thereby increasing risk acceptance, incentives for violent retaliation, and organisational adaptation. By contrast, governance-enhancing, non-violent interventions are expected to situate actors in a ‘gains frame’, thereby reducing incentives for mobilisation.\nThis article examines whether higher levels of militarisation are associated with reductions in terrorism, whether they are counterproductive, or whether governance-centred, non-violent interventions are more effective. Using cross-national data from 2011–2021 and employing Poisson pseudo–maximum likelihood models with country and year fixed effects and robust clustering, the study finds no evidence that militarisation deters terrorism, limited evidence of backlash, and strong evidence that governance-oriented interventions significantly reduce terrorist activity. These findings challenge the policy assumption that greater coercive capacity enhances security and instead suggest that governance-centred approaches may offer more effective and sustainable counter-terrorism strategies.",

          "abstract": "Despite Pakistan’s high tuberculosis burden, BCG vaccination coverage remains suboptimal (71.8%) with pronounced urban-rural disparities. This study analyses IPUMS-MICS6 data (2017-2020; n=17,872 children aged 0-24 months) using survey weighted logistic regression and average marginal effects to quantify the influence of child, maternal, educational and socioeconomic determinants on BCG receipt, stratified by urban and rural residence. Maternal higher education demonstrated the highest absolute association with vaccination probability (21.3 percentage-point increase), followed by strong wealth gradients in rural populations (up to 13.1pp increase). Pre-term birth was associated with substantially higher predicted uptake in urban settings (14.5pp increase), with no comparable effect in rural areas, indicating contextual heterogeneity in access pathways. These findings reveal structurally patterned inequalities in early life immunisation focused on BCG receipt, highlighting persistent barriers to equitable EPI coverage. Policy response should priorities integrated social protection and health system strategies with education-focused interventions and demand-side support for targeting rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged households.",

          "authors": "Geeta Devi Adhikari",
          "abstract": "The global population of refugees is almost twice the women population; consequently, international protection regimes against refugees continue to despite the gender-related risks that they are subjected to. Although the international organisations have become more conscious of gender-based violence, inequality, and exclusion as the essential aspects of protection, there exist significant gaps between the promises of the policy and the real experiences of refugee women. This paper is a critical review of the role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to protect refugee women by framing practices of the UNHCR within feminist refugee studies and the critical humanitarian governance literature. With the agreements of secondary academic materials, the policy documents of the United Nations, and reports of the international human rights organisations, the study asserts that the gender protection framework of UNHCR is structurally confined into the legal constraints of the 1951 Refugee Convention, the state sovereignty predominance, donor-pressured interests, and lax accountability measures. As much as it is true that UNHCR has made normative advances by rendering gender mainstreaming, with Age, Gender, and Diversity framework, the study still suggests that the gaps in implementation have continued to render refugees vulnerable to violence, marginalisation and lack of agency. The study suggests that structural and legal reform to provide significant protection to refugee women is necessary, but not just to increase the scope of humanitarian policy by contributing to the discussion about governing refugees.",

          "abstract": "Nationally representative surveys suggest Chinese Christian growth has plateaued at 2–5%, contrasting with supply-side predictions of 7–10% annual growth and an eventual Christian majority. Using an agent-based model, I formalize the theory's core mechanisms, including competitive evangelism, strict-church retention, cross-religion recruitment, and persecution-driven solidarity, under conditions more favorable to Christianity than any real religious market. Four findings emerge. First, the distribution of religious demand, not supply-side mechanisms, determines growth: under a neutral population, Christianity never exceeds 3%. Second, regulation always suppresses growth; the solidarity effect filters the church but does not grow it, consistent with historians' finding that Rome's Christian majority resulted from imperial patronage, not persecution. Third, strict churches win internal competition but cannot expand the convertible pool. Fourth, when declining intergenerational transmission is incorporated, the model's equilibrium falls to 4–5%, bracketing survey estimates. The debate over Chinese Christian numbers is not a data problem but a theoretical one: the theory's verbal predictions outrun what its own formalized logic can support.",

          "abstract": "For two decades, hyperscanning has interpreted inter-brain synchrony as the neural signature of teamwork. Yet evidence from real operations indicates that effective teams do not remain “in sync”; they redistribute cognitive effort dynamically. This Perspective introduces a load-sharing framework that captures how cognitive resources shift between operators using dual-fNIRS data collected during simulations. By classifying synchronous, asynchronous, and hand-over states, and deriving quantitative metrics of division-of-labour and switching efficiency, this approach reframes team neuroscience from static correlation toward dynamic control. The framework establishes an empirical foundation for measuring collective cognitive homeostasis—the ability of human teams to balance mental workload adaptively under pressure.",

We argue the intrusion of nationalized policy conflicts into local government places greater burdens on those occupying these positions and will increase local policymaker turnover. Focusing on local education, we develop novel measures of nationalized policy conflicts in thousands of school board meetings and pair this with newly assembled rosters of superintendents and school board members. We find nationalized policy conflicts increase local education policymaker turnover. These conflicts are most impactful for school superintendents, who become more likely to retire or resign in their wake. We observe similar, but more muted and slow-developing, consequences for school board members. Our findings show nationalized policy conflicts can alter the character of local government by generating personnel change in key policymaking positions.",

          "abstract": "Political efforts to weaken democratic institutions place civil servants in a dilemma between political responsiveness and protecting democratic values. As civil servants are embedded in an organizational hierarchy, we argue that signals from their direct hierarchical superiors are of key importance to understand how civil servants address this dilemma. Using a randomized survey experiment among Norwegian national-level civil servants, we find that democratic backsliding increases opposition to government wishes, internal and external voice, and con-sideration of exit from the organization. Managerial signals moderate these effects: civil serv-ants are more inclined to voice concerns or consider exit when managers signal responsiveness to government wishes. In a conceptual replication and extension among US civil servants we likewise find a greater inclination to exit if the manager signals responsiveness to government wishes, but also that respondents here are less inclined to voice their concerns to the manager. We discuss possible explanations of findings. Overall, our findings imply that managerial signals within the administrative hierarchy are shaping civil servant responses to democratic backsliding, and that managers who emphasize the importance of protecting democratic values can serve as a bulwark of democracy.",

          "abstract": "In countries like the United Kingdom, social life is today marked by endemic disruption. We live in postnormal times: the infrastructures underpinning everyday life, from affordable housing to green spaces, can no longer be taken for granted, and disturbance, lack and uncertainty have become background conditions of everyday life. In this essay, I argue that these changing circumstances not only affect daily life, but transform conditions for public knowledge. Disruptions of the taken-for-granted can no longer be expected to trigger a process of learning and problem-solving. Instead, they are increasingly met with denial. To make sense of this situation, I draw on classic work in the sociology of knowledge, Ideology and Utopia (1936) by Karl Mannheim. I argue that today's struggles between ideology and utopia unfold on the level of infrastructure, turning everyday environments such as roads into sites of latent conflict. I discuss examples of such environmental conflicts in the UK and propose they can be understood as “trials of co-existence.\" Here, the introduction of new technological systems - such as autonomous vehicles - into everyday settings puts at stake the conditions of existence of other beings belonging to the setting, such as pedestrians or trees. The proliferation of such trials suggests that postnormality is not only marked by changing conditions of social existence - endemic disruption - but by distinctive struggles over co-existence, or interdependence. To conclude, I reflect on what such struggles can teach us about the political challenges facing our technology-intensive, ecologically challenged societies.",

A tiled heat map and associated time-series plots reveal two key patterns: a clear rise in the frequency of mass shootings over time and increasingly pronounced seasonal clustering, with recent years showing concentrated summer peaks.

          "abstract": "While climate scientists largely agree that we are in a severe climate crisis, political leaders around the world struggle with the drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed. The literature on public support indicates that this is often due to domestic distributive conflicts over short-term policy costs, especially for market-based policies. This study focuses on two regulation-based policy instruments (an obligation to retrofit building envelopes and a ban on new fossil-fuelled boilers) that target the same level of emissions reductions in the Swiss residential sector, but with different distributions of costs between tenants and homeowners. In a large-scale preregistered survey experiment (n= 1831), conducted in summer 2025, we inform respondents about the effectiveness of these policy instruments to assess public support. We experimentally manipulate whether distributive information (disaggregated by dwelling type (flat or house) and ownership type (owners or renters) is displayed and whether redistributive measures (policy exceptions or targeted subsidies) are included in the policy proposal. The results show that no redistributive measure can recover the drop in public support from providing the information on the policies' distributive effects. Notwithstanding, there is still a majority support for banning fossil-fuel boilers rather than retrofitting building envelopes. Additional subgroup analyses show that homeowners oppose the latter across all experimental conditions, including the control group. This indicates that homeowners are already aware of the costs for building envelope retrofits, before the experimental treatment can make policy costs salient through distributive information. As they are also unlikely to be more supportive when redistributive measures are implemented, a key obstacle persists.",

          "abstract": "Although political trust is a long-standing interdisciplinary topic, the lack of comparable cross-national time-series data has limited scholars’ ability to analyze its determinants and consequences and to generalize findings across countries and over time. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Trust in National Government (TrustGov) Dataset—a cross-national time-series resource covering 115 countries and territories from 1973 to 2020, harmonizing 1,545 country-year observations from 189 national and cross-national surveys using a Bayesian latent variable model. The dataset is validated through a series of convergent and construct tests. TrustGov supports qualitative and mixed-method research by guiding case selection and helping scholars probe mechanisms behind shifts in trust. It also enables quantitative analyses of trust's dynamic relationships with determinants such as inequality, election integrity,  and institutional performance, as well as outcomes, for example policy preferences and crisis resilience. The project will be updated regularly through periodic releases as new data become publicly available, supporting ongoing research on political trust.",

          "abstract": "Pakistan’s 2018-2030 Family Planning and Population Policy set forth ambitious targets, aiming for a 2 percent annual increase in overall contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) at both national and subnational levels. This study evaluates the feasibility of these targets through a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, leveraging publicly available datasets. By reconstructing historical CPR trends and employing advanced statistical approaches—including generalized additive models (GAM) and logistic growth models—our analysis accounts for Pakistan’s significant demographic diversity and varying regional contexts. The findings reveal substantial disparities in contraceptive use across provinces and regions, with some areas demonstrating steady progress while others lag behind due to persistent socio-cultural, economic, and infrastructural barriers. Our projections indicate that, although select provinces may approach the policy’s CPR goals by 2025, most subnational units are unlikely to meet the 2 percent annual increase without substantial improvements in health service delivery, supply chain management, and community engagement. The study underscores the importance of tailored, region-specific interventions and sustained political commitment to advance family planning outcomes. Limitations include reliance on modelling approaches, availability of uniform data and potential underreporting in certain areas. Overall, while the national targets are laudable, achieving uniform progress requires nuanced, evidence-based strategies responsive to local needs. The results provide critical insights for policymakers and stakeholders to recalibrate expectations and prioritize investments that can accelerate contraceptive uptake and contribute to broader reproductive health objectives in Pakistan.",

          "abstract": "A number of recent papers have used unsupervised image clustering methods for social science questions. However, there has not yet been research examining whether the clusters resemble the kinds of groupings that social scientists identify when conducting traditional image analysis. In response, we compare the clusters emerging through previously recommended unsupervised image clustering methods in social sciences with the manually categorised groupings to determine which, if any, of these methods are able to imitate the ‘social scientist’s gaze’. We use four different conceptual lenses from previous work, theme, content, purpose and type\nand use various metrics to assess the similarities. We show that none of the methods can consistently match manual analysis. Therefore, while unsupervised methods for image clustering can identify visually similar images, this may not be sufficient to capture the full breadth of methodological and theoretical approaches common for social sciences. Following this, we discuss the limitations and opportunities further, suggesting that we might consider unsupervised approaches as a distinct gaze or focus on developing methods which align with previous social scientists’ gazes.",

          "abstract": "Rural areas are often portrayed as relatively socially homogeneous and understood through a unidimensional urban–rural continuum. Yet growing evidence suggests that population composition varies markedly both within and across national rural contexts. This study develops, to our knowledge, the first small-area geodemographic classification of rural Denmark to make this internal diversity visible and analytically tractable. Using nationwide individual-level register data aggregated to small micro-areas generated by an automated redistricting algorithm, we apply unsupervised cluster analysis to a multidimensional set of socio-demographic indicators. The resulting typology identifies distinct rural clusters that differ in demographic and population dynamics, socioeconomic characteristics, and household and family structures. Mapping these clusters uncovers spatial patterns in socio-demographic differences that challenge simplified notions of the rural as a uniform social space, highlighting, for instance, contrasts between ageing and declining coastal areas and expanding advantaged peri-urban rural areas. By providing evidence of socio-demographic diversity of rural Denmark, the classification offers a transparent analytical tool for studying rural social differentiation and place-based inequality and offers insights relevant to rural policy and spatial planning.",

The sorting of individuals to tasks by labelling work as female or male is responsible for a host of negative outcomes for individuals (mostly women) and societies.

I argue that devaluation theories generally take the occupation (or task) as the unit of analysis, decoupling the valuation of doing something from the person that does it. However, if we incorporate the gender-specific social valuation of working in different occupations, we get a clearer picture of the changes that are needed to de-segregate the labour market.",

Although the positive relationship between maternal education and infant health is well-established, less is known about the joint and relative contributions of both parents’ education. Yet, the heterogamy penalty hypothesis suggests that couples with dissimilar educational status face greater stressors than their homogamous counterparts, potentially resulting in unequal gestational outcomes. We revisit this assumption using Austrian register data (N = 455,191 singleton births to 355,119 different-sex couples) and by applying Diagonal Reference Models to disentangle the independent association of educational dissimilarity with infant health, net of parents’ educational levels. Results show a large couple-level educational gradient: infants born to higher-educated homogamous parents face markedly lower risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal growth restriction. Additionally, we find that maternal and paternal education contribute relatively equally to infant health. However, we find no evidence that educational dissimilarity within couples, whether hypogamy or hypergamy, substantially contributes to inequalities in birth outcomes once absolute parental education is taken into account. Overall, our findings underscore the primacy of joint parental educational resources in determining early-life health outcomes.",

Mixed methods integration used system mapping software, follow the thread method, and the extended Pillar Integration Process.\nWe integrated data from 13 interviews, 3 student-staff workshops (n=63), and 334 survey participants to determine level of support for five high level themes; pillar integration uncovered three additional themes. Stress showed greater between-situation variability than for loneliness, with little evidence for situational variability in stigma. Analysis uncovered ten stress response profiles reflecting individual differences in situation-specific stressors, and three loneliness profiles reflecting higher and lower loneliness across all situations. Integration focussed on how response profiles were patterned by friendship group, gender, and school year.\nA relational and situated approach to mental health can provide new insights for health promotion in schools. We present a methodological toolkit to assist researchers, intervention developers and school staff to understand influences on mental health and identify points of change tailored to specific social and spatial settings.",

However, their market share remains limited, and little is known about how nonlinear combinations of consumer attitudes shape purchase intentions across different alternative meat types. This study investigates consumer segments and decision structures underlying purchase intentions for alternative meats in the United States and Japan. Using data from an online survey, we applied random forest models to identify key predictors of purchase intention, followed by decision tree analyses to uncover interpretable, nonlinear decision structures. Taste evaluation emerged as the primary predictor for plant-based meat; however, even among those with lower taste evaluations, purchase intention was elevated among individuals concerned with animal welfare and health. For cultured meat, perceptions of healthfulness and concern for animal welfare were important drivers, while in the United States, purity-based moral concerns acted as a barrier to purchase. Insect-based meat exhibited consistently low purchase intention in both countries, with favorable attitudes emerging only under specific conditions of perceptions and values. These findings underscore the importance of product-specific and culturally sensitive communication strategies, and demonstrate the value of accounting for nonlinear interactions among consumer attitudes when designing interventions to accelerate the diffusion of alternative meats.",

This study is an exploratory study during which 27 stakeholders of the bioregional agritourism system were interviewed through hybrid interviews.

These barriers and drivers, combined with the expectations of the interviewed stakeholders, led to the proposal of 3 strategies to develop this agritourism: clearly defining the agritourism system to make it an attractive and coherent tourist destination, establishing governance to structure this system and encourage the development of initiatives, and taking into account sustainability constraints to ensure the long-term continuation of this agritourism system.",

Moreover, existing research has yet to address how the moral language and frames invoked by fans influence their prosocial behavior. In this study, we propose the social identity theory of moral effects (SIME), which posits that moral foundations play a critical mediating role between social identity and prosocial action. By constructing a four-wave panel dataset of 1,957 Chinese fans, we examine the influence of a broader form of social identity (i.e., national identity) and moral language on fandom philanthropy during public crises to address the theoretical question. We find that ingroup favoritism and individualizing moral language stimulate fandom donations, whereas outgroup hostility and binding moral foundations weaken them. Furthermore, the causal mediation analysis reveals that language based on these moral foundations is a key mechanism, indirectly mediating the effects of social identity on fandom donations. We discuss the theoretical and practical contributions of these findings.",

          "authors": "Michael Ewens; Jacob W. Faber",
          "abstract": "Expanding retirement account access to alternative investments requires delivering illiquid returns to small-balance investors without compromising valuation integrity or liquidity. This paper studies the intermediation process using 110 registered interval and tender offer funds (&gt;$100B AUM, 2015-2024) that offer periodic rather than daily repurchases. The performance gap between these vehicles and institutional drawdown peers averages approximately 130 basis points per quarter. A factor decomposition attributes roughly one-third of the gap to fees and a larger share to imperfect replication of the private-market return stream; liquidity buffers (8-15% of NAV) contribute at the margin. The funds hold an average of 76% illiquid assets, but valuations are frequently stale, with 40% of trading days recording zero NAV changes. Approximately 40% of interval funds face excess repurchase demand in a given quarter. Despite aggregate underperformance, retail-held assets generate comparable IRRs to same-vintage institutional peers while distributing significantly more cash, consistent with managers selecting liquid, distribution-friendly assets to satisfy repurchase obligations. The current equilibrium is one where regulatory frameworks permit access, but the structural costs of liquidity provision limit the transmission of the private equity premium to retail portfolios.",

          "abstract": "The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) has been a cornerstone of U.S. sexual and reproductive health research for five decades, providing nationally representative data on fertility, contraception, and sexual behaviors. However, recent changes to NSFG data collection raise new challenges for data quality, generalizability, and interpretation. In the 2022–2023 cycle, the NSFG implemented a multimodal design with the majority of respondents completing the survey online and experienced a dramatic decline in response rates, falling to 26.8%—nearly forty percentage points lower than in 2017–2019. In response, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) advises against comparisons between the most recent data and earlier NSFG waves.\n\nUsing a synthetic cohort approach, we examine whether the 2022–2023 NSFG exhibits patterns suggestive of selection bias that extend beyond challenges to comparisons over time. We assess consistency across survey waves for demographic characteristics that should remain stable within cohorts and for lifetime measures that should only increase with age. While estimates from 2011–2019 display expected stability, the 2022–2023 data show implausible shifts, including increases in socioeconomic advantage and declines in lifetime contraceptive use, even after application of NCHS-provided survey weights. These patterns suggest that weighting adjustments may be insufficient to address nonresponse bias in the most recent NSFG.\n\nOur findings reinforce existing guidance against temporal comparisons and raise additional concerns about the interpretation of cross-sectional estimates from the 2022–2023 NSFG. We discuss implications for researchers and policymakers relying on NSFG data and offer guidance for cautious use of recent estimates. More broadly, we highlight the need for renewed investment and methodological innovation to sustain high-quality national surveillance of sexual and reproductive health in an era of declining survey participation.",

          "authors": "Omoregie Abiemwense Edokpayi",
          "abstract": "This article diagnoses the central paradox of civic education in Nigeria, aiming to foster peace and unity. Instead, it functions as a tool of epistemic alienation, severing indigenous knowledge systems. Using a postcolonial discourse analysis (PCDA) of the curriculum, triangulated with a qualitative interview of in-service civic education teachers, we evaluate how epistemicide-by-design constructs alienation and necropolitics, a form of sanctioned social death. The PCDA, together with evidence from teachers' testimonies, reveals a curriculum that severs students from their indigenous ontologies. Teachers’ testimonies report practices of resistance, integrating indigenous knowledge and ethics that are outside the mandated civic curriculum; a phenomenon we named pedagogical suturing, the subversive frontline resistance and act of repair that weaves indigenous knowledge systems into the curriculum, stitching colonial schooling. From this practice, we develop the Quantum Afrocentric Citizenship Spiral (QACS) as an operational theoretical framework and Sankofa hermeneutics, the wisdom of reaching back to inform the future. Together, they cultivate a restorative decolonial praxis to reconnect students to personhood, the Land, and ancestral memories in a co-constitutive spiral entanglement. Consequently, this article does more than diagnose; it advances the QACS as a new, actionable framework for decolonizing citizenship education and peacebuilding. This framework has its origin and validation from the very educational resistance it seeks to systematize and empower.\nKeywords: Decolonizing Education, Peace Education, Epistemicide, Pedagogical Suturing, Ubuntu, Nigeria, Necropolitics",

          "abstract": "Migrant descendants in several European countries show increasingly lower fertility rates, sometimes even lower than native-born peers—a pattern defying conventional expectations that migrant descendants either maintain origin-country patterns or converge toward host-country norms. Using Finnish register data (1985–1994 birth cohorts), we analyze first-birth timing across six ancestry groups spanning three migrant generations: 1.5 (migrated as children), second (born in Finland to immigrant parents), and 2.5 (children of mixed couples). Entry into parenthood occurs progressively later across these generations, with the 2.5 generation surpassing even native Finns in postponement. We tested four mechanisms—urban residence, educational investment, economic instability, and barriers to union formation—but none explained the delay. Our study contributes to the literature by, first, underscoring the limitations of the convergence narrative and, second, by drawing attention to the 2.5G as a distinct group whose reproductive behavior requires further conceptual and empirical attention.",

          "abstract": "Echo chambers are increasingly recognized as a critical challenge in online information environments where algorithmic filtering and user preferences limit exposure to diverse viewpoints. While existing studies have primarily relied on content- or network-based methods to detect echo chambers, few have focused on identifying echo chambers using machine learning methods and few have looked at the user risk features that predict participation in an echo-chamber. This study proposes a machine learning framework to predict echo chamber membership based on user features drawn from two representative platforms, Weibo and Twitter (X). We utilized a published dataset covering discussions on the Omicron variant and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, incorporating 20 user features, including 15 general behavioral features and 5 Big Five personality traits. Classification models were developed using three advanced algorithms: Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Feature contributions were interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and CatBoost was the more efficient (or effective or fast). Results revealed that strong emotional polarity, frequent social interaction, and high neuroticism were key user risk features associated with echo chamber participation across both platforms. The results matter because they move beyond traditional content or network-based explanations of echo chambers, shedding light on the individual level psychological and behavioral traits that make users more vulnerable to these environments. This user-centric perspective allows for a deeper understanding of who is at risk and why, which is critical for designing interventions that don’t just target what people see, but how and why they engage with information in the first place.",

A central question in CME is how and why characteristics of polities (such as chiefdoms, states, and empires) evolve over time. Multilevel selection, and especially its application to cultural evolution, provides a very useful theoretical framework for CME because many polity-level characteristics evolve under selection pressures that act in opposite directions at different levels of hierarchical organization. In this chapter I discuss the conceptual framework that multilevel selection provides for studying CME and summarize the main empirical results from my recent book (Turchin 2025). I conclude that major predictions of cultural multilevel selection theory enjoy substantial empirical support.",

          "authors": "Chad M. Topaz; Francis Huang; Maya Chugh Singh; Sarah Sousa; Régan Schwartz; Zofia C. Stanley",
          "abstract": "In virtually every California county, arrests of Black and Hispanic individuals proceed to court in lower proportions than those of white individuals—a pattern that might seem like good news but is not. The most plausible interpretation is that police disproportionately arrest Black and Hispanic individuals on weaker evidence, producing cases that prosecutors more frequently decline. The disparity at the charging stage is a downstream signature of over-policing, not a corrective to it. This Article makes three contributions to the emerging jurisprudence of statistical evidence under California's Racial Justice Act. First, using hierarchical statistical methods applied to statewide administrative data, we provide the first systematic county-level analysis of racial disparities at the arrest-to-court transition, documenting that while the direction of these disparities is nearly universal, their magnitude varies by almost two orders of magnitude across the state—a \"county lottery\" in which geography predicts outcomes far more strongly for Black and Hispanic individuals than for white individuals. Second, we find effectively zero variation in disparities across District Attorneys within the same county, suggesting that racial gaps are structural features of local criminal justice systems rather than attributes of individual officeholders—a finding that counsels caution about reforms focused solely on electing different prosecutors. Third, we offer a doctrinal reframing: we explain why evidence of lower prosecution rates for arrests of Black individuals constitutes evidence of racial harm under the RJA's totality-of-the-evidence standard, rather than evidence of leniency that would undercut a defendant's claim.",

          "authors": "Elida Izani Ibrahim; Laura K. Nelson; Andrea Voyer",
          "abstract": "Debates about generative AI have recently produced strong claims that such tools should be excluded from qualitative, and especially reflexive qualitative, research. This research note challenges that conclusion. We argue that “generative AI” is not a single, well-defined method but a heterogeneous set of transformer-based models, many of which are open, local, and configurable for scholarly use. Situating large language models within a longer lineage of computational text analysis—from topic models to word embeddings to transformer-based models—we suggest that decoder-only models offer distinctive affordances that can align productively with qualitative epistemologies, including attention to context and wholism. Drawing on emerging empirical work, we outline how generative models can support rigorous reflexive qualitative analysis, for example, by aiding in surfacing alternative readings, identifying negative cases, and helping researchers probe the boundaries of their interpretations, without replacing human judgment. We then articulate a framework of “technological reflexivity” for guiding the responsible use of generative AI in reflexive qualitative research, emphasizing documentation of prompts, holdout validation, critical attention to model bias, interpretive control, and ethical safeguards around data privacy and provenance. We conclude that generative AI should not be categorically rejected; rather, qualitative researchers should play a central role in defining how these tools are used in ways consistent with interpretive rigor and longstanding commitments of the field.",

This study explores the depth of working knowledge about rights in police encounters using two national-level surveys of American adults. Furthermore, it examines the cleavages in this knowledge. In one sample, respondents correctly identified an average of 5.90 of 8 statements, whereas in the other, 5.17 of 8 statements were correctly identified.

          "abstract": "This study examines whether the well-documented socioeconomic gradient in formal childcare use is reflected in the timing, sequencing, and stability of childcare and employment strategies following the critical life course transition to parenthood. While higher-SES parents are consistently more likely to use formal childcare, the reasons for this disparity remain poorly understood principally due to data limitations and the complexity of household dynamics. Drawing on linked Dutch administrative data (2010–2019), we use multichannel sequence analysis to identify distinct “childcare strategies” across the first four years of children’s lives, capturing monthly trajectories of formal childcare use and parental employment. A subsequent multinomial regression models the association between these strategies and socioeconomic status. The results reveal wide variation in the stability, intensity, and timing of formal childcare use, closely intertwined with maternal employment patterns. Children from lower-SES households are more likely to experience complex, fragmented, and fragile childcare trajectories—characterized by delayed entry, irregular usage, and lower alignment with stable employment—confirming and extending findings from prior qualitative research. By quantifying these patterns across a full population cohort, the study demonstrates how childcare complexity itself reflects and reinforces broader social inequalities. We conclude that childcare policies must move beyond affordability to address accessibility, stability, and administrative complexity—particularly for parents with low incomes, precarious jobs, or self-employment.",

Can they also best be characterized as discrete, hierarchical, self-similar social networks? There is growing empirical evidence that human social organization may be described in terms of these complex social networks. This emergent form of social organization has been documented in a wide array of human societies ranging from small-scale foraging groups to the earliest large-scale agricultural states. This paper contributes to this growing literature by using Horton--Strahler scaling and spectral analysis to demonstrate the complex structure of large-scale societies using the Coalescent Communities Database 2.0 and Seshat: Global History Databank. The analysis finds a discrete hierarchy of social network sizes characterized by a scaling ratio of between 3 and 4. These properties of complex large-scale societies are remarkably consistent with previous empirical studies of small-scale societies. I suggest that these patterns result from the process of building increasingly larger-scale polities.",

          "abstract": "Paid parenting leave (PPL) policies have become a central pillar of contemporary welfare states, supporting gender equality, labour market participation, child well-being, and long-term social sustainability. As these policies have expanded in scope, duration and objectives, however, the terminology used to describe them has evolved unevenly across countries, international organisations, databases and academic research.\n\nThis Policy Brief argues that terminology is not merely a semantic or technical issue, but a core element of governance and knowledge production. The concepts used to name, classify and aggregate parenting leave entitlements shape how policies are designed, monitored, evaluated and compared. Inconsistent terminology weakens cross-national comparability, obscures policy effects and undermines evidence-based policymaking.\n\nDrawing on a comprehensive review of international regulations, comparative databases, national terminologies and academic research, the brief demonstrates that traditional distinctions between maternity, paternity and parental leave no longer adequately capture the diversity and complexity of contemporary leave systems. While diversity in national terminology is both inevitable and normatively meaningful, the absence of a harmonised comparative framework has become a major obstacle to effective monitoring, policy learning and research synthesis.\n\nThe brief concludes that harmonisation of terminology at national level is neither feasible nor desirable, but that harmonised terminology for comparative and monitoring purposes is essential. It proposes the systematic use of an umbrella concept of parenting leave, disaggregated by entitlement type, while always retaining national legal terms and contextual specificity.",

          "abstract": "Much contemporary punishment policy in the United States operates through indirect and often opaque mechanisms that link public authority to private actors. This article argues that these arrangements constitute a distinct mode of governance that can be understood as a submerged prison state. Drawing on the literature on the “submerged state,” the article shows how tax expenditures, subsidies, civil liability rules, and regulatory frameworks quietly structure the administration and expansion of punishment while obscuring lines of responsibility and accountability.\n\nThrough analysis of legislation, judicial decisions, and policy design, the article demonstrates how submerged penal policies redistribute the costs and benefits of punishment, entrench private interests, and expand carceral capacity without the visibility typically associated with criminal justice policymaking. Because these instruments operate outside the most salient sites of democratic contestation, they weaken public understanding of how punishment is funded and governed, limiting citizens’ ability to evaluate, contest, or reform the carceral system.\n\nThe article situates the submerged prison state within broader debates about privatization, administrative governance, and democratic legitimacy, arguing that indirect governance poses distinctive risks for public accountability in criminal justice. By shifting attention away from prisons and sentencing statutes alone and toward the hidden policy tools that sustain punishment, the article offers a new framework for understanding the persistence of mass incarceration and the political obstacles facing meaningful penal reform.",

          "abstract": "The capacity of inflation targeting (IT) policy to consolidate gains from financial liberalization in developing countries has been questioned, particularly after real interest rates have been driven to a negative territory following COVID-19’s inflationary pressures. In this study, we examine the role of Bank of Ghana’s IT policy in moderating the real interest rate-saving nexus analysed through the lens of the McKinnon-Shaw Hypothesis (MSH), which posits that maintaining real interest rates in a reasonable positive range would stimulate saving and investment rates in developing countries. We apply linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to time series data spanning 1986-2023, augmented by non-linear ARDL analysis. Results show that IT policy strengthens the positive impact of real deposit interest rate on financial saving in the long run. The study, however, finds no stable long-run relationship between real interest rate and financial saving as there prevails only a short run nexus, suggesting that the MSH might be delayed than implied by theory. Further analysis reveals that the saving-real interest rate relationship is characterised by asymmetry in the short run, with saving responding more strongly to negative than positive levels of real deposit interest rate. The study’s findings highlight the importance of maintaining strong commitment to low and stable inflation for successful financial liberalization. The findings again suggest that the central bank of Ghana should be mindful of the asymmetric effects of real interest rates when adjusting the policy rate in response to shocks.",

This study proposes a characteristics-based conceptualisation of premature mortality incorporating intensity of household disruptions caused by death. Using NFHS-5 and PLFS 2019–20, we imputed multiple dimensions of mortality-induced household disruption, including premature assumption of roles, parental loss, early widowhood, and loss of sole earner. Logistic regression and probabilistic composite disruption scores depicted socioeconomic gradients in timing and magnitude. Disruptions peak earlier and more severely among poorer households, particularly for males, while females exhibit later and less pronounced differentials. Age-equivalence analyses showed that disruptions due to mortality at 20 years among the richest are similar to those at 14 among poorest. This redefinition accommodated real-world vulnerabilities, moving beyond fixed cut-off.

It has been found that the strong credibility of the domestic environment in Bhutan gives it the normative and moral power in the international climate governance despite its minor material power. This article can be added to the discussion of climate governance by predetermining the role of land-locked developing countries in influencing the global climate action.\nKeywords: Climate governance, Bhutan, small states, land-locked state, sustainability, climate policy.",

          "abstract": "This research investigates the impact of non-human factors in social commerce, including functionalities of live-streaming, customer response speed, promotional tools, follower count and reviews on consumers’ online shopping behavior. Based on the Signaling Theory and Cue Utilization Theory, the article discusses how external cues become signals for credibility and popularity compensating for the absence of human interaction. An online questionnaire was posted on different active social commerce forums in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and data collection was conducted with 157 respondents, which were subsequently analyzed with SmartPLS. The results show that promotional tools and follower have significant effects on purchase behavior and live streaming has an indirect effect on purchase behavior through the number of follower count. On the flip side, response time as well as online reviews had no significant effect. Social proof and promotional stimuli outweigh cognitive or functional cues, according to the findings. This research contributes to literature on digital persuasion, providing implications for managers for reinforcing consumer trust via real digital signals and promotion variants based on algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Se analiza la productividad legislativa del Congreso local de Hidalgo durante el periodo 2024–2025 con el objetivo de identificar patrones de participación parlamentaria, niveles de desigualdad en la actividad normativa y la estructura efectiva del poder legislativo. A partir de la construcción de una base de datos original que sistematiza 691 intervenciones realizadas por 30 diputados, el estudio emplea un enfoque cuantitativo basado en estadística descriptiva e indicadores de concentración para evaluar la distribución de la agenda. La estrategia metodológica incluyó la estandarización de registros individuales, y la estimación del coeficiente de Gini para medir la centralización de la actividad. Los resultados evidencian una centralización moderada del trabajo parlamentario, una fuerte mediación partidaria en la configuración de la agenda y brechas acotadas en la participación por género. En conjunto, el análisis muestra que la productividad legislativa constituye un indicador clave para comprender la organización\ninterna del Congreso y la calidad de la representación política.",

          "abstract": "Dampak nyata dari abrasi yang terjadi pada makan keluarga Sultan Hasanuddin, Pahlawan Nasional Raja Gowa ke-16 di di kompleks Makam Kassibumbung atau sekarang dikenal dengan nama Kompleks Makam I Sabbelo’mo Daeng Takontu, di Desa Punaga, Kecamatan Laikang. Dilansir dari CNN, dalam kompleks pemakaman tersebut terdapat makam ibu Sultan Hasanuddin, Sa'be Lo'mo Takuntu, istri Sultan Hasanuddin, Ipate Daeng Nisali, saudara laki-laki ibu Sultan Hasanuddin, Garese Daeng Menyambean, saudara perempuan dari ibu Sultan Hasanuddin, Yanisi Daeng Tarimang dan kakek kandung laki- Laki Sultan Hasanuddin, sekaligus Karaeng ke 4 Punaga, I Bobang Daeng Limpo. Pada tahun 2022, lokasi kompleks makam keluarga Sultan Hasanuddin hanya berjarak sekitar 10 meter dari bibir Pantai. Hal tersebut diprediksi akan hilang seiring berjalannya waktu. Kehilangan salah satu area sejarah tersebut akan menghilangkan juga identitas dan menjadi bukti bahwa dampak krisis iklim telah menyebabkan abrasi yang parah di wilayah pesisir.",

          "authors": "Kevin Ramos",
          "abstract": "This study addresses the growing need for interdisciplinary research to solve complex problems in academic contexts. The goal was to analyze term and discipline co-occurrences in 10,000 articles using co-occurrence matrices that categorize different knowledge areas and popular terms. The methodology included constructing these matrices, summing rows to estimate the influence of each discipline, and applying a community detection algorithm to identify clusters of related terms. The results revealed that disciplines such as Biochemistry, Management, and Agriculture exhibit high co-occurrence, indicating their relevance in interdisciplinary dialogue. The detected communities showed two main emphases: one focused on social and managerial aspects, and another centered on data analysis and scientific methodologies. It was observed that less-represented disciplines, such as Health and Biology, have significant opportunities to integrate their approaches with more active areas. The study suggests that fostering collaborations across disciplines can enrich research and facilitate innovative solutions. Such integration is essential to address contemporary challenges and advance knowledge effectively.",

          "authors": "Omoregie Abiemwense Edokpayi",
          "abstract": "This article examines how the Negritude movement can be reconceptualized as a vital force of Afrocentric recovery and resistance to 21st-century neocolonial and racial capitalism erected as architectures of necropolitics. Through a decolonial theoretical methodology, it analyzes how Negritude’s original project provides critical decolonial tools for diagnosing the “subtle, supple, and smart” (Han, 2017) technologies of neoliberalism and the extractive logic that continues to define Black geographies. The article affirms the position that the most potent site for materializing a resurgent Black power is education that undergoes a radical ontological shift, moving beyond the neoliberal model of schooling. The article, therefore, proposes an Afrocentric, ontologically grounded education rooted in Indigenous knowledge systems and the practice of counter-storytelling. This pedagogical praxis, coupled with a decolonized practice of restorative justice reconceived as relational restoration, forms the basis for reclaiming power to heal the psychic wounds of colonization. In the process, the desirous imagination necessary for Black self-determination and futurity is fostered. Therefore, the article repositions Negritude as a living praxis for liberation in an age of ongoing coloniality, rather than as a historical artifact.\nKeywords: Negritude, decolonial education, Afrocentric pedagogy, racial capitalism, restorative justice, Black power, ontological shift, Indigenous knowledge",
