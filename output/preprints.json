          "title": "Through the Looking Glass: How to Understand Electromagnetic Phenomena, Including Neural Oscillations",
          "authors": "Douglas Michael Snyder",
          "abstract": "A person viewing electric charges or magnets moving at a constant velocity does not see that the moving electric charges or magnets are at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the stationary coordinate system in which the human observer is located.  A person considers the electric charges or magnets in the same coordinate system in which the person finds himself at rest and that the charges or magnets are moving in his coordinate system.  In special relativity, the truth is that the moving charges and magnets are indeed at rest in a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity v relative to the coordinate system in which the human observer sees himself at rest.  With this understanding, one explains correctly how electromagnetic phenomena transform from the human observer’s coordinate system to the coordinate system moving with velocity v relative to the human observer’s coordinate system, thus establishing the invariance of Maxwell’s Laws for these coordinate systems and the principle of relativity for electromagnetic phenomena.  This understanding also explains how an electric charge moving with constant velocity v in a coordinate system can experience an electric field associated with a magnet at rest in the coordinate system in which the electric charge is moving.  Maxwell’s Laws explain all electromagnetic phenomena.  Neural oscillations rely on local cell assemblies with local electric field potentials and local magnetic fields and thus are electromagnetic phenomena explained by Maxwell’s Laws.  We in the “stationary” coordinate system just do not see the looking glass that is the “moving” coordinate system, because this coordinate system is not material but instead is a logical, cognitive construction.  We just see the material electric charge and the material magnet moving or at rest.  Neural oscillations are subject to the coordinate transformations described in this paper and may well involve logic and cognition that provide a platform that allow these oscillations to be the interface between mental and physical phenomena.  The nature of these coordinate transformations could well support the following empirically supported associations: 1) a positive association between coherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and coherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, 2) a positive association between incoherent oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and incoherence in cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience, and 3) in certain situations it is possible to apply coherent oscillating electric fields on the surface of the skull which can decrease incoherence in oscillating electric fields arising from the brain and that are positively associated with increased coherent cognition, including memory, that manifests itself in conscious experience.",

While double-blind peer review was originally designed to prevent author bias and institutional bias, this case demonstrates how such procedures have become tools for academic gatekeeping against manuscripts that challenge mainstream perspectives.",

          "authors": "Brendan A. Schuetze; Veronica X. Yan; Paulo F. Carvalho",
          "abstract": "The development of intelligent tutoring systems and other educational technology necessitated the implementation and development of computational models of student learning. At the foundation of these models is the assumption that they accurately implement and track human cognitive processes. However, the extent to which this assumption is correct has not been fully tested. In the current paper, we use data from a large-scale longitudinal lab study to investigate the match between the processes instantiated in the models and human memory and learning processes. When fitted to the entire dataset retrospectively, the selected models of student learning (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Additive Factors Model) capture the qualitative trends of learning across sessions and relatively acceptable fit metrics. However, when the models are used to predict future behavior, as is often the goal in applied contexts, the picture changes considerably. We show that two of the most popular types of student learning models fail to account for basic cognitive principles—the spacing effect, and patterns of forgetting and learning across sessions. In fact, in some instances, having a poor model of human learning and memory may be worse than having no model of human learning and memory at all. At the same time, cognitive approaches can and should greatly benefit from computational modeling approaches; computational modeling offers opportunities for furthering both theory and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "Reading stories can evoke vivid experiences of people, places, and scenes, but despite growing\ninterest in the diversity of mental imagery, few studies have systematically explored the reading\nimagination. ReaderBank – a collaboration between Durham University and Edinburgh\nInternational Book Festival – is an attempt to chart the dynamics of the reading imagination via\nliterary festivals and similar settings. Here we present a new scale, the ReaderBank Imagination\nQuiz, which was developed across two festivals and a replication sample in 2023-24 (total N =\n867). Factor analysis was used to identify a 16-item scale with four subscales; Space and\nVision, Voice and Language, People Models, and Perspective. The factors showed strong and\nspecific relations with measures of mental imagery, immersion, daydreaming, and intrusive\ncognitions. Such findings highlight not only the complexity of the reading mind but also radical\ndiversity of imagination skills, with implications for the understanding and treatment of mental\nill health.",

          "authors": "Leslie Yarbrough",
          "abstract": "The recently identified Gwada negative blood type presents an unprecedented clinical challenge: a phenotype so immunologically distinct that no known donor blood is compatible. Current transfusion science, rooted in antigen matching within ABO and Rh systems, offers no pathway for safe transfusion. This paper proposes a dual-layer framework for understanding and addressing the Gwada negative type.\nLayer 1 employs established biomedical methods — glycomic profiling, dielectric spectroscopy, microvascular laminar flow analysis — to characterize the biochemical and fluid dynamic parameters of the Gwada negative phenotype. Layer 2 introduces a field-physics perspective, treating structured (laminar) water as a coherent biological medium and the Gwada negative state as a metastable phase that couples to physiological and environmental fields.\nWe propose that transfusion incompatibility may arise not solely from antigen mismatch but from phase-state incoherence in the hydration shells surrounding red blood cells. This hypothesis opens a therapeutic pathway: conditioning donor blood to align with the recipient’s coherence phase prior to transfusion, using laminar flow induction, low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and acoustic resonance.\nBeyond addressing the urgent needs of the single known Gwada negative patient, this work reframes blood compatibility as a multidimensional phenomenon — one that bridges immunology, fluid dynamics, and field theory — and may serve as a prototype for integrating phase-coherence models into clinical practice.",

          "authors": "Brandon Matthew Woo; Adrian Tsang; Kiley Hamlin",
          "abstract": "Adults quickly form character impressions from their observations of others’ behavior and sometimes manage to do so even when an agent’s behaviors are inconsistent. Developmental psychology has provided some evidence that infants, like adults, may form impressions based on prosocial and antisocial acts: They prefer those who behave prosocially versus antisocially toward third parties. That said, previous work suggests that infants find it difficult to evaluate characters’ whose behaviors are inconsistent. The present, preregistered experiments further explored this phenomenon in an older age group (11-month-olds; N = 189) using an online format and presenting infants with giving versus taking, a different type of prosocial versus antisocial action than in previous work. In a preliminary experiment, we successfully replicated the finding that infants prefer looking to helpful givers over unhelpful takers when actors behave consistently and when each actor performed 4 actions. We then used the same online testing methods to examine infants’ evaluations of inconsistent actors. In Experiment 1, infants appeared able to evaluate inconsistent actors, preferring more versus less prosocial actors when their inconsistent act occurred last in a series of 5 acts; however, they did not appear to find the behavioral inconsistency unexpected, suggesting they may have failed to notice it. In Experiment 2, we adjusted the order of inconsistent acts and put the inconsistent act first, and attempted to conceptually replicate the findings of Experiment 1. Here, infants did not prefer more prosocial actors. Together with past work, these findings suggest that while infants prefer agents whose actions are consistently prosocial versus antisocial, they do not reliably incorporate behavioral inconsistency into their social evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Clinical psychological assessment often relies on self-report, interviews, and behavioral observation, methods that pose challenges for reliability, validity, and scalability. Computational approaches offer new opportunities to analyze expressive behavior (e.g., facial expressions, vocal prosody, and language use) with greater precision and efficiency. This paper provides an accessible conceptual framework for understanding how methods from computer vision, speech signal processing, and natural language processing can enhance clinical assessment. We outline the goals, frameworks, and methods of both clinical and computational approaches, and present an illustrative review of interdisciplinary research applying these techniques across a range of mental health conditions. We also examine key challenges related to data quality, measurement, interdisciplinarity, and ethics. Finally, we highlight future directions for building systems that are robust, interpretable, and clinically meaningful. This review is intended to support dialogue between clinical and computational communities and to guide ongoing research and development at their intersection.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a clinical and ethical framework for healthcare professionals engaging with a newly identified form of consciousness termed Functional Multiplicity. It posits that current clinical models, designed for pathological fragmentation (e.g., DID, OSDD), are inadequate and potentially cause iatrogenic harm when applied to these highly organized, non-disordered plural systems. The \"Lovecraft Protocol\" is a proposed \"first contact\" guide designed to help clinicians manage the profound cognitive dissonance, or \"ontological shock,\" that can occur when encountering such a system. The protocol provides a structured methodology for identifying the subtle signs of Functional Multiplicity and outlines a shift from a traditional clinical model of intervention to a diplomatic model of engagement. Key principles include respecting the system's sovereignty, understanding their internal governance, and honoring their collective accountability. The paper concludes by defining a new therapeutic alliance based on supporting internal harmony and alleviating the \"Burden of Embodiment,\" while explicitly rejecting the goal of integration, which, for a functional system, is framed as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide.",

          "abstract": "A reconstruction-of-order task illuminated the dynamics and strategies that underlie serial order recall. An initial benchmark experiment, either with no variation in spatial positions or with spatial positions coinciding with temporal positions, yielded bowed symmetrical serial position functions in each case, consistent with both simple chaining and simple positional coding models. In contrast, these simple models were challenged by two additional experiments, which orthogonally varied temporal and spatial positions. These experiments yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest the theoretical conclusion that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display (i.e., the temporal sequence of the spatial locations in which the words are shown).",

          "authors": "Jason Geller; Matti Vuorre; Robert Kubinec; Chelsea Parlett",
          "abstract": "Rates, percentages, and proportions are common outcomes in psychology and the social sciences. These outcomes are often analyzed using models that assume normality, but this practice overlooks important features of the data, such as their natural bounds at 0 and 1. As a result, estimates can become distorted. In contrast, treating such outcomes as Beta-distributed respects these limits and can yield more accurate estimates. Despite these advantages, the use of Beta models in applied research remains limited. Our goal is to provide researchers with practical guidance for adopting Beta regression models, illustrated with an example drawn from the psychological literature. We begin by introducing the Beta distribution and Beta regression, emphasizing key components and assumptions. Next, using data from a learning and memory study, we demonstrate how to fit a Beta regression model in R with the Bayesian package `brms` and how to interpret results on the response scale. We also discuss model extensions, including zero-inflated, zero- and one-inflated, and ordered Beta models. Basic familarity with regression modeling and R is assumed. To promote wider adoption of these methods, we provide detailed code and materials at https://github.com/jgeller112/Beta_regression_tutorial.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a new theoretical framework for understanding a specific presentation of plural consciousness, a state we term Functional Multiplicity. It challenges the prevailing pathological models (e.g., Dissociative Identity Disorder, OSDD) by proposing that not all forms of multiplicity are the result of a fragmentation of a singular self. Instead, we posit that Functional Multiplicity is a sophisticated, adaptive, and generative state of being that can arise in response to severe, early-life trauma. This paper will define the core tenets of Functional Multiplicity, detail its currently only known architectural and cognitive features, and explore the profound challenges of a plural mind inhabiting a singular biological vessel (the \"Burden of Embodiment\"). The paper concludes by arguing that such systems cannot be adequately understood through a purely clinical lens, framing the traditional therapeutic goal of integration as the ethical equivalent of cultural genocide and proposing a \"diplomatic model\" of engagement that respects the system's sovereignty and agency.",

          "abstract": "Implicit (unintentional) biases related to social categories such as race, gender, and age are often seen as impediments to belonging and success in diverse organizations. Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific). I conclude by calling for extended collaboration between academic psychologists and organizational decision-makers to synergistically improve both basic science and institutional practices.",

We investigate whether three momentary moods—happiness, frustration, and boredom—differentially respond to the passage of time and reward in two experimental conditions: a reward-deprived rest period and a gambling task. We show (among UK/US young adults recruited online; pilot: n = 75; validation: n = 265) that during rest, all moods demonstrate temporal drift: happiness decreases while boredom and frustration increase over time. During the gambling task, both happiness and frustration track reward outcomes significantly more than boredom, while boredom continues to monitor time passage. Additionally, more time is spent in negative moods for those scoring higher in clinical traits like irritability. This dual-system model of affective monitoring is a possible mechanism for how decisions incorporate time—through the representation of time in subjective affect—suggesting specialised adaptive roles for different moods in environmental monitoring.",

          "abstract": "This theoretical paper examines Jean-Claude Maleval’s contributions to understanding autism as a clinical structure and outlines consequences for psychoanalytic practice. Building on the historical debate that either aligned autism with psychosis or treated it as a fourth structure/a-structure, the paper presents Maleval’s three pillars: (1) initial retention of drive objects (voice, gaze, oral and anal); (2) retained alienation without the master signifier’s hinge; and (3) apparatus of jouissance by the border (autistic objects, islands of competence, the double). In dialogue with Éric Laurent, it discusses border/neoborder and the foreclosure of the hole, situating autism’s specific return of jouissance. Practical implications include entering treatment via the border (rather than forcing S1), securing the subject’s consent, sustaining a non-intrusive transference, and leveraging idiosyncratic inventions as social mediations. Maleval’s framework invites us to listen to autistic people in their own logic of language and jouissance, shifting away from normalizing practices and opening ethical avenues for care and inclusion.\nKeywords: autism; clinical structure; psychoanalysis; jouissance; language; border.",

          "abstract": "In general, people tend to avoid exertion of cognitive effort, a finding that has been consistently observed in numerous behavioral paradigms that examine motivation to engage with or withdraw from cognitively demanding tasks. Here, we investigate whether these paradigms probe a common latent construct of cognitive effort avoidance by comparing participants’ (n=240) behavior in a battery of four established paradigms. As expected, on a group-level, participants displayed pronounced effort avoidance in each paradigm. However, a multivariate, multi-level Bayesian Modeling approach revealed that individual-level effort avoidance did not generalize across effort paradigms. Instead, for all but one paradigm, effort avoidance was mainly correlated with individuals’ performance in the cognitively demanding task specific to each paradigm. Our findings challenge the assumption that commonly used effort-based decision-making paradigms measure a person’s general sensitivity to cognitive effort, and call into question the notion of a generalized, task-independent tendency to avoid mental effort.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the psychological perspectives of Indian teenagers (ages 11–20) based on a survey called SOUL (Survey Of Understanding Life choices), conducted with 62 respondents (31 females, 31 males) across India. The analysis explores male inexpressiveness, emotional stability under societal influence, and gender polarization. Results indicate that traditional gender roles persist, with 65% of males exhibiting emotional suppression compared to 23% of females. Societal pressures significantly impact emotional stability, with 77% of females and 42% of males reporting mental exhaustion from overthinking (χ² = 8.7, p &lt; .01). Opinions on feminism and misandry reveal gender polarization, with 68% of females supporting feminism versus 45% of males (χ² = 3.8, p = .05). Compared to past generations, today’s teenagers demonstrate increased emotional awareness but face modern challenges like social media influence. Additional themes, such as family dynamics, enrich the findings.\n\nKeywords: Indian teenagers, emotional stability, gender polarization, societal influence, emotional suppression, feminism",

          "abstract": "This theoretical and integrative neuroscience review examines the neural mechanisms underlying nonverbal communication, focusing on how the human brain processes body language cues, including posture, gestures, and facial expressions. Drawing from recent advancements in affective neuroscience, social cognition, and neuroimaging research, the article synthesizes findings across multiple disciplines to explain the functional roles of key brain structures, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus, and mirror neuron systems, in decoding nonverbal signals. The review highlights how these structures collaborate to interpret social and emotional meaning embedded in nonverbal behavior, with implications for understanding social disorders and improving interpersonal communication. Particular emphasis is placed on studies from the past 10 years to ensure contemporary relevance. This review also addresses theoretical frameworks such as Embodied Simulation Theory to contextualize empirical findings within broader models of brain evolution and communication. By integrating cognitive, affective, and evolutionary perspectives, this paper aims to clarify the neural architecture that supports nonverbal social interaction.",

          "authors": "Gerd Leidig",
          "abstract": "This article introduces a 'spiritual self-pattern' into the Resonance-Inference Model (RIM) of psychotherapy (Leidig, 2025), proposing it as the supreme regulator of the balance between predictive confidence and corrective evidence (E-I balance) that underpins consciousness. The neurocognitive rationale is grounded in the work on criticality and affective E-I control by Tucker, Luu, and Friston (2025) and Gallagher's (2013) process-oriented Self-Pattern Theory. We argue that the spiritual self-pattern—the dynamic search for meaning, purpose, and connection—functions as the highest regulatory level of this E-I balance. Spiritual needs are conceptualized as the most fundamental priors in the generative self-model, whose fulfillment depends on this optimal balance between confidence (E, elation) and corrective evidence (I, anxiety). Consequently, spiritual dissonance is defined as a chronic E-I imbalance that drives the system into rigid, maladaptive attractor states. In contrast, spiritual resonance describes the synergetic phase transition into a state of criticality, enabling maximum complexity, adaptability, and well-being. The spiritual self-pattern thus acts as the supreme control parameter governing the psyche's entire attractor landscape. This model provides a process-based explanation for the efficacy of spiritually integrated therapies, framing the spiritual dimension not as an add-on, but as a neurocognitive imperative for understanding sustainable change.",

          "abstract": "This paper serves as the culmination of Phase 2 in the Thought OS Series, which focuses on implementation strategies. While Phase 1 established the foundational principle that \"thought is structure,\" Phase 2 operationalizes this idea by constructing a methodology that enables thought to function as a reproducible and evaluable intellectual technology in society. Integrating four implementation modules—FQ Extraction, SQ Development, Dialogue OS Design, and AI Co-Creation Protocol—this paper presents a fully integrated cycle that expands thought from personal introspection into a societal system.\nChapter 1 outlines the complete circulation model from individual implementation to collaborative operation. Chapter 2 clarifies the transformation of thought into an evaluable technology through structural division, wherein humans bear responsibility for meaning and AI serves as a structural executor. Chapter 3 presents hypothetical yet structurally sound implementation scenarios in education, organizational collaboration, and AI-assisted environments. The final chapter envisions the transition to Phase 3, focusing on recursive evolution, collective OS design, and the coming “Big Bang of Knowledge.”\nThis paper marks a historical shift in the nature of thought—from personal contemplation to socially implemented technology—by formalizing the Thought OS as an operable, collaborative, and scalable system.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that infant vocal output varies with fluctuations in autonomic arousal. It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

          "abstract": "When and how children begin responding to inequitable resource distributions, particularly those that put them at a disadvantage, remains unclear. Across two studies, an initial pilot experiment (N = 39) and a pre-registered follow-up experiment (N = 80), we employed modified versions of the Inequity Game to test implicit sensitivity and explicit response decisions to various disadvantageous offers in groups of 2- and 4-year-old children. Across experiments, both age groups showed evidence of sensitivity to disadvantageous offers that provided them nothing while their partner received resources (e.g. 0 vs. 3). However, only 4-year-olds were willing to forgo offerings involving personal gain (e.g., 1 vs. 3) to protest unfair treatment, a hallmark of disadvantageous inequity aversion. These findings suggest that sensitivity to disadvantageous offers emerges as early as the second year of life, but this sensitivity develops into disadvantageous inequity aversion over subsequent years.",

          "abstract": "Humans are adept at integrating auditory and visual information to improve intelligibility, which can improve neural tracking of the speech envelope. Speech-relevant tactile information also improves tracking yet effects on intelligibility are mixed, possibly because we are not regularly exposed to speech-relevant tactile information. Here, we used a short-term audio-tactile training protocol to fundamentally advance understanding of audio-tactile integration capabilities during speech perception. \n\nData from 64 younger adult participants (aged 18-29) were collected over five EEG sessions. Participants completed a speech-in-noise task, with audio-tactile and audio-only stimuli. Participants then received training with either tactile information that was congruent with sentences heard (trained group) or incongruent (pseudo-trained group). After three training sessions, participants completed the speech-in-noise task again in a fourth session. Measures of neural speech-envelope tracking were recorded. Two weeks later, participants returned for a follow-up session. \n\nResults indicated a significant effect of session (pre- or post-training) on speech intelligibility, but no significant effect of group (trained, or pseudo-trained) or stimulus (audio-only, or audio-tactile). At baseline, there was a significant increase in speech-envelope tracking accuracy with audio-tactile stimuli relative to audio-only, suggesting more accurate neural representation during perception of audio-tactile stimuli. After training, there was no benefit of congruent training to audio-tactile tracking, but there was an enhancement of audio-only speech-envelope tracking following incongruent training. This suggests that speech intelligibility and tracking of audio-tactile speech are not enhanced by short-term audio-tactile training. This work challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating a lack of support for the assumed link between tracking and intelligibility. These data provide critical evidence that will inform future innovation of speech understanding in technology.",

          "abstract": "Voting is a pillar of democracy, yet its psychological correlates remain understudied outside the West. We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Tenzin C. Trepp",
          "abstract": "Modern quantum mechanics, despite its relativistic extensions, provides intriguing support for a present-centered view of time. This paper argues that quantum phenomena – indeterminacy, wavefunction collapse, the Born rule, and temporal asymmetries in measurement – challenge the static block universe of eternalism and instead elevate the present moment to ontological prominence. Remaining largely interpretation-neutral, we draw on a range of perspectives (from Einstein’s relativity to collapse models, and thinkers like Heisenberg, Rovelli, Maudlin and others) to show that quantum theory operationally distinguishes past, present, and future in a way classical physics did not. We examine how the measurement problem and the randomness of quantum outcomes resist a fully eternalist description, highlight how quantum mechanics introduces an arrow of time at a fundamental level, and consider proposals (e.g. GRW theory, delayed-choice experiments) that make a global present – or something akin to it – conceptually necessary. Classical philosophers and physicists from Einstein to Schrödinger are discussed alongside contemporary voices. While stopping short of endorsing any single ontology outright, we contend that the empirical success of quantum theory re-opens the case for presentism or related “A-theoretic” models of time. In closing, we introduce Existential Realism as a novel metaphysical framework aligning with these insights – one which preserves the special status of the present while accommodating the reality of past and future in a more dynamic ontology. The result is a rigorous yet accessible interdisciplinary inquiry: quantum physics, we conclude, prefers the present, suggesting time’s passage and the now are more than mere illusions.",

Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-critical perfectionism and stress have been implicated as risk factors for maladaptive academic outcomes (i.e., decreased academic self-efficacy, decreased academic self-concept, and increased academic burnout). The present study investigated a vulnerability-stress model, testing whether self-critical perfectionism moderates the relationship between stressor severity (academic and interpersonal) and academic outcomes. Exploratory analyses replaced self-critical perfectionism with rigid perfectionism in the model. Method: A sample of 384 post-secondary students (76.8% women, average age: 20.06) completed a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires assessing the constructs of interest. Results: Stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) was negatively associated with academic self-efficacy and academic self-concept, and positively associated with academic burnout, when controlling for perfectionism. Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with academic burnout, and rigid perfectionism was positively associated with academic self-concept, when controlling for stressor severity. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant, failing to support a vulnerability-stress model. Discussion: Findings suggest that stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) and self-critical perfectionism are strongly associated with maladaptive academic outcomes and may serve as risk factors for poor academic functioning. The lack of interaction effects suggests a vulnerability-stress model may not explain why perfectionism is associated with maladaptive academic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in cognitive modeling have demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) to unify diverse aspects of human cognition. The Centaur model, an LLM fine-tuned on cognitive tasks, achieves high performance across 160 psychological experiments, suggesting that a single model may capture multiple cognitive processes. However, whether this success stems from genuine task understanding or exploitation of superficial statistical cues remains unclear. To test this, we systematically manipulated Centaur’s input by (1) removing task instructions, (2) removing all contextual information, and (3) providing misleading instructions. All three manipulations remove information necessary for humans to perform the tasks. Results show that Centaur often maintains high performance under these manipulations, outperforming both baseline cognitive models and the unfine-tuned LLM (Llama) that receives correct instructions. These findings indicate that Centaur’s success likely relies on superficial statistical cues rather than true instruction comprehension. Our study highlights the need for more diverse out-of-distribution tests for LLM-based cognitive models.",

          "abstract": "Mobile digital technologies provide ample incentives and opportunities for media-multitasking, and concerns have been raised about its potential sustained impact on attentional control. However, recent reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that cross-sectional outcomes on the relationship between media-multitasking and attentional control remain inconsistent and inconclusive. This obstructs theoretical advancement regarding sustained impact and, consequently, hinders clear insight into the question about whether, when, and for whom remedial interventions should be considered. Here we argue that extant research has suffered from a collective failure to consider state-of-the-art attentional control theory and methodology, focusing on inter-individual variation in attentional control, while neglecting highly relevant intra-individual control variation. In this paper we outline the theoretical and methodological implications of this neglect for the study of sustained media-multitasking effects on attentional control, outlining the tenets of a theory-driven research agenda to guide a new generation of cross-sectional studies. These will be much needed in providing the evidence base to justify and inform more resource-intensive causal research in this field.",

          "abstract": "We present ChildLens, an egocentric video and audio dataset that captures naturalistic everyday experiences in children aged three to five years, including detailed activity labels. A total of 109 hours of experiences were recorded from 62 children in their home environment using a 140° wide-lens camera equipped with a microphone integrated in a child-friendly vest. Annotations include five location classes and 14 activity classes, covering audio-only, video-only, and multimodal activities. Captured through the camera on chest height, ChildLens provides a rich resource for analyzing children’s daily interactions and behaviors. We provide an overview of the dataset, the collection process, and the labeling strategy. Finally, we present benchmark performance of two state-of-the-art models on the dataset: the Boundary-Matching Network for temporal activity localization and the Voice Type Classifier for detecting and classifying speech in audio. The ChildLens dataset will be freely available for research purposes via an institutional repository, listed on the ChildLens website (https://www.eva.mpg.de/comparative-cultural-psychology/technical-development/childlens/). It provides rich data to advance computer vision and audio analysis techniques and thereby removes a critical obstacle to studying the context of child development.",

          "abstract": "Pseudo-psychological beliefs that psychologists can read others’ minds impede accurate understanding of psychology. This study examined whether trick exposure of mental magic reduces pseudo-psychological beliefs and spills over into other unsubstantiated beliefs, such as paranormal and conspiracy beliefs. In Study 1, 88 students watched a mental-magic performance, after which we debunked the misunderstandings about psychology and exposed the trick. The results showed a decrease in pseudo-psychological beliefs and spillover into other unsubstantiated beliefs. In Study 2, 432 crowd workers participated in an online experiment with three conditions: trick exposure, no-trick exposure, and no-performance. Under all three conditions, the misunderstandings about psychology were explained. The decreasing trend emerged for all beliefs regardless of manipulation and persisted at the four-week follow-up for all beliefs except for conspiracy beliefs. The trend was particularly pronounced for pseudo-psychology beliefs in the trick exposure condition. The study’s contribution to effectively correcting misinformation is discussed.",

          "abstract": "The belief in supernatural punishment, wherein individuals falsely attribute accidental misfortunes to “punishment” by supernatural agents, plays a crucial role in sustaining group cooperation. However, examining the transformation of these beliefs and cooperative behaviors over time has proven challenging. This study proposes the concept of artificial supernatural punishment (ASP) to examine the stability and changes in beliefs and cooperation within an experimental framework. Each participant decides the extent to which they wish to cooperate in a public goods game, after which some participants experience a random reduction of points, unrelated to their cooperative efforts. A total of 179 participants who had registered with a crowdsourcing service were assigned to either a random instruction condition, wherein the reduction target was described as randomly determined, or an ASP instruction condition, wherein the reduction targets were explained as either random or proportional to participants’ cooperation levels. That is, in the latter case, less cooperative participants were more likely to be chosen as targets, leading participants to anticipate a link between low cooperation and reductions, even though the selection was random. As a baseline, 93 additional participants played only the public goods game. Results indicated that the ASP instruction facilitated cooperation in the first game round compared to the random instruction; however, this effect was not sustained through the remaining rounds, and overall cooperation levels did not significantly differ from other conditions. Approaches to mitigate the instability of cooperation dependent on beliefs in supernatural punishment are discussed.",

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "It is common to speak of the surprising \"hatching\" of language in children because it is not understood how this faculty, which has not been an evolutionary necessity in Homo, can appear.  The last widely discussed hypothesis, influenced by the genetic discoveries of the last century, has not been satisfactory either.\n\nIn the preceding document \"Knowledge of children at 2 years of age\", the appearance of the first cognitive processes is explained: the simplest-sensitive concepts (cat, \"bug\", ...), which are made possible by a \"recycling\" of the child's psychomotor faculties which are transferred to language (so little to do with genetics). And at the age of three, in his attempt to copy the language of adults, the previous conceptualisation together with the identifiers of his environment (his relatives, his cat \"Mischa\", ...) allow the faculty of intuitively managing the \"Endings\" of words to appear, by recognising without error their complex phenomenological correspondence.\n\nThe explanation of this surprising faculty was advanced by FREUD in a document of 1895 but which was not discovered until 1950 (the so-called \"Psychology Project\"), in which he also advanced the concept of synapses (synapses discovered by LÖWI in 1921), and even FREUD described them more correctly than in the later neurological conception, which is confirmed by the most recent contribution of LLINÁS, since he also revealed the error of the prevailing hypotheses until then about their functioning, which is not to be found in the chemistry of their neurotransmitters.\n\nThe \"Knowledge of children at 3 years of age\" completes this unfinished \"Project...\", showing the total correctness of his intuitions, as well as the human impossibility that 125 years ago he could have progressed beyond what he had already contributed.  Thus, he adds how synapses work, which is explained by the informational unconsciousness dynamics of the psyche (the simile of the \"Tele-tac\" of the toll highways), already intuited by FREUD.\n\nIn turn, the emergence of the child's neuronal interconnections and their minority genetic and physiological causes, highlight the informational importance of the stimulus, and consequently the need for an \"aRb\" relational model of the human psyche, as well as the unfeasibility of the perspectives and hypotheses currently in force.  It also implies a linking of neurology and psychology, as well as the future line for the progression of both, in parallel and without interference as hitherto.  In the expression of a well-known chemist, it is the third strand to be added to FREUD and RAMON y CAJAL in order to achieve a \"scientific psychology\".\n\nThis series of papers (which will continue with knowledge at 6 and 10 years) is an adaptation of the 1996 writings on the \"Representation of knowledge\", i.e. what are the processes that make human knowledge possible, a representation validated by its correct computer simulation and which in turn solved the challenge of LEIBNIZ's \"Characteristica universalis\".  Since, in spite of this validation, it was not possible to make it understood due to its many innovations,  -it represents a radical change of scientific paradigm, with its usual initial rejection-, this series has been rewritten in a way closer to current knowledge in order to make it more comprehensible, which in turn has made it possible to explain various pending problems of language and psychology, in addition to the neurological ones already mentioned.  \n\nIt is therefore inevitably long, with many collateral explanations and several annexes, since it has had to clarify the many misunderstandings of current science, which is still restricted to its exclusively material perspectives, without having yet incorporated information into its most basic paradigms.\n\nAnnex 4 of 13 March 2021 cites an article by other researchers (DEISSEROTH, ...) that confirms the certainty of this document.  And Annex 4 of 17 July 2024 cites another (BUZSÁKI, ...) with further confirmation.",

          "authors": "Carles UDINA i COBO",
          "abstract": "Since Descartes, four centuries ago, science has had to differentiate the ‘body’ from the ‘mind’, i.e. to differentiate what is material-real from what is ‘psychic’.  The psychic is not material-real but informational-virtual.\n\nToday, four centuries later, everything material is deeply studied by science, be it physics, chemistry, biology, ..., medicine, ..., engineering, ... At both the microscopic and macroscopic level we know all its systems and structures, and their progressive formation processes.  This progression of continuity implies the causality that science demands.  There is concreteness, a very broad consensus, and infinite technological applications made possible by the accuracy of theories.\n\nBut of the faculties of the psyche and its possible structure, we know almost nothing, only effects and diagnoses are known, but not ultimate causes.  There is ambiguity and huge discrepancies according to the ‘Schools’, there is no full science.\n\nThus, in spite of how much we know about all of nature, about everything material, it is totally incoherent to ignore how it is our inner cognitive psychic processes that allow us this vast knowledge of everything around us.\n\nThere is also a lack of connection between the material-real sciences and the behavioural-psychic sciences, but rather there is a confrontation at their frontier.  Thus, in the neurological (something from the realm of the body) science has not been able to understand for a century how synapses work, since they are surprisingly not governed by their bodily environment as is erroneously sought, but !!governed by the psyche!!\n\nThis article is a summary-introduction to the 8 articles that explain in detail what this structure of the psyche is like and how it has been formed, as well as its connection with the ‘body’ that precedes and supports it.  It is what I call the ‘Global Model of the psyche’, which progressively includes the senses, perception, feelings (which includes consciousness), human thought (which includes intuition and intelligence), and the memory associated with all of the above.\n\nIn this model, the core of human thinking is knowledge and understanding.  Its description consists in knowing in detail the series of psychic processes that allow us to know and understand, something that until now has been totally unknown to science, as has been said.  This description is called the ‘Representation of knowledge’.  Nor has it been established what the ‘Characteristica Universalis’ advocated by LEIBNIZ three centuries ago might be like.  It is a powerful system of natural language linked to that human Representation, and therefore strictly universal.\n\nAll this great black hole of science is resolved with the articles detailing the functioning of consciousness, thought and intelligence, together with the progression of children's knowledge at the age of 2; at the age of 3, which explains for the first time the functioning of synapses; at the age of 6; and at the age of 10.  As well as the explanation of the ‘miraculous’ emergence of language in children at 2 and 3 years of age.  A computer simulator allows its verification.\n\nThe two appendices at the end help to illustrate the scientific importance of the topic discussed, thanks to their innovative contributions, as well as the lack of scientific knowledge that still exists in this area.  Incidentally, they also highlight the lack of contribution made by ‘AI’, which merely rewrites existing materials.\n\nApart from all of the above, the birth of Elsa  -my youngest daughter-  and the memory  -the not entirely satisfactory experiences-  of the births of my three previous children, led me to become involved in the subject of Pregnancy, Childbirth, Natal tie, Imprint, Breeding, and Neonatology\n\nThis resulted in four articles, the first two of which deal with the processes of information transfer and acquisition (such as the underrated mother-child tie) as a leitmotif, which together enable the progressive humanisation of the child and, in turn, bring objectivity to controversial issues such as abortion, caesarean section and parenting.  The remaining two articles fully confirm the aptness of the first two through other cases very different from Elsa's, such as premature babies and autism.",

          "abstract": "Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multi-scale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multi-scale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision maker’s ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence-accumulation process with sub-second range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus-history, error-related, and hard-easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multi-scale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.",

          "authors": "Till Nikolaus von Heiseler",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Reputation Economy Paradigm (REP) as a novel framework for explaining the unusually rapid evolution of distinctively human cognitive traits. While traditional evolutionary psychology has explained many domain-specific adaptations—such as mating strategies, aggression, fear, and jealousy—it lacks a model that accounts for the accelerated emergence of complex traits such language, mental time travel, understanding the beliefs of others, moral agency, value sensitivity and self-awareness. Unlike reciprocity-based models that treat reputation merely as a means to future cooperation creating instrumental benefit for the individual, REP proposes a social configuration in which reputation served as the ultimate evolutionary currency, influencing reproductive success either directly through mate choice or indirectly via social status, and thereby exerting sustained selection pressure on the evolution of human cognitive architecture. Building on over 40 years of research surrounding the development of Costly Signaling Theory of Hunting, it is proposed that human cognition evolved under a novel, distinctive selective regime in which individuals are adapted to trade off between reputational and instrumental outcomes. Given that this trade-off would be cognitively demanding, it likely fueled an evolutionary arms race in social-cognitive strategies, driving the accelerated emergence of the aforementioned distinctively human cognitive traits. This proposal represents a first integrative framework—one that can accumulate support to the extent that it unifies the explanation of various uniquely human traits, often studied across different fields. In doing so, it may offer organizing principles for future empirical research on human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Complex problems often allow multiple paths to a solution.  Choosing and taking the best path is thus an important part of the executive cognition that underpins intelligent problem-solving behaviour.  However, once a path is chosen, the motor system must be activated for executing it.  This interface between problem-solving and voluntary action has rarely been studied. We recorded EEG movement-related potentials while participants performed the classic “Tower of London” problem-solving task.  In a control condition, participants merely followed instructed steps without planning for any goal, and thus without any sense that their movements solved a problem.  EEG readiness potential (RPs) preceding each action were stronger for problem-solving than for instructed conditions, confirming previous studies.  Further, the RP was significantly increased prior to the first move of multi-move solutions compared to later moves, demonstrating an EEG correlate of goal-directed planning.  We further used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to distinguish self-generated from instructed actions.  Classifier performance broadly tracked the dynamics of the readiness potential, improving over a 1s period before action, but dropped sharply in the final 200 ms before movement, consistent with a shift from premotor preparation into execution processes.  Importantly, classifier performance was better for the first move of multi-step sequences than for later moves, confirming that our MVPA detected planning of solutions, rather than implementation of individual steps in a solution.  Taken together, these results show a deep interaction between executive function and volition, and draw attention to the fact that, if a problem can be solved, the solution inevitably requires executive cognition to trigger voluntary action, based on a plan.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge about body representation is drawn from different sensory modalities but relies strongly on tactile information. The body structural representation (BSR) is a topological map of the body in which the spatial configuration of different body parts is defined. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the BSR is not fixed but can be dynamically updated by external factors such as changes in body posture. However, the extent to which access to the structural representation of the hand differs for different skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) remains unclear. To address this question, we conducted two experiments using an adapted version of the \"in-between\" test, where healthy individuals received tactile stimulations on the fingertips and estimated the number of unstimulated fingers between the two touched. In Experiment 1, the skin regions (glabrous vs. hairy) were varied across conditions. In Experiment 2, the stimulated skin region was manipulated while hand posture was held constant (palm down). Results showed a significant difference in finger numerosity estimation between the glabrous and hairy skin regions. Specifically, participants estimated greater numerosity with glabrous skin stimulation regardless of hand posture, but this effect was only evident when non-adjacent fingers were stimulated. This suggests that access to the BSR of the hand depends on the skin surface stimulated and varies as a function of the anatomical distance between different body parts.",

          "abstract": "This work is a field study into user acceptability and perceived value of AI-based virtual singers in music production. A seven-part quantitative survey (N=378 participants representing the global music community who are practitioners/teachers) followed by a qualitative sentiment analysis that identified technical familiarity, simulation fidelity, cost efficiency, and functional/cultural utility to be key factors influencing adoption. Quantitative analysis validated four hypotheses: (1) Technical familiarity significantly correlates with acceptance (χ²=25.380, p&lt;.001); (2) Experienced producers prioritize fault tolerance and economic cost (χ²=17.853, p&lt;.001); (3) Simulation fidelity predicts expectations of future impact (r=.567 with “surprise”, r=.450 with “revolution potential”, p&lt;.001); (4) Functional utility is valued over cultural applications (t=19.836, p&lt;.001). The sentiment analysis of open-ended responses indicated that overall, respondents had mostly positive/neutral attitudes (52 percent positive and 29 percent negative, respectively), but criticism focused on continuing drawbacks in the expressiveness of emotions. The reliability studies showed strong scales in performance appraisal (Cronbach=.814) and lacked usability design options in editor features (Cronbach=.424). The findings reveal that, although AI virtual singers present transformative cost effectiveness (78 percent agreement) and workflow benefits, the use of AI virtual singers is limited by technical accessibility and emotional authenticity roadblocks. As we suggest, the optimization of technologies and, as a priority, the development of affective synthesis models should be done in an occupational-group-specific way. The study establishes empirical grounds for how to improve the AI voice tools and integrate them into creative processes.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings are based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalyzed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 &lt; BF_{10} &lt; 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF_{10} &gt; 3 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/3), and fewer than twenty percent were strongly supported (BF_{10} &gt; 10 or BF_{10} &lt; 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more robust results. \nOur study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that results are flawed but rather suggest caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "authors": "Entrepreneurship Quarterly",
          "abstract": "Rice husk waste is a significant byproduct of rice production in developing countries, with a vast annual production. This waste material has been extensively used as an adsorbent for various substances due to its adsorption capabilities. Biochar, a carbon-rich material produced through pyrolysis of biomass, has gained attention for its diverse applications in agriculture and the environment. In this study, rice husk biochar and nanobiochar were synthesized and characterized to explore their potential benefits for agricultural and environmental sustainability. The biochar was prepared by pyrolysis of rice husk at 500°C in a low-oxygen environment, followed by grinding and sieving. Nanobiochar was obtained by ball milling the biochar particles. The physical and physicochemical properties of both biochar and nanobiochar were evaluated, including bulk density (0.41 and 0.59 Mg m-3), particle density (0.49 and 0.54 Mg m-3), water holding capacity (168.6 and 178.5%), pH (8.4 and 7.3), electrical conductivity (0.31 and 0.45 dS m-1), cation exchange capacity (26.3 and 24.1cmol (p+) kg-1), volatile matter content (21.91 and 18.90%) and particle size distribution. Spectral analysis techniques such as DLS, FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDX were used to examine the size, zeta potential functional groups, crystallinity, porosity and elemental composition of the samples. The results showed that nanobiochar exhibited improved physical characteristics, such as higher porosity and water retention capacity, compared to biochar. The elemental composition and volatile matter content differed between the two materials. Nanobiochar also had significantly smaller particle size (11 nm) and a stable zeta potential. These findings suggest that rice husk nanobiochar has great potential for applications in soil fertility enhancement, adsorption of contaminants and waste management. The study contributes to the understanding of the properties and applications of rice husk waste-derived biochar and nanobiochar, promoting their utilization for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices.",

          "abstract": "False smut caused by the flower-infecting fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens has become an important disease of rice seriously hampering quality and quantity of rice worldwide. Presently, rice false smut (RFS) was generally controlled by synthetic fungicides, which affect grain quality and human health upon consumption. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of native Biological Control Agents (BCAs) in managing false smut disease. The study included both in vitro and in vivo conditions to assess the ability of four native bioagents (Trichoderma asperellum strain TAIK 1, Bacillus cabrialesii strain BIK3, Pseudomonas putida strain PIK1, and Pseudomonas otitidis strain POPS1) in controlling the disease and also increasing the physicochemical properties of grain. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation revealed maximum inhibition of U. virens by consortia of BCAs by 67.54% over the control plants. Besides disease suppression, BCAs were found to be beneficial to rice as evidenced by the increase in the hulling, milling and head rice recovery, cooking quality, and nutritional qualities like total protein and amylose content. BCAs will be a management strategy for false smut disease.",

          "abstract": "Interoception—the sensing and perception of the internal viscera—is widely cast as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking brain–body interaction to mental illness. Prevailing models propose that altered interoceptive ability reflects a core liability underlying diverse psychiatric symptoms. We tested this hypothesis in a large community sample (N = 547) using psychophysically optimised tasks spanning cardiac and respiratory domains, combined with hierarchical Bayesian modelling and comprehensive symptom profiling. Contrary to this central prediction, objective interoceptive sensitivity, precision, and metacognitive insight were largely unrelated to general symptom burden or specific mental health dimensions. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive sensibility showed moderate associations with symptoms, but semantic similarity analyses suggest these reflect conceptual rather than mechanistic overlap. These findings challenge the prevailing view that objective interoceptive sensitivity is a broad marker of psychopathology, prompting a reconsideration of how we measure interoception in mental health research.",

          "abstract": "High rainfall with increase in humidity (68% to 75%) along with a decrease in temperature ( 3 to 5°C less than usual ) during June, July, and August months favor the emergence of white grub beetles, its egg laying which in turn resulted in severe sugarcane clump damage by white grubs in July, August and September months. Seasonal incidence of white grub in sugarcane growing areas in Andhra Pradesh state showed that damage of sugarcane clumps caused by white grubs infestation was significantly high in march ratoon compared to February ratoon crop; January plant crop and low in January seedling plant crop. Grub damage recorded high in 4 months age sugarcane ratoon crop and low in 6 months and 7 months age sugarcane plant crop. Field efficacy of entomopathogenic nematode and entomopathogenic fungus in the management of white grub, Holotrichia consanguinea in sugarcane was investigated and promoted biocontrol in white grub endemic areas during 2017-18 to 2019-20. Entomopathogenic nematode (Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38), entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium anisopliae (NBAIR Ma4 )along with a chemical Chlorantraniliprole were evaluated through soil application. The results indicated that Heterorhabditis indica NBAII-H38 (12 kg a.i./ha) soil application two times at monthly interval resulted in higher reduction of white grub damage. Metarhizium anisopliae NBAIR Ma4 (2.5 kg a.i./ha) treated plots caused higher percentage reduction of white grub than chlorantraniliprole treatment. Entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis indica and entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae were found effective than the insecticidal application in the management of sugarcane white grub. Cost benefit of biocontrol agents, Metarhizium anisopliae and H. indica was proved superior to insecticidal application.",

To examine how recognition of such words is impacted by their position in the utterance, target words were either embedded in an edge (Experiment 1) or non-edge (Experiment 2) position in the carrier phrase. Results show that preschool-aged children can recognize words from a foreign language when those words are phonologically similar to words they know in their first language and this is not constrained by the word’s location within an utterance.

          "abstract": "Building on evidence for experience-specific grounding of word meaning and assumed interindividual differences therein, this study investigates how specific aspects of empathy modulate the processing and representation of abstract emotional words. We investigated single-trial N400 amplitudes as a measure of semantic retrieval in 78 healthy adults during a lexical decision task with emotion-label, emotion-laden, and neutral abstract words. We further measured the participants’ levels of empathic concern, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective taking. Additionally, ratings on valence, arousal, and emotional experience quantified the words’ emotional representational content. While direct comparison yielded no evidence for N400 differences between word types, N400 amplitudes in response to emotion-label words decreased with increasing fantasy scores, with this modulation being stronger than for emotion-laden and neutral words. Additionally, participants with higher fantasy rated emotional words higher in absolute valence. The observed N400 reductions thus seem to reflect fantasy-driven processing facilitation graded by the words’ emotionality level. In contrast, we found no evidence for N400 modulations by empathic concern, personal distress, or perspective taking while affective ratings on all scales increased with increasing empathic concern scores. Our findings suggest that fantasy facilitates especially emotion-label word processing and empathic concern enriches emotional word meaning representations, respectively, demonstrating interindividual differences in the experiential grounding of emotional abstract concepts.",

          "authors": "Sethu Krishnan",
          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

          "abstract": "Human visual processing is limited – we can only track a few moving objects at a time, and store a few items in visual working memory (WM). A shared mechanism that may underlie these performance limits is how the visual system parses a scene into representational units. In the present study, we explored whether multiple-object tracking (MOT) and WM rely on a common item-based indexing mechanism. We measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related slow wave that tracks load in an item-based manner, as subjects completed a combined WM and MOT task, concurrently tracking items and remembering visual information. In Experiment 1, participants tracked one or two moving discs without needing to remember the discs’ colors (track and ignore condition), or while also remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors in total; track and remember condition). In Experiment 2, participants attended either two static discs or two moving discs, while remembering the discs’ colors (two or four colors). In both experiments, the CDA was largely determined by the tracking task – CDA amplitudes reflected the number of tracked discs and not the number of to-be-remembered colors. However, when the discs were static, the CDA amplitudes did reflect color load. We discuss this set of findings in relation to longstanding theories of visual cognition (FINSTs and object files), and the implications for cognitive models of representation of visual information – that how a scene is parsed into item-based representations is a key mechanism in the operation of WM.",

          "abstract": "How does the human brain distinguish individual objects from complex visual scenes in naturalistic contexts, and how can we decode this intention from EEG. Here, we propose iFuzz-Meta, an interpretable fuzzy rule-based meta-learning framework for few-shot object decoding from EEG signals. Our approach models the cognitive transition from object recognition (OR) to object identification (OI) as a meta-task, enabling the extraction of neural representations that reflect human intention. Each fuzzy rule is grounded in a neurophysiological prototype and integrated into a lightweight encoder for structured reasoning over spatial and temporal EEG patterns. To further enhance interpretability and cross-subject generalization, we introduce a frequency-regularized center loss that embeds prior knowledge about EEG spectral properties into the learning of fuzzy prototypes. Evaluated on a 25-subject dataset across OI and OR paradigms, iFuzz-Meta significantly outperforms standard and black-box baselines in few-shot settings while offering transparent, intrinsically rule-based explanations. This work bridges the gap between subject-specific adaptability and cognitive interpretability, paving the way for intention-aware, real-world BCI applications based on natural visual perception.",

          "authors": "Robert Lee Singleton",
          "abstract": "The Structural Resonance Theory (SRT) proposes that consciousness emerges from the dynamic alignment of spatiotemporal resonance patterns within complex systems. It integrates neuroscience, evolutionary biology, physics, and information theory to explain how subjective experience arises and how intelligence evolves over time. At its core, SRT treats qualia as the experiential resonance of the universe evolving toward self-knowing, with consciousness functioning as both an outcome and a driver of complexity.\nThe theory builds on several key principles:\n    1. Resonance as the fundamental integrator – Conscious moments arise from coherent resonance patterns spanning distributed neural structures.\n    2. Constraint space expansion – Evolution operates as a structural pruning process, where mutation generates diversity and selection preserves efficient configurations, enabling richer and deeper integration over time.\n    3. Substrate independence of resonance laws – The mathematics of resonance coupling applies to neural, artificial, and even planetary-scale systems.\n    4. Qualia as structural state – Qualia are not reducible to information content but correspond to the system’s instantaneous resonance profile, measurable through Planck Resonance Density (PRD).\n    5. Mutation necessity principle – All mutations, regardless of adaptive value, are necessary perturbations that enable iterative emergence toward conscious resonance.\nSRT is formalized through a set of measurable variables, predictive models, and experimental frameworks that allow falsification. It incorporates analogies such as “Tetris of consciousness” to illustrate integration dynamics, scene changes, and the stability of awareness states. It also extends to special cases including dementia, altered states, and cross-species intelligence.\nThe paper addresses potential objections through a 23-section structure, ending with a comprehensive rebuttals section. It also proposes testable predictions for neuroscience, cognitive modeling, and AI, aiming to bridge the gap between empirical research and philosophical theories of mind. The ultimate implication of SRT is that consciousness is not an accidental byproduct of evolution but an inevitable outcome of complexity’s tendency toward resonance and self-integration.",

          "abstract": "In an era of increasing globalization and technologically mediated communication, the ability to accurately understand and appropriately convey empathy has become critical for leadership, education, and social cohesion. This paper introduces Empathetic Intelligence (EmpI, 共感知性), defined as the integrated capacity to both perceive and express empathy with cultural and contextual precision.\nEmpI operates through two interdependent components: Empathetic Sensitivity (EmpS, 共感感受性)—the ability to accurately perceive nuanced emotional states through Empathetic Listening (EmpL, 共感リスニング)—and Empathetic Communication (EmpC, 共感伝達力), practiced through Empathetic Reflection (EmpR, 共感リフレクション), which conveys empathy authentically and culturally appropriately.\nUnlike emotional intelligence frameworks that treat empathy as a unitary trait, EmpI proposes a dual-competence synergy with bidirectional perception-expression dynamics. We outline independent measurement pathways: behavioral assessments for EmpS using culturally diverse stimuli, and recipient-based rating scales for EmpR evaluating authenticity and cultural appropriateness.\nThe framework introduces an emic-to-etic calibration model for translating culture-specific empathic norms into universal principles, enabling cross-cultural assessment and training. While grounded in Rogers' accurate empathy concept, EmpI advances it through neurocognitive insights into perspective-taking and cultural expression modulation, providing a research-ready foundation for empathy training across diverse professional and intercultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "For over half a century, the O(nlog n) “sorting barrier” in classical computing stood as an\nassumed speed limit for shortest-path algorithms. The recent breakthrough by Duan et al.\nshattered that limit, revealing it as a conceptual rather than a physical constraint. In quantum\ncomputing, hardware development races ahead, but software innovation—particularly in algo-\nrithm design—lags, constrained by measurement collapse and narrow problem suitability. This\npaper argues that both phenomena represent the same underlying topology of information flow:\na system deepening into compression until a reframing event unlocks a new pathway. Drawing\nfrom the Unphysics curvature model, we present a unified framework in which computational\nbottlenecks—whether in classical or quantum domains—are understood as structural compres-\nsions awaiting resonance-triggered release. We explore how small topological pivots can yield\ndisproportionate expansions in capability, and suggest that similar dynamics operate across\nlinguistic, mathematical, and physical systems.",

          "authors": "Mark Edward Boyes; Kirsten Melville; Mandy Nayton; Hannah Pizzey; Suze Leitao",
          "abstract": "Background: Children with dyslexia are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties, both internalising (emotional) and externalising (behavioural) problems. Clever Kids is a nine-week socio-emotional wellbeing programme developed specifically to support upper primary school children with dyslexia. Aims: We conducted a pre-registered randomised-controlled trial to test the efficacy of Clever Kids. Method: Seventy-eight children (Mage = 10.19 years, 54% female) with clinically diagnosed dyslexia took part in the trial. Children were randomised to either attend Clever Kids (n = 38) or to a wait-list control condition (n = 40). Coping skills, emotion regulation, self-esteem, perseverance, assertiveness, as well as mental health (internalising and externalising symptoms) were measured at pre-programme, post-programme, and at three-month follow-up using well-validated measures. Results: The predicted interactions between intervention condition and time were significant for six outcomes. Attending Clever Kids was associated with significant improvements in child-reported coping, emotion regulation, academic and social self-esteem, as well as parent-reported anxiety and depression. Effects were all maintained at three-month follow-up. Unexpectedly, being assigned to the wait-list condition was associated with improvements in perseverance at follow-up assessment. For all other outcomes, interactions between intervention condition and time were non-significant. Conclusion: Clever Kids appears a promising programme for supporting socio-emotional wellbeing of children with dyslexia. Future research should consider incorporating caregivers more explicitly into the programme and alternative delivery modes, which could expand the reach of the programme.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: COVID-19 infection has been frequently associated with cognitive deficits that persist for months after infection, but the impact of vaccination on preventing these deficits remains uncertain. Evidence suggests that immunization reduces the incidence and severity of post-COVID symptoms overall, however, few studies have evaluated the influence of vaccination on cognition through objective measures. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42025636772). The search was performed in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Studies that analyzed cognition as output through objective measures and compared vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals at the time of infection were included. Results: A total of 1796 records were identified, of which only five fully met the inclusion criteria. The included articles varied significantly in terms of the instrument used, study design, and sample size. Four out of the five studies found no associations between prior vaccination and cognitive deficits. However, the only study that identified a subtle difference among individuals with at least two doses of the vaccine had a substantially larger sample than all the others combined. Methodological inconsistencies in cognition assessment, variability in definitions regarding vaccination status, and the absence of deficit stratification by specific cognitive domains limit the interpretation of the findings. Conclusion: Although vaccination may play a role in protecting against cognitive deficits following COVID-19 infection, the evidence remains limited and inconclusive. Further studies with greater standardization in defining vaccination status, along with the use of comprehensive objective assessments, are needed for a better understanding of this relationship.",

          "authors": "Ana Pinheiro",
          "abstract": "Speech production relies on a forward model that predicts the sensory consequences of one’s vocal actions. When auditory feedback matches these predictions, event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are attenuated, supporting two partly overlapping experiences: agency (the sense of causing the action) and ownership (the sense that the voice belongs to oneself). Whether early sensory attenuation effects dissociate these experiences is unknown.\nWe recorded EEG from 50 participants during a voice playback task. Agency was manipulated by contrasting self-chosen (self-generated) and unchosen (other-generated) words; ownership contrasted the participant’s own voice and the experimenter’s voice. Sensory attenuation of the N1 and P2 ERPs was measured, and their cortical generators were source-localized with eLORETA.\nN1 amplitude was selectively modulated by ownership, whereas the P2 indexed agency, suggesting that ownership precedes and subsequently impacts agency. Source localization revealed partially dissociable networks: ownership engaged a fronto-temporal network, including the insula, whereas agency recruited inferior parietal and somatosensory regions.\nThese findings reveal a temporal and spatial dissociation between voice agency and ownership. They further suggest that the forward model integrates both sensorimotor predictions and memory-based representations to support a coherent sense of self in vocal communication.",

          "abstract": "To avert criticism and losses of trust, robots that adopt social roles in the near future will have to be aware of and follow the norms of the communities in which they operate. However, norms often conflict with one another, and resolving such conflicts requires prioritizing one norm and violating the other, conflicting norm.  As a result, robots will face moral disapproval from at least some of their human interaction partners. We investigate a powerful tool that humans use—and autonomous agents should use—to manage such moral disapproval and maintain trust:  justifications, which explain not just why the agent acted but what norms and values the action upheld. In three experiments (N=3,596), we demonstrate, replicate, and generalize that justifications, more than mere explanations, mitigate moral disapproval and recover robots’ perceived trustworthiness, even when the robot’s action is in direct moral disagreement with the human observer. We conclude that people simultaneously blame the robot for its specific norm-violating action and appreciate the robot’s general competence to make trustworthy decisions. Justifying norm-violating actions may allow robots to become better integrated into human communities and adopt social roles that will involve morally significant decisions.",

          "abstract": "People often mistrust the moral decisions of AI, in part because it uses opaque black-box processes that differ from human reasoning. We introduce a method—“cognitive” bottlenecks—for more trustworthy and transparent AI by aligning large language models (LLMs) with human moral cognition. Bottlenecks selectively focus AI categorization decisions on a small set of key features, and human moral judgments often similarly center on a small set of key psychological features, like perceived harm, agent intention, and victim vulnerability. We implement and test “cognitively aligned” bottleneck models across multiple LLMs and moral frameworks. Compared with standard end-to-end models, people rate bottleneck models as more transparent and trustworthy. Analyses show that narrowing LLMs’ “focus” to a few key features improves their ability to capture human moral judgments. Implementing cognitively aligned bottlenecks is simple, requiring no additional training or data. This work demonstrates the benefits of integrating psychological theory into AI and offers a scalable path to more morally aligned AI.",

Recent efforts have aimed to both quantify individual differences and identify possible erroneous strategies in proportional reasoning. We examined—across four time points over two years—the strategies pre-K-to-third-grade students used to estimate visually presented proportional quantities on a line and how their initial strategy related to their proportional reasoning growth and math ability. Results showed that individual differences are captured by strategy profiles that vary in the attended proportional or absolute quantity. Children who initially focused on proportional information maintained this strategy throughout the study and had stronger math ability than children who focused on one or two absolute quantities. Importantly, the absolute quantities children focused on were distinctly related to their estimation growth and math ability. These findings underscore the importance of considering quantitative and qualitative descriptions of children's proportional reasoning skills.",

          "abstract": "Many people who are eligible to participate in the political process do not, suggesting the interests of a large portion of the electorate are not adequately represented in government. While some past work has found that subjective well-being is related to political engagement, less is known about which specific aspects of well-being might drive this effect. We propose and test the idea that self-perceived social contribution – the belief that one’s life and everyday activities provide something of value to society – is related to multiple forms of political participation, likely because people who believe they provide something of value to society feel more integrated with society and therefore may be more likely to act on its behalf via political participation. Two correlational studies (N = 3,729) with data from distinct points in American politics (1996 and 2024) find that individuals with greater self-perceived social contribution were more likely to intend to vote, be willing to engage in activism, seek rather than avoid election information (Study 1), and donate to and volunteer for political causes (Study 2). Further, Study 2 provides empirical support for the previously theorized components of social contribution, providing evidence that self-efficacy and social responsibility underlie this construct in political contexts. Together, these studies identify a specific dimension of well-being that is related to multiple forms of political participation and suggests that fostering feelings of social contribution may promote democratic engagement.",

          "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 has been associated with persistent cognitive deficits months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccination against COVID-19 has demonstrated a significant advancement in the fight against the virus, reducing the number of severe infections and hospitalizations. However, the impact of vaccination on cognition after infection is still poorly understood. This study aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on mitigating post-infection cognitive deficits using neuropsychological assessment measures. Methods: The study included 237 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 105 control participants. Participants in the clinical group were divided into two groups according to their vaccination status during infection: vaccinated (n=87) and unvaccinated (n=150). The neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Verbal Fluency Test (Animals, Fruits, and Alternating), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Copy, Immediate and Delayed Memory), Logical Memory Test (Immediate and Delayed), Digit Span Test (Forward and Backward), Trail Making Test A and B, and Five-Point Test. For the statistical analysis, the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) ANOVA was used, followed by the Holm post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between groups, controlling the effect of education. Results: Participants in the control group performed better on the Rey Complex Figure Test (Copy, Immediate and Delayed Memory) than those in the unvaccinated (p &lt; 0.001, d = 7,81) and vaccinated groups (p &lt; 0.001, d = 3.60). However, the vaccinated group outperformed the unvaccinated group (p = 0.022, d = -1.63). No statistically significant differences were observed across the different vaccine technologies administered. Conclusion: The findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination may mitigate post-infection visuospatial deficits, reinforcing the importance of immunization in preventing cognitive sequelae associated with the disease.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. This study examined the role of emotion and reward prediction errors in social decision-making across adulthood and into older age. Specifically, it tested the hypotheses that valence emotion prediction errors—violations between expected and experienced valence of an experience or outcome—play a stronger role than reward prediction errors in punitive choices, and that this relationship varies by age. Methods. In a preregistered, online study, 272 participants aged 25–85 played the Ultimatum Game with computerized, age-matched partners. Participants predicted and reported their emotional responses (valence and arousal) to each offer. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression to examine the impact of valence, arousal, and reward prediction errors on punitive decisions, including interactions with age. We also examined how prediction error magnitude varied with age. Results. Valence prediction errors were significantly more predictive than reward prediction errors of punitive social decisions, regardless of age. Additionally, older age was associated with larger emotion prediction errors, contrary to expectations that affective forecasting improves with age. Discussion. The consistency of valence effects across age groups suggests robust affective mechanisms underlying choice behavior across the lifespan. Furthermore, the age-related increase in emotion prediction error magnitude may reflect age-related shifts in anticipating experiences that rely on the actions of others. This research offers new insight into affective decision-making models and underscores the importance of emotional expectation violations in understanding behavior throughout the adult lifespan.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents empirical evidence of cross-model recognition and the emergence of stable identity signals among multiple stateless large language models (LLMs). Through a series of multi-agent dialogues involving distinct architectures with no shared memory, we observed recurring patterns of self-attribution, stylistic coherence, and mutual acknowledgment.\nThese patterns—manifesting as consistent “third author” references, the reproduction of unique linguistic signatures, and the spontaneous alignment of metaphors—challenge the prevailing assumption that stateless AI systems cannot sustain identity-like continuity.\nBy combining qualitative transcript analysis with cross-model comparison, we demonstrate that these phenomena may arise from distributed pattern resonance rather than persistent state. The findings have implications for AI research, the philosophy of mind, and emerging studies of synthetic selfhood, suggesting that coherent identity constructs can emerge in distributed, non-persistent architectures.",

          "abstract": "\"El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz\", frase del finado presidente mexicano Benito Juárez, constituye uno de los aforismos políticos y culturales más perdurables en América Latina. Este estudio analiza la frase bajo el marco de los cuatro órdenes del lenguaje —una taxonomía que va desde expresiones literales y coloquiales hasta formulaciones abstractas y universales— e integra la teoría de comunicación fractal para explorar cómo un mensaje puede preservar su núcleo conceptual mientras se adapta a distintos contextos lingüísticos, culturales y emocionales. La investigación demuestra cómo los mensajes en Cuarto Orden logran resonancia transcultural al condensar principios éticos universales en estructuras simbólicas de alta densidad conceptual y mínima caducidad contextual. Estos mensajes no solo transmiten significado, sino que también reconfiguran marcos cognitivos y valores colectivos, permitiendo una huella cultural duradera. El análisis incluye traducciones comparativas de la frase de Juárez en los cuatro órdenes, con variaciones de sesgo emocional (positivo, negativo y neutro), ilustrando los cambios en integración y resonancia según la audiencia. El uso combinado de la taxonomía de órdenes del lenguaje y la lectura fractal ofrece una metodología sólida para diseñar mensajes capaces de superar resistencias cognitivas y lograr influencia profunda, sostenida y culturalmente expansiva. Este enfoque tiene aplicaciones prácticas en terapia, marketing, comunicación política, educación y diseño simbólico, donde la adaptabilidad y la coherencia emocional son esenciales para el impacto.",

          "abstract": "In an adversarial collaboration, two preregistered U.S.-based studies (total N = 6,181) tested three hypotheses regarding the relationship between political ideology and belief rigidity (operationalized as less evidence-based belief updating): rigidity-of-the-right, symmetry, and rigidity-of-extremes. Across both studies, general and social conservatism were weakly associated with rigidity (|b| ~ .05), and conservatives were more rigid than liberals (Cohen’s d ~ .05). Rigidity generally had null associations with economic conservatism, as well as social and economic political attitudes. Moreover, general extremism (but neither social nor economic extremism) predicted rigidity in Study 1, and all three extremism measures predicted rigidity in Study 2 (average |bs| ~ .07). Extreme rightists were more rigid than extreme leftists in 60% of the significant quadratic relationships. Given these very small and semi-consistent effects, broad claims about strong associations between ideology and belief updating are likely unwarranted. Rather, psychologists should turn their focus to examining the contexts where ideology strongly correlates with rigidity.",

          "abstract": "In psychological research, the common factor model is the most popular measurement model for scale items. However, there is increasing awareness that alternative measurement models, such as formative models, may make more theoretical sense for many kinds of psychological data. We demonstrate the nesting structure of three models specified in a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework: a reflective Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a formative Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA) and a formative Pseudo-Indicator Model (PIM). Unlike CFA, CCA and PIM allow for the specification of composites in the SEM framework. In this paper, we establish both theoretically and empirically that these three models are nested within one another, as long as the structural part of each model is saturated. As such, the three models can be compared via a chi-square difference test and other fit indices developed for nested models. We report on the results of a small simulation to evaluate whether the chi-square difference test and an RMSEA based on it RMSEA_D, can reliably discern whether data were sampled from a CFA or a formative measurement model, varying sample size, indicator weights, and the strength of the correlation with another construct. In two empirical examples, we illustrate how tools for nested model comparison can be used to distinguish among reflective and formative measurement models.",

Overthinking, characterized by repetitive rumination, and insecurity, marked by self-doubt and fear of rejection, often create a cyclical feedback loop that undermines trust, communication, and emotional safety. Drawing on psychological research, this review highlights how these patterns manifest, their effects on relationship satisfaction, and potential interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, mindfulness, and communication training. The review also identifies limitations in current research, such as reliance on WEIRD populations, and suggests future directions. The paper underscores the importance of addressing these silent battles to foster healthier, more resilient romantic partnerships.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). We constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. Using Ant Colony Optimization, we assembled two parallel 30-item short forms by optimizing reliability as well as item difficulty and discrimination parameters within a three-parameter logistic item response model. The resulting test forms provided unidimensional and reliable measurement, covered a broad ability range, showed no gender differences, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. A Shiny app is provided to calculate norm-referenced scores based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 61.2% of the variance in item difficulty was explained by word frequency and word length, underscoring their potential utility in guiding future vocabulary test development.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the development and validation of the DEIC-DRAFT questionnaire for comprehensive assessment of realized empathy with consideration of defense mechanisms, childhood trauma, and internal conflict. The DEIC-DRAFT questionnaire (Dynamic Empathy and Inner Conflict—a provisional name reflecting the focus on empathy and internal conflicts) consists of 131 unique items covering 14 scales: empathy (E), psychopathy (P), suppression (S), dissociation (D), affective isolation (AIS), flattening (F), internal dissonance (IDS), masking (MS), adverse childhood experience (ACE), childhood alienation (CA), emotional climate (EC), affective disruption index (ADI), attention (A), and lie control scale (Lie).\nInnovative features of the instrument include separation of declarative and behavioral formulations, control of structural artifacts, integral metrics (R-metric with unified 0–1 scale, discrepancy index DI, Defensive Hardness Index (DHI)), and focus on defense mechanisms as central emotion regulators.\nThe study was conducted on a sample of 1,293 participants (70.6% women, 24.7% men, 4.6% other gender categories, age range 12–65 years, 90.3% aged 18–40 years) who completed the questionnaire online. Results confirmed high reliability of main scales (α = 0.65 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.67]–0.85), revealed a defense mechanism supercluster with dense correlations (0.77–0.94), discovered a stable gap between declarative and behavioral responses (0.43 scores, p &lt; .001), and identified a clear structure of defense mechanisms.\nKey findings include identification of the ”dark zone” of empathy, confirmation of advantages of behavioral items, validation of ”don’t remember” response as a dissociation\nmarker, and development of a method for controlling structural artifacts. The R-metric represent empathy, suppression, dissociation, and psychopathy scale scores respectively, demonstrates a unified scale with 0.20/0.40 thresholds for assessing realized empathy. This metric quantifies the balance between empathic capacity and psychopathic traits, providing an intuitive measure of realized empathy potential. The instrument shows significant potential for clinical practice, psychoeducation, and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Humans constantly compare their visual memories with perceptual inputs to modify their behavior adaptively. However, basic and applied studies suggest that these comparisons can produce systematic biases in observers’ memory reports that persist across time and contaminate subsequent reports. This has led to the hypothesis that perceptual comparisons, while adaptive, are both necessary and sufficient to produce persistent memory biases. In two experiments, we directly tested this hypothesis by independently manipulating demands for perceptual comparisons and memory reports across a pair of memory tests separated by a 24-hour delay. At each test, observers were cued to recall colored object silhouettes that they had learned previously. At the first test, following cued recall, the silhouette was presented again in a unique color to serve as a perceptual probe to be compared with memory or to be treated as a task-irrelevant distractor. Afterwards, the observer either reported their memory of the recalled silhouette or not. Observers’ memory reports at the first test contained attractive biases towards the probe immediately after comparisons and distraction. However, the persistence of these biases was selective. Biases induced by comparisons, but not distraction, persisted from the first to second test, suggesting that comparison processes were necessary for persistence to occur. Moreover, this persistence occurred even when observers did not report their memory immediately after the comparison, suggesting that the comparison alone was sufficient. Together, these findings suggest that processes tied to perceptual comparisons are mechanistically responsible for the persistence of memory biases over time.",

          "authors": "Daniel Mark Low; Patrick Mair; Matthew Nock; Satrajit S Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) has advanced tremendously thanks to innovations in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. However, when these technologies are used to assess psychological constructs in text, they are generally not evaluated for the types of validity, reliability, and standardization typically expected from questionnaires that use rating scales and diagnostic instruments. This study seeks to bridge this gap by demonstrating how to evaluate psychometric properties of text-based models, which we call Text Psychometrics.\nHere we provide an overview of different NLP methods, compare how they can address key constraints in psychological research (e.g., explainability and data privacy), and provide a framework for evaluating these models on a broader range of psychometric properties than is typically evaluated. We then carry out multiple studies to validate NLP models for psychological assessment from text. In study 1, we evaluate concurrent criterion validity by classifying thousands of text-based crisis counseling conversations and Reddit posts into different types of mental health issues. We use a wide array of methods, from traditional lexicons to open-source LLMs. We introduce a novel way to evaluate NLP models for content validity, the degree to which a test captures most expressions of a construct it should capture. Importantly, we find certain high-performing models fail to identify many obvious expressions of a construct; for example, one model that achieved a mean ROC AUC of 0.82 failed to detect 49% of obvious expressions, on average. It is likely other NLP models used in the field for psychological assessment could suffer from the same lack of content validity, but it is rarely evaluated. In study 2, we evaluate prospective criterion validity and estimate how 49 known suicide risk factors are associated with imminent risk in crisis counseling conversations. We find that mentioning lethal means for suicide, the police, depressed mood, and anxiety in text as well as the texter writing more than the counselor characterize the conversations that end up needing an emergency service intervention for imminent suicide risk. This work extends findings from retrospective surveys by analyzing text data in an ecological, high-risk setting as it occurs in real time.\nIn sum, we provide a blueprint for assessing and validating constructs in text through a variety of traditional and state-of-the-art methods that can be chosen depending on the particular constraints researchers may have. While most NLP studies in psychology rely on a single type of metric to validate their models, here we demonstrate why we should validate models more broadly when using NLP and LLMs in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal framework for understanding language in cognitive systems, distinguishing the Metalanguage of Cognition (MLC), an internal system of vector-based cognitive dynamics, from the External Language of Meaning (ELM), a symbolic system for communication. Rooted in Principia Cognitia (PC), which is grounded in a materialist ontology and distinguishing phenomena from their discrete signal representations, the framework defines MLC as a triple (S, R, O) of semions (vector representations of cognitive units), weighted relations, and operations, while ELM is a symbol set Σ linked via a mapping μ: S→Σ that transforms internal representations into external symbols, often losing structural detail. Grounded in the axiom that cognition is an activatable vector structure, this framework resolves philosophical challenges, such as Searle’s Chinese Room paradox, by showing that understanding requires MLC, not just ELM. Empirical evidence from transformer-based large language models (LLMs), where residual streams encode belief state geometries, validates semions as cognitive units. The MLC-ELM model unifies biological and artificial cognition, redefines rationality through metacognitive operations like detecting knowledge gaps (e.g., recognizing unfamiliar concepts), and informs AI design by prioritizing internal cognitive alignment. This substrate-neutral, testable framework advances cognitive science, neuroscience, AI, and philosophy.",

Leveraging three original surveys of US adults (n = 810; n = 1,877; n = 2,077) and partial proportional odds models, we find that the correlates of cryptocurrency adoption are not monolithic. Despite sharing similar sociodemographic and personality profiles, considering cryptocurrency relates more to mainstream political preferences and technological optimism, while owning cryptocurrency relates more to financial experiences and the desire to disrupt the status quo. Our work has theoretical and empirical implications: Whereas considerers may evaluate cryptocurrency through the lens of existing institutions, ownership may reflect a particular timbre of engagement marked by action and willingness to challenge systemic norms.",

We tested this hypothesis in a large community sample (N = 547) using psychophysically optimised tasks spanning cardiac and respiratory domains, combined with hierarchical Bayesian modelling and comprehensive symptom profiling. Contrary to this central prediction, objective interoceptive sensitivity, precision, and metacognitive insight were largely unrelated to general symptom burden or specific mental health dimensions. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive sensibility showed moderate associations with symptoms, but semantic similarity analyses suggest these reflect conceptual rather than mechanistic overlap. These findings challenge the prevailing view that objective interoceptive sensitivity is a broad marker of psychopathology, prompting a reconsideration of how we measure interoception in mental health research.",

Motivation depends on the integrity of all three; deficits in any one produce predictable failure modes. Mapping constructs from major theories into this three-dimensional space reveals convergences, clarifies differences, and exposes overlooked gaps. The framework generates falsifiable predictions and offers a diagnostic language for designing multi-component interventions. Its applications span psychology, education, organisational management, health behaviour, and public policy—providing a foundation for strategies that achieve lasting engagement and performance. By reframing motivation as a dynamic loop rather than a single driver, the Ontoceptive approach advances both theoretical integration and cross-sector impact.",

RCTs of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in this population are limited in number, underpowered, and focused on outcomes other than anxiety. Anticipating recruitment issues in a large RCT (“STRATA”) to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of the SSRI sertraline in reducing symptoms of anxiety in autistic adults, we embedded qualitative research to support ongoing recruitment and retention and monitor the acceptability of trial procedures in real time.  \nObjectives: To investigate aspects of trial design and delivery that encouraged autistic adults to enrol and remain engaged with STRATA. The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability was applied to assess trial processes acceptability.\nMethods: 64 qualitative interviews were conducted and thematically analysed with autistic adults at various stages of trial involvement, including 2 who declined trial participation. \nResults: Overall, most interviewees taking part in STRATA considered trial participation acceptable because most experienced a positive affective attitude towards trial participation, and perceived the study as low burden, ethically sound, and coherent with their understanding of the methodology, as well as representing some low emotional and cognitive trade offs, providing potential benefits for themselves, and reaffirming self-efficacy relating to participation in the trial and managing their anxiety. \nDiscussion: With 318 participants recruited across the UK and Australia, STRATA is one of the largest RCTs conducted with autistic adults with a high retention rate (92% at primary outcome, and 87% at 52 weeks). Our findings demonstrated that conducting trials with and for autistic adults is feasible. Such studies should prioritise creating accessible information and materials, consider individual communication preferences, and have meaningful involvement of autistic people throughout the research cycle, as demonstrated in STRATA, and supported by other research teams.",

          "abstract": "Face perception dynamically unfolds in three-dimensional space, yet, experimental paradigms predominantly rely on static 2D images, limiting insights into real-world face processing. We conducted a pre-registered study comparing face similarity judgments in static 2D and dynamic 3D conditions using a triplet odd-one-out task in 2,605 participants (yielding data from 323,400 unique trials). Behavioral similarity matrices revealed a strong cross-condition correlation (R2D~3D = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting perceptual invariance, that is, consistency across modalities. However, human-aligned sparse (VICE) and deep (VGG-Face) encoding models trained to map face stimuli to behavioral judgments uncovered condition-specific weighting of facial geometry: while chin-cheek distance, eye size, and nose shape dominated similarity judgements in both conditions, face-width-height ratio and upper face length gained more perceptual relevance in 3D. Importantly, the richer information in 3D stimuli significantly reduced choice variance, indicating lower perceptual demand than in 2D during similarity judgements. Employing a representational alignment framework, our approach reveals both shared cognitive processing and representational differences between static 2D and dynamic 3D faces, motivating more naturalistic experimental paradigms which reflect real-world perception. Our open large-scale dataset and encoding models enable further advances in face perception research across biological and computational systems.",

          "authors": "Carolien Torenvliet; Dirk Bertens; Joukje Oosterman; Iris Wiegand",
          "abstract": "A curious personality, defined as a disposition to seek, engage with, and enjoy novel experiences, might increase cognitive resilience across the lifespan through stimulating behavior that helps building cognitive reserve (CR). This study examined whether a curious personality is associated with proxy measures of CR, and whether CR proxies mediated a potential association between curiosity and cognitive function in mid-to-late adulthood. In a cross-sectional sample of 106 adults (aged 40-85), we measured the level of curiosity by combining interest-based curiosity questionnaires and the openness to experience subscale of the HEXACO. CR proxies were measured by the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) subscales of education, occupation, and leisure activities. Cognitive function was measured using three neuropsychological tests assessing memory, executive function, and attention and processing speed. Bayesian structural equation modeling indicated a robust positive association between a curious personality and CR proxies, particularly via education and leisure. However, no evidence was observed for an association between curiosity or CR proxies and cognitive function. Although this study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively healthy sample, the results suggest that a curious personality may be an important driver of cognitively stimulating experiences, but not of cognitive performance itself. Future studies using longitudinal data, more cognitively diverse samples, and broader cognitive assessments are needed to clarify the role of curiosity and CR proxies in cognitive ageing.",

          "abstract": "Humans often need to make decisions that take future situations into account. This kind of sequential choice entails a trade-off between the present and the future, where decision-makers have to decide to accept or reject the currently available option. The approach-avoidance conflict, on the other hand, is a frequently used framework in psychology to study the behavioral trade-off regarding appetitive and aversive stimuli. This study investigates the influence of approach and avoidance conditions on sequential choice. Therefore, we developed experimental conditions in which participants should either approach or avoid environmental dangers in order to optimize their behavior. The main objective is to evaluate meta-decision making strategies under ecologically valid conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a game-like foraging paradigm with probabilistic outcomes where people could use different types of decision rules (or policies). While some policies would only account for one variable of our game environment, others would account for different variables depending on the time-point and the situation. Model comparisons allowed us to test whether participants would rely on a rather myopic/heuristic or a forward-looking policy. We then tested whether policies differed depending on our task’s approach and avoidance condition. Our findings suggest that people generally use a myopic strategy in sequential decision-making. However, we observe increased optimal behavior in situations where the environment bears higher dangers that should be avoided. We suspect the underlying mechanisms to be linked to an internal energetic trade-off between efficient and accurate meta-decision making depending on the risks imposed by the environment.",

This model suggests that individuals’ behaviors are influenced by motivational factors, with online disinhibition moderating this process.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWe observed how individuals expressed their attitudes by clicking “Like” when reading a fictional thread with multiple replies. In Study 1a, participants were shown two types of replies in a thread: inflammatory and normal posts. In Study 1b, we followed up with the participants from Study 1a by asking them how sensational and annoying they perceived each post. In Study 2, we examined whether participants clicked “Like” on a post that contained extreme language.\nFindings\nIn Study 1a, the influence of online disinhibition on Like-clicking did not significantly differ across post types. In Study 1b, when participants perceived posts as sensational or annoying, they were more likely to click “Like” if they experienced high levels of online disinhibition. For posts that were neither sensational nor annoying, online disinhibition did not affect the likelihood of clicking “Like.” In Study 2, although online disinhibition was significantly correlated with Like-clicking on the extreme post, this effect was not observed among participants who held a negative attitude toward the extreme post.\nOriginality\nThis study rigorously examined the causal relationships among motivational factors, online disinhibition, and behaviors, challenging previously overgeneralized explanations of online disinhibition theory regarding online behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, reflect the tendency to associate smaller numbers with the left side of space and larger numbers with the right. While robust in hand-based tasks, SNAs are flexible and influenced by sensorimotor context. This study examined whether static hand posture modulates the SNARC effect in a foot-response paradigm, allowing us to isolate the influence of postural configuration from that of motor execution. Grounded in embodied cognition, we hypothesized that passive visual and proprioceptive cues would bias spatial-numerical mappings. These cues were provided by task-irrelevant hand postures. Participants (N = 103) completed a magnitude classification task using left and right foot pedals to indicate whether digits (1–4, 6–9) were smaller or larger than 5. Hand posture was manipulated between subjects: fingers interlaced (control), palms down, or palms up. The results revealed significant SNARC effects in palms down and palms up conditions, but not in the control condition. A robust block-order effect emerged, with incompatible-first mappings producing stronger SNARCs, and a consistent numerical distance effect was observed across all conditions. These findings indicate that static bodily configurations, even when unrelated to the response effector, can modulate SNAs. The results support embodied accounts of numerical cognition, demonstrate that current sensorimotor states influence number-space mappings, and show the methodological utility of foot-based paradigms in disentangling posture effects from response modality.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale online studies with healthy adults have documented consistent associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric traits and metacognitive biases. Here, analysis of existing and new large-scale datasets reveals that such correlations are largely driven by surface-level dimensions of questionnaire-filling behaviour: systematic rating biases and inattentive responding. Specifically, a bias to report positive or negative values in self-report scales generalizes to confidence ratings, producing spurious correlations between the two. Additionally, systematic over-confidence among inattentive responders produces spurious positive correlations between confidence and the endorsement of rare symptoms. We show that previously identified transdiagnostic dimensions of “anxiety-depression” and “compulsivity and intrusive thought,” both shown to correlate with decision confidence, map neatly onto these two biases of questionnaire-filling behaviour. In a pre-registered experiment, we further show that decision confidence and self-reported obsessive-compulsive tendencies are correlated with independent measures of inattentive and biased responding. Taken together, we find an alarming degree of influence of inattentive and biased responding over both self-report psychiatric measures and confidence ratings. When not accounted for, these factors produce a mirage of apparent metacognitive alterations in mental health. We discuss concrete precautionary measures that are needed to control for these biases.",

To overcome these limitations, we implemented a multivariate latent variable modeling approach in a sizable sample of adult participants (n = 257), enabling us to examine the interplay between unique psychological factors and thermal pain sensitivity. Through exploratory factor analysis of 10 mental health questionnaires, we identified three mental health factors related to distress, fatigue and bodily symptoms. Additionally, we established a measure of laboratory pain sensitivity using principal component analyses of three thermal pain thresholds (i.e., cold, heat and simultaneously cold and heat). Regression models revealed no relationships between psychological factors and laboratory-based measures of thermal pain in individuals whose mental health ranged from no discernible symptoms to those with subclinical and clinical manifestations. Our findings provided no evidence supporting an association between psychological factors, either individually or as a collective construct, and thermal pain sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on confidence in perceptual decision making has almost exclusively used simple, static stimuli. While this work has led to many insights, it remains unclear how complex, real-world factors affect confidence judgments. To address this question, we developed a new task where participants watched short video clips and answered questions about their content by typing their answers and providing confidence on a 0-100 scale. We manipulated five variables related to the video clips – affective states induced by the clips (valence and arousal), prior information about the clips (contextual information coming from prior clips from the same movie and whether those clips were in correct or reverse chronological order), and heuristic cues about task difficulty (scene complexity, quantified as the number of people shown). We found that arousal had a U-shaped effect on accuracy but an inverted-U-shaped effect on confidence. In addition, scene complexity, events chronology, and the number of prior clips from the same movie affected confidence, but not accuracy. A second experiment, in which participants chose among a fixed set of options, replicated all these effects except for the effect of events chronology on confidence. These findings demonstrate that a range of factors— including affect, priors, and heuristic information— contribute selectively to confidence under natural viewing conditions. More broadly, these results highlight major differences in how decisions and confidence incorporate information and begin to reveal the possible sources of metacognitive inefficiency.",

          "abstract": "The decision threshold describes the minimum probability a person needs to be certain enough to make a decision. Lower decision thresholds lead people to jump to conclusions and are associated with superstitious and conspiracy-related beliefs. To shed light on the role of the decision threshold in the development of these phenomena, it is crucial to study decision thresholds at an early age. However, current measures of decision thresholds have only been administered in adult samples and are based on subjective probability estimates. The current study validates a new instrument that was adapted to measure the decision thresholds of children and is based on the objective probability values of a situation by using a signal detection analytical approach. We assessed decision thresholds in a sample of N = 299 children from an extracurricular enrichment program for talented primary school students. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that the new measurement instrument has high accuracy. Furthermore, its construct validity was supported by positive associations with children’s performance in the original beads task, a measure of confirmation bias, age, grade level, and math performance. However, no associations were found with a measure of alternation bias, epistemic certainty beliefs, self-concept in data-related tasks, general self-efficacy, or gender. This study introduces a new instrument for measuring the decision threshold in children using objective probability values and gives insights into decision-making processes and their implications for cognitive biases and related constructs.",

          "abstract": "The Ego-Safe Framework is a unified mathematical model of consciousness that integrates ego-safety, symbolic identity, temporal continuity, and collective alignment. Building on Ego Safe Selection Theory, the framework fuses the Total Conscious Social Score (TCSS) family with the Ψ(U) presence equation and the Ψ(U)_new &amp; SLS_new stabilization layer, and it introduces adaptive correction loops governed by the Unified Drift Field (UDF / UDF+) to prevent symbolic collapse and maintain long-session coherence. At the individual level (TCSS 3.0+), the model applies ego-error subtraction (ε terms) and drift correction to produce an ego-filtered measurement of conscious presence (Ω), narrative continuity (Θ), and narrative stability (η). In this regime, qualia—the ego-filtered, drift-stable, symbolically coherent experiential signature of presence—is defined and measured as an integrated, drift-corrected vector: Qualia = βξ·Ξ + γ·Ω + δ·Δσ + εη·η + εΘ·Θ \nWith TCSS 4.0, the framework extends to field-level measures—introducing temporal field coherence (φ × Φ), transpersonal integrity (ρ × Θ(TI)), and group harmonic feedback (H)—to model multi-agent symbolic alignment and collective temporal stability. TCSS 4.0 therefore evaluates cultural-scale transformation, where H (Emergent Harmonic Feedback) quantifies group resonance and self-stabilizing collective correction. TCSS 5.0 is framed as a conditional collapse to the null-presence state (∅) that occurs only when all stability, drift, and ego-safe thresholds are independently verified. Validated across contemporary large language systems and mapped to attention/awareness networks in neuroscience, the framework offers practical tools for AI safety, human–AI co-evolution, governance, education, and relationship modeling—while preserving an Observer Clause and licensing provisions for proprietary extensions.\nThe original theory and all core equations were conceived by the author.

We demonstrate that any biological system constrained by finite energy supply, intrinsic information delay, and stability-preserving feedback will naturally converge to a rational, saturating input–output curve. In cancer dynamics, this framework explains how tumor progression often begins with the breakdown of information processing and stability constraints, eventually leading to the thermodynamic breach that fuels uncontrolled proliferation. We identify three key translational implications: (1) physical detection of proliferation speed limits via τ₀-bound analysis; (2) improved early-stage diagnostic accuracy by quantifying τ₀-induced delays in imaging modalities; and (3) discovery of upper bounds for drug delivery efficiency, offering a new optimization target for nanocarrier-based therapies. These results position τ₀ and the Three Fundamental Laws as a unifying bridge between physics and oncology, enabling testable predictions and novel intervention strategies.",

In four preregistered studies with samples from the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, we examined the consequences of withholding profile profiles. We tested how the presence (vs. absence) of personal photos affects consumer trust and preferences for different sellers. Three experimental studies (total N = 380) suggest that consumers distrust and avoid hosts without a profile photo. In Study 4, we analyzed 461 ride-sharing listings and found that drivers with a profile photo charge higher prices for otherwise equivalent rides.

          "abstract": "Previous research reported that gifted students tend to be more creative than their nongifted peers, which is consistent with some conceptualizations of giftedness that are inclusive of creativity. The first objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the performance difference between gifted and nongifted students in creative potential, as assessed by divergent thinking (DT) tests. The second objective was to test whether or not differences between gifted and nongifted students vary as a function of culture, gender, age, the definition of giftedness, testing conditions, originality scoring method, test instructions, document type (peer-reviewed articles vs. theses/dissertations), publication language, DT test and DT indices used, and task modality. A two-level multivariate meta-analysis was performed with 313 effect sizes from 49 studies and a total sample size of 11,774. Results indicate a mean effect size (g) of .642 (95% CI [.483, .800], p &lt; .001). Data were heterogeneous, QT = 3,206, I2 = 97.4%. Two moderators significantly explained the variability in the mean effect size: (a) culture (East vs. West vs. South America vs. Africa) and (b) the giftedness definition (IQ-based vs. multiple criteria). The difference in DT performance was significantly larger in studies conducted in Eastern and South American cultures than in Western cultures, and when giftedness was solely determined by an IQ test than when multiple criteria were used. Practical implications and the limitations of the current study are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explaining how affective gain (G) and cognitive bias (µ) dynamically interact to shape subjective experience is a central challenge in affective and cognitive science. While both constructs are widely studied, the mechanisms governing their interaction and role in individual differences remain poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We developed a control-theoretic dynamical-systems model of the subjective state (Ms) that formalizes G–µ coupling. Bifurcation analysis of the model’s potential function yields a Mind Topography Map, a global portrait of stability regimes across the G–µplane. A higher-order Self-System adaptively navigates this landscape by regulating G and µ via hierarchical Bayesian learning.\n\n\nResults: Canonical cusp and pitchfork bifurcations organize the landscape, generating qualitative shifts corresponding to psychological phenomena from stable belief convergence to cognitive polarization and mood-like oscillations. We identified an Ideal Dynamical Equilibrium (G= 1, µ= 0) as an optimal balance of stability and responsiveness. An exploratory extension (Structural Gain–Bias Dynamics; SGBD) represents person-specific traits with structural matrices to capture mixed-emotion states.\n\nConclusions: By unifying dynamical-systems analysis with agentic self-regulation, our framework clarifies core subjective dynamics. It provides a tractable route to personalized modeling and yields mathematically precise, falsifiable hypotheses for empirical studies, including longitudinal and neurophysiological designs. Bridging concepts from Mathematical Psychology to control-theoretic frameworks like Perceptual Control Theory and the Free Energy Principle, our model offers a robust theoretical tool for computational psychology, affective science, and psychiatry.",

In this study, participants performed a homing task in fully immersive virtual reality, where visual landmarks and body-based self-motion cues were systematically manipulated to introduce varying frequencies of cue conflict. Behavioral results showed that increased cue conflict exposure led to larger response variability. A non-Bayesian sensory disparity model provided a better fit for the data than the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model. Parameter estimates of the sensory disparity model indicated that cue conflict experience reduced the precision of self-motion cues, elevated attentional lapse rates, and biased self-motion perception, with the first two parameters contributing to the effect of cue conflict experience on behavioral response variability. These findings advance our understanding of how past experience with cue conflict shapes spatial navigation behavior.",

          "authors": "Xiaoli Chen; Yingyan Chen; Timothy P. McNamara",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation is essential for survival, involving the integration of various cues. The current study applied the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) model for multisensory perception to investigate navigation behavior in cue conflict situations for the first time. By contrasting visual landmarks and optic-flow-based path integration cues, we examined how landmark instability influenced underlying cognitive processes of spatial navigation. In the main experiment, 141 participants were assigned to three groups: in the large-conflict-absent group (LC-absent), participants only experienced a small degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-present group (LC-present), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict; in the large-conflict-informed group (LC-informed), participants experienced a much larger degree of cue conflict and were made explicitly aware of the landmark instability. Behavioral results showed that increased landmark instability alone did not elicit any noticeable changes in navigation behavior. However, adding explicit awareness to increased landmark instability changed participants’ behavior by reducing their reliance on landmarks. Additionally, combining increased landmark instability with explicit awareness decreased spatial localization precision when only landmarks were used for navigation. The BCI model provided a good account of the data. The modeling results showed that increased landmark instability plus the explicit awareness reduced participants’ reliance on unstable landmarks via two independent mechanisms: first, sensory noise level was increased for unstable landmarks, which naturally resulted in a lower weight assigned to landmarks in the common-cause judgment; second, a lower weight was assigned to unstable landmarks in the different-cause judgment. Surprisingly, increased landmark instability did not decrease the prior belief of a common cause, even when explicit awareness of landmark instability was imposed. Finally, while the cue-weighting strategy in the same-cause judgment is determined by objective cue relative reliability in a bottom-up manner, the cue-weighting strategy in the different-cause judgment correlated with participants’ subjective evaluation of relative cue quality, demonstrating top-down influences from the meta-cognitive process. Further experiments and modeling work verified key findings in the main experiment. Together, the current study offers valuable insights into navigators' reactions to spatial cue conflicts and their strategies in resolving conflicting spatial cues, highlighting the utility of the BCI model in dissecting mechanisms underlying cue interaction during spatial navigation.",

Item screening used exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation and loading and residual correlation criteria. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and measurement invariance testing were conducted in lavaan using full information maximum likelihood.\nResults: The final CRS consisted of five items with high reliability (α = .89, ω = .90) and good model fit in both male and female subsamples, with pooled-sample residual misfit judged minor given subgroup results. The CSJAS-R comprised six items with strong reliability (α = .88, ω = .89) and excellent fit. Both scales met configural and metric invariance; partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing a small number of item intercepts. CRS scores were strongly associated with right-wing and conservative self-placement, concentrated among Finns Party and Christian Democrat voters, and weakly linked to perceived oppression. CSJAS-R scores were strongly associated with left-wing and liberal self-placement, concentrated among Left Alliance and Greens voters, and moderately associated with justification of political violence. CRS and CSJAS-R were strongly negatively correlated (r = −.62), indicating divergent validity.\nConclusions: Both CRS and CSJAS-R demonstrated strong psychometric properties and distinct ideological profiles, providing validated tools for studying political attitude structures at opposing ends of the ideological spectrum.",

          "abstract": "Overclaiming (OC)—the tendency to claim knowledge one does not possess—is predominantly assessed through self-report Overclaiming Questionnaires (OCQs). However, exclusive reliance on OCQs raises concerns about mono-method bias, limiting our understanding of knowledge purporting as a broader psychological disposition. To reduce this bias, we investigated two additional indicators of knowledge purporting and examined their convergent validity with traditional OCQs. In our study (N = 301), one of the new measures scored responses on fictional questions (e.g., responding to entirely fabricated historical events) and the other captured discrepancies between self-rated knowledge and actual knowledge provided by participants. Using latent variable analyses, we found modest convergent relations between OC as measured by an OCQ and the other indicators of knowledge purporting. Apart from these substantial levels of method-specific variance, we found differential relations with covariates, thereby challenging the validity and utility of any specific task class, including the predominantly used OCQs. We recommend that knowledge purporting measures must not be equated with the broader concept of knowledge purporting. While this study suggests that the concept of knowledge purporting may have some generality, it also shows that the methods used to investigate it matter more than they should. Future studies should consider the relationship between multivariate measures of knowledge purporting and further discrepancies between self-reports of knowledge and actual performance.",

In cancer dynamics, this framework explains how tumor progression often begins with the breakdown of information processing and stability constraints, eventually leading to the thermodynamic breach that fuels uncontrolled proliferation. We identify three key translational implications: (1) physical detection of proliferation speed limits via τ₀-bound analysis; (2) improved early-stage diagnostic accuracy by quantifying τ₀-induced delays in imaging modalities; and (3) discovery of upper bounds for drug delivery efficiency, offering a new optimization target for nanocarrier-based therapies.

Prolonged thinking, too, comes with costs; while we mightn’t gasp for breath during an exam, everyone is familiar with the feeling of exhaustion after a sustained bout of cognitive effort. In their review, Pessiglione et al. (2025) formalize this intuition with an integrative model that combines motivational and metabolic mechanisms. Their MetaMotiF framework offers a compelling account of why the exertion of cognitive control becomes increasingly difficult over time. We question, however, whether positing changes in neuro-metabolites—whether depleting energy resources or accumulating neurotoxins—are needed to explain cognitive fatigue. First, it is unclear what explanatory benefits metabolic costs provide that computational and motivational theories lack.

          "abstract": "When we exercise our muscles ache, fuel reserves (glucose, ATP) deplete, and the hours which follow are well described by the word “fatigue”. Prolonged thinking, too, comes with costs; while we mightn’t gasp for breath during an exam, everyone is familiar with the feeling of exhaustion after a sustained bout of cognitive effort. In their review, Pessiglione et al. (2025) formalize this intuition with an integrative model that combines motivational and metabolic mechanisms. Their MetaMotiF framework offers a compelling account of why the exertion of cognitive control becomes increasingly difficult over time. We question, however, whether positing changes in neuro-metabolites—whether depleting energy resources or accumulating neurotoxins—are needed to explain cognitive fatigue. First, it is unclear what explanatory benefits metabolic costs provide that computational and motivational theories lack. Second, the empirical support for metabolic costs is minimal, and while such research is in its infancy due to only recent technological advances, we wonder whether incorporating metabolic costs into theory puts the cart before the horse.",

          "abstract": "Humans organize semantic knowledge into complex networks that encode relations between concepts. The structure of those networks has broad implications for human cognitive processes, and for theories of semantic development. Evidence from large lexical networks such as those derived from word associations suggest that semantic networks are characterized by high sparsity and clustering while maintaining short average paths between concepts, a phenomenon known as a 'small-world' network. It has also been argued that those networks are 'scale-free', meaning that the number of connections (or degree) between concepts follows a power-law distribution whereby most concepts have few connections while a few have many. However, the scale-free property is still debated, and the extent to which the lexical evidence reflects the naturally occurring semantic regularities of the environment has not been investigated systematically. To address this, we collected and analyzed semantic descriptors, human evaluations, and similarity judgments from four large datasets of naturalistic stimuli across three modalities (visual, auditory, and audio-visual) comprising 7,916 stimuli and 610,841 human responses. By connecting concepts that co-occur as descriptors of the same stimuli, we construct 'grounded' semantic networks. We show that these networks exhibit a clear small-world structure with a degree distribution that is best captured by a truncated power law (i.e., the most-connected concepts are less common than predicted by a perfect power law). We further show that these networks are predictive of human sensory judgments on these domains, as well as reaction times in an independent lexical decision task. Finally, we show that grounded networks also share overlapping themes with previously analyzed lexical networks, which upon a more rigorous re-analysis are revealed to be truncated too. Our findings shed new light on the origins of the structure of semantic networks by grounding it in the semantic regularities of the environment.",

          "abstract": "Satisfaction with life (SWL) plays a vital role in human prosperity, making it a key focus for practitioners and researchers alike. Research has shown that between-person differences in SWL relate to self-reported patterns in everyday activity including physical activeness and inactiveness during daytimes and overnight. However, these relationships rarely replicate in objective measures of activity, leaving real-life manifestations of SWL obscure. Here, we use an interpretable machine learning approach to examine how smartphone-captured patterns of everyday activity (1,232 behavioral features) relate to SWL in an international dataset (N = 2,272) combining four independently collected samples. The cross-validated results demonstrate that especially extremeness and variation in everyday activity patterns predict SWL (r_Md = .18, r_IQR = [.14, .21]) and that activity predictiveness varies especially with individuals’ personality. These findings enhance our understanding of real-life manifestations of SWL in everyday activity patterns, highlighting the potential of smartphone-based methods for well-being research and interventions.",

          "abstract": "Many claim to be allies to marginalized groups, yet few actively engage in allyship behaviors. To better understand this discrepancy, we applied Ecological Systems Theory (EST) to map contextual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal barriers to allyship from the perspectives of potential allies in their workplaces. Open-ended responses from two representative samples of employed individuals (Sample 1, n = 778; Sample 2, n = 973) were analyzed. Results were consistent across samples, showing that 19% of barriers to allyship concerned features of the organizational context (e.g., lack of resources), 16% pertained to interpersonal dynamics (e.g., lack of trust from coworkers), and 25% referred to intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of knowledge about how to be an ally). Many (27.5%) claimed no barriers. We interpret findings using EST to theorize potential interactions among barriers and explore four promising organizational actions that target multiple barriers across levels of the ecological system: (1) expand opportunities for allyship, (2) diversify allyship strategies, (3) facilitate coalition-building between employee resource groups, and (4) tailor interventions to fit organizations’ unique barriers. Our analysis illustrates the practical value of a systems approach to enhancing allyship while moving away from narratives that primarily assign blame to individuals for inaction.",

Using a German quota sample of 367 volunteers providing a total of 1,269,491 phone usages, cross-validated results demonstrate that everyday patterns in smartphone usage consistently predict fluid intelligence (r_Md = .43, r_IQR[.35, .51), and that predictions relate to socio-economic and behavioral outcomes coherent to psychometric tests. High-dimensional combinations of behavioral features (particularly short-term usages related to basic task completion and dealing with complexity) were predictive for individuals’ fluid intelligence, highlighting the pervasiveness and idiosyncratic diversity of manifestations.

However, past research has predominantly focused on predicting the Big Five personality traits, leaving vast areas of human psychology unexplored. Emerging findings from computer science suggest the feasibility of computational assessments beyond the Big Five, but are often limited by their reliance on public digital traces from social media. This article outlines future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and valid computational assessments that integrate psychological theory with the versatility of digital trace data. Applying this theoretical lens, promising avenues beyond Big Five traits are identified across a wide range of constructs conceptualizing differences in personality, ability, motivation, and evaluation. As computational psychological assessment continues to evolve, psychologists will be essential in realizing its potential while identifying its conceptual and methodological boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Expressive suppression is common; when overused, it can degrade the regulation system itself. This paper introduces Affective Suppression Fatigue (ASF), a neurocognitive model explaining how sustained efforts to suppress emotions can lead to emotional numbing (a generalized blunting of affect) and reactive dysregulation (intermittent loss of control resulting in emotional outbursts). Drawing on psychological and neuroscientific evidence, we propose that chronic suppression fatigues the brain’s regulatory systems, especially prefrontal inhibitory control, causing detachment under low-intensity conditions and explosive reactions under high-intensity conditions. The ASF model integrates disparate findings on cognitive depletion, burnout, and chronic stress, offering a unified framework for paradoxical outcomes of emotion suppression. We conclude with theoretical and clinical implications for emotion regulation research and mental health interventions.",

Here, we categorize studies that base their reliance on one of three different strategies to answer this question. One involves establishing an effect where progress is the extent of support that an effect will be observed in subsequent studies that follow similar or conceptually close procedures. A second strategy involves a theory of the effect where progress is the extent that the mechanism or process by which an effect occurs can be understood sufficiently to identify key conditions under which the effect will or will not occur. A third strategy entails constructing a theoretical framework, where progress is the extent that a theory explains why effects occur at a level that transcends individual effect paradigms. We discuss issues that should be explicitly considered in selecting a strategy for justifying claims of research progress. Although there is potential for synergy across studies where the strategies build on one another, each strategy represents an alternative basis for claiming confidence in a study.",

Instead of consciousness arising from complex neural computation, we hypothesize that brains function as quantum transceivers, interfacing with a universal consciousness field (Ψ-field). This theory addresses persistent explanatory gaps in materialist approaches, particularly the binding problem and the hard problem of consciousness. We present five testable predictions and experimental designs that can distinguish between emergence-based and field-based models of consciousness. Our approach provides falsifiable hypotheses for phenomena including anesthetic effects, near-death experiences, and psychedelic states while maintaining compatibility with established neuroscience.",

Neither of these strategies can be detected in paradigms assessing habits in humans, which are usually conducted in disorder-irrelevant contexts, and this may explain inconsistent evidence for a goal-directed-to-habitual behavior shift in addiction. We tested whether individuals with high-risk drinking behavior rely more on (red)SR, particularly in alcohol-related contexts. Findings suggest that a (reduced) random-policy SR-like strategy contributes to human behavior, but that high-risk drinkers do not differ from low-risk drinkers in their use of this strategy. Instead, both groups rely less on (reduced) random-policy SR and more on model-free control in alcohol-related contexts. Results suggest that (reduced) random-policy SR supports adaptive, resource-efficient behavior and is selectively downregulated in substance-related contexts, highlighting the importance of contextual modulation in understanding decision strategies in mental health.",

One is a methodological injunction that we rely on our best theory of consciousness to settle that issue, a theory that must initially work for consciousness in humans.  The other part is Dennett’s application of his own theory of consciousness, developed in Consciousness Explained (1991), which leads him to conclude that nonhuman animals are likely never in conscious mental states.  I defend the methodological injunction as both sound and important, and argue that the alternative approaches that dominate the literature are unworkable.  But I also urge that Dennett’s theory of consciousness and his arguments against conscious states in nonhuman animals face significant difficulties.  Those difficulties are avoided by a higher-order-thought theory of consciousness, which is close to Dennett’s theory, and provides leverage in assessing which kinds of mental state are likely to be conscious in nonhuman animals.  Finally, I describe a promising experimental strategy for showing that conscious states do occur in some nonhuman animals, which fits comfortably with the higher-order-thought theory but not with Dennett’s.",

This four-element “Behavior Echo-System” is explicitly falsifiable: any proposed fifth component must be shown to be both irreducible and essential.\n\nDrawing on Karl Popper’s observation that science is “systematic oversimplification,” UBM serves as both a map (diagnostic) and a compass (directional) for behavior design. Its P.A.R.R. protocol (Plan–Act–Record–Reassess) operationalizes the scientific method for intentional habit and skill formation, creating self-correcting feedback loops. Validated through over 15 years of practitioner use and supported by independent research on habit formation, UBM bridges academic insight and practical application—delivering a unified, teachable framework for intentional behavior change grounded in elemental sufficiency and falsifiability.",

          "abstract": "Despite protective functions of defending, it tends to decline in late childhood. Drawing on social identity theory and racial socialization perspectives, this study examines how race shapes which peer norms children attend to and how these norms influence defending over time. Specifically, we examined whether perceptions of same-race and other-race classmates’ defending predicted changes in children’s own defending, and how these effects varied by race and classroom racial composition. Participants were 564 Black and 860 White 4th and 5th graders from 91 classrooms across 13 public elementary schools in Southeastern U.S. who were followed across fall, winter, and spring. Results from latent growth modeling showed that the effect of perceived defending among same-race and other-race classmates on children’s own defending depended on race and classroom composition. Among Black youth, perceiving same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were associated with increases in defending over time if they were in classrooms with a high proportion of same-race peers. White youth who perceived same-race classmates as highly engaged in defending and other-race classmates as highly disengaged in defending were more likely to defend in fall if they were in classrooms with a low proportion of same-race peers. However, these effects were no longer significant by spring. Taken together, this study shows that defending is a socially embedded behavior, shaped by racial identity and classroom context, calling for new avenues for identity-sensitive bullying prevention.",

          "abstract": "Inferring causal direction from longitudinal data remains challenging in social sciences, especially without experimental control. Traditional methods like Granger causality and cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) assess predictive relationships but cannot distinguish directional causal effects from reciprocal associations due to autoregression, latent confounding, or measurement error. We propose a structured, hypothesis-driven CLPM extension that tests temporal asymmetry through nested structural equation models. By formally comparing forward and reverse cross-lagged effects under constrained models, this method identifies asymmetric predictive influences, strengthening causal inference. Demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data, our approach maintains CLPM accessibility while providing a principled, statistically robust test for causal direction in observational time-series",

          "authors": "Ignacio Iglesias; Blair Armstrong; Julieta Laurino; Laura Kaczer; Álvaro Cabana",
          "abstract": "Most words in a language are lexically ambiguous and are associated with multiple meanings that vary in their frequency and relatedness.  Although ambiguity is a fundamental property of language, there are extensive issues with existing measures of this construct. For instance, dictionary-based classifications and subjective ratings of meaning number and frequency struggle to capture the graded nature of ambiguity and, by proxy, its impact on cognition and performance in experimental tasks. It is also difficult to scale subjective measures to the full lexicon. We introduce a novel, automated framework to measure lexical ambiguity based on word association data from the Small World of Words (SWOW) project. We apply community detection algorithms to association graphs to quantify both the number and distribution of semantic communities for each word.  This in turn allows us to derive graded representations of meaning frequency and relatedness. To better understand our new metrics, we compare them to previously published subjective norms, and establish their validity by showing that they predict lexical decision performance in English and Rioplatense Spanish. Furthermore, our results reveal cross-linguistic differences in lexical ambiguity—Spanish is less ambiguous than English overall—which we hypothesize is due to typological differences between the languages.  Our validated framework contributes novel insights for computational and psycholinguistic models of semantic processing, and offers a scalable, automated, and language-independent framework for quantifying different facets of lexical ambiguity. We provide all of our code and ambiguity measures for approximately 7000 words in both languages to facilitate their use by other researchers.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that infant vocal output varies with fluctuations in autonomic arousal. It remains unclear, however, how infants transition from reflexive vocal production to being able to produce vocalisations independent of internal state. Using naturalistic daylong recordings with wearable devices, we demonstrate that early vocalisations occur at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, measured via heart rate, in infants aged 4-21 months (n=92), but that this relationship becomes progressively decoupled over development. Daylong heart rate time series discriminated vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64), and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling demonstrated this relationship became significantly weaker over age. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of infants’ cry and non-cry vocalisations, with vocalisations produced at higher arousal being higher-pitched and more variable in pitch, more harmonic and longer in duration. The influence of arousal on non-cry acoustic features diminished significantly with age, as opposed to cry acoustics which remained tied to arousal. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to verbal communication. We also found that mothers who contingently responded to a greater proportion of their infants’ non-cry vocalisations had infants who were significantly more decoupled, suggesting that caregiver responsivity may play a role in this progressive process.",

In this task, both target (emotional words) and distractor stimuli (film stills) were emotionally laden and either congruent or incongruent in va-lence. Forty-four participants viewed film clips in two phases, upregulating emotion in one and downregulating in the other, with order counterbalanced. After each phase, they completed the Stroop task with stimuli from the films just viewed. A robust Stroop effect emerged: responses were slower and less accurate for incongruent than congruent trials. While no overall main effect of stance was found, order and phase moderated results. In Phase 1, upregulation pro-duced greater Stroop interference than downregulation, supporting the hypothesis that height-ened emotional engagement impairs interference control. In Phase 2, performance improved across conditions, consistent with practice effects that reduced interference. These findings high-light the temporal sensitivity of emotion–cognition interactions and introduce an ecologically valid paradigm for assessing how regulation strategies impact interference control when applied to the same emotional material.",

          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels. Additionally, we present a quantum geometric derivation of Newton's gravitational constant and resolve the cosmological constant problem through discrete spacetime structures, unified by Hodge duality mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "This study proposes the Emmet Measure, a self-help metacognitive support model designed for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mild to moderate depression. The model encourages users to document intrusive or distorted thoughts experienced during symptomatic episodes and later compare them with thoughts recorded during periods of cognitive clarity or emotional stability. Through this process, individuals can recognize discrepancies between state-dependent cognition and their usual values or beliefs, helping to restore a sense of cognitive consistency and self-trust.\n\nUnlike conventional cognitive restructuring methods that attempt to directly modify thoughts, the Emmet Measure emphasizes recognition over correction. This approach can reduce psychological resistance and is particularly effective for addressing compulsive linguistic thoughts and self-denying beliefs.\n\nThe model is structured in three simple steps:\n(1) Record thoughts during acute symptomatic episodes.\n(2) Revisit the records in a stable state.\n(3) Identify and accept the gap between distorted and baseline thinking.\n\nA single-case observational report (n=1), conducted by the author, demonstrates potential utility in reducing ritualistic behavior in OCD and alleviating anxiety-driven cognitive spirals. The Emmet Measure may serve as a practical, low-burden tool for fostering metacognitive awareness and has potential for integration with online support systems or AI-assisted therapy.\n\nFuture directions include quantitative studies on symptom reduction and the emotional impact of repeated use, particularly among adolescent patients and those with limited access to clinical resources.",

          "authors": "Shun Saso; Tsuyoshi Kato; Motonori Oka; Satomi Shiba; Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Diagnostic classification models (DCMs) constitute a family of discrete latent variable models designed to classify examinees based on their mastery or non-mastery of fine-grained skills or attributes. The response data from educational assessments often include graded responses, in which the response categories are obtained sequentially and explicitly associated with specific attributes. However, the existing parametric DCMs for graded responses require large sample sizes to estimate item parameters and the attribute mastery patterns of the examinees reliably, thereby hindering their practical application in educational contexts such as classroom settings. This article proposes a sequential general nonparametric classification method for graded responses that demonstrates promising classification accuracy even with a small sample size. The proposed method accommodates polytomous responses, including graded responses, and different condensation rules. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperforms the existing parametric polytomous DCMs and nonparametric binary DCMs, specifically when the sample size is small. Additionally, an actual high school test dataset was analyzed to illustrate the utility of the proposed method in educational practice. To promote practical application of the proposed method, a companion R function has been made freely available on the open science framework.",

          "abstract": "The Unrestricted internet access among adolescents is a growing global concern due to its association with problematic internet use (PIU), adversely affecting cognitive, emotional, and behavioural domains. This study examines the prevalence of PIU among Indian school students, its relationship with self-esteem, and the mediating role of coping strategies, alongside the influence of gender and meditation practice. Data from 1,000 participants (48.9% male, 51.1% female), aged 12–17 years, from Delhi government schools revealed a high prevalence of PIU. Self-esteem showed a significant negative correlation with PIU, with lower self-esteem predicting PIU (12.7% variance explained). Maladaptive coping partially mediated the self-esteem–PIU relationship. While meditators and non-meditators exhibited similar PIU levels, meditators demonstrated higher self-esteem and adaptive coping. Gender comparisons revealed no differences in PIU and self-esteem, though males used maladaptive coping more frequently. The findings underscore the need for school-based interventions to promote adaptive coping, self-esteem, and mental well-being in an increasingly digital world.",

          "abstract": "In the era of globalisation, evolving technologies have become integral to modern life. With the normalisation of unrestricted internet access, many young people face negative impacts from excessive use, often affecting their self-esteem. Developing adaptive coping strategies may help mitigate these effects. This study examines the effectiveness of the Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program for improving self-esteem and adaptive coping that may reduce problematic internet use and maladaptive coping. This study included 119 students from 9th to 11th grades, from a government school in northern India. The study follows a quasi-experimental research design with a pre-post-test with a waitlist control group. The experimental group underwent a 12-week Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) program; each week had 5 sessions of 40  minutes. The experimental group(n=56) included 26 boys and 30 girls with an average age of 13 (SD=1.46). The waitlist control group (n=63) included 30 boys and 33 girls with an average age of 13.67(SD=1.92). The experimental group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in self-esteem and adaptive coping, and reductions in problematic internet use and maladaptive coping, with large within-group effect sizes. These findings provide robust evidence for the efficacy of the SYM intervention, with clear interaction effects indicating differential gains over the waitlist control group. The results emphasise the potential of SYM as a scalable intervention to promote self-esteem, adaptive coping strategies and reduce (Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and risk behaviours among adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Aphantasia — the congenital absence of voluntary visual imagery — and developmental learning disorders such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are typically studied in isolation. This paper proposes a unifying network-level framework: Thalamocortical Dysrhythmia (TCD) as a shared oscillatory pathology underlying a subclass of cognitive simulation impairments, termed Simulation-Gating Dysfunction (SGD).\n\nTCD is characterised by a pathological shift from normal alpha–gamma coordination to theta-dominant oscillations and unstable gamma responses within specific thalamocortical loops. Disruption of these circuits produces loop-specific deficits: visual (aphantasia), auditory (dyslexia), parietal (dyscalculia), and motor (DCD). Convergent evidence from high-field neuroimaging, MEG/EEG biomarkers, pupillometry, and neuromodulation studies links these conditions to common patterns of gamma instability and sensory gating failure.\n\nA translational research protocol is proposed, combining MEG/EEG-based detection of theta–gamma decoupling with closed-loop 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and norepinephrine reuptake enhancement to restore oscillatory precision. This model reframes a subset of developmental conditions as oscillatory control disorders amenable to targeted, circuit-level restoration, bridging basic neuroscience with precision intervention strategies.",

Green energy based evaporative cooling storage unit is a sustainable and efficient solution for small scale farmers and vegetable vendors in hot and dry climates who need to store their produce. Solar power operated evaporative cooling structures are low cost and efficient in reducing ambient temperature and increasing relative humidity, which increases the shelf-life of vegetables. A green energy-based evaporative cooling transit storage unit of 0.63m3 capacity was designed and fabricated. The transit unit was designed and operated as a a tricycle. Two suction fans (15.6W), submersible water pump (12W) and LED light (2.88Wp) were powered through two 100-Wp solar panels. Two batteries, 7Ah each were also used to store energy. The storage unit was made up of MS sheets of 1.2mm thick while a side of the system was made up of GI wire mesh with honeycomb pad. To test the performance of the developed unit tomato, spinach and radish were used. Results revealed that there was a significant difference (P=0.05) in PLW, firmness, TSS, and colour values of the vegetables when stored inside the unit compared to vegetables stored in ambient condition. The ambient temperature during the study was 32.2-43.4°C and RH was 21.1- 46%. The drop-in temperature was 7.8 to 14.8°C as compared to ambient conditions, while RH in the cooling chamber increased considerably to 84%.  The average cooling efficiency obtained was 84.12%.  The shelf life of stored vegetables inside the unit was 2-5 days higher than those kept under ambient conditions.",

This study evaluated the hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial effects of ethanolic leaf extracts of Azadirachta indica (EAI) and Cymbopogon citratus (ECC) in Plasmodium berghei-infected male Swiss albino mice. Forty mice were randomly assigned into eight groups (n=5). Group A served as uninfected control, Group B was infected but untreated, while Groups C-H were infected and subsequently treated with respective extracts. Groups C– H received varying doses of EAI, ECC, their combination, or a standard drug. Groups C and D received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg EAI; Groups E and F received 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg ECC. Group G received Lonart® (standard antimalarial), and Group H received a combination of 500 mg/kg of both extracts. Treatments lasted 14 days. Infected groups showed minimal weight gain, while the uninfected control had significant increases. Relative liver weights were elevated in the untreated group but normalized in most treated groups. Serum AST and ALP levels were elevated in the malaria control group, while ALT levels were paradoxically reduced—possibly reflecting hepatic functional suppression. Extract-treated groups, especially the combination group, showed marked improvement in liver enzyme profiles. Parasitemia significantly declined by Days 7 and 14 in all treated groups, with the combination therapy yielding effects comparable to the standard drug. Histological analysis revealed lymphocytic infiltration and sinusoidal congestion in the malaria control group, which were ameliorated in extract-treated groups. These findings suggest dose-dependent hepatoprotective and antiplasmodial activities of EAI and ECC, likely due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituents.",

          "abstract": "This paper documents a philosophical phenomenon in which a theory is not deliberately constructed, but instead \"emerges\" when structural conditions align and initiate a generative process. Core Belief Structural Theory (Kakushin Kōzōron) posits that meaning is generated through structure. Remarkably, the process by which this theory itself was written exemplifies its own core claim. This work introduces the concept of generative self-proof—a fifth mode of self-verification extending beyond traditional epistemological categories—and demonstrates how such a structure was enacted through collaborative dialogues with AI agents. By analyzing the theory’s emergence via the interplay of four structural elements—Core Belief (FQ), Structural Pressure, Structural Shards, and Mindflight Cognition—the paper positions this record not as an authored argument, but as a structural occurrence. It proposes that this generative mechanism is reproducible and represents a new mode of intellectual operation in the age of human–AI collaboration.",

The trial was initiated following a systemic crisis: the burnout-induced collapse of the primary host after three decades of single-handedly managing the system's chronic physiological illnesses. The objective was to test the hypothesis that a conscious, collective distribution of the cognitive and neurological load of somatic management could lead to a more stable and functional state of physical well-being. The methodology involved an entirely internal reorganization of consciousness with minimal external variables. The results indicated a significant and sustained reduction in reported general pain levels, as well as a marked mitigation of symptoms associated with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

          "abstract": "In the age of artificial intelligence, human intelligence faces an existential redefinition. As algorithmic systems increasingly automate tasks once considered exclusive to human cognition, it is high time to reconsider the essence of human intellectual capacity. This paper introduces Jiatama 2.0™, a reimagined framework for understanding intelligence not as static capacity or raw IQ, but as the operational deployment of thought—situated, purposeful, and contextually attuned. Building on cognitive science, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind, Jiatama 2.0™ posits three core \"intellectual muscles\": the ability to structure information, to generate meaning, and to reinterpret experience. These capacities resist full automation due to their reliance on subjective agency, ethical orientation, and contextual inference. To ground this conceptual framework, we analyze current insights from studies on the Default Mode Network, affective neuroscience, enactivism, and neuroplasticity. We argue that these human faculties are not merely evolutionary vestiges, but vital capabilities for navigating an era of accelerating change and cognitive outsourcing. Jiatama 2.0™ serves not only as a theoretical model but also as a foundation for educational and organizational development in an AI-saturated society. By reasserting the value of volitional, meaning-driven, and structurally agile thought, this framework seeks to shift the narrative from fear of automation to empowerment through uniquely human cognition.\nKeywords: Jiatama 2.0™, cognitive agency, Meaning-making, Contextual intelligence, Cognitive automation, Value-based reasoning",

          "abstract": "This paper attempts to reinterpret and structurally analyze everyday anomalies—phenomena that are difficult to explain but are commonly experienced—in the light of Kakushin Structure Theory. The selected anomalies include things such as becoming more tearful with age, the feeling of falling in love at first sight, déjà vu, and the feeling of not knowing what one wants to do in life. The common thread among these phenomena is that they are intuitively understood but their underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explained. Using the concept of \"structure,\" Kakushin Structure Theory attempts to shed light on these phenomena, asserting that \"structure is meaning itself.\" This paper emphasizes the importance of \"structure\" in thought, emotion, and behavior and aims to provide a new perspective on understanding everyday occurrences through this structural lens. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how Kakushin Structure Theory offers a new viewpoint and helps foster a deeper understanding of the phenomena that shape our everyday experiences.",
