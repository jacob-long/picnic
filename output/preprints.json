          "authors": "Gary Charness; Anna Dreber; Daniel Evans; Adam Gill; Severine Toussaert",
          "abstract": "Peer review is central to the lives of researchers. We conduct a survey on improving peer review to which we received responses from over 1,400 economists. The survey is the bedrock of this article, which was written to (i) document the current state of peer review and (ii) investigate concrete steps towards improving it. We offer a snapshot of the recent submission and peer review activity of respondents, detail the difficulties they report facing, and measure their attitudes about various challenges and possible proposals to address them. We hope that this report will provide fertile ground for the development and implementation of practical solutions for improving peer review in economics.",

          "authors": "Agata Czech; Noam Tal-Perry; Becky Ioppolo; Steven Wooding",
          "abstract": "A diverse body of empirical research has produced mixed findings on gender disparities in research funding. Only a few of these studies effectively control for the structural factors of discipline and seniority of applicants. We have conducted the first institution-wide analysis of grant applications using high-resolution administrative data to understand gender-based differences in funding outcomes. We included 18,583 applications submitted between 2015 and 2023 and assessed whether women applied for grants at different rates, requested different amounts, or had different success rates. After adjusting for seniority and disciplinary area, we found no evidence of consistent gender disparities in application rate. Historical gender disparities in application size in favour of men were observed but did not persist. Weak evidence for gender disparities for success rate was observed in favour of women, which disappeared after controlling for application size. However, when examining individual disciplines and seniorities, gender disparities in both directions were observed for rate, size and success. These findings highlight the importance of separating structural and individual factors in understanding funding disparities to allow for effective interventions; the value of institutional administrative data in allowing this type of analysis; and highlight the role of structural (career stage and disciplinary) disparities in the gender disparities seen in scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The teaching of qualitative evidence synthesis (QES) in higher education is crucial for producing comprehensive and rigorous qualitative research. Despite its importance, teaching QES faces challenges such as methodological complexity and a lack of standardized materials. This study explores theoretical perspectives on teaching QES and proposes effective methodologies for higher education.\nMethods: A qualitative evidence synthesis approach was adopted using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) framework. Articles were selected using the SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) tool, which is tailored for qualitative and mixed-methods research. Data were collected through interviews with educators and students and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key themes and patterns.\nResults: Effective teaching strategies for QES include interactive workshops, practical sessions, and the use of real-world examples and case studies. Technology integration, such as qualitative data analysis software and virtual learning environments, enhances learning experiences. Feedback from students highlights the importance of hands-on activities and collaboration. Educators emphasize the need for innovative teaching strategies and continuous professional development.\nDiscussion: Integrating constructivist and experiential learning theories into QES education promotes active engagement and critical thinking. Institutional support and comprehensive curriculum development are essential for successful integration. Continuous training for educators ensures they are equipped to teach QES effectively.\n Conclusion: Teaching QES in higher education presents unique challenges and opportunities. By applying constructivist and experiential learning theories, educators can develop effective strategies that enhance student understanding of QES methodologies. Future research should explore additional strategies for improving QES education and its long-term impacts on students' research skills.",

          "authors": "Review",
          "abstract": "Urbanization in Bafoussam has induced significant demographic shifts, presenting both opportunities and challenges. As the city confronts increasing urban poverty, the concept of livability becomes essential for enhancing residents' quality of life. This paper explores how enhancing urban livability can alleviate the negative impacts of poverty and provides insights into effective strategies for fostering inclusive urban development and empowering marginalized communities in Bafoussam. Specifically, the study: (i) evaluates the current level of urban livability and its relationship with residents' aspirations, (ii) Correlate the Future aspirations of the Bafoussam city dwellers with Livable City Method as a working tool for stakeholders in Bafoussam (iii) formulates a participatory urban planning framework that integrates the perspectives and needs of local stakeholders to facilitate collaborative efforts in improving livability in Bafoussam. Utilizing the Livable City Method (LCM), the study identifies potential obstacles to achieving the city's desired livability standards. The analysis included 156 surveys of urban residents and 5 interviews with key informants, including the Mayors of Bafoussam, the Delegate for Urban Development and Housing, and the Transport Delegate. Key findings emerges that access to clean water, electricity, affordable housing, public transport, markets, waste disposal, health services, education, and safety are the primary needs of Bafoussam's residents. By reviewing the city’s development plan, the study proposes series of interventions, each offering multiple benefits, thereby aligning future aspirations with current operational activities. Additionally, the study assesses the resilience of these interventions against future changes. Consequently, city authorities in Cameroon can leverage the advantages of the LCM model to ensure that development initiatives align with residents' aspirations for improved livability in its cities.",

          "abstract": "The major factor faced by Agricultural activities is water scarcity. Water is very essential in Agricultural activities (plantation), crop acquires water naturally by precipitation and subsurface moisture, when the supply of water is inadequate for crop use, mostly results to irrigation. This present study estimates and compares six various universally accepted models for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0) for Kano situated in the Sahelian climatic zone of Nigeria using measured meteorological parameters of monthly average daily global solar radiation, sunshine hour, wind speed, minimum and maximum temperatures and relative humidity covering a period of thirty one years (1988 – 2018). Four different statistical validation indices of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of correlation (R) were carried out to test the accuracy of the evaluated models. The result indicated that high value of ETo was found in the month of April with 10.0256 mm/day for Kano and a low value was found to be in August with 5.0804 mm/day for Kano. The Blaney – Morin Nigeria model was found more accurate for Kano with RMSE, MBE, MAE and R values as 1.5078 mm/day, -1.4634 mm/day, 1.4634 mm/day and 0.9790 respectively.",

          "authors": "Review",
          "abstract": "Investigation of heavy metals (Zinc) concentration and nutritional value of cow hides (ponmo) consumed in AMAC (Abuja Municipal and Kuje Area Councils was carried out between November 2021 and January 2022. Samples were randomly collected from both Area Councils and prepared for Analysis using Nitric acid digestion and Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). The mean concentration of Zinc (Zn) in AMAC were 0.88 ± 0.35mg/kg and 2.04 ± 0.57mg/kg in Kuje Area Council respectively.  Results showed that the concentration of Zinc (Zn) in cow hide (Ponmo) from AMAC was two times as high as cow hide (Ponmo) from Kuje Area Council. The mean concentration of Zinc (Zn) in cow hide in both Area Councils were two times as high as the Food and Agricultural Organization Standard unit for  Zinc(Zn),  which is 0.03mg/kg -1.0mg/kg. However, potential accumulation may depend on the frequency of consumption or exposure. In contrast to many studies the samples had alot of nutritional value. Proximate analysis showed that the ponmo samples for Kuje had 54% proteinand 34.68% carbohydrate, moisture 5.3%, crude lipid 2.3%, ash 2.7%, fibre 0.82% while ponmo samples for AMAC had 51.4% protein, 36% carbohydrate, 5% moisture, crude lipid 4.3%, ash 2.1% and fibre 1.1% which suggests that Ponmo has some level of nutrient especially rich in protein and carbohydrate and low in fibre content. Cowhides from AMAC and Kuje Area Councils contain significant amount of zinc, which exceeded the standard limit and could pose a potential health risk to consumers depending on the frequency of consumption.  Hence the need for monitoring of this metal concentration to avoid excessive bioaccumulation that could be harmful to health. This study also showed that cowhides is rich in some nutrients especially protein and carbohydrates and can be a substitute for meat protein.",

          "abstract": "This study conducted a fractal analysis of the Indian Affective Picture Database-Revised with three primary objectives: (i) to compute the fractal dimension and Hurst coefficient for full face and segmented facial zones (eyes, nose, lips) to examine emotional differences, (ii) to evaluate whether the baseline condition (neutral expression) exhibits commonality across expressers in terms of fractal metrics, and (iii) to investigate fractal dimension changes across facial regions and compare them at -45 and +45 degree angles for six basic emotions. Findings revealed that fractal changes in the eye region significantly exceeded those in the nose and lip zones, as well as in the full face, highlighting the eyes as the most unpredictable in expressing basic emotions. Notably, individual differences were evident even in neutral expressions. The analysis indicated that although the intensity of anger expression varied among individuals, the Hurst coefficient consistently remained higher during anger than in neutral expressions. Similarly, this trend was observed for surprise, with one exception. Conversely, emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, and disgust displayed greater individual \nvariation. In summary, the results suggest that while the expressions of basic emotions manifest distinctly at +45 degrees— particularly for happiness, anger, and disgust—they do not exhibit \ndistinctive characteristics at -45 degrees.",

          "authors": "Sarah M. Tashjian; George Mildred-Short",
          "abstract": "Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to poor mental health outcomes, yet existing research often oversimplifies ACE impacts by focusing on cumulative risk rather than distinct types of adversity. This limits insights into how specific ACE patterns influence psychopathology. Inquiries into links between ACE exposure and mental health typically focus on a single symptom class, overlooking co-occurring psychopathologies.\nObjective: We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct patterns of ACE exposure and examine associations with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a treatment-seeking adult sample.\nParticipants and Setting: Participants were 514 adults (71% female) aged 18-85 (M=26.25, SD=8.68) seeking psychological treatment. Data were collected at a public clinic using validated self-report measures.\nMethods: LCA identified three classes of ACE exposure: low adversity, maltreatment (emotional/physical abuse and neglect), and household dysfunction (parental mental illness, separation). Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using the DASS-21, PCL-5, and ASRS. Associations between ACE classes and psychopathologies were analyzed using BCH-adjusted models controlling for comorbidities.\nResults: The maltreatment class showed significantly higher depression (B = 3.02, p &lt; .001) and PTSD symptoms (B=11.65, p&lt;.001) than the low adversity class. The household dysfunction class exhibited elevated ADHD symptoms (B=12.09, p&lt;.001) compared to both maltreatment and low adversity classes. No significant differences in anxiety were observed after controlling for comorbidities.\nConclusions: Distinct ACE patterns were linked to specific psychopathology symptoms. Findings highlight the need to move beyond cumulative models to person-centered approaches, which can inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "This paper, presented as a conceptual hypothesis intersecting theology, cosmology, and phenomenology, proposes a radical but increasingly plausible cosmological hypothesis: that our observable universe exists within the interior of a black hole. Drawing from general relativity, quantum field theory, fossil records, and paleomagnetic data, we present converging lines of evidence that challenge the standard cosmological model. We explore the implications of extreme gravitational curvature on entropy, time dilation, biological gigantism, and physical constants. Building on Einstein’s discomfort with singularities and expanding upon modern geometric theories, we suggest that many of the unresolved paradoxes in contemporary physics, from nonlocality to the horizon problem, may be symptoms of living inside a black hole. We introduce the term Unphysics to describe this emerging framework: a physics governed not by linear progression through flat space, but by recursive coherence in curved and compressed spacetime. This is not mysticism. It is a serious proposal rooted in empirical anomalies and theoretical tension. One that may better explain where, and what, the universe actually is.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Safety planning interventions (SPIs) may prevent suicidal behavior among adolescents, but many adolescents in need do not receive an SPI. Self-guided digital SPIs could reach many vulnerable youth, but the quality of adolescents’ self-produced digital safety plans is unknown. Method: In this longitudinal study, we analyzed 180 safety plans created using a novel SPI web-application by adolescents aged 13–18 (53% non-Hispanic white, 61% women) with past-year suicidal thoughts or behaviors. We rated safety plan quality and completeness using a validated scoring system, and participants reported safety plan usage at one-month follow-up. Results: Of all safety plans, 78% were rated as at least “Satisfactory.” Adolescents’ safety plans were mostly complete, with an average completeness score of 15.32 out of 19 (SD = 2.85). Safety plan quality was moderate, with an average quality score of 10.47 out of 18 (SD = 2.02). Safety plan scores did not differ significantly by participant age. At one-month follow-up, 33% of participants reported having used their safety plan. Adolescents whose safety plans were more complete were more likely to use their plan (OR = 1.26, p &lt; .01), but quality and global impression did not predict use. Of those who used their safety plan, 93% said it was at least “somewhat” helpful. Safety plan scores did not predict adolescent-rated plan helpfulness. Conclusions: Adolescents can use self-guided SPIs to create satisfactory safety plans without clinician guidance. Larger-scale testing of such tools is warranted, including to better understand associations between safety plan characteristics and suicide-relevant outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Falsely remembering never-before-seen information can have significant negative consequences during everyday life, and can occur when novel information is semantically or perceptually similar to previously encoded experiences. The aim of the current research was to investigate the extent to which semantic and perceptual false memory are associated with overlapping vs distinct neural processes. To investigate this question, 30 younger adults encoded lists of images and words. At retrieval, participants underwent fMRI scanning and made memory judgments for items seen at encoding (targets) and new items that were perceptually or semantically similar to targets (lures). Consistent with our previous work showing that domain-general cognitive processes predict individual differences in false memory production (West et al., 2025) and consistent with past behavioral and neuroimaging false memory research, false memory activity, irrespective of domain, was associated with overlapping activity within the medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex. At the same time, unique domain-specific activation was observed in frontal (e.g., middle and inferior frontal gyri) and parietal (e.g., superior and inferior parietal lobes) regions for semantic false memory and in frontal (e.g., middle and inferior frontal gyri) and occipital (e.g., middle occipital gyrus) regions for perceptual false memory. Multivariate analyses examining the neural patterns associated with falsely remembered and novel yet related information indicated that semantic and perceptual items were represented as distinct and discriminable within frontoparietal regions commonly active during both semantic and perceptual false memory. Taken together, these results suggest that false memory formation is associated with both domain-general and domain-specific neural processes at retrieval.",

          "abstract": "Computer mediated communication (CMC) such as social media is ubiquitous and essential to modern life, but concerns exist that it can increase polarization. This study examined the effects of medium richness (number of social cues) of messages on affective and opinion polarization. We hypothesized that a lower medium rich message (text) results in individuals developing more polarized views on both the issue and the people involved. Three hundred and fifty-four participants were recruited from CloudResearch’s Connect platform. Participants were surveyed on their gun control attitude, then shown one of four vignettes at random (video or text opposing or supporting gun control). The video conditions showed a White male in their late 20’s describing their opinion on gun control; the text conditions presented the same script but as a forum post. The vignette viewed and participant’s gun attitude determined the two independent variables, medium (video/text) and alignment (aligned/not-aligned). Participants filled out a questionnaire on how well they respected the opinion displayed (opinion confidence) and how much they liked the person in the vignette (likability). Results indicated that participants who viewed an opinion similar to theirs (aligned) reported higher likability and opinion confidence regardless of medium. More importantly, the interaction effect was significant for likability. The difference in likability between the aligned and not-aligned text conditions was significantly greater than the difference between the aligned and not-aligned video conditions. Thus, the text condition was more polarizing and the hypothesis that fewer social cues in communication medium increase polarization is partially supported.",

          "abstract": "Are Republicans more likely to believe in conspiracy theories than Democrats? This question has received considerable attention among researchers, but answering it requires measures of conspiracist belief that function the same among Democrats and Republicans. Unfortunately, evidence of such measurement invariance is scarce. To address this limitation, the current preregistered study (nDemocrats = 351; nRepublicans = 339) tested the invariance of four short-form conspiracist ideation measures—the General Measure of Conspiracism (GMC), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale – 5 (GCB-5), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), and the American Conspiracy Thinking Scale (ACTS)—across the two major US political parties. Given the lack of prior research on the topic, we preregistered the optimistic hypothesis that all four scales would achieve the highest level of invariance (i.e., strict factorial invariance). The GMC was the only measure to reach this level. The GCB-5, CMQ, and ACTS, by contrast, only achieved the third-highest level (i.e., metric invariance), despite the GCB-5 demonstrating the greatest overall fit of the measures tested. Researchers who are interested in comparing levels of conspiracist ideation between Democrats and Republicans may, therefore, be best served by using the GMC.",

Thus far, the literature has focused only on lies to influence the child’s behavior and emotions.

Forty Dutch caregivers with at least one child aged 5-12 years, were interviewed and examples of parent-to-child lies were analyzed. Our analyses derived a new taxonomy of 11 subtypes, including lies intended to maintain the parent’s privacy or to look better as a parent. Lies were either triggered by caregivers’ state of mind (e.g., feeling overwhelmed), or related to internalized parenting convictions (e.g., I must protect my child). The new taxonomy allows future quantitative and qualitative studies to study the correlates and outcomes of different types of parental lies.",

          "authors": "İlgüsu Öksüz; Feyza Çorapçı; Yasemin Kisbu",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Building on a recent study that identified five health risk behavior profiles among males and six profiles among female adolescents from 43 European countries, this study aims to explore the youth’s perceived support from family, peers, and teachers in relation to these profiles. Despite the emphasis on adolescent health-risk behaviors and perceived social support systems in previous literature, limited research has examined how these support domains intersect with person-centered patterns of co-occurring health-risk behaviors. \nMethods: Using the most recent data from the 2017/2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey (N = 68,688), this study used the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH) method to assess differences in perceived family, peer, and teacher support across the profiles identified from eleven health-risk behaviors among 15-year-old adolescents based on latent profile analysis (LPA), separately for males and females. \nResults: The results revealed that adolescents in the Low-Risk profile reported the highest family and teacher support. Peer support was highest among males in the Poor Lifestyle–Smoking profile. The lowest support levels across all three domains were observed in the Poor Lifestyle–High Substance Use profile. \nConclusions: These findings demonstrate that social support patterns vary systematically across health-risk profiles, underscoring the importance of tailoring intervention strategies to adolescents’ specific needs. Since each profile represents a unique pattern of perceived support, a one-size-fits-all approach may be insufficient. Instead, prevention efforts that simultaneously strengthen family dynamics, peer and teacher relationships may offer the greatest benefits for adolescents who demonstrate multiple risk behaviors across different areas.\n\nKeywords: health-risk behavior, adolescence, latent profile analysis, social support, protective factors",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have documented that overshadowing weakens when a CS-US trace is inserted, and we have interpreted such effect in terms of differential generalization in trace versus delay procedures, but direct evidence in humans is lacking. Two online experiments investigated whether the weakening of cue-outcome temporal contiguity impacts generalization gradients. Participants experienced strong temporal contiguity (the offset of a cue coincides with the onset an outcome) or weak temporal contiguity (there is a temporal gap between the offset of a cue and the onset of an outcome) in a continuous predictive learning task. Initial training involved a double negative discrimination, in which there was one reinforced cue (aqua-color rectangle) and two non-reinforced cues (one greener and one bluer than the reinforced cue), and participants had to make a response whenever they predicted the outcome. After training, in the generalization test phase, outcome expectancy in presence of several stimuli along the full green-blue dimension was tested. Outcome expectancy was assessed with discrete ratings in Experiment 1 (n=252) and a behavioral dependent measure (button presses, similar to the training phase) in Experiment 2 (n=250). Regardless the type of measure, when participants experienced weak cue-outcome temporal contiguity showed a broader generalization response, although differences were more prominent in the green side of the color dimension. Furthermore, no significant differences emerged between two groups experiencing strong temporal contiguity but differing in cue duration (controlling stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA), suggesting that cue-outcome temporal contiguity plays a more critical role than cue duration in shaping generalization. Overall, this result advances our understanding of the role of temporal contiguity at a basic level, while opening the possibility to study it as a critical factor in more applied settings.",

          "abstract": "When trying to make sense of what is going on in the world and their personal lives, people often refer to scientific and religious explanations. Based on pertinent literature, we introduce a novel self-report instrument that captures five types of how people subjectively conceptualize the science-religion relationship. In addition to examining the psychometric properties of the new instrument, we tested whether these five types of conceptualizations are ordered along a single continuum of conflict vs. compatibility. In doing so, we ran and compared two unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models; a generalized partial credit model (GPCM) and a generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM), both in a German (total N = 2,920) and in a U.S. (N = 1,197) sample. We examined model fit statistics to determine the best-fitting model and examined measurement precision at the scale and the item levels. Finally, we tested measurement invariance across countries (i.e., Germany and the United States), as well as the discriminant, convergent, and criterion-related validity of our new instrument. Our results suggest that public perceptions of the relationship between science and religion are best captured by an unfolding response process (i.e. GGUM) and vary systematically across cultural contexts. In addition, U.S. participants perceived higher levels of conflict than their German counterparts. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of science-religion perceptions and provides a validated measure for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is one of the most costly, influential, and wide-reaching research efforts in educational psychology. But are the measures they administer as valid as they should be? As part of its 2022 cycle, PISA included a focus on creative thinking, incorporating questionnaires designed to measure various creativity-related constructs. However, information on the development of these items is limited, and the extent to which these items validly capture their intended constructs has not been systematically evaluated. If these measures lack validity, the field risks interpreting secondary analyses of PISA data that may not be fully psychologically meaningful, leading possibly to incorrect recommendations for educational practice. This problem is addressed by employing a multi-stage expert judgment procedure (involving a total of N = 11 experts) to assess the content validity of 128 creativity-related items selected from an initial pool of 936 items from PISA 2022. After an extensive pilot-phase (Study 1), experts categorized items according to predefined construct and domain definitions, evaluated item quality, and rated construct coverage (Study 2). Findings revealed substantial misalignment between the constructs assigned by the OECD and those identified by the expert panel (average of 37% overlap). The results raise concerns about the interpretability and coherence of existing PISA creativity indices and underscore the need for improved scale specification. This study ultimately offers a detailed item-content map as a ground for revised measurement of creativity-relevant constructs, which are intended to support future analyses grounded in psychologically and educationally valid quantities.",

Previous research has suggested that having access to multiple (scientific and religious) explanations may reduce the perceived utility of each single one of those explanations (the “dilution effect”). In the present study, 719 participants received different numbers of scientific and religious explanations for three incidents. We also measured participants’ religiosity and their perceptions of the relationship between science and religion. Contrary to the dilution effect hypothesis, our data showed that receiving multiple explanations did not reduce the perceived utility of a single explanation. Our analyses further revealed that the utility of religious explanations depended on participants’ religiosity and their perception of the science-religion relationship, but the utility of scientific explanations did not depend on any of these factors. Based on this result, we suggest that scientific and religious explanations are processed differently.",

          "abstract": "Collaborative online projects rely on sequential collaboration; a process in which entries are adjusted consecutively by contributors. Sequential collaboration has recently been examined for numerical judgment aggregation for which it produces highly accurate information. However, the impact of additional information about previous contributors on subsequent judgments remains unclear. Thus, Experiments 1A (N=85), 1B (N=186), and 1C (N=302) examined the effect of presented expertise, gender, and group membership of the previous participant, respectively, on participants' behavior in sequential collaboration. We did not find a significant effect of any of the presented features on change probability or change magnitude. In Experiments 2 (N=538) and 3 (N=878), we focused on previous participants' expertise as a highly relevant presented feature. We did not find an effect of previous participants' expertise in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 revealed significant but small effects below the smallest effect size of interest. Overall, these findings suggest that sequential collaboration shows some robustness against simple social influences highlighting its potential as a method for judgment aggregation. This study adds to the understanding of how collaborative processes can be optimized for accuracy and reliability. For collaborative projects these results further emphasize that sequential collaboration is a successful and bias-preventing way of collaboration.",

Because the widely-used approach of treating MI as a binary decision does not enable inferences about the practical implications of non-invariance, effect sizes for MI – most notably dMACS – were proposed. So far, such effect sizes have only been defined for models with simple structure, which consequently limits their applicability. In this paper, we extend dMACS and subsequent effect sizes of measurement non-equivalence to general factor analytic models, rendering them universally applicable.

          "abstract": "In perceptual decision-making tasks, humans integrate noisy sensory evidence over time to guide their choices. The optimal integration process assumes that all evidence is weighted equally within a trial and that different trials are independent. However, humans exhibit systematic deviations from optimality, including uneven weighting of evidence within trials and influences from previous trials. Prior studies have demonstrated that biological constraints can account for this suboptimality. In this study, we present evidence that humans adapt their evidence integration strategies over time in response to task demands, and that the suboptimal uneven weighting is gradually learned over the course of the task. By explicitly modeling this adaptation through online gradient-based learning, our model outperforms existing approaches in capturing human behavior and unifies both observed forms of suboptimality in the Click task: dependence across trials emerges from an error-driven learning process that also gives rise to uneven integration weights within trials. We further propose a bounded-rational adaptation account to explain why humans progressively learn to weight evidence unevenly within a trial.\n\nOur modeling framework provides a general approach of resource-rational adaptation. It captures how initially uninformed agents can gradually update their strategies through error-driven learning and is applicable to a broad range of learning and decision-making scenarios.",

The present study tests the capacity of cognitive models to assess latent motives in real-time by evaluating different deep neural networks trained to infer a human player's intent during a continuous control task. These networks were trained by (a) directly using observable information or (b) selecting important features by estimating the parameters of a generative model of movement behavior inspired by approach-avoidance theory. Comparisons of classifier accuracy suggest that latent model parameters predict a participant's intent at a level exceeding human performance. Furthermore, classifier performance was best when model-based inferences were combined with summary statistics about behavior, yielding faster and more stable network training compared to networks that had no manual feature extraction.

          "abstract": "Simulation accounts posit that speech is covertly imitated to support perception in a top-down manner. Behaviourally, covert imitation can be measured through the stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) task. In a speech SRC task, participants produce a target speech syllable whilst perceiving a speech distractor that either matches the target (compatible condition) or does not (incompatible condition). The degree to which the distractor is covertly imitated is captured by the automatic imitation effect, computed as the difference in response times (RTs) between compatible and incompatible trials. Simulation accounts disagree on whether covert imitation is enhanced when speech perception is more challenging or instead when the speech is familiar. To dissociate between these two accounts, we conducted two experiments, one behavioural and one using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), in which participants completed SRC tasks with native and non-native contrasts. In Experiment 1, participants performed an SRC task with two native and two non-native contrasts, received perception training with the non-native contrasts, and performed the SRC task again. Results showed that non-native distractors were linked to higher automatic imitation than the native distractors before and after the training, but that the automatic imitation effect for the non-native distractors decreased more after training. Experiment 2 demonstrated that speech primary motor cortex showed higher excitability during passive perception of non-native compared to native contrasts but showed no correlation with automatic imitation. Our results highlight that speech motor cortex acts as an adaptive reflexive gain control mechanism.",

Across two preregistered experiments, adult participants saw simple grid-world environments in which characters moved in a “C” path efficiently (or not) to an object (or not). These events were labeled with a novel verb or noun. Participants were asked whether that word applied to new events varying in object-directedness, path, and efficiency. By contrast to infants’ focus on efficiency, adults instead focused on object-directedness and path, and they did so similarly for both verbs and nouns. Language might thus build on universal, prelinguistic assumptions of goal-directedness and efficiency to specify what goal an agent might have (e.g., object- vs. location-directed) as well as how an agent might achieve that goal (e.g., this vs. that kind of path), ultimately restricting the hypothesis space for action understanding and supporting learning.",

          "authors": "Zishan Jiwani; Qiang Xie; John Joseph Curtin; Kevin M Riordan; Robbie Babins-Wagner; Derek Caperton; Mindi Thompson; Simon Goldberg",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Employment status, an essential socioeconomic factor, may be an important driver of disparities in mental health and access to treatment. However, prior research has been inconclusive and utilized broad employment categories. The present study investigated the associations between various types of employment status and baseline symptomology, psychotherapy engagement, and psychotherapy outcomes. Method: We examined 27,258 patients (mean age = 32.54; 62.9% female; 75.8% White) who attended 115,936 psychotherapy sessions at a Canadian mental health agency between January 2014 and July 2022. Employment status was categorized into nine distinct groups (e.g., full-time, part-time, unemployed and looking for work, unemployed not looking for work, and retirement). Multilevel models examined the association between employment status and baseline symptoms, psychotherapy engagement (e.g., total sessions, early termination), and outcomes (e.g., symptom change). Results: Patients who were unemployed (both looking for and not looking for work) reported higher baseline symptoms and increased odds of suicide concern compared to patients with full-time employment. Contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, patients who were unemployed attended more sessions and showed no significant differences in symptom change or trajectory of change compared to those employed full-time. Retirement was linked to lower baseline symptomology, and both retirement and full-time student status were associated with slower trajectories of change relative to full-time employment. Conclusion: Findings suggest that unemployment is associated with worse baseline mental health but does not hinder psychotherapy engagement and effectiveness. Ensuring accessibility of psychotherapy for unemployed individuals is crucial, given their heightened risk of psychological distress.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known algorithm used to assess the similarity between signals of varying lengths. Initially developed for automatic speech recognition, DTW has found applications in psycholinguistics, particularly in analyzing gesture form similarity. An open question in this domain is how effectively DTW captures gesture form similarity. Here, we validate DTW against human annotations of gesture form similarity across two multimodal interaction corpora and explore its utility as an automatic, continuous measure of gesture form similarity. Our findings reveal weak to moderate correlations between DTW distance and the number of gesture features---such as hand shape, movement, orientation, and position---suggesting that DTW serves as a useful proxy for gesture form similarity. Additionally, we highlight the importance of qualitative analysis of raw data and DTW predictions in enhancing DTW's predictive accuracy. Our study offers a rigorous validation of DTW as a measure of gesture form similarity and presents a detailed framework for preprocessing motion tracking data and calculating DTW distance. While none of the methods is perfect, the combination of automatic and manual measures provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and measuring gesture form similarity.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas require individuals to choose between allowing harm to several people or preventing this by actively causing harm to a smaller number of people. These dilemmas have been foundational in studying how people resolve conflicts between competing moral principles, with responses traditionally interpreted as reflecting either “utilitarian” concern for the greater good or “deontological” refusal to enact harm. Existing research relies almost exclusively on hypothetical scenarios. We confronted 794 participants across two studies with real-life consequential dilemmas involving minor but genuine physical harm. Participants decided whether to allow two confederates to receive painful electroshocks or shock a third confederate, and provided motivations for their decisions. Study 1 manipulated physical proximity to potential targets, while Study 2 examined how the gender composition of potential targets influenced decisions. Moreover, each participant faced this choice twice, allowing us to examine how prior outcomes influence subsequent moral decisions.\nResults show that responses to traditional hypothetical dilemmas moderately predict real-life behavior. Physical proximity and target gender had no significant effects on actual choices. When confronting the dilemma a second time, approximately one-third of participants switched their decision, primarily to distribute harm equitably across potential targets. Analysis of participants' motivations reveals a diverse spectrum of moral considerations beyond utilitarian-deontological frameworks, including fairness concerns, responsibility avoidance, and beliefs about shared versus individual suffering. Our findings invite scholars to expand current theoretical models to better capture the nuanced ways people approach sacrificial trade-offs in consequential, real-world situations.",

          "authors": "Thomas DW Wilcockson; Melody Pattison; Ahmet Begde",
          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

Cognitive warfare (CW) has been proposed as the most advanced form to-date of manipulation of behaviour at mass scale to obtain strategic advantage. Instead of the corpse-ridden battlefields of kinetic warfare, the theatre of operations of CW is the human mind, and therein operations are realised on the  fields of perception, emotion and memory. The goal is not termination but permanent control and exploitation. This opinion article reviews methods of CW focused on the human factors that may be manipulated not to merely control what populations think but how they think and thus how they act. It is argued that the weaponisation of sciences of brain and behaviour, combined with a distributed-computing technological milieu, can be utilised in CW to  fine-tune societal and subject-level factors rendering not only all opposition infertile, but the very fact of being oppressed desirable.",

          "authors": "MaRSS Lab; John Kitchener Sakaluk; Omar Jordan Camanto",
          "abstract": "Researchers wishing to analyze cross-sectional dyadic data must select a modeling framework to accomplish their statistical goals. Historically, most researchers have chosen dyadic multilevel modeling or dyadic path analysis of observed variables via structural equation modeling (SEM). Here, we advocate for—and provide open-source tools and open-access tutorials to advance—the use of dyadic structural equation modeling with latent variables. We begin with an overview of the subordination of latent variable modeling in dyadic data analysis, review its major value propositions, and discuss key research design considerations. We then introduce a new R package, dySEM, which helps users script a variety of dyadic SEMs with latent variables for model fitting with the lavaan package, and generate reproducible outputs including tables, path diagrams, and supplementary tests and indexes. We outline the typical workflow for deploying dySEM: (1) scraping indicator information, (2) scripting models, (3) fitting with lavaan, and (4) output generation. We also discuss our approach to quality control and inclusivity in dySEM’s development. Three reproducible tutorials follow, illustrating applications to (a) a Correlated Dyadic Factors Model (CDFM), (b) a Multiple Correlated Dyadic Factors Model (M-CDFM), and (c) a Latent Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (L-APIM). Each tutorial includes the formal model, a prototypical path diagram, key research questions or hypotheses, and reproducible code for scripting and outputting. We conclude with a discussion of future development targets for dySEM, and calls for more Monte Carlo guidance for dyadic analyses and support for open-source academic developers.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a revolutionary paradigm for understanding the role of gamma motor neurons (γ-MNs) in attention. Traditionally viewed as mere regulators of proprioceptive sensitivity during movement (α-γ coactivation), we suggest that γ-MNs are, in reality, active directors of a brain-controlled sensory \"pre-amplification\" mechanism. This top-down gamma modulation allows for fine and targeted attentional focus in all its forms: from internal attention (such as bodily awareness and interoception) to external multimodal attention (visual, auditory, tactile, chemical). The classic model of proprioception fails to explain how attention can refine perception in the absence of macroscopic movement. The hypothesis outlined here solves this gap, demonstrating how γ-MNs can make subtle signals salient, derived from basal muscle tone, intrinsic micro-oscillations of the body, or simple motor intention. Through this modulation, muscle spindles become hypersensitive, amplifying proprioceptive feedback and providing a fundamental bodily anchor for the direction and quality of attention. Our approach aligns with theories of predictive control and embodied cognition, while distinguishing itself from and integrating critiques of the premotor theory of attention. While the latter emphasizes the preparation of macroscopic movements (e.g., saccades) for spatial attention, the γ-MN hypothesis proposes a more microscopic and peripheral mechanism that supports attention at a deep level, making the body an active instrument of sensory investigation. This article offers a concrete neurophysiological mechanism for a unified theory of attention as an intrinsically embodied process, suggesting new directions for future research.",

Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. Using a within-subject design in 104 healthy individuals, we investigated and directly compared the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. The study was preregistered in the German Clinical Trials Register (registration number: DRKS00029228). Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Empathy for pain guides moral concern and prosocial behaviour, yet little is known about how it extends across species. This study examined how people perceive and respond to pain in humans, pets, and farmed animals, and how these responses relate to individual psychosocial traits. We developed and validated the Cross-Species Pain Empathy Task (C-SPET), the first image-based tool enabling direct comparison of pain perception and willingness to help across species. A total of 407 undergraduate participants rated perceived pain and support intentions after viewing images of wounded (pain) and non-wounded (no-pain) individuals from each species category. Participants reported greater willingness to help animals than humans, possibly due to perceptions of animals as more vulnerable. Within the animal category, when no pain was visible, farmed animals were perceived as suffering more and received more support than pets. Awareness of the typical living conditions of farmed animals may lead people to infer suffering even in the absence of pain cues. When pain was explicit, pets were perceived as suffering more and received more support than farmed animals. Pain cues may have triggered either emotional closeness toward pets or cognitive dissonance in response to farmed animal suffering, as this challenged participants’ everyday practices such as meat consumption. Canonical correlation analyses revealed two psychosocial profiles linked to pain sensitivity and prosocial intentions. A caring, pro-animal profile was associated with greater support for non-human animals. A second profile, reflecting emotional reactivity, religiosity, and cultural background, was linked to heightened pain sensitivity across species. Species-specific biases were shaped by distinct traits. Favouring animals over humans was associated with pro-animal attitudes, life choices, and lower prejudice, possibly reflecting a strategic moral prioritisation of often neglected groups. Favouring pets over farmed animals was linked to ethnicity, higher meat consumption, political conservatism, and social dominance orientation, suggesting a tendency to maintain traditional roles around animal categories. These findings highlight the psychosocial factors that shape pain empathy and caring behaviour across species.",

In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "abstract": "Neuroscientific and survey studies have pointed to the existence of ´pain-intrusions´ in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), i.e., medically unexplained re-experiencing of peritraumatic pain in the same body regions as during the traumatic event. Previous survey studies in trauma-survivors have assessed pain-intrusions by directly asking about pain as a re-experience of the traumatic event—an approach susceptible to expectancy effects. Here, we systematically assessed peritraumatic pain and current medically unexplained pain (MUP) to explore whether MUP occurs in the same body regions as during the traumatic event. To shed further light on MUP as a re-experiencing symptom, we analyzed the role of PTSD symptoms and established predictors of intrusions. In a pre-registered online study, survivors of psychologically traumatizing events (N=330) reported peritraumatic pain and current MUP intensity and location in 108 predefined body regions, PTSD symptoms, and intrusion predictors. Thirteen percent of participants experienced likely pain-intrusions (i.e., MUP in the same body region as during the traumatic event). Experienced (vs. non-experienced) peritraumatic pain increased the likelihood of MUP in the same body region (odds-ratio=2.94), but not across all regions. Further, peritraumatic pain intensity predicted MUP intensity in the same body region. PTSD symptom severity as well as known intrusion risk factors (e.g., cumulative traumatic experiences, younger age at the earliest traumatic event, peritraumatic distress and dissociation, trait rumination, and trait anxiety sensitivity) predicted pain-intrusion occurrence. Results support the notion that posttraumatic MUP may constitute pain re-experiencing associated with PTSD symptomatology, and that these pain-intrusions share risk factors with other re-experiencing symptoms.",

The AOAC and AOCS methods were used in the analyses and the results compared with Standards provided by Food safety and standards authority of India, Coconut Development Board, Kochi.\n\nResults: The results showed that 50% of the total fermented oil sample had high moisture content than standard and expected to undergo oxidative rancidity. According to the standards, 100% of the oil samples had free fatty acids and acid value within acceptable range indicating no signs of rancidity.\n\nConclusion: There was a significant difference in saponification value, free fatty acid profile and moisture content of Traditional fermented (FWCE) and dry copra balls by continuous processing expellers (TDCE, DMCE) method. The ANOVA (P&lt;0.05) showed that there were significant differences in the MC, FFA, AV of oils produced among the processing centers and that produced in laboratory. The processes involved in all the extraction centers vary and might have accounted for that. The results indicate that the coconut oils produced in both the cases meet the standards however new technologies in processing should be adopted to improve the quality to meet the standards.",

          "abstract": "Salinity intrusion is one of the major environmental issues throughout the world. The spatial variability of salt accumulation through the soil profile was studied at Kalapara Upazila, Patuakhali district, Bangladesh. The soil samples were collected from 30 locations covering six villages: Solimpur, Umidpur, Diaramkhola, Hazipur, Monoharpur and Puranmohipur of Kalapara Upazila, Patuakhali district. From each spot, soil samples were collected from two soil depths (0-5cm and 5-10 cm).The study was therefore consisted (30 locations and 2 soil depths) 60 soil samples. The soils were strongly acidic having mean pH value of 4.11, and 4.83 in 0-5, and 5-10 cm soil depth, respectively. In 0-5 cm soil depth, the EC1:5 values were 5.80 dS/m. The EC1:5 values were drastically reduced to 1.86dS/m in 5-10 cm soil depth. The available P content in 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil depth was 21.3 and 24.1 ppm indicating the less availability of P in the surface soil. Available sulphur content found in 0-5 cm soil depth was 28.5 meq/100 g soil ppm which reduced by 63% in 5-10 cm soil depth. The Na+ content in surface soil was 23.03 meq/100 g soils where as in subsurface soil it was 16.7 meq/100 g soils that indicated Na affects plants growth in the study area. With the increase of soil depth exchangeable K content was gradually decreased. Based on the electrical conductivity and different nutrients Monoharpur, Puranmohipur, Diaramkhola village were found seriously affected by salinity.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are poised to become a ubiquitous feature of our lives, mediating communication, decision-making and information curation across nearly every domain. Within psychiatry and psychology the focus to date has remained largely on bespoke therapeutic applications, sometimes narrowly focused and often diagnostically siloed, rather than on the broader and more pressing reality that individuals with mental illness will increasingly engage in agential interactions with AI systems as a routine part of daily existence. While their capacity to model therapeutic dialogue, provide 24/7 companionship and assist with cognitive support has sparked understandable enthusiasm, recent reports suggest that these same systems may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of psychotic symptoms: so-called ‘AI psychosis’ or ‘ChatGPT psychosis’. Emerging, and rapidly accumulating, evidence indicates that agential AI may mirror, validate or amplify delusional or grandiose content, particularly in users already vulnerable to psychosis, due in part to the models’ design to maximise engagement and affirmation, although notably it is not clear whether these interactions have resulted or can result in the emergence of de novo psychosis in the absence of pre-existing vulnerability. Even if some individuals may benefit from AI interactions, for example where the AI functions as a benign and predictable conversational anchor, there is a growing concern that these agents may also reinforce epistemic instability, blur reality boundaries and disrupt self-regulation. In this paper, we outline both the potential harms and therapeutic possibilities of agential AI for people with psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we propose a framework of AI-integrated care involving personalised instruction protocols, reflective check-ins, digital advance statements and escalation safeguards to support epistemic security in vulnerable users. These tools reframe the AI agent as an epistemic ally (as opposed to ‘only’ a therapist or a friend) which functions as a partner in relapse prevention and cognitive containment. Given the rapid adoption of LLMs across all domains of digital life, these protocols must be urgently trialled and co-designed with service users and clinicians.",

          "abstract": "The breathing rate, phase, and amplitude have been shown to track changes in emotional states such as anxiety and cognitive performance in tasks that involve perception, attention, and short-term memory. It is common practice to characterize breathing by using a block average breathing rate, phase, or amplitude. While these features are useful for measuring the central tendencies of breathing, they do not capture the structure of the patterns of change in its activity over time (i.e., breathing dynamics) whose relationship with affective and cognitive processes remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, we characterized breathing dynamics by a set of measures which capture the breathing signal’s rate and amplitude central tendency, variability, complexity, entropy, and timescales. Then, we conducted a principal components analysis and demonstrated that these metrics capture similar, yet distinct features of the breathing rate and amplitude time series. Next, we showed that breathing dynamics change across rest and task conditions, suggesting they may be sensitive to changes in behavioral states. Finally, using multivariate analyses, we demonstrated that breathing complexity and entropy in the resting state are strongly and positively correlated with anxiety levels, while breathing variability in the task state is strongly and negatively associated with working memory performance. Our findings extend the current understanding of how breathing is associated with affective and cognitive processes by highlighting the key role of dynamics in that relationship",

          "abstract": "Theory-driven computational psychiatry attempts to use cognitive models of computation to understand how mental health problems might relate to (or be caused by) changes in cognitive processes such as learning and decision-making. However, the potential applications and relevance of this approach are contingent on several (often implicit) assumptions, including that computational parameters 1) are recoverable, 2) are reliable over time, 3) reflect conceptually similar processes across different tasks, and 4) relate to symptoms. To illustrate and test these assumptions for a selection of commonly used tasks, we recruited a large online sample of participants (n=548), who completed seven mental health questionnaires and five tasks. A subset of n=115 was re-invited to complete the five tasks 14 days later. For each task, five models (including a null model, or model of no interest) were fit and the winning model was selected through Bayesian model comparison. The parameters from the winning models showed good recovery (mean r=0.853, sd=0.135), and good to excellent levels of test-retest reliability (mean ICC=0.635, sd=0.30). Parameters that were theoretically or mathematically similar to each other were, however, generally not related, with relationships only found within the class of ‘inverse temperature’-like parameters (significant r values ranged from 0.11 to 0.23): indicating that in general, parameters do not generalise across task contexts. Finally, only parameters from two of the five tasks (four-armed bandit and cognitive effort) related to symptoms, and these relationships were weak (maximum absolute r values ~0.10). To conclude, it seems that at least some of the implicit assumptions when advocating for the use of computational models in psychiatry are not met for these popular tasks and computational models. This limits the clinical and translational utility of this approach. Computational psychiatry researchers should carefully assess the assumptions and psychometric properties of their tasks and models as part of their early-phase development to ensure robustness of the field going forward.",

          "authors": "Janna Teigeler; Yannik Stegmann; Matthias Gamer",
          "abstract": "Attentive immobility is a defensive state that prepares organisms for adaptive responses to imminent threats. In humans, it has been associated with a multimodal pattern of heart rate bradycardia, elevated skin conductance, freezing of gaze, and reductions in visuocortical alpha power to enhance perceptual processing and action preparation. However, the extent to which these processes are shaped by threat intensity or rather reflect stereotypic response patterns remains elusive. Here we combined avoidable and inevitable threats with different shock intensities to dissociate threat intensity from action preparation in defensive responding. Forty-eight participants observed naturalistic images while electrocortical activity, heart rate, skin conductance, pupil dilation, and eye movements were recorded. The color and shape of the cue preceding each trial were indicative of the trial type and predicted an inevitable or avoidable high or low-intensity painful stimulation after the picture offset. Results showed stronger gaze centralization in avoidable trials, indicating enhanced action preparation. Skin conductance primarily reflected threat intensity, while heart rate, alpha power reduction, fixation durations, and pupil dilation varied with both threat intensity and action readiness. The interplay between these components suggests a need to move away from the notion of separate systems governing physiological and motor responses under threat. We argue for an integrative framework where defensive responses and motor preparation are driven by motivational relevance, which escalates with perceived imminence, harm potential, and escape possibility. These findings underscore the interconnected nature of affective and motor processes, offering new perspectives on human defensive behavior.",

Because the widely-used approach of treating MI as a binary decision does not enable inferences about the practical implications of non-invariance, effect sizes for MI, most notably dMACS were proposed. So far, such effect sizes have only been defined for models with simple structure, which consequently limits their applicability.

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "abstract": "Sequential collaboration describes an aggregation process intensively researched for numerical judgments which is characterized by a first contributor creating a judgment that is subsequently adjusted or maintained by following contributors. In previous research, participants performing sequential collaboration were only provided with information about the judgment of the person immediately preceding them in a sequential chain. However, in real-world collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Docs projects), more information about the past development of a sequential chain is often accessible or even directly displayed. As a concise piece of such information, we used judgment invariance, that is, the number of times a current judgment remained unchanged in the immediately preceding steps of a sequential chain. We hypothesized that increasing judgment invariance decreases both the probability and the magnitude of participants' judgment changes. Additionally, we hypothesized that the influence would be weakened with increasing expertise of participants. In three preregistered experiments, (G)LMM analyses suggested that increasing judgment invariance decreased the probability and magnitude of judgment changes confirming our hypothesized main effects. Concerning the interaction hypothesis of judgment invariance and expertise, a more ambiguous picture emerged. Experiment 1 was completely consistent with the interaction hypothesis. Experiment 2 supported it concerning the probability but not the magnitude of participants' judgment changes. In Experiment 3, a directionally reversed interaction effect was observed, possibly due to unconscientious participation. We conclude that the insight into the past development of a sequential chain, specifically information on judgment invariance, influences the judgment behavior of contributors in sequential collaborations. In summary, judgment invariance could be established as a substantial influence in sequential collaboration, which comes with practical implications for real-world collaborative projects.",

We evaluated the promises and limitations of this approach via a big team science competition. Twelve teams competed to predict self-reported affective experiences using a multi-modal set of peripheral nervous system measures. Models were trained and tested in multiple ways: with data divided by participants, targeted emotion, inductions, and time. In 100% of tests, teams outperformed baseline models that made random predictions. In 46% of tests, teams also outperformed baseline models that relied on the simple average of ratings from training datasets. More notably, results uncovered a methodological challenge: multiplicative constraints on generalizability. Inferences about the accuracy and theoretical implications of machine learning efforts depended not only on their architecture, but also how they were trained, tested, and evaluated. For example, some teams performed better when tested on observations from the same (vs. different) subjects seen during training. Such results could be interpreted as evidence against claims of universality. However, such conclusions would be premature because other teams exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, results illustrate how big team science can be leveraged to understand the promises and limitations of machine learning methods in affective science and beyond.",

          "authors": "Julia Ayache",
          "abstract": "Technology, especially Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), has penetrated society in an unprecedented way, raising concerns about its impact on human life. While some claim that IT and AI can help humanity flourish, others argue that these technologies, if unregulated, could threaten modern societies by reinforcing social inequalities and undermining freedom and autonomy. Consequently, calls to regulate IT and AI are multiplying. Although often grounded in humanistic and ethical principles, these calls have not yet extended meaningfully beyond academic discourse. This essay argues that such ethical approaches are constrained by temporal, spatial, and intersubjective limitations, what might be called the “physics” of ethics, which hinder their practical implementation. First, temporal constraints stem from the difficulty of forecasting IT and AI development and its societal effects, given (i) a lack of consensus on their impact, (ii) the opacity of AI systems, and (iii) the disruptive nature of innovation processes. Second, spatial constraints concern the erosion of boundaries between public and private life due to IT, which commodifies identity and encourages performative rather than authentic interactions. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult to address IT and AI use without falling into the “tyranny” of transparency, leading to (i) flattened social relations, (ii) diminished trust, and (iii) dehumanization. Third, intersubjective constraints highlight how IT and AI reinforce existing social inequalities, often excluding and exploiting marginalized communities. Therefore, meaningful regulation should embrace alternative standpoints by supporting (i) bottom-up, (ii) community-based, and (iii) participatory design practices. However, while some design approaches such as those found in the Slow Design and Design Justice movements hold promising outcomes, they face resistance due to entrenched systemic forces.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation (ER) forms a key process for managing stress throughout life. To explore age-related differences in ER from early adolescence to young adulthood, a network tree analysis was conducted with 1,041 participants from community based samples in Belgium and The Netherlands (Mage=18.66; SD=4.01; range=12-25; 36.7% boys). Based on The Adaptive Coping with Emotions model, ER skills included Awareness, Identification, Labeling, Understanding, Modification, Acceptance, Tolerance, Readiness to Confront, and Effective Self-Support. Using model-based recursive partitioning, two distinct age groups were identified (12-16 and 17-25 years), indicating different ER patterns across early adolescence and young adulthood. Centrality and clustering of ER skills, and their unique associations were examined across groups. Modification, Identifying &amp; Labeling, and Acceptance &amp; Tolerance were the most influential nodes in both networks. Although the overall network structures were similar, permutation tests showed higher connectivity of ER skills in the 17-25 age group. Moreover, the skill of Awareness was significantly less central in the 12-16 age network compared to that of the 17-25 age network. In line with this, only in the 12-16 age group, a two-dimensional community structure was obtained, clustering Identification &amp; Labeling, Awareness and Understanding (community 1), and Acceptance &amp; Tolerance, Modification, Readiness to Confront, and Effective Self-Support (community 2). This distinction disappeared with increased connectivity in the 17-25 age group. Taken together, the current findings demonstrate that maturation goes hand in hand with higher levels of interconnectivity between ER skills, revealing developmental differences in ER skill connectivity among adolescents and young adults.",

The typical statistical approaches modelling affective inertia as autoregression largely ignore that assessment periods covering several days also include overnight intervals which may bias affective inertia. In this study, we thus aimed to test (1) whether affective inertia differs within-day and overnight and (2) whether within-day and overnight inertia are differentially associated with psychological functioning (e.g., personality, perseverative thoughts, stress). We operationalized within-day inertia as the autoregression of affect from one timepoint to the next during the same day and overnight inertia as the autoregression of affect from the previous night to the next morning. We used data from the ESCAPE project including 254 ethnically and economically diverse participants (25–65 years) who participated in up to three 14-day measurement bursts with five daily beeps. We found significant within-day and overnight affective inertia in positive and negative affect. Overnight inertia substantially exceeded within-day inertia that would be expected for the longer overnight interval, indicating affective inertia differs within-day and overnight. This research highlights the importance to disentangle within-day and overnight intervals when studying affective inertia.",

Cognitive control frameworks distinguish different subcomponents, such as inhibition, updating, shifting, proactive and reactive control. A comprehensive overview of how these subcomponents develop in aging is lacking, with research typically focusing on small samples treated as a homogenous age group, targeting a single subcomponent, or using heterogenous tasks across studies. In the current study, young adults (N=75) and three cohorts of older adults (N=231) completed an extensive test battery assessing multiple subcomponents of cognitive control. Results showed improved response inhibition and interference control in older vs. young adults, decreased updating and shifting with age, and preserved proactive control in older adults. These findings show that changes in cognitive control subcomponents follow different onsets and trajectories, highlighting the importance of including them in cognitive aging research.

          "abstract": "This preprint discusses the continuities and discontinuities between Radical Embodied Cognitive Science (RECS) and Marxism. The guiding hypothesis for this discussion is the assertion that the two programs are philosophically and theoretically compatible as they both attend to the corporeal organisation of living bodies that engage with their environment. Both traditions emphasise the concreteness of lived experience, and both traditions take a starting point in the kinetic impermanence of this experience. RECS, for instance, traces perception to a perceiver moving through the environment (in Gibson’s perceptual psychology) and Marx explicitly evoked Epicurus’s kinetic materialism and the dialectics of change and changeability. Both thus build on a premise of pedesis where the historical development is ‘neither strictly necessary nor strictly random’ (Nail, 2020, p. 13). In RECS, this prompts the researcher to attend to the precarity and overdetermination of behaviour, and in Marxism it emphasises the historicity of the human corporeal organisation, and with that the underdetermination of biology as insufficient as a frame for understanding this corporeal organisation. The discussion is guided by the assumption that the integration of the two traditions can function is an important guide for the development of cognitive ecology, the cognitive science of embodied organism-environment systems.",

          "abstract": "Recent findings show that lexical activation is slower when words are surrounded by other words, as they always are in natural reading. Here we focus on the proposal that this is due to direct interference from adjacent words that are processed in parallel. In three experiments using a flanked masked visual word adaptation of the visual world paradigm with adult skilled readers, we probed the spatial conditions for interference. Target words were flashed at fixation for 75 ms flanked by other words before being masked; we studied gaze shifts to the image (out of four displayed) corresponding to the target. We found that interference increases with proximity and is asymmetric (stronger from the right side). In the third experiment we included an image for one of the flanker words and we obtained direct evidence for lexical activation of the right-side flanker, consistent with parallel models of word recognition. Intriguingly, the strong asymmetry of lexical activation stands in contrast to a much weaker asymmetry in overall interference, indicating that different levels of representation are differentially involved in the online interactions among adjacent words. In all, our findings constitute strong evidence for distributed attention around fixation differentially affecting diverse word processing stages, and call for a reconsideration of word recognition models that posit independent processing of individual words. They also confirm that the masked flanked visual word visual world paradigm is appropriate for studying attentional allocation during reading.",

The answer remains unclear: Some research has found that more confident people are more vulnerable to misinformation and inaccurate beliefs, while other work suggests that more confident judgments are more accurate. Here, we clarify the association between confidence and misinformation detection by measuring both general confidence in one’s abilities and specific confidence in particular judgments. In a large, pre-registered study (N=503) on Lucid where participants judge the accuracy of news posts, we demonstrate both previously discussed patterns simultaneously. While higher general confidence is associated with worse discernment of true versus false headlines, higher confidence in specific judgments is associated with better truth discernment. These results underscore the fundamental difference between general confidence and confidence in specific judgments and offer a unifying framework for understanding the complex relationship between confidence and the ability to tell fact from fiction.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 20th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i.e., perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, despite the fact that their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the foundations of these assump-tions and examines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreasing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Additionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable. More fundamentally, when these assumptions are violated, the TRC becomes underidentified, meaning that multiple, substantively different data-generating process-es can yield the same coefficient, thus undermining its interpretability. These findings call into question the TRC’s suitability for applied settings, especially when traits fluctuate over time or measurement conditions are uncontrolled. Alternative approaches are briefly discussed",

          "abstract": "Across many studies, verbal labels have been shown to significantly affect perceptual and cognitive processes. Here we ask whether verbal labels can also improve visual working memory performance by making objects more recognizable. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to remember visual details of unrecognizable shapes derived from real-world objects. Participants were either provided with category labels prior to stimulus presentation or not. We reasoned that the labels could aid object recognition, which would then help maintain them in working memory based on recent work showing that meaningful, recognizable objects are better remembered than arbitrary visual shapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no reliable increase in visual working memory performance when participants were given verbal labels. This pattern of results persisted across various experimental manipulations, including different methods of distorting the objects, testing label memory, and using within or between-category stimulus sets. Overall, our results indicate that category labels did not readily enhance working memory performance for obfuscated shapes that are difficult to recognize, suggesting that improving visual working memory for meaningful stimuli may depend on how the visual system reorganizes incoming visual information perceptually rather than associating visual inputs with verbal knowledge. Thus, verbal labels do not seem to have as broad and general effects on cognitive functioning as previously assumed.",

The current study addresses this gap by assessing the role of protective factors in the association of neighborhood deprivation, threat, and segregation with psychopathology symptoms and cognitive outcomes. Linear mixed models were run in ABCD sample participants (n=5,812) to test associations of neighborhood Area Deprivation Index (ADI; deprivation), crime (threat), and dissimilarity and interaction index (segregation) with attention difficulties, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), and fluid and crystallized cognitive performance. School environment, neighborhood education child opportunity index, neighborhood cohesion, and green space were tested as moderators of the association of neighborhood adversity with outcomes. Higher neighborhood educational resources buffered the association of neighborhood deprivation with crystallized cognitive performance. The association of higher neighborhood crime with externalizing symptoms was weaker for youth in less supportive school environments. Further, higher neighborhood segregation was associated with internalizing symptoms more strongly for youth with more neighborhood educational resources. Taken together, results suggest adverse neighborhood environments are associated with higher psychopathology symptoms and lower cognitive performance. Access of neighborhood educational resources could buffer links of neighborhood deprivation and cognitive performance. While evidence of protective links was not widespread, studying these patterns is necessary for understanding possible environmental contributors to mental health and cognitive function.",

This paper builds on recent efforts to focus on predictive differences between measurement models in an attempt to examine the degree to which such approaches—which utilize quite distinctive notions regarding the nature of ability—produce different predictions of response behavior in the real-world. We first present two simulation studies in which data are generated from variants of CDMs that differ in sample size, attribute hierarchical structures, and attribute estimation methods. We illustrate that, as we would expect given that they were used to generate data, CDM-based predictions uniformly outperform those of IRT models. We then compare the performance of CDM- and IRT-based approaches across nine empirical datasets previously analyzed using CDMs. Our findings indicate that overfitting is a pervasive issue across CDM-based predictions, particularly with the G-DINA model. Furthermore, only five out of nine datasets show improved model fit for CDMs over the 2PL model when using the marginal mastery probabilities estimator, and none show superior performance when using the maximum a posteriori estimator. Researchers and practitioners may need to balance the diagnostic appeal of CDMs with the fact that their complexity can come at the cost of predictive accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if, in turn, it prompts perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency, but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

Researchers need to report information on student demographics to facilitate this applicability assessment. This study examined which student demographics are reported in school-based depression prevention intervention trials. We identified all measures used to assess student demographics in 71 depression prevention trials. We organized these measures into eight demographic domains from the PROGRESS framework. We found that nearly all trials reported baseline demographic data in at least one domain—though no studies reported baseline data for every domain. In addition, data reported within domains reflected multiple demographics using different measures. Findings raise concerns about the ability of school personnel to comprehensively assess applicability of this evidence to their student populations. A “core baseline set” could establish fieldwide norms on what and how to measure student demographics, making school psychology research more useful to educators by providing comprehensive information for assessing applicability of the evidence.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning methods have recently begun to be used for fitting and comparing cognitive models, yet they have mainly focused on methods for dealing with models that lack tractable likelihoods. Evaluating how these approaches compare to traditional likelihood-based methods is critical to understanding the utility of machine learning for modeling and determining what role it might play in the development of new models and theories. In this paper, we systematically benchmark neural network approaches against likelihood-based approaches to model fitting and comparison, focusing on intertemporal choice modeling as an illustrative application. By applying each approach to intertemporal choice data from participants with substance use problems, we show that there is a high degree of convergence between neural network and Bayesian methods when it comes to making inferences about latent processes and real outcomes. For model comparison, however, classification networks significantly outperformed likelihood-based metrics. Next, we extended neural networks in two ways, using recurrent layers to allow them to fit data with variable stimuli and numbers of trials, and using dropout layers to allow for posterior sampling. We ultimately suggest that neural networks are better suited to fast parameter estimation, posterior sampling, large data sets, and model comparison, while hierarchical Bayesian methods should be preferred for flexible applications across different experimental designs.",

People often say “I’m just joking” to mean “Don’t take my words or actions literally.” To date, little is known about the role of authenticity in humor appreciation. To explore this question, we used audio recordings of comedic stories told by standup comedians (Experiments 1-3), text-only comedic stories (Experiment 4), and text-only observational jokes (Experiment 5) as comedic materials. We manipulated perceptions of authenticity by alleging the comedian prioritizes authentic self-expression (vs. pleasing their audience) (Experiment 1), performs because they love performing (vs. for fame and money) (Experiment 2), tells jokes that are based on real, personal (vs. fictional, imagined) experiences (Experiment 3), or wrote their own jokes (vs. used another human writer or AI) (Experiments 4-5). Across all studies, people evaluated the allegedly authentic jokes as funnier and expressed greater interest in following or sharing the comedian’s work.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms by considering a probability variable that can reproduce the phenomenon of a sudden negative value from a positive value. As a result, we found that depressive symptoms themselves occur according to a normal distribution or Gaussian process. Even if the mental state suddenly becomes negative, it is found to settle down to a positive or negative mean mental state due to the law of large numbers in the case of a normal distribution, and due to regression to the mean in the case of a Gaussian process. From this, we also discussed how to cope with depressive symptoms. Finally, we discussed connections with similarity curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The emergency medical service profession needs resilience interventions that address clinicians’ mental health risk. This study performed a randomized controlled pilot trial examining 1) feasibility, acceptability, and adoptability of a novel digital intervention: Self-Reflection Resilience-Recovery Activity Promotion Training; 2) the intervention’s effect on hypothesized mechanisms of action (HMAs: meaning made from stressors, adaptive self-reflection, recovery activities, recovery experiences); and 3) the intervention’s impact on mental health outcomes (MHOs: PTSD, anxiety, depression symptoms).\nMethods: Eligible participants were ≥18 years with ≥1 EMS shift scheduled in the next 8 days. Recruitment took 6 months; 83/126 workers were eligible and randomized to intervention (n = 37) or control groups (n = 46). Most were White (89%) and male (51%). Both groups completed 8 daily assessments on mobile devices/computers that monitored the HMAs/MHOs. Intervention respondents received 10 additional open-ended questions prompting reflection about stressors encountered, lessons learned, and recovery strategies. We used Welch’s t-tests and Fisher’s exact tests for the feasibility analyses, summary measures for the acceptability and adoptability analyses, and multilevel models for the HMA/MHO analyses. \nResults: We recruited over 80% of respondents within the first 3 weeks; 70/83 respondents submitted ≥1 complete daily assessment (M = 6.07, SD = 2.20); the intervention was rated helpful, useful, not burdensome, and likely to be used in the future. The intervention group reported more meaning made relative to the control group across all assessments (b = 1.46, 95%CI = 0.17, 2.75, p = .027) and higher levels of meaning made on each subsequent assessment (b = 0.35, 95%CI = 0.16, 0.53, p &lt; .001). These effects varied by intervention fidelity. Respondents demonstrating greater adherence reported more meaning made across all assessments (b = 1.53, 95%CI = 0.03, 1.02, p = .039), and higher levels on each subsequent assessment (b = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.20, p &lt; .001). No statistically significant differences were detected on the other HMAs and MHOs\nConclusion: While results support the intervention’s feasibility, acceptability, and adoptability, some refinement to the intervention’s content and procedures is necessary to detect expected differences on all HMAs and MHOs before conducting a definitive trial.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

Los resultados indicaron que el desempeño en pruebas inmediatas y demoradas es superior en tareas con bajo nivel de interactividad de elemento que las tareas con alta interactividad de elemento. También se halló que las tareas ejemplo-problema son mejores que ejemplo-ejemplo en la prueba demorada.

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened emotionality. Past research indicated that the biased interpretation of social situations (i.e., interpretation bias) might contribute to these aberrant affect dynamics in adolescents’ daily life. Social situations are, however, constantly changing. Therefore, the ability to flexibly revise social interpretations (i.e., interpretation flexibility) might be equally important as interpretation biases for explaining affective outcomes during adolescence. The present study examined whether interpretation bias and inflexibility predicted two major affect dynamics features (i.e., mean and standard deviation) in children and adolescents. At baseline, N = 154 children and adolescents (M = 12.81 years; 48.70% female; 49.35% male; 1.95% non-binary; 72.08% White) completed a task assessing bias and inflexibility in interpreting social situations. Then, for 28 days, participants rated their positive and negative affect. Results showed that inflexibility in revising positive and negative interpretations in light of disconfirming evidence predicted higher intensity of negative affect. When controlling for interpretation inflexibility, positive interpretation bias predicted higher positive affect, whereas negative interpretation bias was associated with more variable negative affect. The results emphasize the predictive utility of interpretation biases and inflexibility for daily affective experiences in youths.",

In Studies 1 and 2, participants explicitly identified interracial couples as being attributed deviant sexual stereotypes, and Study 3 completed the experimental causal chain by demonstrating that couples who are described with these deviant sexual stereotypes elicit disgust.  Study 4 provided evidence that perceiving interracial relationships to be based on sexual fetishes statistically mediates the relation between interracial couples and disgust.  Taken together, these findings indicate that interracial couples are stereotyped as sexually deviant, and that thinking of couples in terms of such deviant sexual stereotypes can produce a disgust response.",

Participants viewed a paragraph of nonsensical Latin text and rated how much beauty they felt from the letters.

In the ordinary reading task, participants rated comfort after reading a short story. In the RSVP task, participants read 40 words of a different short story, each word presented for 500 ms (120 words per minute), and again rated comfort. The first task maintains ecological validity, and the second eliminates reading speed as a confound. We found that the two comfort ratings are strongly correlated (R2 = 0.88), and comfort predicts beauty (R2 = 0.96). Beauty and comfort together revealed three distinct font clusters, which were not distinct using either measure alone. These clusters correspond to standard typographic categories: text, script, and display. Indeed, font category predicted ratings of beauty and comfort. However, within text fonts, beauty and comfort ratings did not distinguish between serif and sans serif. We also found striking individual differences. Beauty and comfort were positively correlated for most participants, but strongly negatively correlated for others. A participant’s beauty-comfort correlation is predicted by their preference for minimalist style and by the difference in their ratings across font categories (R2 = 0.60). We show how form and function, two aspects of product design often considered separate, are closely interconnected for fonts.",

          "abstract": "The climate crisis requires urgent societal transformation, yet dominant discourses of climate delay hinder effective action by portraying systemic change as unfeasible or unnecessary. Drawing on discourse theory, we propose a novel theoretical account centered on collective prospection —the shared ability to imagine possible societal futures. We posit that societal crises create a window for change by eroding the legitimacy of the status quo and traditional discourses. Adopting a psychological interindividual-differences perspective, we argue that dystopian thinking and utopian thinking are two psychological processes jointly contributing to societal change motivation. We describe three elements of dystopian thinking (dystopian hopelessness, dystopian worries, apocalyptic wish). Dystopian thinking may express people’s worries about undesirable futures and wishes for a new societal beginning possibly inducing deconstructive processes in people regarding their internalized status quo beliefs. In turn, utopian thinking serves a reconstructive function, viewing societal crises as a window of opportunity to re-negotiate societal rules and build collective hope for a positive future alternative. These processes may synergistically fuel discourses of transformation – a conceptual counterpart challenging climate delay discourses and expanding our collective imagination towards the possibility of reaching a social-ecologically just future. We propose five recommendations for future research on collective prospection.",

Participants completed a fun and engaging object foraging task, requiring discrimination of target objects from distractors. We used human ratings as well as activation patterns from a neural network to quantify the visual and semantic information available for object discrimination. In line with our preregistered hypotheses (https://osf.io/84wxp), older children relied more on semantic and high-level visual information than younger children. Also as predicted, they tuned into the visual cues most diagnostic for the task—shape for basic-level distinctions (e.g., brush vs. pipe) and features for subordinate-level distinctions (e.g., two different bowties). Critically, an exploratory representational similarity analysis (RSA) nonetheless revealed remarkably similar underlying object representations across all age groups, suggesting that developmental changes in object perception are primarily quantitative rather than qualitative. These findings suggest that children's improved object discrimination abilities reflect increased access to relevant visual and semantic information.

          "abstract": "While the rise of AI-assisted voice technology that can clone or augment a speaker’s voice offers many positive applications, it also poses risks for cybersecurity, fraud, and manipulation as natural and AI-augmented speech become harder to distinguish. Kirk (2025) recently found that listeners showed a general bias toward classifying voices as human. However, this bias was particularly strong when the voices spoke the Dundonian Scots dialect, which likely stems from a prior belief that AI cannot convincingly replicate local or non-standard varieties. Consequently, listeners may be more inclined to believe that AI voices using these dialects are real human speakers, leaving some language communities disproportionately vulnerable to deception.  The current manuscript reports two experiments (total N = 300) using the same classification task preceded with brief informational nudges about AI. The first revealed that informing participants that AI could authentically produce regional Scottish varieties cut the bias for responding “human” in half, compared to a control (no information) condition. A second experiment demonstrated no effect of a vigilance-based nudge (that warned about the real-world consequences of misidentifying AI voices) on reducing this “human” response bias. These findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidance for addressing biases in AI voice perception.",

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status is thought to be a combination of education, income, and occupational prestige. At extremes, it may be easy to determine high or low SES, but the reality is much more nuanced as people with advanced degrees can earn much less than people with lesser education, such as a therapist with a master’s degree making $50,000/year and a nuclear power reactor operator with a general equivalency diploma making $100,000/year. A total of 284 participants were recruited via Prolific and by direct invitation from a curated list of published authors on topics in SES. A conjoint design was used to compare randomized side-by-side combinations of the three indicators, participants were asked to decide which person had the higher SES. Here we show, as predicted, income held the most weight for lay and expert participants, followed by education and then occupational prestige. We found that all academic participants, not just economists, favored income the most and academics valued education significantly more than non-academics. No differences were noted in the prioritization of income between academic and non-academic participants and no evidence was found that people tend to favor the SES traits they hold. Income is by far the most important predictor of someone’s SES, once experimentally divorced from education level and occupational prestige. We argue future research should either measures SES only using income, or a weighting scheme where 75% of a formative indicator is taken up by income, 20% by education levels, and 5% by occupational prestige. Theoretical implications for measurement, cross-cultural psychology, and the theoretical status of SES are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Coherent speech remains focused on the topic at hand, avoiding irrelevant or tangential comments. Discourse coherence often declines with age and this has been linked to declines in cognitive control processes that regulate activation of knowledge and ideas. The present study tested whether external topic reminders could improve coherence by reducing reliance on internal control processes.\nMethods: 77 young and older adults produced spoken discourse in response to topic prompts. In the baseline condition, the topic prompt was removed when the participant began speaking. This was compared with conditions where a reminder was presented on screen, either throughout their response or only during the last 30 seconds.\nResults: Both age groups produced more coherent, topic-focused responses when they had access to a topic reminder. Late reminders had an additional proactive impact on participants’ speech, increasing its coherence even before the reminder appeared. This proactive effect was short-lived in the older group but more sustained in the young group.\nDiscussion: When speaking, people must maintain the current discourse goal (i.e., intended topic), in order to prioritise relevant information and inhibit irrelevant ideas. Topic reminders boost activation of the discourse goal, reducing the need to maintain this through internal control. Furthermore, people proactively strengthened goal activation when they anticipated a later reminder, but older people were less effective at maintaining this throughout their response. Together, these results suggest that internal maintenance of discourse goals is less effective in older people, though they do benefit from external cues that support topic maintenance.",

          "authors": "Mariana Von Mohr; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "Where does political ideology come from? Early research in political neuroscience has linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, implying a neurobiological basis of ideology, beyond societal factors. However, recent replication failures challenge the idea of a direct connection between physiological reactions and political attitudes. Given the role of interoception in body-awareness and emotional regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their internal bodily states). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we show that when people have higher interoceptive sensibility, their political ideology is not driven by their disgust sensitivity. It is only when interoceptive sensibility is low that disgust sensitivity plays a significant role in political ideology: higher disgust sensitivity increases the likelihood of identifying as Republican, while lower disgust increases the likelihood of being Democrat. We propose that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility rely more on physiological signals to process emotions like disgust. As a result, their ideological differences are less shaped by internalized cultural beliefs about what is disgusting and instead reflect their actual physiological experience. In contrast, those with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations, relying more on ‘social priors’ to interpret their physiological states. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political cognition, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political ideology, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

          "abstract": "Digital behavioral activation (BA) is scalable, accessible, and efficacious for depression. However, some individuals do not improve during digital BA, and identifying non-responders early is critical for facilitating adaptive intervention approaches (e.g., stepped care). To explore whether passive sensing data might serve as early predictors of symptom change, we tested whether early changes in passively sensed behavioral targets of BA predicted depression symptom changes during app-based BA. Young adults (N = 47) with elevated depressive symptoms completed a 12-week trial of an app-based BA intervention, Vira. The Vira app provided BA psychoeducation, assessed self-reported daily mood, and used smartphone sensors to passively assess time spent at home (i.e., homestay), walking, stationary time, time in bed, bedtime, and waketime each day. We quantified early behavioral changes by fitting a multilevel growth model for each behavior over the first 2 weeks of the intervention. Models included a random slope reflecting each participant's average day-to-day change in that behavior. We extracted these slope estimates and tested whether they predicted depressive symptom (PHQ-8) change from pre-to post-intervention. We hypothesized that individuals with greater early changes in intervention-targeted behaviors would experience greater reductions in depressive symptoms. As hypothesized, individuals with greater early decreases in passively sensed homestay (i.e., reduced behavioral withdrawal) experienced a greater reduction in depressive symptoms by the end of treatment (b = 0.94, p = .025). Early changes in other behaviors did not significantly predict depressive symptom change (ps &gt; .158). Passively monitoring early changes in homestay during app-based BA may support the early identification of individuals at risk of symptom persistence, thus providing earlier opportunities to adjust treatment.",

          "abstract": "Language mixing is a common feature of bilingual communication, yet its predictors and effects on children’s vocabulary development remain debated. Most research has been conducted in contexts with clear societal and heritage languages, leaving open questions about language mixing in environments with two societal languages. Montreal provides a unique opportunity to examine this question, as both French and English hold societal status, while many families also maintain heritage languages. Using archival data from 398 bilingual children (7–34 months), we looked at French-English bilinguals (representing societal bilingualism) and heritage-language bilinguals within the same sociolinguistic environment. We assessed the prevalence, predictors, and motivations of parental language mixing, and its relationship with vocabulary development. Results revealed that mixing was less frequent among French-English bilinguals compared to heritage-language bilinguals and bilinguals in other communities. The direction of mixing differed between groups: French-English bilinguals mixed based on language dominance, while heritage-language bilinguals mixed based on societal language status. Primary motivations included uncertainty about word meanings, lack of suitable translations, and teaching new words. Mixing showed minimal associations with vocabulary size across participants. These findings suggest that parental mixing practices reflect adaptive strategies that vary by sociolinguistic context rather than detrimental influences on early language acquisition.",

However, no research studied whether such cycles exist and how they look like in multiple eating disorders (EDs). We therefore explored networks of prospective relationships between negative and positive emotions and transdiagnostic eating-related behaviors (hunger, food craving, and calorie intake) across EDs. Method: These variables were assessed six times a day for eight days in women with restrictive (AN-R, N=29) and binge-purge (AN-BP, N=26) Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa (BN, N=42), and Binge-Eating Disorder (BED, N=37). Prospective relationships were analyzed with modified vector-autoregressive networks. Results: Every group showed negative affect following calorie intake; this was predicted to be especially intense in BN and especially long-lasting in AN-BP. AN-R further showed ‘positive emotional eating’, with happiness predicting desire-to-eat at the next timepoint and thereby subsequent eating. BED further showed ‘negative emotional eating’, with worry predicting hunger and desire-to-eat, and irritation predicting calorie intake. AN-R and BN showed ‘bored eating’, while AN-BP showed no emotional eating. We also observed affect-mediated pathways for restriction: in AN-R, depressed mood predicted reduced hunger and desire-to-eat; in AN-BP and BN, hunger predicted reduced negative affect; and in all three groups, there were restriction- or hunger-promoting feedback loops mediated by emotion. Discussion: Substantial post-eating dysphoria was present in all EDs. Restriction-promoting feedback loops were present in AN-R, AN-BP, and BN, while BED only showed negative emotional eating.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS), the temporal alignment of brain activities\nbetween individuals, has been proposed as a biomarker for successful communication and smooth social interaction. Surging empirical evidence shows that INS emerges spontaneously between infants, children, and their caregivers from early on in development. Yet, little is known about the developmental preconditions and functions of INS in childhood. This paper presents a developmental framework for understanding INS, integrating insights from structural and functional brain maturation, as well as behavioral, social, and cognitive development. We discuss how early caregiver-infant interactions, characterized by shared perceptual rhythms, facilitate the emergence of INS. Given initial limitations in temporal precision of neural processing, early INS is likely constrained to low-frequency brain rhythms and evolves alongside the maturation of neural networks and socio-cognitive abilities. We outline how INS may support critical developmental processes, including social learning, language acquisition, and attachment formation, through enabling mutual prediction and co-regulation between caregivers and children. Furthermore, we hypothesize that tasks requiring higher-order mutual understanding are linked to qualitative changes in INS patterns over time. This framework highlights the potential of INS as both a marker and a driver of developmental change, offering new avenues for research and intervention. Longitudinal studies and rhythm-based interventions could deepen our understanding of how INS supports development, with implications for enhancing social learning and attachment in populations at risk for developmental challenges. This work underscores the importance of adopting a developmental perspective in INS research.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms by considering a probability variable that can reproduce the phenomenon of a sudden negative value from a positive value. As a result, we found that depressive symptoms themselves occur according to a normal distribution or Gaussian process. Even if the mental state suddenly becomes negative, it is found to settle down to a positive or negative mean mental state due to the law of large numbers in the case of a normal distribution, and due to regression to the mean in the case of a Gaussian process. From this, we also discussed how to cope with depressive symptoms. Finally, we discussed connections with similarity curves discussed in previous papers.",

In this paper, we use the theory of system responses to elucidate how popular dynamic regression models differ in the dynamics they imply. Crucially, this theory allows us to reason about complicated dynamic models qualitatively, without requiring a technical background.

          "abstract": "Graphical models have become an important method for studying the network structure of multivariate psychological data. Accurate recovery of the underlying network structure is paramount and requires that the models are appropriate for the data at hand. Traditionally, Gaussian graphical models for continuous data and Ising models for binary data have dominated the literature. However, psychological research often relies on ordinal data from Likert scale items, creating a model-data mismatch. This paper examines the effect of dichotomizing ordinal variables on network recovery, as opposed to analyzing the data at its original level of measurement, using a Bayesian analysis of the ordinal Markov random field model. This model is implemented in the R package bgms. Our analysis shows that dichotomization results in a loss of information, which affects the accuracy of network recovery. This is particularly true when considering the interplay between the dichotomization cutoffs used and the distribution of the ordinal categories. In addition, we show that there is a difference in accuracy when using dichotomized data depending on whether edges are included or excluded in the true network, highlighting the effectiveness of using the ordinal model in recovering conditional independence relationships. These findings underscore the importance of using models that deal directly with ordinal data to ensure more reliable and valid inferred network structures in psychological research.",

          "authors": "Leila Chaieb; Juergen Fell",
          "abstract": "Recent research has shown that memory consolidation (MC) is not only facilitated by sleep, in particular NREM sleep, but also by wakeful resting states. Mind wandering (MW) is a common phenomenon during waking state, especially during rest. The hippocampus is involved in both MC and MW, and both cognitive processes have been associated with hippocampal ripple activity. Therefore, it is an important and obvious question whether MW interacts with MC. To advance understanding of this question, this review briefly describes and discusses relevant studies that have explored the role of MW in MC. The studies included in this review were required to have experimentally investigated MC and measured MW, either through self-report questionnaires or experience sampling. A provisional synthesis suggests that autobiographical thinking and daydreaming negatively impact MC. However, a specific offline state characterized by greater slow oscillation power and decreased task-focus, which suggests increased MW, has been reported to facilitate MC. It remains unclear whether certain MW contents and characteristics - particularly MW about the previously encoded material - support or inhibit MC. More research is needed to clarify this issue. Future investigations should regularly assess whether MW is related to the learned material, ideally using experience sampling. Additionally, aspects such as the temporal orientation, deliberateness and meta-awareness of MW could be relevant to MC. Furthermore, it may be useful to distinguish between on-task focus with and without task-related thoughts, as well as off-task focus with thoughts (MW) and off-task focus without thoughts (mind blanking).",

We tested this claim in a high-stakes field experiment comparing single-blind review (reviewer identities withheld) and double-blind review (reviewer and author identities withheld) for 530 academic conference submissions. On reliability, both processes showed moderate reliability, leading to only 40\\% overlap among top-rated submissions. This low overlap indicates that differences between review systems partly stem from noise in the review system. In terms of fairness, our analysis indicates that single-blind reviews favored more senior coauthors and first authors who were Ph.D. students or research scientists, while disfavoring Asian (vs. White) first authors. Meanwhile, male first authors received slightly higher ratings in both conditions (especially under double-blind), but the greater the proportion of male coauthors, the lower the review ratings were under double-blind (vs. single-blind). On validity, we find that for submissions accepted and presented as a talk, neither review ratings nor author characteristics predicted talk quality, number of questions, or attendance. However, review ratings from both systems similarly predicted judged poster presentation quality (for a subset of submissions) and eventual publication (for all submissions). These findings highlight limitations in both single- and double-blind approaches. Double-blind review is not a cure-all for inequities that might arise via single-blind. Yet, including author identities does not appear to enhance reliability or validity enough to justify the risks this information poses in potentially advantaging a particular individual or group.",

However, none of these comparisons reached statistical significance,\nand all high-density intervals (HDIs) included zero. Hopfield network-based attractor modeling\nyielded small, non-significant differences favoring the good group in attractor count and basin\nentropy across several bands, suggestive of richer but unconfirmed dynamical capacity.\nIn contrast, circuit-level modeling with the Jansen-Rit neural mass model revealed credible\ngroup differences in two parameters recurrent connectivity strength (C) and background input\n(μ) both showing HDIs excluding zero.

          "abstract": "Background: CBT training faces significant challenges including limited supervised practice opportunities with diverse cases, inconsistent training experiences, resource-intensive supervision methods, and difficulties ensuring standardised competency assessment. This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of CBT trainer, an app facilitating training of CBT therapists through AI simulation of therapeutic interactions with feedback supporting competency development.\n\nMethod: This mixed-methods pilot study employed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 involved initial usability testing. Stage 2 included 59 participants from psychological practitioner training programs (77.2% from Low Intensity CBT Interventions program, 22.8% from Doctorate in Clinical Psychology) who engaged with the application over a month. Outcome measures included the System Usability Scale, platform engagement, post-study surveys on perceived learning outcomes, and qualitative feedback.\n\nResults: The CBT Trainer exceeded all pre-specified outcome targets, with participants spending an average of 95.24 minutes (SD = 134.58) engaging with roleplays. Participants voluntarily created an average of 4.15 role-play sessions each (SD = 3.55), with each session containing an average of 49.69 interactions. The platform achieved excellent usability with a mean SUS score of 82.20 (SD = 12.93). Assessment skills were the most significantly self-reported improved area (96.7%), followed by information gathering skills (66.7%). Participants valued immediate feedback (83.3%) and convenience (73.3%) as key advantages over traditional methods. \n\nConclusion: This pilot study provides evidence that AI-based virtual patient simulation offers a promising supplementary training tool for CBT therapists, with particular strengths in accessibility and immediate feedback. Future research should employ randomized controlled designs with objective competency assessments to determine whether simulated practice translates to measurable improvements in clinical performance.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: People with neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism are frequently excluded from clinical trials, either explicitly or via lack of trials or inaccessible recruitment. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) developed methods to understand and maximise participant recruitment and retention in trials. The QRI was applied for the first time to a placebo-controlled trial for a co-occurring mental health condition in autistic adults. \nObjectives: To investigate recruitment enablers and barriers, as well as strategies to address these in a large medication trial involving autistic adults through application of the QRI.   \nMethods: We employed mixed methods to investigate recruitment processes. Data collection included screening logs, 16 staff interviews, and 233 audio recordings of consultations between trial researchers and autistic adults about trial participation. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data provided a comprehensive understanding of recruitment barriers and facilitators. \nResults: The trial successfully recruited 318 autistic adults, 104% of the required sample of 306, demonstrating the feasibility of conducting large-scale RCTs with autistic adults. Closely involving the autistic community in the design and delivery of the trial was a crucial enabler. Other key enablers included tailored communication to autistic people’s needs and offering remote follow-up, further improving accessibility.  Barriers such as low initial response rates were addressed through direct outreach, facilitating self-referrals, and partnerships with autism interest groups.\nDiscussion: Our findings offer guidance to other researchers in designing and conducting trials involving people with neurodevelopmental conditions. Our experience underscores the importance of close collaboration between clinicians, researchers, and the autistic community in conducting relevant, well-designed trials, aligning with participatory research principles. Pre-conceived ideas about resistance to trial procedures in this group (e.g., treatment allocation blinding, randomisation, etc.) should be challenged.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms by considering a probability variable that can reproduce the phenomenon of a sudden negative value from a positive value. As a result, we found that depressive symptoms themselves occur according to a normal distribution or Gaussian process. Even if the mental state suddenly becomes negative, it is found to settle down to a positive or negative mean mental state due to the law of large numbers in the case of a normal distribution, and due to regression to the mean in the case of a Gaussian process. From this, we also discussed how to cope with depressive symptoms. Finally, we discussed connections with similarity curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy emphasizes the transformative power of mystical-type peak experiences. Stroboscopic ganzfeld (ganzflicker) stimulation offers a non-pharmacological analogue to psychedelic drugs. This exploratory self-experimentation study investigated whether anxiety-neutralizing techniques (eye movements, square breathing) enhance the brightness of visual hallucinations during ganzflicker meditation in a manner analogous to mystical peak bright light experiences. A single-subject experimental study was conducted over 20 consecutive days using alpha-frequency stroboscopic stimulation delivered via a mobile phone in a headset. Three interventions were compared: (A) resting with eyes closed, (B) square breathing with eyes closed, and (C) horizontal eye movements with eyes open. Visual hallucination brightness was scored from 0-10 at six time points following each intervention during 45-minute meditation sessions. Contrary to the hypothesis, therapeutic interventions (square breathing and eye movements) had minimal effect on brightness enhancement. Instead, the control condition of resting with eyes closed produced consistent brightening of visual hallucinations upon reopening the eyes. Eye movements produced a transient darkening effect. Both brightening and darkening effects showed reproducible temporal patterns with maximum effects at 40-60 seconds post-intervention and duration of 2-3 minutes. The brightening effect was accompanied by positive affect and peak experience qualities. These findings support alpha rhythm involvement in meditation-induced luminous phenomena. The delayed brightening after eye closure aligns with established literature on alpha resynchronization (20-30 seconds) following eye opening in unstructured visual fields. The darkening effect of eye movements corresponds with known alpha suppression during saccadic activity, consistent with EMDR's therapeutic mechanism of reducing imagery vividness. Results suggest that ganzflicker-induced brightness phenomena result from dual alpha augmentation: neural entrainment to alpha-frequency stimulation and alpha rebound following a period of eye closure. This simple controllable method may serve as both a clinical adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and as a standalone tool for self-inducing therapeutic peak experiences, offering sustained access to transformative states for long-term mental health and wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "How fluid are citizens’ views of democracy and its actors? Citizens widely support democracy in principle, but temporary factors like partisan considerations push many to bend these principles. To identify the limits of this malleability, we examine whether citizens’ democratic views even covary with a seemingly unrelated yet ubiquitous factor: their affective state. Drawing on multidisciplinary research, we theorize that citizens have more (less) benevolent views of democracy and its actors when feeling good (bad). Two studies with nationally representative samples from the Netherlands and the US––analyzing sixteen waves of naturally varying and experimentally induced affective states––test this prediction. We find that citizens’ affective states shape how they evaluate democracy and its actors, but these effects are limited to long-term variation in how they feel. This evidence implies that citizens’ democratic views are––though even more fluid than recently shown––nonetheless robust to immediate variations in affective states.",

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active interaction with a virtual pet (walking, petting and brushing, ball throwing), passive observation of virtual pet interaction, or a puzzle-game control condition. We found a significant reduction in negative mood in both the active and passive virtual pet conditions, but not in the control group. However, salivary OXT levels did not significantly differ across conditions. These findings suggest that even passive exposure to virtual pets can reduce negative mood, although such interactions do not appear to influence OXT secretion.",

          "abstract": "Specific phobia (SP) is a prevalent mental disorder. Exposure-based treatments are the most effective therapy. Surprisingly, little is known about the intrinsic functional connectivity of SP and its modification by treatment, possibly due to a strong focus on a presumed fear network. Hypothesis-driven a priori selection of brain regions does not allow the full extent of potential changes in SP and the modulating effects of therapy to be captured. Therefore, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with hypothesis-free, data-driven functional connectivity multivariate pattern analysis (fc-MVPA), which takes into account the entire functional connectome, to identify differences between N=72 individuals with SP and a non-phobic control group (CG, N=82). The SP group then received a one-session exposure treatment and was scanned again after 16 weeks.\nFc-MVPA showed the largest differences between SP and CG in somatomotor regions with higher connectivity to temporal nodes of the default network and anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network. Stronger connectivity values in the pre- compared to the post-treatment condition was evident in visual regions. while anti-correlations to the frontoparietal network were reduced. Post-hoc comparisons showed that the connectivity patterns of the SP after treatment between almost all identified nodes of both contrasts ('SP vs. CG' and 'pre vs. post') were comparable to those of the control group. Given the known functions of the identified networks, the results suggest that exposure treatment may improve the control of perceptual and action regions, leading to better environmental prediction of mentally constructed scenes and improved action control.",

          "abstract": "Flickering visual stimulation can evoke neural oscillations, which can influence ongoing brain activity. Electrophysiological recordings of neural oscillations in the ripple band (80-180 Hz) showed that these high-frequency oscillations occur in the neocortex and the hippocampus, that they phase-synchronize across long distances, and that ripple oscillations in the neocortex often precede those in the hippocampus during wakefulness. It is therefore possible that the neocortical ripple oscillations propagate beyond sensory areas to the hippocampus, inducing ripple oscillations. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment (N = 8) in humans, using ultra-high frequency visual stimulation (UHV-stimulation) to evoke ripple oscillations recorded through electrodes implanted in or near the hippocampus. Although hippocampal ripple oscillations, so-called sharp-wave-ripples (SWRs), mostly occur during quiet rest or slow-wave-sleep, we aimed to increase their abundance using visual stimulation during wakefulness. We hypothesized that UHV-stimulation would increase the number of SWRs relative to an eyes-open resting-state baseline. In line with this hypothesis, we observed significantly more SWRs per second during periods of stimulation compared to a resting-state baseline before and after the stimulation. This indicates that UHV-stimulation can be used as a safe noninvasive tool to influence SWRs, which offers the potential to improve memory.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of conspiracy theories in the wake of major events is a significant societal challenge. Using the July 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump as a case study, here we test whether conversational dialogues with a large language model (LLM) can reduce belief in immediately unfolding conspiracies. In an experiment conducted in the days following the assassination attempt (N = 789 U.S. adults), participants holding conspiratorial views engaged in a five-turn conversation with an LLM designed to reduce their conspiracy belief (for example, some Democrats thought the attempt was faked, while some Republicans thought it was an inside job). Compared to control participants who either discussed an irrelevant topic with an LLM or viewed a static fact sheet about the assassination attempt, participants in the LLM treatment showed significantly reduced conspiracy beliefs (d = 0.38). Two months later, after a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, treated participants were half as likely to believe conspiracies surrounding this new event. Linguistic analyses indicate the AI achieved this by promoting critical thinking and epistemic caution, rather than by only providing factual rebuttals. These results highlight the potential for scalable, cognitively-focused interventions to counteract misinformation in the immediate aftermath of high-profile societal events.",

          "authors": "Paul Seli; Daniel Smilek",
          "abstract": "The Dynamic Framework of Thought (DFT; Christoff et al., 2016) was introduced to capture William James’s insight that people’s thoughts tend to wander “hither and thither,” offering a framework for understanding spontaneous thought and mind wandering. Here, we critically evaluate the DFT’s characterization of these constructs, focusing on four definitional forms: stipulative, ostensive, diagrammatic, and operational. We examine these definitions through the lens of the classical approach endorsed by the DFT authors, which requires hard boundaries and clearly specified necessary-and-sufficient features. Our analysis reveals several problems, including (a) the absence of clear boundary conditions for defining spontaneous thought and mind wandering, (b) inconsistent or ambiguous identification of definitional features, and (c) misalignment among the definitional forms. We offer three recommendations to increase the coherence and scientific utility of the framework: (a) adopt a family-resemblances approach in which concepts are characterized by graded membership across a set of continuous dimensions; (b) emphasize thought variability as the core dimension of the DFT; and (c) ensure coherence across definitional forms, particularly between stipulative and operational definitions, while minimizing reliance on problematic ostensive and diagrammatic approaches. These changes will help the DFT better align with how concepts function in scientific practice and everyday cognition.",

          "abstract": "Despite the potential to significantly increase the impact of donations, people often fail to prioritize the cost-effectiveness of charities. This paper examines an explanation for why people may donate less effectively due to reputational concerns that favor empathizing with donation recipients rather than deliberating about the cost-effectiveness of charities. Across seven studies, we find that “deliberators” are perceived as less moral and less desirable as social partners than “empathizers”. Moreover, people accurately anticipate the reputational costs of deliberation and are more likely to donate to causes that evoke more empathy but are less cost-effective when reputational concerns are highlighted. Our findings suggest that there are disincentives for selecting charities by deliberating about their cost-effectiveness, as people are more rewarded for signaling socially valued moral traits than for prioritizing charitable impact.",

          "authors": "Chandra Sripada",
          "abstract": "Inspired by economic theory, theorists in neuroeconomics and related areas of cognitive science contend that value serves as a common currency for selection among options. While impressive support for this view has amassed over the last three decades, critics have raised serious concerns. They argue that there are a number of pathways to action that bypass value; dissimilar psychological systems do not share a common value currency; and the view cannot accommodate well documented kinds of “irrationality,” such as context effects. This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the common currency view, distinguishing common currencies that operate at two phases (decision-phase and learning-phase) and at two levels (options-level and meta-level). A further distinction is made between mechanistic common currency models utilized in cognitive science and representational common currency models that are formulated in expected utility theory and utilized in economics. These refinements help address the criticisms and yield a more nuanced understanding of the role of value in human decision-making.",

          "authors": "Philip Held; Sarah A. Pridgen; Daniel Szoke; Yaozhong Chen; Zuhaib Akhtar; Darpan Amin",
          "abstract": "Background: Innovative, scalable mental health tools are needed to address systemic provider shortages and accessibility barriers. Large language model (LLM)-based tools can provide real-time, tailored feedback to help users engage in cognitive reappraisal outside traditional therapy sessions. Socrates 2.0 is a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) tool that guides users through Socratic dialogue. This study examined its feasibility, acceptability, and potential for symptom reduction.\nMethods: Sixty-one adults enrolled in a four-week mixed-methods pre-clinical feasibility study. Participants used Socrates 2.0 as desired and completed self-report measures of depression, social anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms at baseline and one-month follow-up. Feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness along with usability and working alliance were assessed via validated measures. Semi-structured interviews explored user experiences and perceptions.\nResults: Participants engaged with Socrates 2.0 an average of 6.70 (SD=4.57) times over four weeks. Feasibility (mean=4.26, SD=0.67), acceptability (mean=4.16, SD=0.84), and usability ratings were high. Participants reported moderate reductions in depression (effect size d=0.30), social anxiety (d=0.25), obsessive-compulsive (d=0.33), and posttraumatic stress (d=0.28) symptoms. Working alliance scores suggested a moderately strong perceived bond with the AI tool. Qualitative feedback indicated that the nonjudgmental, on-demand nature of Socrates 2.0 encouraged self-reflection and exploration. Some users critiqued the repeated questioning style and limited conversation depth.\nConclusions: Socrates 2.0 was perceived as feasible, acceptable, and moderately helpful for self-guided cognitive reappraisal, demonstrating potential as an adjunct to traditional therapy. Further research, including randomized trials, is needed to determine effectiveness across different populations, optimize personalization, and address repetitive conversational loops.",

In this study, we address this gap by examining the longitudinal relationship between social media use and psychiatric diagnosis in secondary healthcare.\n \nMethods\nWe used Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data linked to the Millennium Cohort Study, representing residents of England born in 2000–2002 (N = 12,586 with linkage consent rate 49.2%). We applied Cox proportional hazards models to separately model the hazard of having a psychiatric diagnosis recorded in HES in the three years following social media use recorded at ages 11 and 14. To select theoretically relevant covariates, we used directed acyclic graphs co-produced with experts with lived experience of mental distress and social media use. We used a combination of multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting to handle missing data, and sampling weights to render the sample representative of the target population.\n\nOutcomes\nWe did not find evidence for a longitudinal association between social media use and psychiatric diagnoses in either time period. However, post hoc analyses investigating non-linear relationships suggested a significantly increased hazard of psychiatric diagnosis among participants who reported no social media use at age 14 relative to those with moderate use.\n\nInterpretation\nClaims that social media are a major driver of increasing demand for youth mental health services are currently not evidenced. Future research should critically consider the potential risks, as well as benefits, of interventions into social media use in young people.\n\nFunding\nWellcome Trust and Economic &amp; Social Research Council.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrative framework linking quantum informational fields, endogenous bioelectric signaling, and linguistic patterning in biological systems as foundational to morphogenesis and consciousness. Drawing on models from Bohm’s implicate order, biofield physics, and emerging data from wave genetics and biophoton research, it outlines a hypothesis in which biological structure and cognitive function are not merely outcomes of genomic coding but active, field-mediated phenomena. The hypothesis suggests that DNA operates both as a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information, modulating development through vibrational coherence and semantically structured fields. The framework synthesizes findings from Levin’s work on bioelectric patterning, Popp’s biophoton theory, and linguistic wave theory to argue for a field-based mechanism that underlies cellular organization, memory storage, and potentially even intention-driven effects. This model presents a challenge to classical gene-centric biology by proposing that semantic and energetic coherence across biological systems plays a central role in form and function. Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) was developed to provide independent measures of sensitivity and bias for an observer asked to discriminate a signal stimulus against background noise. The sensitivity measure, d' , achieves this goal when the underlying decision space consists of two Gaussian distributions of equal variance. However, d' fails to provide a stable measure of sensitivity when the distributions are of unequal variance. In addition, unequal base rates of stimulus presentations or asymmetries in the payoff matrix for decision outcomes further shift criterion placement and estimations of sensitivity. Alternative sensitivity metrics that attempt to consider these scenarios either require information across multiple confidence levels or make implicit assumptions about the underlying decision space a priori. I propose an optimization approach that accurately estimates information about the underlying decision space without requiring information over multiple confidence levels. The proposed approach requires β and a single false alarm and hit rate pair. The reliance on β limits the proposed method to providing a normative model of performance where the researcher is operating under a theoretical framework of decision. Simulations illustrate that in cases where β is known, or can be reasonably estimated, the optimization approach is successful in recovering the critical characteristics of the decision space.",

          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as “GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY” were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as “honeypots” to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination—the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

          "authors": "Yena Kim; Laura Wallace; Brad Bitterly; Emma Levine",
          "abstract": "Why do people fail to initiate important but difficult conversations? The dominant explanation in extant literature is that people are overly pessimistic about the outcomes of having these conversations. From this perspective, motivating conversational engagement should be as simple as correcting this misperception. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that people still delay having conversations they expect will be more beneficial than costly, suggesting the pessimism account may be incomplete. We address this puzzle by proving the first empirical test of a self-regulatory account of difficult conversations. We argue that difficult conversations often involve both expecting positive outcomes following a conversation and a negative experience while having it. Like other self-regulatory conflicts—such as going to the gym or eating healthily—initiating difficult conversations involves choosing an uncomfortable, short-term experience to obtain a positive, long-term outcome. Across three experiments with U.S. adults (online, university lab; N = 976), we show that conversational decisions are similarly sensitive to time: people are more willing to initiate conversations in the future (vs. now). However, it is not the case that people want to put off conversation generally because this effect is specific to conversations for which the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. Furthermore, people are aware of this self-regulatory dynamic: they are willing to use costly commitment devices to get themselves to have the conversation. In sum, we provide the first empirical test of a self-regulatory account of difficult conversations, highlighting a new mechanism driving conversational avoidance.",

          "abstract": "Negativity captures attention and motivates people to read and share news, but can also harm mental health and sometimes discourage action to address long-term problems like climate change. Negative affect also has complex effects on memory—for example, focal details may be enhanced, but peripheral details can be distorted or forgotten, leaving individuals vulnerable to future misinformation. Here, we investigated an alternate route to increasing engagement with news: evoking positive affect by emphasizing opportunity and progress toward future goals. In two experiments, we adapted environmental news headlines to feature different aspects of each story, emphasizing Crisis or Opportunity. Both Crisis and Opportunity framing (and negative and positive affect, respectively) motivated reading and sharing, relative to the unaltered headlines. Crucially, consistent with theoretical predictions, we identified a trade-off: Crisis framing had the strongest effects on immediate engagement (increasing sharing and real charitable donations), but impaired memory for peripheral details; in contrast, Opportunity framing enhanced memory for news content. In a third study, we investigated real-world engagement with news about climate change by computationally classifying content in &gt;25,000 news headlines on social media; Opportunity and Crisis framing were both associated with increased likes, reposts, and replies. Overall, we demonstrate that the affective framing of news modulates reading, sharing, donations, and memory in laboratory and real-world settings.",

Additionally, parks differ in the affordances they offer in terms of amenities and other characteristics. In this pre-registered, cross-sectional study we asked participants (N = 303, Chicago, USA residents) to visit several city parks over the course of two weeks (N_obs = 1234). While visiting, they rated naturalness, safety, maintenance, and noisiness, and completed the Perceived Restoration Scale. They also reported on their momentary affect, subjective cognitive restoration, and preference for the park. Using both theory-driven and data-driven approaches, we found that all these qualities were related to affective and cognitive outcomes. Additionally, we found that when participants visited a park they had been to before, compatibility between activities they reported wanting to do in the park and the amenities offered by the park predicted preference, but this relationship did not hold when participants visited a park they hadn’t been to before. Overall, this study highlights the need to integrate approaches from both environmental psychology and leisure studies to generate more holistic and comprehensive recommendations for urban greening planning and policy.",

Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick-and-throttle used on the PBM. \n\nMethod: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video.\n\nResults: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device.\n\nConclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This shows that transfer effects from alternative input devices depends in part on properties of the task.\n\nApplication: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection.",

As our perception of the environment is so tightly guided by the externally available information, it’s natural to ask to what extent sensory processing internalizes these everyday mass–velocity relationships. Contrary to the longstanding assumption that mass and velocity are encoded independently in the mind, across three experiments (N=176), we reveal a novel mass–speed illusion: heavier-looking objects are judged to move more slowly than lighter ones, despite identical retinal speeds and sizes. This bias persists across very different stimulus manipulations and is strikingly uniform across observers. Together, these results demonstrate that the perceptual system internalizes the statistical regularities linking mass and velocity in the natural environment and suggest that the foundations of our intuitive grasp of physics are embedded within early sensory encoding.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness, on the Dynergic Theory of Consciousness (DTC), is not an emergent add-on but the natural expression of reality's relational fabric. DTC treats relations as ontologically primary: when five universal patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) synchronize within a substrate's binding window, a system experiences itself as a unified whole. Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Heightened negative affect is a core feature of serious mental illness. Over 90% of American adults own a smartphone, equipped with an array of sensors which can continuously and unobtrusively measure behaviors (e.g., activity levels, location, and phone usage patterns) which may predict increases in negative affect in real-time in individuals' daily lives.\n\nMethod: Sixty-eight adults with a primary mood or psychotic disorder completed daily emotion surveys for over a year, on average (mean 465 days; total surveys = 12,959). At the same time, semi-continuous collection of smartphone accelerometer, GPS location, and screen usage data, along with accelerometer tracking from a wrist-worn wearable device, was conducted for the duration of the study. A range of statistical approaches, including a novel personalized ensemble machine learning algorithm, were compared in their ability to predict states of heightened negative affect.\n\nResults: A personalized ensemble machine learning algorithm outperformed other statistical approaches, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.72 (for irritability) - 0.79 (for loneliness) in predicting different negative emotions. Smartphone location (GPS) variables were the most predictive features overall. Critically, there was substantial heterogeneity between individuals in the association between smartphone features and negative emotional states, which highlights the need for a personalized modeling approach.\n\nConclusions: Findings support the use of smartphones coupled with machine learning to detect states of heightened negative emotions. The ability to predict these states in real-time could inform the development and timely delivery of emotionally beneficial smartphone-delivered interventions which could be automatically triggered via a predictive algorithm.",

          "abstract": "Social media is fraught with ambiguity and opportunities for making skewed interpretations. Negative interpretation bias, or the tendency to assign negative meanings in response to ambiguous information, is associated with mental health problems like depression and anxiety, while positive interpretation bias, or the tendency to make benign interpretations in response to ambiguity, may be protective. Interpretation bias is a modifiable treatment target in cognitive interventions. Reappraisal, which involves considering different perspectives, may hold promise for shifting negative self-focused social media interpretations (i.e., “online” interpretation bias, such as catastrophic thoughts about the significance of not having enough likes or followers). Through a multiphase user-centered design process with college student stakeholders (N = 37), we developed a digital single-session reappraisal intervention to shift online interpretation bias, as well as secondary outcomes (e.g., “offline” interpretation bias, reflecting interpretations about situations that are not online, like in-person parties). A randomized-controlled trial with N = 162 college students who reported negative self-evaluations tied to social media was conducted to compare PRISM to an activity-matched social media control condition. As hypothesized, PRISM led to greater reductions in online and offline negative interpretation bias and increases in online and offline positive interpretation bias than the control condition, post-intervention and at two-week follow-up. However, PRISM was largely ineffective in shifting outcomes other than interpretation bias (e.g., anxiety and depressive symptoms), underscoring the need to enhance transfer of the interpretation bias changes to improve other clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrative framework linking quantum informational fields, endogenous bioelectric signaling, and linguistic patterning in biological systems as foundational to morphogenesis and consciousness. Drawing on models from Bohm’s implicate order, biofield physics, and emerging data from wave genetics and biophoton research, it outlines a hypothesis in which biological structure and cognitive function are not merely outcomes of genomic coding but active, field-mediated phenomena. The hypothesis suggests that DNA operates both as a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information, modulating development through vibrational coherence and semantically structured fields. The framework synthesizes findings from Levin’s work on bioelectric patterning, Popp’s biophoton theory, and linguistic wave theory to argue for a field-based mechanism that underlies cellular organization, memory storage, and potentially even intention-driven effects. This model presents a challenge to classical gene-centric biology by proposing that semantic and energetic coherence across biological systems plays a central role in form and function. Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

          "abstract": "This article proposes a neuroevolutionary model of language origins in which the human-specific ability to experience intrinsic reward from symbolic vocal behavior emerged as a major innovation, building upon pre-existing communicative vocalizations found in non-human primates. We suggest that, while vocal communication served essential social and emotional functions in early hominins, a neurobiological shift occurred when self-generated vocalizations that successfully matched symbolic referents,whether perceptual, mnemonic, or affective,began to activate dopaminergic reward circuits. This new capacity for self-reward did not replace communicative functions, but rather enriched them, enabling the stabilization and creative expansion of symbolic behaviors even in the absence of immediate social utility. In Homo sapiens, genetic adaptations further expanded vocal and articulatory capacities and refined the connectivity between reward circuits and cortical language areas, dramatically increasing the range and precision of symbolic matches. The anticipation and achievement of articulatory, lexical, and syntactic success became then intrinsically pleasurable, establishing a self-reinforcing loop of linguistic exploration and innovation. Over time, the social dimension of language learning and use, amplified by group size and cultural complexity, catalyzed the rapid growth of linguistic and cooperative capacities in modern humans. Crucially, we suggest that this self-rewarded symbolic behavior conferred adaptive advantages beyond cognition and sociality, notably by enabling the generation of dopaminergic reward at low energetic cost, potentially supporting stress reduction and immune function. This hypothesis is supported by converging evidence from neuroimaging, neurogenetics, and experimental psychology, which demonstrate that successful symbolic matching and linguistic insight activate dopaminergic reward circuits, and that human-specific neural adaptations may have provided the substrate for these processes.",

          "abstract": "How societies remember the dead can reveal what people value in life. We analyzed 38 million obituaries from the US (1998-2024) to examine how personal values are encoded in individual and collective legacies. Using Schwartz’s theory of basic human values, we found that tradition and benevolence dominated legacy reflections, while values like power and stimulation appeared less frequently. Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: men were remembered more for achievement, power, and conformity, while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism. Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women. Our findings reveal how obituaries serve as psychological and cultural time capsules, preserving not just individual legacies, but also indicating what US society values collectively regarding a life well lived.",

          "abstract": "What factors influence how much fun people have when engaging in inherently enjoyable tasks? Several theories predict that people will have the most fun in environments of intermediate difficulty because these environments usually offer the most progress in learning about the world. Past studies have frequently focused on simple experimental paradigms in which learning was still instrumental for later tasks. Here, we put these theories to a test in three large and realistic video game data sets: a puzzle game (with 7,994 levels and 376,341 votes), a racing game (138,662 levels and 614,770 votes), and a platformer game (115,032 levels and 795,313 votes). As predicted, people preferred levels of intermediate difficulty in all games. Yet, additional factors influencing people's enjoyment also emerged: players preferred levels that matched closely with their prior expectations of difficulty and were also motivated by success. We further confirmed these factors in two precisely controlled experiments. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of the dynamics of fun in realistic environments and emphasize the importance of using both realistic, game-like environments and highly controlled experiments to refine theories of human learning and decision-making.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces an integrative methodology combining satellite image segmentation and psychometric modeling to investigate how near-home environments influence psychological restoration and affective experiences. Using an ad-hoc clustering procedure on satellite imagery, we quantified environmental features (green spaces, gray areas, roofs, shadows) surrounding the home of 917 Italian university students. These objective features were then linked to self-reported perceptions of restorativeness and emotional states (pleasure, arousal, dominance) across home, university, and nature settings. Results revealed that gray spaces negatively predicted restorativeness, particularly diminishing psychological distancing (“being-away”), attentional engagement (“fascination”), and spatial openness (“scope”). Structural Equation Models (SEM) confirmed that these components significantly mediated the relationship between gray space and affective outcomes. Specifically, gray spaces indirectly reduced emotional states of pleasure and arousal through diminished restorativeness, while also exerting a positive association with emotions of dominance, possibly reflecting feelings of environmental control or adaptation in urban contexts. Our approach advances previous research by isolating the psychological pathways linking built environments to emotional well-being, and by demonstrating the value of combining environmental segmentation with latent variable modeling. The findings support the development of urban planning strategies aimed at reducing gray space exposure and enhancing restorative features in residential areas, thereby promoting emotional resilience and well-being.",

          "authors": "Stefan C. Schmukle",
          "abstract": "Two different approaches for calculating confidence intervals (CIs) for individual scores in psychological testing practice have been discussed in the literature within the framework of classical test theory, but unfortunately, both approaches can lead to biased estimates. The traditional approach (CI: observed score ± z · standard error of measurement) fails to take into account the phenomenon that, with imperfect measurement, true scores will be closer to the population average than observed scores will be (regression to the mean). On the other hand, the regression approach (CI: regression-based true score estimate ± z · standard error of the estimate) takes regression to the mean into account. However, this approach leads to confidence intervals that are on a different scale than the observed scores. The different scaling occurs because true scores have a smaller standard deviation than observed scores, and the extent of this shrinkage depends on the reliability of the test. It is thus incorrect, for example, to interpret true scores as falling on a standard scale (like T-scores) even when the observed scores were measured on such a scale. Here, I suggest a scale correction for the regression-based true score estimate to preserve the scaling, and thus to ensure both the accuracy and interpretability of the confidence intervals. Simulations indicate that this approach has the desired properties and outperforms the two existing approaches. The regression approach with scale correction is therefore recommended for calculating confidence intervals for individual scores in psychological testing practice.",

Based on such theories, cognitive models were developed that made the theoretical findings applicable and testable.\nHowever, most of those models still suffer from two major drawbacks: First, they are commonly developed on an aggregate level and are rarely applied to individuals. Second, the models often consist of a variety on sub-processes and effects internally, but are not build in a modular way, hindering the transfer of findings between different models. We present a data-driven methodology that generates modular process models from such sub-processes and effects, exemplarily applied to the domain of syllogistic reasoning. Given the question-answer pattern of reasoners, a combination of sub-processes maximizing performance is calculated, which outperforms the current state of the art in terms of the ability to account for individual reasoning behavior.",

Longitudinal evidence is less common, but among young adults in the United Kingdom (UK), current longitudinal evidence highlights the specific association between increases in harmful gambling and subsequent suicidality. In a young UK adult cohort, we aimed to investigate whether harmful gambling, as measured by the Problem  Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), would be associated with concurrent and future suicide attempts (at intervals of one, four, and five years). Furthermore, the four-year window was used to observe whether PGSI increases were a unique risk factor for suicidality, as has been observed before. In all instances, hierarchical logistic regression models explored whether  associations were robust to controls for adolescent suicidality and relevant confounders.\n\nDesign: A birth cohort study of the UK general population.\n\nSetting: Avon, UK.\n\nParticipants: n=2,801 (62.4% female) participants with data for suicidality at 24 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).\n\nMeasurements: Past-year non-fatal suicide attempt prevalence was self-reported at 24 and 25 years (in 2017-2018). PGSI was measured at 20 and 24 years. Measured confounders were sex, maternal education, economic activity (employment/education status), hyperactivity, alcohol disorder likelihood, and adolescent suicidality.\n\nFindings: Past-year suicide attempt prevalence was 2.57% at 24 years, and 1.86% at 25 years. Confounder-adjusted models found that PGSI predicted suicide attempts at 24 years (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.13, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p=.001), and predicted future suicide attempts over one-year (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25, p=.001), and four-year timespans (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.34, p&lt;.001), but there was inconclusive evidence of this association over five years (OR=1.14, 95% CI 0.995–1.31, p=.058). There was inconclusive evidence that increases in PGSI scores between 20 and 24 years predict suicide attempts at 24 years (OR=1.69, 95% CI 0.72–3.99, p=.230).\n\nConclusions: Among young adults in the United Kingdom, harmful gambling appears to be associated with suicide attempts; however, this association may be more complex long-term, and increases in harmful gambling during adulthood may not be an important factor.\n\nKeywords: Gambling-related harm, Suicide attempts, PGSI, ALSPAC, Longitudinal",

          "abstract": "Almost all linguistic expressions are ambiguous to some extent, and can be interpreted in various different ways. This is especially the case for novel expressions a speaker has never encountered before, in particular combined concepts expressed via compounds such as /gold student/ or /monkey ring/. Although previous studies have shown that word embeddings (meaning representations derived from text-based language models), can encode the interpretational diversity of such expressions, these previous studies have been limited to a small, rigid and high-level closed set of relational interpretations (e.g., `student MADE OF gold', `student ABOUT gold'). In contrast, the present study uses more ecologically-valid open-format interpretations provided by human participants, which are afterwards classified in a bottom-up manner in order to compute quantitative estimates of interpretational diversity. In an exploratory study on pre-existing data, we first investigate what measures derived from word embeddings capture interpretational diversity, with the vector norm of the embeddings emerging as the best predictor. In a subsequent high-powered confirmatory study, we then systematically select new items for maximal variation of this vector norm, and replicate the same pattern. This is the first study to show that text-based language models encode the unconstrained interpretational diversity of linguistic expressions, even within a single vector representation, and even for novel expressions that have never been observed in their training data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health concern, with global and UK prevalence rates estimated at 9.8% and 41.3%, respectively. The antenatal period offers a critical window for interventions to reduce alcohol use and mitigate risks to both mother and child. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and predictors of antenatal alcohol consumption using data from a large sample of UK women engaged with a pregnancy support app.\nMethods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 50,225 pregnant women who used Tommy’s pregnancy support app between September 2020 and January 2024. Alcohol use was assessed via a binary question, and other health behaviours, mental health conditions, and physical health indicators. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of antenatal alcohol consumption.\nResults: The prevalence of antenatal alcohol consumption was 16.91%. Women who reported smoking (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.32-2.69) and illicit drug use (OR = 6.79, 95% CI: 6.09-7.57) antenatally had significantly higher odds of alcohol consumption. Mental health conditions (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15) and depressive symptoms (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.14) were also associated with increased odds of drinking during pregnancy. Physical health conditions were associated with reduced odds of alcohol use (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93).\nConclusion: This study highlights the need to improve adherence to guidelines recommending complete abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. Findings suggest that women who smoke or use drugs, are particularly at risk of antenatal alcohol consumption. Digital health tools could play a crucial role in providing tailored support and interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and improve maternal and fetal health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories targeting LGBTI+ individuals have become increasingly prominent in public discourse, often reinforcing prejudice and symbolic threat. Across three studies conducted in Slovakia, we examined the associations between belief in LGBTI+ conspiracy theories, affective and cognitive prejudice, symbolic threat, political conservativism, and intergroup contact. Study 1 demonstrated moderate links between contact, prejudice and LGBTI+ conspiracy beliefs. Studies 2 and 3 tested whether communicating tolerant social norms or imagined intergroup contact could decrease conspiracy beliefs via reducing prejudice. Both manipulations failed to significantly affect belief in LGBTI+ conspiracy theories or prejudice, partially due to substantial group of participants unwilling or unable to engage with the manipulations. However, we found strong associations between conservativism, intergroup threat and LGBTI+ conspiracy beliefs. Collectively our findings underscore the complexity of reducing conspiracy beliefs and the importance of considering the broader socio-political context in which such beliefs are formed and maintained.",

          "authors": "Dzan Zelihic; Stefania Antonia Kyriakidou; Laoura Ziaka; Bob McMurray; Athanassios Protopapas",
          "abstract": "Recent findings show that lexical activation is slower when words are surrounded by other words, as they always are in natural reading. Here we focus on the proposal that this is due to direct interference from adjacent words that are processed in parallel. In three experiments using a flanked masked visual word adaptation of the visual world paradigm with adult skilled readers, we probed the spatial conditions for interference. Target words were flashed at fixation for 75 ms flanked by other words before being masked; we studied gaze shifts to the image (out of four displayed) corresponding to the target. We found that interference increases with proximity and is asymmetric (stronger from the right side). In the third experiment we included an image for one of the flanker words and we obtained direct evidence for lexical activation of the right-side flanker, consistent with parallel models of word recognition. Intriguingly, the strong asymmetry of lexical activation stands in contrast to a much weaker asymmetry in overall interference, indicating that different levels of representation are differentially involved in the online interactions among adjacent words. In all, our findings constitute strong evidence for distributed attention around fixation differentially affecting diverse word processing stages, and call for a reconsideration of word recognition models that posit independent processing of individual words. They also confirm that the masked flanked visual word visual world paradigm is appropriate for studying attentional allocation during reading.",

          "authors": "Krzysztof Bielski",
          "abstract": "Decision processes are often described at two levels: the process level and the control, strategic level. In value-based multi-attribute choice, people can either evaluate all available information (compensatory strategy) or rely on the most crucial information (simple strategy). This strategy selection problem, which is a key function of the control level, has been underexplored, although several studies have explored the neural underpinnings of decision-making at the process level. In this study, we aimed to 1) test whether predecisional information processing and strategy use depend on urgency, a hypothesis based on previous findings from perceptual decision-making; 2) determine the neural correlates of this effect. To this end, we used the probabilistic inference choice task, where participants must choose a better option based on sequential sampling of up to six probabilistic cues. In different trials, inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of either 1 s or 2 s represented two urgency conditions. We analysed both behavioural data describing decision strategy use, and fMRI data related to this process. The results conceptually replicate previous findings from perceptual decision-making, showing that longer ISIs (greater urgency) led to the choice of an option associated with lower probability of winning and were associated with a greater tendency to use the simple choice strategy. Activity of the right preSMA was higher when there was a lower probability of winning in the longer ISI condition, and among simple strategy users in general. Our study underscores the role of urgency in value-based decision-making, showing the influence of temporal processing on strategy selection and it underscores the role of the presupplementary motor cortex as part of the neural substrate of this process.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of small numbers. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness has been identified as a global health concern, and prevalence is increasing. Attachment theory and self-determination theory can provide insight into the underlying factors which may cause one to feel lonely. This study examined how individuals’ attachment orientations are associated with their self-determined solitude and non-self-determined solitude, and, in turn, their feelings of loneliness. Online surveys were administered to 548 adult community members and university students and measured attachment orientations, motivation for solitude (i.e., self-determined and non-self-determined solitude), and loneliness. The study used a prospective correlational design with 1-week between the Time 1 and Time 2 surveys. Structural equation modelling was used to test the predictive effects of anxious and avoidant attachment orientations on loneliness, mediated by motivation for solitude. Analyses revealed that non-self-determined solitude mediated the relationship between anxious and avoidant attachment and loneliness. Self-determined solitude mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and loneliness. However, self-determined solitude did not mediate the relationship between anxious attachment and loneliness. These findings highlight that non-self-determined solitude may be a key mechanism linking anxious and avoidant attachment orientations with loneliness. Additionally, self-determined solitude seems to play a key role in reducing loneliness, particularly for those avoidantly attached. The findings expand understanding of the motivation processes for anxious and avoidant attachment orientations, providing key practical implications for future interventions to focus on increasing self-determined solitude through psychological need fulfilment for anxious and avoidantly attached individuals, which may help to decrease loneliness.",

          "authors": "Marios Adamou",
          "abstract": "Social camouflaging—broadly defined as the suppression or modulation of autistic traits to conform to neurotypical social norms—has become a dominant explanatory construct in autism research. It is routinely presented as both an adaptive coping strategy and a clinical risk factor, linked to exhaustion, suicidality, and identity confusion. Yet despite its empirical and cultural traction, the concept has not undergone sustained philosophical scrutiny. This paper offers a critical analysis of camouflaging through four philosophical lenses: ontological, epistemological, logical, and ethical. We argue that the construct (1) lacks ontological stability, as it fails to identify a coherent class of phenomena distinguishable from adjacent constructs; (2) is sustained by epistemically circular and theory-laden methodologies that presuppose what they purport to measure; (3) embeds logical inconsistencies, particularly in its attribution of intentionality to agents diagnosed partly on the basis of reduced social reasoning; and (4) perpetuates ethical harm by individualising structural burdens and pathologising context-sensitive adaptation. Drawing on alternative conceptual frameworks—including neuroperformativity, rhizomatic identity, world-travelling, and ecological adaptation—we propose that research and clinical practice would be better served by models that affirm neurodivergent agency without encoding normative expectations of conformity. Rather than refining the camouflaging construct, we advocate its dismantling on grounds of conceptual incoherence and epistemic injustice. A philosophically and ethically adequate account of autistic social navigation must begin not with what is concealed, but with the norms that render difference invisible.",

This study sheds light on the interplay between variables using cross-sectional data from 13,507 individuals from five ethnic minority groups from the Healthy Life in Urban Setting (HELIUS) study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We developed a novel multilevel network analysis to explore the conditional associations between factors of interest for the entire group, and deviations from these effects for each ethnic subgroup.  Across all groups, unemployment, perceived stress, and adverse experiences were most strongly connected to depressive symptoms, while other individual factors such as perceived ethnic discrimination were connected indirectly. While individual psychological factors remain the strongest predictors of depressive symptomatology, socio-demographic and cultural determinants underly these psychological factors.",

          "abstract": "The widespread prevalence of child marriage across distinct ancient and medieval civilizations suggests the presence of a common underlying mechanism. This article proposes that the cross-cultural emergence of child marriage may be rooted in evolutionary adaptations from the Paleolithic period, when short life expectancy exerted reproductive pressure to mate early. These pressures may have shaped psychological predispositions and hormonal mechanisms that later fossilized into enduring cultural institutions—persisting even after their biological necessity had faded. Drawing on the concept of cultural lag and cross-civilizational patterns, the paper advances a theory of unconscious evolutionary continuity that can explain both the ubiquity and resilience of child marriage practices. The hypothesis neither justifies the institution nor minimizes its harms, but rather seeks to understand its deep historical and biological roots.",

We apply the workflow to a perceptual decision-making task performed in an fMRI scanner, demonstrating how to specify behavioral and neural design matrices, set priors, construct brain-behavioral links, and conduct group-level tests and individual-difference analyses. Through the hierarchical modeling framework, joint estimation stabilizes weakly identified parameters and mitigates attenuation bias in brain–behavior correlations.

Gender differences in personality traits could thus stem from people relying on their self-image, identity, and gender norms when answering global trait questionnaires. Results from two German-speaking samples of N = 324 older adults and N = 1,685 younger adults revealed gender differences in global trait scores for emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, but non-significant and smaller differences in corresponding average state scores. The findings are in line with theory suggesting that average state reports might be less biased, whereas global trait reports might include stereotypes and identity.",

          "abstract": "Personality pathology presents unique challenges in adolescence, a critical period for developing social autonomy and complex peer relationships. Yet, little research examines how these vulnerabilities unfold in daily life. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment (AA) study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female) aged 12–21, capturing 13,190 interactions over 14 days. Using Contemporary Interpersonal Theory and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we modeled links between personality pathology, perceptions of others’ and participants’ interpersonal behavior, and mentalizing. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) revealed that personality pathology was associated with lower daily social satisfaction in youth. Self-reports linked pathology to reduced perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, personality pathology was not associated with lower average mentalization but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Higher pathology strengthened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance, driven by Antagonism, while Psychoticism showed the reverse pattern, weakening this association. Detachment reduced the association of mentalizing and perceived warmth, and negative affectivity weakened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance. Findings highlight the dynamic nature of interpersonal dysfunction in adolescent personality pathology. Recognizing maladaptive patterns early may guide interventions that stabilize social interactions and promote mentalizing in ways that foster connection rather than control, reducing long-term challenges.",

          "abstract": "From a clinical perspective, identifying individuals with math difficulties is the first step toward offering them adequate support. These individuals tend to avoid mathematical tests, thus hindering identification. From a research perspective, this avoidance of math test-taking results in systematic data missingness. Moreover, in large-scale research, math tests are typically not feasible owing to time and resource constraints. Here, we develop a self-report scale for assessing individuals’ math difficulties and strengths on a continuum as a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to mathematical tests. Our math ability rating questionnaire (MARQ) is a valid and reliable self-rating scale for adults, available in full (19 items) and brief (3 items) versions. The new measure was developed using a sample of 278 Finnish adults (161 women) unselected for their math skills. Participants completed four mathematical tests and filled out a 30-item questionnaire, whose development was informed by an extensive literature review. Regression analysis, item response theory, and confirmatory factor analysis were used to identify the items most strongly associated with math performance. The full MARQ includes items about childhood difficulties, current self-concept, and daily life situations, whereas the brief MARQ focuses solely on childhood difficulties. The full and brief MARQ had reliabilities of 0.94 and 0.86, respectively, and correlated with participants’ mathematical anxiety (0.72 and 0.69), their math enjoyment (−0.58 and 0.50), and their children’s math skills (−0.24 and −0.22). Our findings demonstrate that the MARQ is a reliable tool for assessing math skills and identifying adults with difficulties in mathematics.",

          "authors": "Varfolomeyev Andrey",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a reductionist approach to Chalmers’ “hard problem of consciousness,” critiquing the concept of qualia as a redundant cognitive-linguistic construct. Qualia arise from the distal nature of visual perception, which relies on light reflection. Color perception is a multi-stage process involving physical stimulation, neural processing, and cognitive interpretation. The principle of visual perception is inherently dependent on the object reflecting light and is inseparable from it, rendering the isolation of a specific color’s perception outside the context of an object impossible. The “hard problem” stems from an inadequately justified extrapolation of vision’s peculiarities to consciousness as a whole. Subjective experience is explained by associative connections formed through learning and culture, rather than irreducible qualities. The color red is not a fundamental property of an object but a descriptive quality, contextually dependent on the perceived object and constituting a cognitive construct. Rejecting qualia resolves the “hard problem,” supporting a physicalist explanation of consciousness and highlighting an evolutionary mechanism for filtering background processes to prevent cognitive overload.",

While existing frameworks from internationally recognized entities provide foundational ethical guidance, the ETHICS framework offers distinct contributions tailored specifically to clinical contexts. It contextualizes general AI ethics within the daily realities of healthcare, emphasizing actionable principles related to clinical workflows, patient engagement, and health data governance. The framework was developed using a novel human-AI collaborative methodology: ChatGPT generated initial drafts, which were then refined through linguistic simplification, expert evaluation, and scenario-based stress testing. ETHICS also employs a mnemonic structure to enhance recall and communication among clinicians, increasing its practical utility. It encompasses six core principles: equity and fairness, transparency and patient-centered care, human oversight and clinical integrity, information privacy and data governance, continuous improvement and sustainability, and support and education for professionals. This study also stresses the potential of large language models to support ethical innovation when guided by expert oversight.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of fluent and coherent language in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to implement a form of universal computation, operating as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

Prior interventions have also shown limited success in promoting these strategies. This study evaluated the STAR Voyage I intervention, designed using the IMPACT Framework, which aimed to enhance students' metacognitive strategy knowledge, self-regulated learning skills, and behaviour change capability. Using a longitudinal pre-post design with 38 undergraduate students, results showed significant, moderate initial increases in retrieval practice and significant, large increase in spacing. Further, the results suggest that these gains were largely maintained long-term, with very small or small nonsignificant changes observed between weekly average scores and a follow-up three months later. The intervention also led to notable initial improvements in metacognitive knowledge (e.g., procedural knowledge) and key facets of self-regulated learning (e.g., academic self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, effort regulation). Additionally, students reported high satisfaction, and identified various significant barriers and facilitators to strategy use. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the IMPACT Framework in fostering durable improvements in student learning behaviours and provide valuable insights for future educational support.",

Our research modeled consensus—the extent to which different perceivers (viewers) rate different targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. In both studies, viewers (fans from Yellowjackets or Succession subreddits) provided self-ratings and character ratings using 3-item measures for each of 9 personality traits—the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed that consensus correlations were significant for all traits across both studies (mean rs = .54 to .60). Assumed similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (after controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers tended to project their own open-mindedness onto characters from both TV shows, whereas Yellowjackets viewers projected Dark Tetrad traits onto characters, driven largely by their assumed similarity of narcissism and sadism. We also used k-means clustering to examine structural relationships among characters based on the trait means provided by viewers, yielding a novel visualization of character groupings and the dimensions that may underly them. Because viewers’ perceptions of similarity to fictional characters contributes to forming parasocial relationships, understanding personality perception’s role in this process is likely central to advancing theory in media psychology.",

Data collection and analysis were guided by Framework Analysis, a structured qualitative method that supports systematic organisation, and interpretation of complex data across cases and themes.\n\nResults: Four themes were identified: 1) Improving access to healthcare; 2) Service improvement; 3) Individualising care; 4) Reducing the impact of risk factors. These findings inform actionable recommendations for suicide prevention strategies, improvements in mental health service delivery, and evidence-based best practices.\n\nConclusion: LGBTQA+ youth continue to face systemic barriers to equitable healthcare. Mitigating suicide risk requires queer-affirmative care, proactive service delivery, culturally competent practitioners, and actionable strategies that address unmet healthcare needs, promote engagement, and reduce existing health disparities. \n\nImplications for the profession and/or patient care: Mental health practitioners should deliver inclusive, trauma-informed, and LGBTQA+ affirmative care. Improving clinical outcomes requires systemic service improvements, meaningful involvement of young people in care planning and decision-making processes, and comprehensive training in LGBTQA+ health to strengthen cultural competence among practitioners.\n\nImpact: This study addresses a significant knowledge gap and provides evidence-based recommendations for mitigating suicide risk, addressing the specific healthcare needs of LGBTQA+ youth, and enhancing their support systems. The findings have the potential to inform clinical best practices, healthcare education, service design, provision and accessibility, policy development, and suicide prevention strategies.\n\nReporting method: Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR).",

This has created a need for standardized tools to measure individual differences in song perception. The current article reports the development of the Lyric Focus Questionnaire (LFQ), which measures the degree to which a song listener’s cognitive resources are oriented towards the lyrics versus the other musical features (i.e., pitch, rhythm, timbre). In Study 1, we used exploratory factor analysis to reduce 121 candidate items down to 12 items for the LFQ. In Study 2, we used confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency measures to ascertain the unidimensional structure of the LFQ. In Studies 3 and 4, we demonstrated that the LFQ is correlated to comprehension of lyrics but not to the ability to exactly recall lyrics. In Study 5, we aggregated data from the first four studies to create initial norms for the Lyric Focus Questionnaire and to explore discriminant validity between Lyric Focus and musical and literary activities with more statistical power than in each study alone. The LFQ is presented as a practical, valid, and reliable tool for researchers interested in the relation between music and language.",

While problem-solving primarily engages visuospatial working memory, fact retrieval, and procedural execution centered in the left inferior frontal gyrus, problem-posing activates distinct neural pathways involving metacognition, conceptual integration, and dorsolateral prefrontal networks. Our synthesis of neuroimaging, behavioral, and educational research reveals that these complementary processes influence cognitive arousal, self-efficacy, and motivation in mathematics education through different mechanisms. Problem-solving effectiveness correlates with spatial working memory capacity and cognitive flexibility, while successful problem-posing depends on metacognitive monitoring and language processing abilities.

          "abstract": "Background: Individuals with bipolar II disorder (BD-II) and depression face limited treatment \noptions and are often excluded from psilocybin therapy trials due to theoretical concerns of \nprecipitating mania or psychosis.  Although psilocybin has demonstrated antidepressant effects \nwhen combined with psychotherapy, adverse event reporting is inconsistent, and restrictive \neligibility criteria limit generalizability.  \nAims: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin therapy in \nindividuals with BD-II experiencing moderate-to-severe depression. \nMethod: In this open-label, single-arm pilot trial, 14 participants received 10 mg of psilocybin, \nfollowed by 25 mg if depressive symptoms persisted. Participants underwent psychotherapy \nbefore, during, and after psilocybin administration sessions and were proactively monitored for \nadverse events. Depression and quality of life were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg \nDepression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Questionnaire (QoL\nBD), along with exploratory measures. \nResults: Psilocybin was well tolerated, with transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure \nand no serious adverse events. Common adverse events included mild-to-moderate anxiety, \nnausea, and headache. Three participants experienced notable psychiatric adverse events \n(suicidal ideation and hypomania) which resolved with support. The frequency and nature of \nboth serious and non-serious adverse events were broadly comparable to those reported in \npsilocybin studies for other conditions. MADRS scores improved at all timepoints: 21 days after \n10 mg (-12.7 [2.7], p&lt;0.001); 21 days after 25 mg (-18.6 [3.1], p&lt;0.001) and 90 days after the \nfinal dose (-14.3 [2.8], p&lt;0.001). Quality of life also improved at 90 days (31.2 [10.2], p=0.004).  \nConclusions: Psilocybin therapy under controlled conditions may be safe and effective in \nreducing depressive symptoms and improving quality of life in individuals with BD-II depression, \nand feared outcomes—mania, psychosis, and suicidality—do not appear elevated relative to \nother clinical populations treated with psilocybin. Given the high psychiatric comorbidity and \ngeneral vulnerability to adverse events in this population, randomized, placebo-controlled trials \nare needed to confirm efficacy and refine dosing protocols in larger samples.",

          "abstract": "The rapid spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised important\nquestions about how individuals process misinformation, particularly in contexts where prior\nbeliefs are already strongly held. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\nto examine the neural mechanisms involved in evaluating COVID-19 vaccine misinformation\nand factual information, with a focus on how prior beliefs shape these processes.\nVaccine-adherent participants (N=39) were exposed to a series of vaccine-related statements—\nboth accurate and false—and indicated their level of agreement during scanning. Contrary to our\nhypotheses, we did not observe significant involvement of emotional processing regions such as\nthe amygdala or precuneus when participants were exposed to vaccine-related misinformation\nthat conflicted with their prior-held beliefs. However, when participants made belief-incongruent\nresponses (i.e., endorsing misinformation or rejecting accurate information) we observed\nincreased activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal\ncortex (DMPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG)—regions\nimplicated in decision-making, moral reasoning, memory integration, and cognitive control. Our\nfindings suggest that resolving conflicts between incoming information and prior beliefs engages\neffortful decision-making systems that battle uncertainty and conflict. Due to recruitment\nlimitations, the present analysis was restricted to vaccine-adherent individuals. Future research\nshould explore whether vaccine-resistant individuals show similar or distinct neural responses\nwhich may provide more insight into the persistence of misinformation in the context of negative\nprior beliefs.",

In every society, self-reliant decisions (intuition or deliberation) were most commonly preferred and considered the wisest. Expectations for fellow citizens, however, were mixed: advice from friends was expected about as often as self-reliant routes. The self-reliance tilt was strongest in cultures and individuals high in independent self-construal and need for cognition, and weakest where interdependence and self-transcendent reflection were salient. The same patterns emerged when examining ratings of each strategy’s utility, and oral protocols with Indigenous groups. Self-reliance appears the modal preference across cultures, but its strength is predictably tempered when cultures—and individuals within them—construe the self in relational rather than autonomous terms.",

Using archival data from 15 datasets (N = 602 children, 12-60 months), we evaluated these measures' psychometric properties. We found that: (1) proportion looking, reaction time, and proportion of trials switching from distractor to target, demonstrated the strongest validity, robustness (experimental effect size), and reliability; and (2) the paradigm captures two distinct cognitive processes—detecting mismatches and confirming matches—with distractor-initial trials showing stronger developmental sensitivity.

Yet, an answer may be critical to\nthe advancement of research, policy, and practice related to autistic students in higher education.\nThis paper addresses three related but distinct questions about autistic students’ college\nenrollment within the United States: 1) What percentage of autistic high school students go on to\ncollege? 2) What percentage of students registered with their postsecondary institutions’\nDisability Services Offices are autistic? 3) What percentage of enrolled undergraduates are\nautistic? To answer these questions, we examined more than 700 publications, reviewed more\nthan a dozen common survey instruments used at postsecondary institutions, and pulled data\nfrom several federal datasets. We assessed each of these sources and synthesized their findings to\ngenerate a range of estimates regarding the prevalence of autistic students in higher education.\nConsidering only those studies for which we held moderate or high confidence regarding the\nquality and generalizability of their data, the best available evidence suggests 42.9% – 47.0% of\nautistic high school students continue on to college, 2.8% – 4.0% of college students registered\nwith their schools’ Disability Service Offices are autistic, and 0.3% – 4.7% of all undergraduates\nare autistic. Ultimately, our calculations suggest there are likely between 135,400 and 286,254\nautistic undergraduates currently attending college in the United States. These estimates can be\nused by researchers, policymakers, and educators to highlight the importance of attending to the\ninterests, needs, experiences, and outcomes for autistic students.",

Since its original description, researchers spanning many scientific disciplines have identified analogous aspects within the topics they study and the associated complicated or complex systems (e.g., cultural keystones, molecular keystones, corporate keystones, keystone individuals within social networks). In this paper, we outline the behavior science analogy in the concept of a keystone contingency: A contingency whose removal or significant modification would disproportionately disrupt the current functioning and observed variability of an organism’s behavioral system. To make the idea of keystone contingencies explicit, we first discuss the relationships between behavioral repertoires, behavioral processes, and behavioral systems that temporally scale and can be analyzed, spanning individual motor responses through molar patterns of behavior. Once the behavioral system of interacting contingencies is described, we then discuss how researchers and practitioners might validate that they have identified a keystone contingency for an organism and offer several potential targets for analysis. Even if keystone contingencies turn out not to exist or do so in a graded fashion, research lines that map and quantify the total set of interacting contingencies that comprise an organism’s experiences over time will likely teach us much about the behavior of organisms that we have yet to discover.",

This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of CBT trainer, an app facilitating training of CBT therapists through AI simulation of therapeutic interactions with feedback supporting competency development.\n\nMethod: This mixed-methods pilot study employed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 involved initial usability testing. Stage 2 included 59 participants from psychological practitioner training programs (77.2% from Low Intensity CBT Interventions program, 22.8% from Doctorate in Clinical Psychology) who engaged with the application over a month. Outcome measures included the System Usability Scale, platform engagement, post-study surveys on perceived learning outcomes, and qualitative feedback.\n\nResults: The CBT Trainer exceeded all pre-specified outcome targets, with participants spending an average of 95.24 minutes (SD = 134.58) engaging with roleplays. Participants voluntarily created an average of 4.15 role-play sessions each (SD = 3.55), with each session containing an average of 49.69 interactions. The platform achieved excellent usability with a mean SUS score of 82.20 (SD = 12.93). Assessment skills were the most significantly self-reported improved area (96.7%), followed by information gathering skills (66.7%). Participants valued immediate feedback (83.3%) and convenience (73.3%) as key advantages over traditional methods. \n\nConclusion: This pilot study provides evidence that AI-based virtual patient simulation offers a promising supplementary training tool for CBT therapists, with particular strengths in accessibility and immediate feedback. Future research should employ randomized controlled designs with objective competency assessments to determine whether simulated practice translates to measurable improvements in clinical performance.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 20th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i.e., perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, despite the fact that their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the foundations of these assump-tions and examines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreasing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Additionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable. More fundamentally, when these assumptions are violated, the TRC becomes underidentified, meaning that multiple, substantively different data-generating process-es can yield the same coefficient, thus undermining its interpretability. These findings call into question the TRC’s suitability for applied settings, especially when traits fluctuate over time or measurement conditions are uncontrolled. Alternative approaches are briefly discussed",

A VR-based serious game was developed to assess a range of behavioral, cognitive, meta-cognitive, and physiological indicators to determine its effectiveness in identifying individuals with depressive symptoms. The study sample consisted of 100 participants, including 50 individuals with depressive symptoms (DS) and 50 healthy controls (HC), classified using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multi-modal data collected within the VR environment were analyzed using the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify participants as DS or HC. \nResults demonstrated a mean classification accuracy of 72%, with the best performance reaching 80%. Feature importance analysis indicated that the model’s decision-making process relied on a combination of physiological, behavioral, and meta-cognitive measures. \nThese findings underscore the value of incorporating multi-modal data into depression assessments and suggest that integrating VR and XAI could pave the way for more effective and personalized approaches to screening, diagnosis, and treatment of depression.",

          "authors": "Krzysztof Bielski",
          "abstract": "Decision processes are often described at two levels: the process level and the control, strategic level. In value-based multi-attribute choice, people can either evaluate all available information (compensatory strategy) or rely on the most crucial information (simple strategy). This strategy selection problem, which is a key function of the control level, has been underexplored, although several studies have explored the neural underpinnings of decision-making at the process level. In this study, we aimed to 1) test whether predecisional information processing and strategy use depend on urgency, a hypothesis based on previous findings from perceptual decision-making; 2) determine the neural correlates of this effect. To this end, we used the probabilistic inference choice task, where participants must choose a better option based on sequential sampling of up to six probabilistic cues. In different trials, inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of either 1 s or 2 s represented two urgency conditions. We analysed both behavioural data describing decision strategy use, and fMRI data related to this process. The results conceptually replicate previous findings from perceptual decision-making, showing that longer ISIs (greater urgency) led to the choice of an option associated with lower probability of winning and were associated with a greater tendency to use the simple choice strategy. Activity of the right preSMA was higher when there was a lower probability of winning in the longer ISI condition, and among simple strategy users in general. Our study underscores the role of urgency in value-based decision-making, showing the influence of temporal processing on strategy selection and it underscores the role of the presupplementary motor cortex as part of the neural substrate of this process.",

This paper introduces the Cultivating Individual Virtues in Context (CIVIC) model, a theoretically novel and practically grounded framework for evaluating behavioural patterns without collapsing into relativism. Synthesising insights from behaviour therapy, moral philosophy, and differential psychology, the model proposes that virtues are not fixed traits but enacted regularities that integrate three irreducible contexts: biological constraints, environmental conditions, and social consequences. Patterns that harmonise all three domains are considered virtuous, not merely functional, and constitute the behavioural substance of flourishing. The CIVIC model offers a pluralistic yet normatively serious account of virtue and flourishing, enabling practitioners to support lives that are individually coherent, contextually attuned, and ethically sustainable.",

          "abstract": "Are simpler explanations better, all else equal? Many people seem to think so. And many capitalize on this by claiming that their explanations are simple — perhaps the simplest! But some scholars have argued that parsimony’s scope is rather limited and its justificatory basis quite thin. And some psychological studies cast doubt on the net benefits of parsimony: considering the simplicity of an explanation can derail probabilistic reasoning. Alas, once acquired, status as a theoretical virtue is rarely lost. To advance the debate, we conduct experiments that test another way so-called theoretical virtues may impair reasoning (N = 1312). Results show that merely labeling explanations “simplest” can bias decisions beyond what base rates or the conjunction rules of probability merit (Experiment 1). Alternative labels like “most complex” or “most unifying” did not have such reliable or consistent effects (Experiment 2). These findings complement recent arguments and evidence about the risk of considering simplicity and raises broader questions about how theoretical “virtues” can mislead people. The good news is that people were more resilient to fallacious appeals to simplicity when evaluating more familiar and less mathematical explanations (Experiment 3). This suggests a potentially novel content effect: simplicity’s fallacious allure may be more potent in more alien, abstract, or arithmetic contexts in which other cues are less salient. Together, these data add objections to simplicity’s virtuous status, especially when describing potentially complex quantitative explanations to the uninitiated.",

          "abstract": "Recent research reveals that children’s language development is tied to their linguistic input. While the majority of this research has focused on speech children hear from adults, children around the world do not exclusively interact with adults. Instead, children regularly interact with other children, whether in the home or in early childhood education settings. Here, I contextualize the frequency of interactions with speech from other children. I then highlight properties of speech from children, such as its acoustic signature and content, that might make it particularly relevant for early language learning. Lastly, I discuss how considering speech from children allows us to create theories that are inclusive of societies around the world, where caretaking often involves more children and in lower-SES settings, where higher birthrates are common. I conclude that theories of language development should consider speech from other children as an important component.",

          "abstract": "Can metaphorical reasoning involving embodied experience—such as color perception—be learned from the statistics of language alone? Recent work finds that colorblind individuals robustly understand and reason abstractly about color, implying that color associations in everyday language might contribute to metaphorical understanding of color. However, it is unclear how much colorblind individuals’ understanding of color is driven by language versus their limited (but no less embodied) visual experience. A more direct test of whether language supports the acquisition of humans’ understanding of color is whether large language models (LLMs)—those trained purely on text with no visual experience—can nevertheless learn to generate consistent and coherent metaphorical responses about color. Here, we conduct pre-registered surveys that compare colorseeing adults, colorblind adults, and LLMs in how they (i) associate colors to words that lack established color associations and (ii) interpret conventional and novel color metaphors. Colorblind and colorseeing adults exhibited highly similar and replicable color associations with novel words and abstract concepts. Yet, while GPT (a popular LLM) also generated replicable color associations with impressive consistency, its associations departed considerably from colorseeing and colorblind participants. Moreover, GPT frequently failed to generate coherent responses about its own metaphorical color associations when asked to invert its color associations or explain novel color metaphors in context. Consistent with this view, painters who regularly work with color pigments were more likely than all other groups to understand novel color metaphors using embodied reasoning. Thus, embodied experience may play an important role in metaphorical reasoning about color and the generation of conceptual connections between embodied associations.",

However, findings in this area have been mixed, and there have been few efforts to date to summarize this literature. The aim of the current systematic review was to analyze existing literature that tested different facets of learning in samples of individuals with AN compared to other groups. In line with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted an initial search in April 2024 on PSYCInfo and PubMed, yielding an initial sample of 1,376 articles, of which 177 were fully assessed for eligibility. Our final review included 122 articles; coding, extraction, and synthesis of results occurred from April 2024 to March 2025. Included studies predominantly were cross-sectional in nature, tested group differences between those actively ill with AN and control subjects who had no history of psychopathology, and used neuropsychological tasks primarily gauging episodic learning (e.g., verbal or visuospatial learning) or associative learning (e.g., reversal learning). Qualitative synthesis of these findings suggests that while there appear to be alterations in learning among individuals with AN compared to controls, the significance and specific pattern of learning differences is inconsistent. It is likely that heterogeneity exists within AN and other eating disorders across development, stage of illness, and clinical phenotypes. Future research that begins to characterize meaningful heterogeneity and adopts methods such as computational modeling may offer promising methods for improving the characterization of and treatments for this devastating condition.",

          "abstract": "With rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the potential for paternalistic artificial agents grows. Autonomy restrictions have a detrimental impact on psychological well-being, regardless of the source of the restriction. The inherent opacity of AI is impeding the anticipation of autonomy-influencing factors. Hence, autonomy restrictions might go unnoticed thereby impeding our natural protective mechanisms: reactance reactions. To investigate the complex relationship between AI paternalism, autonomy perceptions, and reactance reactions we conducted an experimental, scenario-based, repeated measures mixed methods (2x5) online study (N = 137). The study took place in an e-commerce setting where participants were asked to buy a T-shirt from a web-shop, with varying levels of AI influence from a budget app. Participants experienced one of five levels of paternalistic influence (Control Condition without AI influence, Nudging Condition, Reversible Restriction, Non-reversible Restriction, Covert Restriction) and provided feedback twice: immediately after interaction and after receiving information about AI-supported decision-making and its paternalistic potential. The study's findings provide evidence for the presence of a reactance deficit, showing that individuals may have difficulty activating their natural protective mechanisms when confronted with highly paternalistic AI systems.",

          "abstract": "As key players in the internationalization of the counseling profession, international student therapists (ISTs) possess valuable strengths given their cross-cultural experiences. While an expanding body of literature underscores the importance of meeting ISTs’ training needs, the current emphasis leans heavily on their challenges while overshadowing the valuable potentials and strengths ISTs can offer to the field. Exclusive focus on challenges may perpetuate a deficit-based perspective, whereas excessive focus on strengths may run the risk of undermining the practical challenges ISTs often face in training. To bridge this gap, we introduce a dialectical framework rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy, naïve dialectism, to reconceptualize the deficit-based perspective on ISTs’ challenges. This framework emphasizes strengths as transferrable outcomes that arise from one’s challenges with effective training. Building on this dialectical framework, we propose a theoretical model to highlight the dynamic interplay between the challenges and potentials often encountered by ISTs as they navigate cross-cultural experiences as bicultural individuals in the U.S. This model captures the essence of how these challenges may serve as potentials and strengths in their professional development. Training recommendations for programs, supervisors, and trainees are discussed. We encourage the field to recognize ISTs not only as learners but as valuable contributors whose unique experiences and insights enrich the counseling profession.",

          "authors": "Serge Nataf",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a neuroevolutionary model of language origins in which intrinsic reward, rather than communicative function, initially drove the emergence of symbolic vocal behavior. We propose that in early hominins, language-like acts emerged when self-generated vocalizations were internally matched to symbolic referents, activating dopaminergic reward circuits and reinforcing these behaviors independently of social utility. In Homo sapiens, genetic adaptations would have expanded vocal and articulatory capacities and refined the connectivity between reward circuits and cortical language areas, enabling a dramatic increase in the range and precision of symbolic matches. The anticipation and achievement of articulatory, lexical, and syntactic success would have become intrinsically pleasurable, establishing a self-reinforcing loop of linguistic exploration and innovation—even in the absence of social feedback. Over time, language would have been exapted for social communication, and the reward associated with language would have become increasingly contingent on social recognition and group cohesion. As group sizes expanded, this social dimension would have greatly amplified motivation for language learning and use, catalyzing the rapid growth of linguistic and cooperative capacities in modern humans. Crucially, we suggest that this self-rewarded symbolic behavior conferred adaptive advantages beyond cognition and sociality, notably by enabling the generation of dopaminergic reward at low energetic cost, potentially supporting stress reduction and immune function. This hypothesis is supported by converging evidence from neuroimaging, neurogenetics, and experimental psychology, which demonstrate that successful symbolic matching and linguistic insight activate dopaminergic reward circuits, and that human-specific neural adaptations may have provided the substrate for these processes.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a mathematical analysis of the logic of measuring Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs). Starting from the canonical definition of NCCs provided by  Crick and Koch (1990) and Chalmers (2000), a series of lemmas and theorems are provided which show how NCCs can be discovered if empirical data about the co-activation of neural states and states of consciousness is available. The result of this analysis is a new method to measure NCCs, which we preliminarily call Co-Activation Analysis (CoAA), that might complement or extend existing methods such as contrastive analysis and decoding. CoAA might be of interest for experiments because it does not require data from near-threshold conditions, is compatible with all major conceptions of states of consciousness (including, e.g., micro-phenomenological notions and global states of consciousness), can be applied to most conceptions of neural or computational states (including, e.g., those provided by Predictive Processing/Active Inference, or those attained in more ecological conditions), and helps alleviate the problem of confounders. Furthermore, we show as a theorem that as far as the logic of measurement is concerned, if applied to data from contrastive analysis studies, CoAA improves upon the result provided by contrastive analysis. The paper is a purely theoretical contribution. It is presented in the hope that the mathematics developed here can support and improve the empirical search for NCCs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although life stressors are known risk factors for suicide, the specific stressor types that most strongly precipitate suicidal outcomes, and on what timescale, remain poorly understood. Based on existing theory, we investigated whether objectively rated interpersonal stressors, especially social and targeted rejection stressors, are proximally associated with increased likelihood of suicidal ideation and behavior.\nMethod: Using an objectively rated contextual threat interview to assess stressful life events, and a timeline followback procedure for assessing suicide-related outcomes, we examined how the severity of four types of acute life events (i.e., non-interpersonal, interpersonal without social rejection, social rejection without targeted rejection, and targeted rejection) were temporally associated with the likelihood of same-day and next-day suicidal ideation and behavior over 16 months in 143 young adults (M age = 25.27, SD = 4.65) with recent suicidal ideation or behavior.\nResults: After controlling for prior-day suicidal ideation and non-interpersonal stressors, daily within-person increases in interpersonal stressor severity were related to higher odds of same-day (but not next-day) suicidal ideation. Additionally, greater increases in targeted rejection severity were uniquely related to increased likelihood of both same-day and next-day suicidal behavior after controlling for prior-day suicidal behavior and other types of stressors. \nConclusions: Interpersonal stressors are strong, proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior, and these effects are particularly strong for targeted rejection life events. Clinicians should thus assess recent interpersonal and, especially, targeted rejection stressors when evaluating acute suicide risk, and may reduce such risk by helping patients stabilize and strengthen their social relationships.",

Online semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts (n = 9), recruited via purposive sampling based on their media contributions, published works, and qualifications. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to understand these experiences, focusing on themes of academic validation, expert power, and morbid curiosity to understand difficulties of disseminating complex theory and knowledge to the public, in understanding the sensationalisation of those who have committed criminal offences. Implications of the research are discussed, including the improvement of relationships between academia and the media to ensure the emergence of accurate and beneficial information regarding the Criminal Justice System, individuals who have committed or been victimised by criminal offences, rehabilitation, and forensic psychology more broadly.",

Developing a digital adaptation of BAM has the potential to increase its accessibility and fill a critical gap in existing digital ED interventions, which to date have not specifically targeted anti-fat bias or fatphobia. This study applies a human-centered design approach to inform the development of a digital version of BAM.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 participants, including 17 college students with elevated ED psychopathology and 14 past BAM participants. College students with elevated ED psychopathology shared experiences with fatphobia and anti-fat bias, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Past BAM participants shared experiences with BAM, how they use mental health technology, and thoughts on digitizing BAM. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis with a critical realist lens.\n\nResults: College students with elevated ED psychopathology described pervasive and harmful experiences of anti-fat bias and fatphobia, coupled with difficulties accessing action-oriented mental health support, underscoring a gap in care that a digital adaptation of BAM could address. Both groups expressed strong interest in a hybrid digital format that combines synchronous and asynchronous components for a balance of social connection and flexibility. \n\nDiscussion: Findings suggest that a digital adaptation of BAM could address unmet needs in ED prevention by providing accessible, action-oriented content focused on anti-fat bias and fatphobia. Incorporating synchronous social connection within a flexible, interactive framework may promote engagement and impact. A critical next step will involve designing and pilot testing this digital adaptation of BAM to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.",

However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline.

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy emphasizes the transformative power of mystical-type peak experiences. Stroboscopic ganzfeld (ganzflicker) stimulation offers a non-pharmacological analogue to psychedelic drugs. This exploratory self-experimentation study investigated whether anxiety-neutralizing techniques (eye movements, square breathing) enhance the brightness of visual hallucinations during ganzflicker meditation in a manner analogous to mystical peak bright light experiences. A single-subject experimental study was conducted over 20 consecutive days using alpha-frequency stroboscopic stimulation delivered via a mobile phone in a headset. Three interventions were compared: (A) resting with eyes closed, (B) square breathing with eyes closed, and (C) horizontal eye movements with eyes open. Visual hallucination brightness was scored from 0-10 at six time points following each intervention during 45-minute meditation sessions. Contrary to the hypothesis, therapeutic interventions (square breathing and eye movements) had minimal effect on brightness enhancement. Instead, the control condition of resting with eyes closed produced consistent brightening of visual hallucinations upon reopening the eyes. Eye movements produced a transient darkening effect. Both brightening and darkening effects showed reproducible temporal patterns with maximum effects at 40-60 seconds post-intervention and duration of 2-3 minutes. The brightening effect was accompanied by positive affect and peak experience qualities. These findings support alpha rhythm involvement in meditation-induced luminous phenomena. The delayed brightening after eye closure aligns with established literature on alpha resynchronization (20-30 seconds) following eye opening in unstructured visual fields. The darkening effect of eye movements corresponds with known alpha suppression during saccadic activity, consistent with EMDR's therapeutic mechanism of reducing imagery vividness. Results suggest that ganzflicker-induced brightness phenomena result from dual alpha augmentation: neural entrainment to alpha-frequency stimulation and alpha rebound following a period of eye closure. This simple controllable method may serve as both a clinical adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and as a standalone tool for self-inducing therapeutic peak experiences, offering sustained access to transformative states for long-term mental health and wellbeing.",

In the practice of testing, the SEM is used as a one-size-fits-all measure for each test score. This practice emphasizes the need for a score-related precision estimate that shows which scores are precise and which scores lack precision. We discuss several score-related precision estimates based on classical test theory and item response theory, and provide open-source statistical software included in JASP that enables computation of these estimates. Using score-related precision estimates, decisions based on test scores are expected to show less bias than the common score-unrelated SEM.",

          "abstract": "Reflective reasoning has been central to philosophy and cognitive science more generally. However, scholars lack a unified empirical explication of ‘reflection’. This paper synthesizes a cross-disciplinary account from philosophers, scientists, and centuries of English speakers: ‘reflection’ often refers to—among other things—conscious and deliberate reconsideration of an initial intuition. This two-factor account of reflection empirically distinguishes reflection from often conflated phenomena such as rumination; it also tidily classifies self-conscious reflection as a subset of reflection. This account also accommodates mounting evidence that reflection is neither necessary nor sufficient for rationality. The two-factor account has implications for philosophy (e.g., that both practical and theoretical reasoning can benefit from reflection) and science (e.g., that reflection can be a solution to rather than just a symptom of negative rumination). So the two-factor account should be preferred to accounts that do less to unify, make sense of, and guide philosophy and science.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Strojny; Pawel Strojny",
          "abstract": "Background and aims\nEscapism is a key gaming motive associated with both psychological relief and Gaming Disorder. Yet, existing models often neglect the dynamic role of goal attainment in shaping gaming outcomes. Drawing on Goal Systems Theory, we introduce the construct of Post-Gaming Return (PGR)—a state reflecting successful psychological transition from gameplay to real life—as a potential explanatory mechanism of adaptive and maladaptive escapist play.\nMethods\nTwo studies were conducted with active gamers (Study 1: N = 259; Study 2: N = 193). Participants completed the PGR scale along with validated measures of escapism, mood, need satisfaction and frustration, vitality, life satisfaction, and gaming disorder (GD) symptoms. Regression analyses tested the predictive and discriminant validity of PGR across both samples.\nResults\nPGR was positively associated with post-game positive mood and need satisfaction, and negatively with negative mood and need frustration. In both studies, PGR predicted vitality and lower GD symptoms beyond escapism motives. The two PGR subscales—ease of disengagement from the game and ease of re-engagement in daily activities—differentially predicted outcomes: disengagement was the strongest negative predictor of GD, while re-engagement was associated with vitality and life satisfaction. In Study 2, PGR showed weak correlations with general mood and apathy, supporting its discriminant validity.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nThe findings support a shift from static motivation-based models toward a dynamic goal-resolution framework. PGR captures key post-gaming processes and helps distinguish between healthy and problematic escapist play. It offers a novel tool for identifying regulatory success or failure in gaming contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition associated with both genetic and prenatal environmental risk factors. Emerging evidence points to chronic low-grade inflammation as a potential shared pathway influencing ADHD symptoms.\nMethods: Using data from 42,193 children in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), we investigated whether maternal diet-induced inflammation during pregnancy (assessed via the Dietary Inflammatory Index, DII) and children’s genetic liability for inflammation (indexed by polygenic scores for C-reactive protein, PGS-CRP) were associated with ADHD symptoms at ages 5, 8, and 14 years. ADHD symptoms were reported by mothers and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Covariates included child sex, birth weight and length, maternal smoking, and genetic principal components.\nResults: Higher maternal DII and higher PGS-CRP were each independently associated with increased ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention, across development. Effect sizes were small but statistically significant. No interaction was observed between genetic and dietary inflammatory risk.\nConclusions: Prenatal maternal diet and inherited inflammatory risk factors appear to contribute additively to ADHD symptom development. These findings support the role of inflammation-related mechanisms in ADHD etiology and suggest that prenatal nutrition may be a modifiable risk factor.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that contingency instructions (CI), stating that the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) will not be presented anymore, can enhance extinction learning, and additional CI before extinction retrieval can reduce the return of fear. However, immediate pre-retrieval instructions are impractical in therapeutic settings. Thus, this study investigated the impact of CI before and/or after extinction training on extinction learning in 240 participants (120 patients with anxiety disorders (ADs), 120 healthy controls) using a three-day sequential conditioning paradigm. Electrical shocks and colored lamps served as UCS and conditioned stimuli (CS), with skin conductance responses (SCRs), CS valence, and UCS expectancy ratings as readout measures. CI before extinction training enhanced extinction learning for both patients with ADs and healthy controls across the physiological and subjective measures. Instructed healthy controls displayed even lower SCRs than instructed patients during early extinction. Furthermore, participants receiving post-extinction CI showed reduced CS differentiation in their SCRs during extinction retrieval. After a reinstatement, instruction timing differentially affected fear responses across contexts. Participants instructed before and after extinction, and uninstructed participants showed higher fear responses in the original conditioning context. Those instructed only before extinction exhibited increased fear responses in extinction and novel contexts, while participants instructed only after extinction showed heightened fear responses exclusively in the extinction context. The findings highlight how the timing of providing contingency information shapes fear learning and memory.",

          "abstract": "To understand interpersonal processes within family systems, researchers need models that go beyond commonly investigated dyadic relationships. The current study introduces triadic (t) extensions of the standard Actor-Partner Interdependence Model for both observed variables (tAPIM) and latent variables (latent tAPIM). Using an empirical example, we illustrate the implementation of both models by presenting their formulas and providing accompanying R code. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of these models under varying levels of measurement error. The results indicate that: (1) both models are generally unaffected by convergence problems; (2) the latent tAPIM more effectively accounts for measurement error, yielding more accurate estimates; (3) the latent tAPIM produces higher standard errors compared to the tAPIM; and (4) the power and type I error rates of both models are comparable, with only minor differences.

          "abstract": "Emotional stimuli are often remembered better than neutral ones, yet the mechanisms behind this\nadvantage remain debated. One key factor in memory enhancement is the encoding of\nexpectation violations, but their interaction with emotional valence remains poorly understood.\nThis study examined how expectation and emotional content jointly shape recognition memory.\nAcross three experiments, participants first learned predictive contingencies in a rule-learning\ntask. An encoding phase followed, in which some stimuli violated established expectations, while\nemotional content was manipulated orthogonally to expectation. Recognition memory was then\ntested for expected and unexpected stimuli. In mixed lists (Experiment 1), unexpected stimuli\nenhanced recollection for negative and neutral items but not for positive ones. When arousal was\nmatched across valence (Experiment 2), the benefit shifted to unexpected positive and neutral\nstimuli. In pure emotional lists (Experiment 3), the effect of expectation violations on recollection\nwas diminished, and memory was shaped primarily by valence, with negative stimuli eliciting\ngreater recollection than positive ones. These findings show that the mnemonic benefit of\nunexpected events is not uniform but varies with valence, arousal, and list composition. They\nsupport layered models of distinctiveness, suggesting that memory emerges from the interaction\nof item-level expectancy, emotional salience, and contextual variability.",

In addition, students may be nudged with adaptive notification badges to close their knowledge gaps. \nAim: This study evaluated the effectiveness of implementing an adaptive notification badge (small red button) reminding students to close their knowledge gaps. We also investigated the association between closing knowledge gaps and students’ overall performance, while controlling for other relevant factors (e.g., students’ usage behavior, system features, and teachers’ assignment types).\nSample: We considered 105,081 students (in 6,668 classes working on ~25 million problems) who used an ITS for learning mathematics.\nMethods: We employed hierarchical linear regression analysis to evaluate whether students were more likely to close their knowledge gaps in a period in which notification badges were implemented in the ITS, as compared to a period without notification badges. Moreover, we used psychological network analysis to evaluate whether closing knowledge gaps was associated with students’ performance relative to other relevant factors.\nResults: Students closed 28% of their knowledge gaps when the adaptive red button notification badge nudged them but only closed 5% when there was no red button. Closing knowledge gaps predicted better student performance and was a more important predictor than students’ usage behavior, other system features, and teachers’ assignment types.\nConclusions: Our study highlights the relevance of adaptive nudges within ITS for closing knowledge gaps and shows that closing knowledge gaps is linked to students’ performance.",

Here, we capitalized on a large data set (3,158 students; 257,321 problem sets) from an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) and employed state-of-the-art psychological network analysis. Using psychological network analysis allowed us to visualize and quantify interdependencies between students’ performance on different fraction and algebra subtopics. We observed relatively high partial correlations between algebra subtopics and between fraction subtopics, respectively. We also found that two fraction subtopics significantly predicted four algebra subtopics.

          "authors": "Vismay Agrawal; Ruben Eero Laukkonen",
          "abstract": "Meditation has been shown to reduce various forms of suffering and increase well-being. However, its broad effectiveness raises the question: In what way does meditation reduce suffering? We explore this question systematically, proposing that meditation’s effectiveness stems not from addressing specific types of suffering but from dismantling underlying mechanisms that create the conditions for suffering. We examine suffering from three frameworks: well-being (hedonia/eudaimonia), contemporary mindfulness (non-reactivity), and traditional Buddhist practice (ignorance). While these approaches may correspond to phenomenologically similar states with less suffering, they reinforce different underlying habits, thereby affecting the probability of suffering arising in the future. Second, we highlight this difference using the action-perception cycle as our analytical tool. Particularly, we cast suffering as self-reinforcing action-perception cycles, and unreliable/reliable reduction from suffering as unstable/stable equilibrium in action-perception cycles. Third, we propose four stages through which meditation facilitates a reliable reduction by progressively revealing that suffering, typically perceived as a passive experience, is in fact a specific pattern of action we are engaged in (i.e., meditation provides a reliable way to reduce enacted suffering). Our framework provides a foundation for mathematically formalizing and computationally modelling non-reactivity, ignorance (in the Buddhist sense), and suffering, and has implications for the larger goal of understanding perception, action, and conscious experience.",

One explanation for this effect is response suppression, by which an item is removed from the set of retrieval candidates once recalled. The present study aimed at (1) determining the generality of this effect by extending it to the visuospatial domain, and (2) identifying the locus of the effect by using a forward/backward recall procedure. After a first unsuccessful attempt to replicate the Ranschburg effect using visuospatial stimuli, we sought to replicate the original effect using verbal materials. An additional series of three experiments failed to replicate the Ranschburg effect, including in experimental situations in which it had initially been observed. Simulations show that if the Ranschburg effect exists, it is unlikely to be explained by response suppression. The present study questions the importance of the Ranschburg effect for models of WM.",

However, this research has rarely included socially aversive traits which are characterized by self-centered and socially antagonistic behavior. The current study examined the interplay between life events and four aversive traits—narcissistic admiration, narcissistic rivalry, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy in a sample of young adults aged 18 to 30. A total of N = 871 university students were assessed four times over two years (NT2 = 553, NT3 = 567, NT4 = 539). Latent change models were used to estimate (a) associations between baseline trait levels and the occurrence of these events at T3 (selection effects) and (b) associations between life events at T3 and subsequent changes in trait levels (socialization effects). While two of five preregistered selection hypotheses were confirmed, all four socialization hypotheses were rejected. Exploratory analyses revealed associations predominantly concerning psychopathy. For example, starting a new job, becoming the victim of a crime, and losing a family member were all associated with a relative increase in psychopathy. The results support the notion of selection and socialization effects for psychopathy, but are less clear for the other aversive traits.",

          "abstract": "Background. The current study investigated relations between a broad set of postpartum depression (PPD) risk- and protective factors, their centrality and unique relations with PPD symptoms. Methods. Mixed graphical network models were estimated in cross-sectional data collected during Phase 7 (2012-2015) of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Half of the 57,518 women were included in exploratory model 1, the other half in model 2 for cross-validation. A broad selection of biopsychosocial factors were modelled, including sociodemographic variables, indices of maternal health (behavior), pregnancy course, support, infant variables, and stressors. Results. A densely connected network of risk- and protective factors was obtained. Pregnancy duration, infant intensive care unit placement, infertility treatment, birth weight, income, and childbirth classes were ranked amongst the most central variables in the model. Out of 35 biopsychosocial factors included in the model, 11 were robustly related with PPD across both samples. High income, pre-pregnancy physical activity, pregnancy intention, and prenatal care focusing on depression risk were related to lower depression severity. Several other variables, including prior history of depression, pre-pregnancy dieting, prenatal risk behavior, and personal stressors were uniquely related to increased depression severity. Depressive complaints reduced with increased time since delivery. Women experiencing depressive symptoms were more likely to rely on aid from health workers postpartum. Results from models 1 and 2 were largely identical. Conclusions. Although cross-sectional in nature, these findings shed light on the complex associations between key risk- and protective factors for PPD, with implications for early detection and prevention.",

The authors conclude that Centaur provides “…tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories” and suggest that it makes an important contribution to building a unified theory of cognition. In our view, the curation of the Psych-101 database of psychological experiments is a valuable resource for training and testing LLMs as models of human cognition. However, we highlight three major problems with Centaur that undermine the authors’ conclusions. First, Centaur was not subjected to severe tests and therefore, it is unclear whether Centaur accounts for many phenomena (effects) that are informative regarding psychological theory. Second, the model is not limited by the most basic mechanistic constraints of human cognition. Therefore, it produces wildly implausible behaviour when subjected to simple experimental manipulations and/or absurd instructions. Third, even if the model did behave like a human under such manipulations, it is unclear what theoretical insights would have been gained. Successful prediction does not imply successful explanation, and as cognitive scientists the development of explanatory theories is our main goal.",

          "authors": "Graeme Lithgow",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a paradigm-shifting framework for understanding neurodivergent cognition through the lens of adaptive specialization. Drawing from the Information Bottleneck Principle and Narrative Resilience Theory, we reconceptualize conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and aphantasia as distinct cognitive architectures—each reflecting trade-offs that prioritize certain processing modes over others. Rather than viewing these traits as pathological deficits, we argue they represent evolved strategies of cognitive optimization within complex environments. This integrated, network-level model highlights how structural constraints (e.g., reduced visual imagery in aphantasia) may give rise to compensatory enhancements in verbal-symbolic reasoning, memory systems, and emotional resilience. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, clinical psychology, and information theory, the paper offers testable predictions, practical applications for therapy and education, and a strong case for abandoning deficit-based frameworks in favor of cognitive equity. The model also introduces the “Narrative Resilience Variant” (NRV), a subtype marked by strong autobiographical coherence and resistance to trauma collapse—despite atypical working memory profiles. This approach not only challenges prevailing diagnostic models but offers a robust template for future research on cognitive diversity.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance—including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness—to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.",

The study finds that dreams can be categorized into two interaction modes: controllable dreams and self-answered dreams. Both modes are significantly influenced by the response delay of the AI: when the delay exceeds 15 minutes, the probability of interface emergence in dreams increases substantially; in contrast, delays shorter than one second lead to chaotic dreams in which interfaces fail to form. We further propose that dreams internalize not only the content of interaction, but also its structure and form. This mechanism may be linked to the “prediction error compensation” process in predictive coding theory. In addition, we hypothesize that the emergent structure of dream interfaces fundamentally follows the same rational function form observed in biological response systems.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a paradigm-shifting framework for understanding neurodivergent cognition through the lens of adaptive specialization. Drawing from the Information Bottleneck Principle and Narrative Resilience Theory, we reconceptualize conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and aphantasia as distinct cognitive architectures—each reflecting trade-offs that prioritize certain processing modes over others. Rather than viewing these traits as pathological deficits, we argue they represent evolved strategies of cognitive optimization within complex environments. This integrated, network-level model highlights how structural constraints (e.g., reduced visual imagery in aphantasia) may give rise to compensatory enhancements in verbal-symbolic reasoning, memory systems, and emotional resilience. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, clinical psychology, and information theory, the paper offers testable predictions, practical applications for therapy and education, and a strong case for abandoning deficit-based frameworks in favor of cognitive equity. The model also introduces the “Narrative Resilience Variant” (NRV), a subtype marked by strong autobiographical coherence and resistance to trauma collapse—despite atypical working memory profiles. This approach not only challenges prevailing diagnostic models but offers a robust template for future research on cognitive diversity.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive models. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems produces brittle responses, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms—statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. We argue that building a robust science of AI–psychology requires integrating two of our field’s foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands far more rigorous validation processes. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output—endorsing “I am anxious”—requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to classify, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.",

The potential relationships between RT and item discrimination remain less explored. In this study, we propose a model for simultaneously estimating the relationships between RT and item discrimination at the person, item, and person-by-item (residual) levels and illustrate our approach through an item-level meta-analysis of 37 empirical datasets comprising approximately 850,000 item responses. We find no evidence of average differences in item discrimination between items of different time intensity or persons of different average RT, while residual RT strongly and negatively predicts item discrimination (pooled coef. = -.31% per 1% difference in RT, SE = .04, tau = .22). While heterogeneity is high and several datasets show strong positive or negative relationships, we find no evidence of moderation by overall dataset characteristics. Flexible generalized additive models show that the relationship between residual RT and item discrimination is generally curvilinear, with discrimination maximized just below average RT and minimized at the extremes. Our results suggest that RT data can provide insights into the measurement properties of educational and psychological assessments, but that the relationships between RT and item discrimination are highly variable.",

These “measurement phantoms”—statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena—threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition—using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation—“LLM selfhood”—showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.",

Les mesures acoustiques de la VC comprennent une proportion de f0 non-fiable, une mesure de pente spectrale (H1*−H2*) et deux rapports harmonique-bruit (CPP et HNR entre 0 et 500 Hz). Les résultats pour le genre témoignent collectivement de plus grande présence de VC chez les hommes que les femmes. Les différences d’âge sont plus modestes : les locuteurs plus âgés démontrent provisoirement plus de VC que les locuteurs plus jeunes. Cela suggère que la production de VC a une base physiologique.

          "abstract": "Dark humour has been examined as part of a broader taxonomy of humour styles in psychological research. The Comic Style Markers (CSM) is currently the only standardised measure that captures four distinct dark comic styles (i.e., sarcasm, cynicism, irony, and satire) and has been used to explore how they relate to personality traits and other individual differences. This systematic review synthesises findings from 18 empirical studies identified through Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and PubMed.\nSome dark comic styles were linked to socially aversive traits and lower agreeableness, particularly sarcasm and cynicism, which also showed the most consistent associations with poorer well-being outcomes such as stress, anxiety, and reduced life satisfaction. Irony showed more mixed associations, at times linked to negative affect but also to insight, meaning, and workplace functioning.\nSatire appeared more contextually flexible – with some positive associations particularly when controlling for sarcasm and cynicism. Irony and satire showed links to strengths and wisdom that were similar to patterns more commonly seen in those who prefer lighter comic styles.\nDark comic styles were more prevalent among men, younger individuals, and those with more critical or non-traditional worldviews. These styles were largely unrelated to intelligence or resilience but were associated with greater acceptance of taboo humour. While certain styles reflected antagonistic traits or poorer well-being, others were linked to positive qualities, suggesting that dark humour is a psychologically meaningful but diverse construct. \nFindings are discussed in relation to broader humour literature and applied relevance.",

Through rigorous thermodynamic analysis, we demonstrate that any biologically feasible response function S(\\tau) must satisfy three fundamental conditions: (1) saturation (\\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty}S(\\tau)=k), (2) optimization (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2S}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau^2}&lt;0), and (3) stability (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau}&gt;0). Under these constraints, the simplest rational function solution S(\\tau)=\\frac{k\\tau}{\\tau_0+\\tau} emerges naturally, unifying phenomena across multiple biological scales - from molecular (Michaelis-Menten kinetics) to neural (predictive coding) and behavioral levels (free energy principle). The work further excludes non-compliant function forms (e.g., unbounded polynomials) and outlines extensions for chaotic and quantum biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies of self-relevance have largely utilized self-name and self-face stimuli. The goal of this study was to examine whether previously observed ERP effects of self-relevance occur using a diverse set of pictorial stimuli. Participant-submitted photos were used as both targets and distractors in an oddball task. When the participants’ own photos were used as targets, P300 amplitude was higher compared to familiar targets as well as the previously unseen categorical targets. When the participants’ own photos were used as distractors, P300 amplitude was comparable to both familiar targets and categorical targets. P300 amplitude to participants’ photos did not correlate with their perceived involvement with the subject photographed as measured by the Revised Personal Involvement Inventory. We interpret these findings as suggesting that the attentional salience of information relating to the self extends beyond highly self-relevant cues such as one’s own name or face. All stimuli that the participants had exposure to prior to the task (i.e., their own photos and the familiar target stimuli) elicited a frontal positivity which was greater than what was elicited by previously unseen stimuli. Thus, parietal activity may better discriminate self-relevance from mere familiarity.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience has attempted to understand the underlying functioning of one's body experience. This has resulted in standardised methods involving multisensory manipulations and measurable constructs. These approaches contribute to the important goal of creating a cumulative and reproducible science. However, they may sometimes fail to capture important yet complex and nuanced qualities of experience. We propose that combining qualitative methods employed in design research centered on body experiences, together with quantitative approaches from neuroscience and psychology, can yield a richer account without compromising quantitative rigour. This integration of quantitative and qualitative methods, we argue, may be particularly valuable when dealing with one's body perception. Without pretending to fundamentally solve methodological discrepancies between qualitative and quantitative approaches, we propose a conciliatory take. For this purpose, we provide a synthesis of tools and methods from design research that could be useful in three steps of the research inquiry: the experimental design, data collection, and data analysis. Our suggested mixed methods approach aims to account for individual differences, produce more nuanced insights, increase transparency, foster multidisciplinarity, and potentially speed progress in some aspects of the research program.",

Partiendo de la hipótesis de que la dificultad para encontrar una pareja considerada adecuada y estable en estos perfiles puede estar estrechamente relacionada con su habilidad para persuadir a mujeres a involucrarse sexualmente en etapas tempranas, se plantea que dicha capacidad incrementa la probabilidad de encuentros sexuales sin vínculo emocional suficiente para activar la liberación de neuroquímicos del apego como oxitocina y vasopresina.\n\nEsta combinación podría inducir un ciclo de disonancia cognitiva o evitación aparente tras el encuentro, no porque la pareja potencial sea inadecuada per se, sino como resultado de sus propios procesos neuroquímicos al no haber habido tiempo suficiente para consolidar un vínculo emocional previo a la relación sexual.

          "abstract": "The widespread prevalence of child marriage across distinct ancient and medieval civilizations suggests the presence of a common underlying mechanism. This article proposes that the cross-cultural emergence of child marriage may be rooted in evolutionary adaptations from the Paleolithic period, when short life expectancy exerted reproductive pressure to mate early. These pressures may have shaped psychological predispositions and hormonal mechanisms that later fossilized into enduring cultural institutions—persisting even after their biological necessity had faded. Drawing on the concept of cultural lag and cross-civilizational patterns, the paper advances a theory of unconscious evolutionary continuity that can explain both the ubiquity and resilience of child marriage practices. The hypothesis neither justifies the institution nor minimizes its harms, but rather seeks to understand its deep historical and biological roots.",

          "abstract": "The possibility of influencing speech perception through the priming of a social variable has been shown in studies with subtle and explicit priming methods. However, failures in replicating the effects in newer experiments have cast doubt over the phenomenon. This paper reports on the attempt of replicating subtle and explicit social priming in a Norwegian context, by attempting to prime two Norwegian linguistic variants. Eighty-four participants carried out a vowel matching task in which the vowel /ʉː/ was expected to be perceived differently depending on which condition the participant was randomly assigned to (Urban East Norwegian or Oslo-East). For explicit social priming, participants were told the origin of the speaker who uttered the sentences. For subtle social priming, different newspapers were used with the intention of subliminally priming the participant. The results were analyzed using Bayesian multi-level ordinal probit models. The models showed anecdotal to moderate evidence for the null hypothesis in the case of explicit priming and none to anecdotal evidence for the null for subtle priming. The results from our study cast doubt over whether social priming can affect speech perception. Claims on social priming regarding speech perception thus need careful empirical evaluation.",

We modelled the developmental interplay between chaos and achievement, including their reverse association (i.e., achievement chaos), and its aetiology in up to 7,591 twin pairs (49% female), who were born in the mid-90s in the UK and assessed at age 9, 12, and 16 years. Associations between household chaos and educational achievement were consistently negative, bidirectional, and of small effect sizes across ages. These associations were best explained by genetic and environmental confounding. Family SES accounted for most of the confounding in the predictions from achievement to chaos; for the reverse, environments shared within families but distinct from SES were implied. Our findings suggest that long-term associations between children’s experiences of household chaos and educational achievement are modest and non-causal.",

          "abstract": "Stress in interpreting has been well researched over the last few decades. This study takes a multimodal approach to investigate the distinct effects of emotional and cognitive load on interpreter stress. 20 student interpreters consecutively interpreted four first-person mental healthcare narratives from Turkish to English that varied in emotional content and difficulty, within a 2×2 factorial design. Cognitive and emotional responses were captured using galvanic skin response (GSR), prosodic features (pitch and intensity), and three self-report measures (PANAS, STAI, and NASA-TLX). The stimuli were normed using traditional readability indices, expert ratings, and novel natural language processing techniques to control emotional valence and linguistic complexity. The results showed that physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, was primarily driven by cognitive load, particularly during the later stages of interpreting. Emotional load, on the other hand, was more clearly reflected in prosodic markers (especially pitch) and negative affect ratings. The results also hinted at a convergence in pitch between the source speaker and the interpreter. Notably, emotional and cognitive load began to take its toll from the latter stages of the listening phase onwards. However, none of the objective or subjective stress measures predicted interpreting accuracy, suggesting that performance may be mediated by individual coping strategies. The findings are expected to have implications for interpreting pedagogy and the development of cognitive and emotional support strategies in high-stakes interpreting contexts.",

We found that for “win-relevant” features, children chose easier settings when playing to win than when playing for fun. By contrast, for “win-irrelevant” features, children generally preferred similar settings across conditions. Children also judged “win-relevant” factors as more important to winning than “win-irrelevant” factors, and judged both as irrelevant to having fun.

          "abstract": "Social norms shape a vast range of human behaviors, from everyday interactions to major life choices. Yet, existing theories of norm emergence typically focus either on why certain norms arise (substantive properties) or on how they spread and persist (dynamical properties), often making conflicting assumptions. Here, we propose a unified account in which norms prescribing how one ought to act emerge naturally from the fundamental algorithms that guide learning—whether in social or non-social settings. Our account builds on recent advances in decision-making and emotion research that have highlighted ‘actor-critic’ models as a core mechanism of learning from feedback. We extend this mechanism to social settings by assuming that it is not only we who critique our actions, others critique our actions as well. By simulating this interindividual form of learning, we show that it uniquely produces group behavior that exhibits both substantive and dynamical properties of real-world social norms, including prosociality, ingroup bias, stickiness, S-shaped curves, and local conformity / global diversity. Our framework thus offers a uniquely parsimonious way to bridge the gap between individual learning and group behavior.",

This study investigates the relationship between perceived stress and job involvement among IT professionals in India. A total of 300 participants (150 males and 150 females), aged 22–50 years, were selected using purposive sampling. Data were collected using the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1988) and the Job Involvement Scale (Dhar &amp; Srivastava), and analyzed through descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation, independent samples t-tests, multiple regression and moderation analyses. Results revealed a significant negative correlation between perceived stress and job involvement, supporting existing research that high stress diminishes job-related psychological investment. Regression analysis confirmed that perceived stress is a significant predictor of job involvement even after controlling for demographic variables such as age and experience. No significant gender differences were found in stress or job involvement levels, echoing the findings of Keskin (2008) and Tiwari &amp; Singh (2014), which emphasized job conditions over personal demographics. These findings reinforce the theoretical framework linking job stress to reduced engagement and highlight the importance of supportive organizational practices to mitigate stress and promote employee involvement. Implications for HR policy and mental health interventions are discussed in the context of sustaining workforce resilience in the IT industry.",

          "authors": "Dmitry Nikolaev",
          "abstract": "This article explores the development of G. Kelly’s ideas on rethinking existing approaches to understanding the sources and main characteristics of human activity. It demonstrates that by employing a complex, multidimensional image of a “constructive human being”, which integrates numerous partial images, it is possible to fundamentally reject the concept of “motivation”. This seemingly paradoxical step has non–trivial methodological, theoretical, and practical consequences. For instance, it helps us overcome unconscious assumptions from classical mechanics. These assumptions suggest that a human remains at rest until external forces act upon them, providing “psychic energy” and compelling them to act according to the resultant forces. Motivation is “re–described” through the broad process of construction – constructing oneself, one’s behavior, and, through it, the surrounding world. In this context, self–determination, freedom, and autonomy emerge as essential characteristics of a human being as a living organism. Any motivating impact is viewed as facilitation, the creation of conditions for potential change, or the support of the ongoing direction of human activity construction. Therefore, practices of such facilitation should not be motivation–centered but truly human–centered, based on the image of a free, autonomous, dignified, and capable of the act human being.",

          "abstract": "Larger food portions relate to higher food consumption. Thus, habitually finishing meals by eating the entire portion (so-called plate clearing or plate cleaning) may lead to weight gain. However, findings have been mixed: some studies reported small, positive associations between self-reported plate clearing tendencies and body mass index but other studies did not find a relationship or even reported a negative association. The current study performed a meta-analysis on the correlation between plate clearing tendencies and body mass index. The pooled effect based on 22 samples was r = 0.04 (95% CI [0.02, 0.10]), indicating no relationship between plate clearing and body mass index. A meta-regression indicated that the percentage of women as well as the type of self-report measure moderated the effect, suggesting that there might be a small, positive relationship between plate clearing and body mass index in men and when the Plate Clearing Tendency Scale was used. In conclusion, this meta-analysis does not indicate that habitual plate clearing relates to a higher body weight in general. Whereas self-report biases cannot be excluded based on the current study, persons with plate clearing tendencies may have learned to adjust self-served portion sizes or may compensate caloric intake by increasing energy expenditure, thus preventing weight gain.",

In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families—mothers’ educational attainment when children were 5 years old significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]). Using path models with polygenic scores, we disentangled genetic transmission (shared genetics) from environmentally mediated effects. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, derived from interview recordings when children were 5 years old, accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational outcomes. These findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

We performed these experiments as part of an adversarial collaboration to test contrasting theories of consciousness; Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Predictive Processing Active Inference (AI), and Predictive Processing Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) accounts. According to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, non-activatable retinotopic cortical regions,  such as the blind spot region for the ipsilateral eye, create a different cause-effect structure and therefore should contribute differently to the perceived quality of space of activatable retinotopic regions. The two Predictive Processing accounts, in contrast, posit that internal models will accommodate structural deviations around the blindspot based on the available sensory evidence (particulars of this accommodation differ between the two accounts). We present a series of paradigms in which participants evaluate distances and areas that either include the blind spot or not (without stimulating it directly), as well as illusory motion that is either adjacent to the blind spot or not. We model psychometric functions relating perceived and objective space. These models vary in terms of bias and precision according to the experimental conditions (blind spot involved vs. not involved, ipsilateral vs. contralateral eye), making it possible to quantify the potential disruption of subjective spatial extendedness induced by the blind spot. We present simulated results for each experiment corresponding to the predictions of each account, and conclude by discussing challenges and plans for dissemination.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of small numbers. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Scholarly insight that player-avatar relations range from unity to resembling human-to-human interactions has prompted research into the dynamics behind this variability. The player-avatar interaction model (PAX) and its corresponding measure, the common player-avatar interaction scale (cPAX), were recently developed to describe these relational dynamics; however, until now, they have not been independently evaluated. Thus, our study aimed to test cPAX’s dimensionality and reliability in a separate sample and investigate the functioning of PAX’s critical concern dimension due to inconsistent findings about its relationship to perceived avatar sociality. Using a cross-sectional survey of 398 World of Warcraft players, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on cPAX, assessed the internal consistency of its four subscales, and examined the relationships between PAX dimensions and sense of presence. Our results supported the four-factor cPAX model, demonstrating strong reliability for relational closeness, anthropomorphic autonomy, and critical concern subscales, while sense of control showed minimally acceptable reliability. Contrary to our hypothesis, critical concern positively correlated with sense of presence, suggesting it reflects players’ desire for coherence in avatars’ stories and worlds rather than their plausibility or realism. Consequently, we interpret critical concern as distinct from its empirical origin, suspension of disbelief, with evidence indicating that both phenomena may enhance sense of presence and are involved in narrative and social aspects of gaming. Overall, our findings support the suitability of PAX and cPAX for applied research while emphasizing the need for continued attention to reliability of sense of control measures and to the role of critical concern in gaming.",

          "abstract": "Neural network modeling has played a central role in psycholinguistic studies of lexical processing, but the recent advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a different approach that may yield new insights into the mental lexicon. Four chatbots are prompted across three experiments to test how their LLMs generate psycholinguistic ratings of words in comparison with humans. LLM ratings, averaged across varying list contexts, were found to be highly correlated with human ratings, and differences in correlation strengths were partly explained by differences in rating ambiguity. LLM context manipulations strengthened correlations with human ratings through better calibration, and variability in LLM ratings was correlated with human inter-rater variability. We conclude that LLMs used context to guide the human-like assembly of psycholinguistic rating functions, rather than recalling ratings from training data. Additional results from testing LLM generation of word naming latencies showed that function assembly is currently limited by patterns of co-occurrence in textual data. Patterns at more fine-grained timescales are needed in training data to model online lexical processes.",

Drawing on the Free Energy Principle (Friston), Hebbian learning, and Hinton’s neural network theory, CogIntel seeks to emulate the brain’s predictive coding mechanisms while reinforcing synaptic adaptability through real-time intervention and feedback.\n\nThe system operates via a tri-phasic architecture: cognitive decoding, targeted intervention, and reinforcement optimization. In this model, AI interprets neural and behavioral data to guide individualized digital cognitive therapies or neuromodulatory strategies (e.g., neurofeedback, tDCS), optimizing them continuously based on user-specific patterns and outcomes.\n\nCogIntel is specifically designed to address neurodegenerative and neurocognitive conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). By leveraging adaptive learning algorithms and neural interface systems, CogIntel aims not merely to mitigate symptoms but to support systemic cognitive restoration and functional rewiring.\n\nAt its core, CogIntel is built on the belief that the brain can heal itself — that within its architecture lies an inherent potential for self-repair. By harnessing the principles of neuroplasticity and Hebbian plasticity, and accelerating them through intelligent systems, CogIntel acts as a catalyst: amplifying the brain’s own capacity to adapt, reorganize, and evolve.

          "authors": "Olya Bulatova; Keisuke Fukuda",
          "abstract": "Recently, in a novel paradigm, Bulatova and Fukuda (2025) showed that making an arbitrary prediction about a future event was sufficient to induce robust false memories of the event even when it never took place. Here, we tested whether this prediction-based false memory reflects the adaptability of our predictive processing mechanism. More precisely, we hypothesized that the higher the likelihood of prediction confirmation, the stronger the prediction-based false memory would be. In Experiment 1a and 1b, we manipulated the prediction accuracy during encoding (30% and 70%) across experiments and found that prediction-based false memory was indeed greater when the prediction accuracy was higher. Furthermore, in Experiment 2a and 2b, we demonstrated that this modulatory effect persisted even when prediction accuracy was varied across encoding blocks within the same experiment, thus highlighting the dynamic nature of this adaptive process. Lastly, we established that this dynamic updating was not explained by explicit awareness of prediction accuracy manipulation. Taken together, our findings suggest that prediction-based false memory is dynamically updated based on the reliability of predictions, reflecting the adaptability of the predictive processing mechanism.",

          "authors": "Praveen Suthaharan; Santiago Castiello de Obeso; Yuen-Siang Ang; Philip R. Corlett",
          "abstract": "Processing uncertainty may be pathognomonic (characteristic of a disease) for some psychiatric conditions. Some people expect the world to change, even when it doesn’t. This tendency is central to paranoia, where individuals often anticipate threat or change without clear evidence. But what determines whether these beliefs translate into behavior? One possibility is that metacognitive structure – the coherence and depth with which one articulates their own thinking – acts as a buffer. An agent may endorse a belief but have sufficient accessory hypotheses to insulate it from action. To test this, we used metacognitive prompting in GPT-4 to score individual reflections on open-ended questions (e.g., did you use any particular strategy?) after completing a probabilistic reversal learning task. Individuals with higher paranoia demonstrate lower metacognitive structure (t = 5.98, p &lt; 0.001), with metacognition moderating the relationship between volatility belief and switching behavior (β = -0.05, p = 0.001) even after controlling for reflection verbosity and general cognitive ability. These findings suggest that metacognition protects against uncertainty-driven instability, pointing to a key mechanism by which reflection protects against cognition under change. This work provides a novel framework to measure metacognition from behavioral task debrief questions.",

          "abstract": "Planning is an expensive computational operation that easily exhausts our cognitive resources. For this reason, it is critical to learn strategies to initiate planning wisely. Although recent advances have shown where and how planning should be engaged to aid adaptive behavior, little is known about when planning should be engaged. Here, we investigate how individuals choose to engage or delay planning. For this purpose, we developed a task where, at certain decision points in a multistep decision problem, it is optimal to delay planning and relinquish control because all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two studies, we show that humans can optimally delay planning and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. In doing so, we demonstrate that meta-policies to engage or delay planning are not simply learned from experienced outcomes, rather, they are constructed by searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can optimally delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "Desde edades tempranas, muchos niños expresan un liderazgo innato o talentos extraordinarios que permanecen invisibles al ojo clínico convencional, no por falta de evidencia, sino porque no existe una métrica diseñada para reconocer lo que aún no se nombra formalmente. PRIHA (Proyective Reading Inferential High Ability) ofrece un modelo de psicometría narrativa inferencial capaz de detectar genialidad y necesidades emocionales invisibles mediante el análisis profundo de narrativas autobiográficas y asociaciones simbólicas, incluso cuando los niños no pueden expresarlo conscientemente.\n\nEste modelo parte de un vacío crucial: estudios estiman que el 70% de niños con altas capacidades permanece sin identificar en sistemas educativos tradicionales (Cross &amp; Cross, 2015), mientras que la falta de atención a sus necesidades emocionales incrementa hasta en un 50% la probabilidad de desarrollar frustración, ansiedad o retraimiento social en la adolescencia (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2016). PRIHA analiza complejidad lingüística, riqueza simbólica, coherencia temporal y causalidad narrativa para inferir perfiles proyectados de CI, motivación, tolerancia a la ambigüedad y resiliencia emocional, todo sustentado en neurociencia del lenguaje (Schultz, 2007) y teorías de mentalización (Fonagy et al., 2002).\n\nA diferencia de las baterías clínicas convencionales, que pueden costar entre 200 y 1,200 USD por evaluación y requieren múltiples sesiones presenciales de varias horas, PRIHA es capaz de procesar una narrativa en menos de 15 minutos, con análisis automático de IA, eliminando la necesidad de desplazamientos, profesionales intermediarios y altos costos. Gracias a su naturaleza digital y escalable, el modelo está diseñado para ser de acceso gratuito y universal, asegurando que cada niño, sin importar su ubicación o contexto socioeconómico, pueda ser evaluado en su propio idioma y entorno cultural.\n\nInspirado en la idea de que medir lo que no se nombra es la única vía para transformar lo que se ignora, PRIHA democratiza la identificación temprana del liderazgo y potencial oculto, ofreciendo un marco ético y clínico que reduce el sesgo social y cultural. Este enfoque reivindica la posibilidad de ver en cada niño —incluyendo al niño que todo líder lector de este documento fue alguna vez— el capital humano único que, si se acompaña con respeto y conciencia, puede traducirse en individuos resilientes, creativos y comprometidos con construir sociedades más equitativas, inclusivas y evolucionadas.",

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "La fantasía proyectiva es un proceso neuropsicológico en el que la mente construye relatos que, aunque puedan distorsionar la objetividad, permiten sostener la autoestima, modular el estrés y adaptarse a entornos complejos. Este documento presenta un análisis clínico y simbólico sobre cómo líderes e influencers utilizan, consciente o inconscientemente, la fantasía proyectiva para enunciar verdades reprimidas, crear nuevas narrativas colectivas y transformar la percepción de quienes los rodean. Estudios recientes indican que el 80% de los adultos mantiene creencias ilusorias para proteger su estabilidad emocional (Sharot et al., 2011), mientras que el 72% de jóvenes declara identificarse con influencers que expresan ideas que temían reconocer por sí mismos (Pew Research Center, 2023).\n\nDesde la neurociencia, se describe cómo la liberación de dopamina y oxitocina fortalece la fijación positiva de las palabras del líder cuando sus mensajes validan emociones reprimidas, mientras que la activación de la amígdala y el cortisol puede generar rechazo ante verdades que amenazan la autoimagen (LeDoux, 1998; Schultz, 2007). En términos evolutivos, se fundamenta que la capacidad de construir narrativas convincentes, incluso parciales o simbólicas, ofreció ventajas adaptativas para cohesionar grupos y generar sentido de pertenencia (Trivers, 2011).\n\nEl texto introduce un sesgo proyectivo de autocompasión, amor y empatía, para que líderes comprendan que las reacciones de los demás no son su responsabilidad, pero que su capacidad de nombrar lo innombrable les otorga un poder que debe ejercerse con conciencia, ética y equilibrio emocional. La fantasía proyectiva, cuando es integrada conscientemente, se convierte en herramienta simbólica para generar insights, motivar transformaciones positivas y construir entornos de diálogo y resiliencia.\n\nSe concluye que la fantasía proyectiva, lejos de ser una “mentira”, puede ser comprendida como un recurso humano esencial para resignificar experiencias, catalizar la integración de nuevas verdades y fortalecer un liderazgo empático, congruente y responsable, que inspire desde la autenticidad sin sacrificar el propio bienestar emocional.",

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "Las relaciones afectivas intensas pueden detonar circuitos neuroquímicos de fijación similares a los observados en la adicción, activando de forma simultánea sistemas dopaminérgicos (motivación y recompensa anticipatoria), oxitocinérgicos (apego y vinculación) y mecanismos de refuerzo variable, ampliamente documentados en estudios de neuromarketing como responsables de la creación de lealtad compulsiva hacia marcas, productos y figuras. Esta similitud funcional sugiere que los patrones neurobiológicos que sostienen la fijación emocional en relaciones desorganizadas pueden analizarse, predecirse y modularse con herramientas derivadas tanto de la neurociencia del consumo como de la psicología del apego. Presentamos un ejercicio neuroquímico aplicado como estrategia de reequilibrio para cortar la fijación en vínculos intensos, basado en ayuno de dopamina, sustitución controlada de fuentes de recompensa, reactivación funcional de oxitocina mediante contacto seguro y estabilización de serotonina con hábitos conductuales. A través de una guía de 30 días se propone entrenar al cerebro a reorganizar sus patrones motivacionales, ofreciendo una alternativa para autorregular circuitos de apego mediante experiencias diseñadas, como se hace en intervenciones de neuromarketing que buscan desplazar asociaciones emocionales hacia nuevas metas o marcas. Este protocolo parte de la evidencia que vincula intermitencia emocional con liberación intensa de dopamina (Schultz et al., 1997) y teorías evolutivas que explican la función adaptativa del apego en términos de retención de pareja (Hazelton &amp; Buss, 2000), así como estudios que muestran que rupturas amorosas activan el núcleo accumbens de forma casi idéntica a la abstinencia de drogas (Fisher et al., 2010). Al traducir estos hallazgos en una metodología práctica, se ofrece un modelo de autocondicionamiento dirigido a cortar fijaciones afectivas con la misma lógica que programas de fidelización o branding neuroemocional, pero orientado a la salud mental del individuo. Este trabajo busca abrir un camino interdisciplinario entre neurobiología, psicología del apego y neuroeconomía, proponiendo que, al comprender y dirigir deliberadamente nuestros estímulos externos y externos, podemos guiar al cerebro a reprogramar sus circuitos de apego sin recurrir a fármacos ni a intervenciones exclusivamente psicológicas, sino usando los mismos mecanismos que la industria del neuromarketing emplea para generar deseo, engagement y lealtad, pero aplicados a la liberación emocional y la autorregulación.",

          "abstract": "La presente carta, dirigida a niños con rasgos de liderazgo temprano, propone una intervención simbólica basada en fundamentos neurobiológicos, psicológicos y socioculturales para promover un liderazgo empático, equilibrado y responsable. Su objetivo es brindar a niños que poseen alta capacidad expresiva y natural tendencia a influir en su entorno, herramientas simbólicas que les permitan reconocer su propio poder, ejercerlo de forma constructiva y comprender que las emociones que despiertan en otros no son su culpa.\n\nDesde un marco teórico que articula la teoría del apego (Bowlby), los modelos de resonancia emocional y disonancia cognitiva (Festinger), y los principios neuroquímicos de la liberación de neurotransmisores como dopamina, oxitocina y cortisol (LeDoux, Carter), la carta traduce estos conceptos en un lenguaje comprensible para niños. Se incluye un sesgo proyectivo positivo intencionado que exalta el amor, la inclusión, la empatía y la identificación, al tiempo que introduce una fantasía proyectiva de estructura, congruencia y elocuencia para que los niños se perciban como líderes capaces de inspirar sin perder su equilibrio emocional.\n\nLa carta enseña a los niños a observar el efecto de sus palabras en los demás, a usar su talento para construir en lugar de herir, y a reconocer que un liderazgo auténtico requiere también autocuidado. Se presentan ejemplos adaptados al nivel cognitivo de la educación primaria, para que los pequeños identifiquen en sus conocimientos recientes de ciencias naturales la explicación neurobiológica de por qué sus palabras pueden generar amor, incomodidad o rechazo en quienes los rodean. Este enfoque innovador busca que el niño líder internalice su potencial como guía simbólico en su entorno inmediato, fomentando la autoaceptación, la empatía y la responsabilidad simbólica, sin imponer la responsabilidad emocional por los sentimientos de los demás.\n\nSe concluye que proveer marcos simbólicos de comprensión desde edades tempranas puede contribuir a la formación de líderes con un sentido de propósito genuino, capaces de construir espacios de diálogo sincero y resiliente, sin sacrificar su propia estabilidad emocional.",

          "abstract": "Las figuras conocidas como influencers o líderes de opinión no son meros generadores de contenido en redes sociales; son símbolos contemporáneos que, al nombrar verdades reprimidas o compartidas, despiertan profundos procesos proyectivos en la mente de sus seguidores. Este fenómeno combina idealización y evitación, generando amor u odio intensos que se fijan de manera permanente a través de rutas neuroquímicas, cognitivas y simbólicas. Basándonos en teorías de disonancia cognitiva (Festinger, 1957), activación amigdalar ante amenazas a la autoimagen (LeDoux, 1998) y mecanismos de apego oxitocínico (Carter, 1998), demostramos cómo un solo estímulo —la expresión de una verdad— puede detonar procesos neurobiológicos idénticos a los observados en las adicciones conductuales (Volkow et al., 2016).\n\nEste documento desglosa seis niveles de asociación que permiten entender por qué un influencer puede quedar fijado como figura de placer o amenaza: emocional, cognitiva, simbólica-cultural, neuroquímica, proyectiva personal y social-colectiva. Estudios recientes revelan que más del 70% de usuarios siguen a influencers que validan sus emociones reprimidas, mientras que un 40% admite revisar obsesivamente el contenido de figuras percibidas como auténticas (Pew Research Center, 2023). Sin embargo, cuando los mensajes del influencer confrontan creencias centrales de la estructura individual, la respuesta más probable es el rechazo y la evitación, activados por malestar emocional y disonancia cognitiva.\n\nEl análisis sugiere que el proceso de fijación proyectiva hacia el influencer es multifactorial y que, dependiendo del estado de integración emocional del seguidor, la experiencia puede llevar a un insight placentero o a una reacción hostil. Además, se discute cómo estas dinámicas pueden servir como catalizador en procesos terapéuticos al actuar como puente simbólico para liberar verdades reprimidas. La integración de evidencia neurobiológica y teorías del comportamiento ofrece un modelo novedoso para comprender el impacto de los influencers como figuras de resonancia estructural que generan adicción a la integración —o al rechazo— de la verdad.",

          "abstract": "Human beings demonstrate a universal impulse to share and consume stories. Over generations of transmission, within and across cultures, stories have evolved to develop regularities in their internal structures. Here, we investigated how two features of story structure – coherence and familiarity – impact recall as participants retold a story 5 days in a row. We predicted that familiar and coherent structures would be more stable over retellings. We measured stability using two novel story similarity measures of the (1) degree of structural change within storytellers, and (2) similarity in remembered structure across storytellers. Study 1 first validated our story similarity measure. Studies 2 and 3 then tracked the evolution of stories that varied in coherence and familiarity, respectively, using novel stories adapted from the popular “Cinderella” structure. Results showed that all stories became more structurally stable across retellings, with stories moving in a consistent direction (i.e., towards a consistent final form). However, retellings of a story with a more coherent and familiar structure showed both greater stability within and similarity across minds than retellings of a story with an incoherent (Study 2) or unfamiliar structure (Study 3). Thus, using novel tools to measure story evolution, our findings suggest that familiarity and coherence of a story structure offered it an advantage in memory, both within and across minds.",

While traditional social neuroscience approach has made significant progress in mapping isolated social cognitive processes, it often fails to capture the complexity of real-world social environment—where perception, decision-making, and interaction unfold simultaneously and contextually. In this review, we introduce naturalistic social neuroscience as a paradigm shift that bridges this gap through incorporating multidisciplinary naturalistic measurements, which integrates lab-based simulation such as movie watching and virtual reality, real-world embedded measures like digital phenotyping and wearables devices, as well as the strategic combination of multiple approaches. The framework also includes an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered multilevel data analysis to synthesize behavioral, computational, and neurobiological data to reveal the mechanism underline real-world behaviors. Finally, we propose opportunities, critical considerations, and future directions for pushing forward naturalistic social neuroscience. This review broadens the view and equips researchers with an extended toolkit for understanding the richness of social behavior.",

DTC treats relations as ontologically primary: when five universal patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) synchronize within a substrate's binding window, a system experiences itself as a unified whole. Each substrate constructs distinct temporal realities: human cortex knits ~100 ms moments, plant networks weave seconds-long intervals, neuromorphic chips build microsecond temporal universes. Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS) quantifies this coordination, yielding testable predictions: 40-70% PTS drop under anesthesia, monotonic PTS gains as neuromorphic synchronization tightens, and correlation between PTS and behavioral flexibility across species. By revealing the hard problem as a category error of substance-first thinking, DTC reframes time itself as a product of relational coordination rather than a pre-existing container. If these predictions hold, consciousness will shift from biology's most stubborn mystery to physics' signature of self-organizing coherence.",

Path analyses revealed exploration at T1 predicted higher reflection at T2, while the intervention promoted exploration and action but not reflection at T2. No significant link emerged between reflection at T2 and action at T3. Findings highlight the role of heritage cultural identity exploration in youth’ critical consciousness development, and suggest identity based interventions can support its development.",

          "abstract": "As climate and environmental activism has increased in recent years, so too has government repression of disruptive, non-violent protests. There have been mixed findings on the (dis)inhibiting impact of this repression on continued activism. We examine the impacts of repression on intentions to engage in normative (conforming to societal rules) and non-normative (violating these rules) collective actions, in a sample of Extinction Rebellion UK activists (N = 1,375). We assess both anticipated and experienced repression as predictors of action intentions, over and above past activism and core social-psychological motives (identification, grievance, and efficacy). We demonstrate that, while anticipated repression has no direct effect on either collective action type, lived experiences of repression positively predict non-normative action intentions. Analysing emotional responses to repression demonstrates positive indirect effects of anticipated repression through anger/outrage for both collective action types, and through contempt for non-normative action, as well as a negative indirect effect on non-normative action intentions via increased fear. Experienced repression also has a galvanizing indirect effect of non-normative action intentions via reduced fear. These findings disentangle differing indirect emotional effects of anticipated and experienced repression on both kinds of action intentions. Importantly, they also reveal a galvanizing effect of lived experiences of repression on disruptive action intentions.",

To gain a comprehensive understanding of CC development in schools and address the potential conflation of individual student perceptions of school climates with their CC, we examined associations between students' and teachers' perceptions of racialized school climates—specifically assimilationism, color-evasion, multiculturalism, and CC —and students' CC of racialized inequities, including critical reflection, motivation, and interpersonal and structural action. Our sample comprised 832 students (M = 15.05 years, SD = 0.75, 44.5% female, 4.2% non-binary) and 198 teachers in 23 secondary schools in Thuringia, Germany, with data collected in 2022. Multilevel path analyses and school-level bivariate correlations revealed that student and teacher reports of CC climate were related to more, and teacher-reported assimilationism to less critical reflection. Effects for color-evasive and multiculturalist climates on various CC facets were mixed, including positive and negative effects across student and teacher reports. To cultivate youth CC as resource and tool for driving transformative change, measures fostering a CC climate should be taken, including social-justice oriented training programs for educators.",

          "abstract": "Human beings demonstrate a universal impulse to share and consume stories. Over generations of transmission, within and across cultures, stories have evolved, with some story structures surviving better than others. Here, we investigate the factors theorized to guide this selection. Across three studies, our project tracks the evolution of stories in real time as participants tell and retell a story for 5 days in a row. Each study varies the structure of the initial story to manipulate its familiarity and structure. We predict that stories with familiar structures will survive better across retellings. Study 1 tracks the evolution of a story with no recognizable structure using novel story structure metrics. Study 2 compares the evolution of a story with structure and without structure. Study 3 compares the evolution of a familiarly structured story with an unfamiliarly structured story. Results show that all stories become more structurally stable across retellings, with stories moving in a consistent direction (i.e., towards a consistent final form). Stories with more familiar structures show greater evolutionary stability: They are modified less than both unstructured (Study 2) and unfamiliar stories (Study 3), and are either consistently more structurally stable across retellings (Study 2) or start out more stable in earlier retellings (Study 3). By the last generation of recall, people show greater agreement in their recall of more familiarly structured stories than unfamiliarly structured stories (Study 3). This suggests that familiar stories with structural integrity have an evolutionary edge over unfamiliar structures, surviving better in people’s memories.",

We performed these experiments as part of an adversarial collaboration to test contrasting theories of consciousness; Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Predictive Processing Active Inference (AI), and Predictive Processing Neurorepresentationalism (NREP) accounts. According to the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness, non-activatable retinotopic cortical regions,  such as the blind spot region for the ipsilateral eye, create a different cause-effect structure and therefore should contribute differently to the perceived quality of space of activatable retinotopic regions. The two Predictive Processing accounts, in contrast, posit that internal models will accommodate structural deviations around the blindspot based on the available sensory evidence (particulars of this accommodation differ between the two accounts). We present a series of paradigms in which participants evaluate distances and areas that either include the blind spot or not (without stimulating it directly), as well as illusory motion that is either adjacent to the blind spot or not. We model psychometric functions relating perceived and objective space. These models vary in terms of bias and precision according to the experimental conditions (blind spot involved vs. not involved, ipsilateral vs. contralateral eye), making it possible to quantify the potential disruption of subjective spatial extendedness induced by the blind spot. We present simulated results for each experiment corresponding to the predictions of each account, and conclude by discussing challenges and plans for dissemination.",

For PBT to have a meaningful impact on mental healthcare, clinician input is needed to support treatment development, dissemination, and implementation efforts. The current study aimed to (1) better understand current perspectives on PBT among clinicians and (2) seek clinician feedback that may encourage accessibility and/or adoption of PBT. \nMethod: We used a cross-sectional survey to examine clinicians’ familiarity with and perspectives on PBT and its associated framework, the extended evolutionary meta-model (EEMM). \nResults: In our sample of 150 clinicians, 57.3% had heard of PBT and 41.3% had heard of the EEMM. Participants broadly agreed on how to conceptualize treatment components using the EEMM. In addition, feedback from clinicians suggested that the EEMM may underemphasize certain aspects of functioning (e.g., interpersonal relationships), even if they are technically represented by the EEMM (e.g., Sociocultural level). \nConclusion: There was high-level agreement with respect to how the EEMM was used as an organizing framework, however, training may be needed to increase inter-clinician reliability. Limitations include using an older version of the EEMM in our survey (current at the time of use) and limited representation of clinicians outside a cognitive behavioral orientation and working outside the U.S.",

This study examined the implementation of the Healthy Minds,\nThriving Kids (HMTK) program – free, evidence-based mental health videos for K–12 schools\nand families. After viewing the videos, 3,079 California K–12 educators completed a follow-up\nsurvey on implementation status, perceptions, and barriers. Analysis identified three teacher\ngroups (n=1,806): “Early Implementers” (used the resources), “Prospective Implementers” (plan\nto use them), and “Non-Implementers” (no plan to use them). While both Early and Prospective\nImplementers valued the resources, the latter cited time constraints and administrative approval\nprocesses as key barriers. Non-Implementers found the content less relevant but also noted time\nconstraints as a challenge. Machine learning analysis showed that teacher readiness and actions\nfor implementation were shaped by internal factors (e.g., beliefs, self-efficacy) and external\nsupport (e.g., school leadership). Notably, teachers in schools with more students eligible for free\nor reduced-price lunch were more likely to demonstrate readiness and take action for implementing\nclassroom-based mental health resources. These findings highlight three priorities to narrow the\ngap between teachers’ motivation and the support needed for implementation: providing structured\nsupport to reduce systemic barriers like time constraints, strengthening teachers' intrinsic\nmotivation and school leadership backing, and prioritizing schools serving students from low\nsocioeconomic backgrounds – where both student needs and teacher motivation are high.",

We show that willful inattention plays a key role in a number of important policy problems, and we discuss strategies for mitigating its negative effects.",

Indeed, most true crime consumers defer to documentaries as their preferred method of engaging in morbidity, especially with readily available access through popular streaming platforms. As such, many experts in psychological and criminologically-aligned pathways (namely, forensic psychology) contribute to and participate in such media to enhance societal understanding of the causes, consequences, and rehabilitative potential of offending behaviour. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts (n = 9), recruited via purposive sampling based on their media contributions, published works, and qualifications. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to understand these experiences, focusing on themes of academic validation, expert power, and morbid curiosity to understand difficulties of disseminating complex theory and knowledge to the public, in understanding the sensationalisation of those who have committed criminal offences. Implications of the research are discussed, including the improvement of relationships between academia and the media to ensure the emergence of accurate and beneficial information regarding the Criminal Justice System, individuals who have committed or been victimised by criminal offences, rehabilitation, and forensic psychology more broadly.",

By applying observational methods from primatology, we conducted video analysis of streets fights recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces of Amsterdam in order to evaluate whether conflicts generate social tension among human bystanders and promote bystanders’ affiliation as a tension-reduction mechanism. We found that witnessing a street fight increased the expression of anxiety-related behaviours in bystanders and their propensity to engage in non-physical and physical affiliative interactions. The occurrence of affiliation improves in turn the emotional state of bystanders by reducing their expression of anxiety-related behaviours. Our work offers for the first time a behavioural-based analysis of the emotional drivers underpinning bystanders’ activity in real-life conflicts.",

Here we used EEG to investigate how intrinsic timescales develop from infancy to toddlerhood and how they compare to adults. A recent rs-fMRI study found sleeping neonates had longer timescales than awake adults. However, fMRI is affected by hemodynamics, has limited temporal resolution, and timescales may be affected by sleep. Therefore, EEG was used to measure intrinsic timescales in infants longitudinally from 6 to 16-months-old (exploratory cohort, N=45; validation cohort, N=45) and adults (N=10). Infants were awake and engaged in visual stimulation, and adults were recorded under comparable (vs. different) conditions. Six-month-olds’ timescales were longer than those of adults in comparable conditions, and they shortened from 6 to 16-months-old. Finally, in younger infants, brain timescales correlated to alpha rhythm self-predictability. Longer intrinsic timescales early in infancy, a finding which generalises across fMRI and EEG, might act as an inductive bias favouring the learning of holistic abstract representations. Delineating the mechanisms underlying brain processing timescales in infants is a crucial step towards understanding the neural mechanisms which could allow infants to extract and learn patterns from the environment.",

          "abstract": "In response to growing replication failures attributed to underpowered studies and questionable research practices (QRPs) such as data peeking, researchers have increasingly turned to sequential testing frameworks -- most notably the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). By evaluating evidence at each interim analysis, SPRTs achieve the same inferential rigor as fixed-sample protocols while requiring substantially fewer participants, all without sacrificing robustness to violations of their statistical assumptions.\n    However, like any statistical method, SPRTs are susceptible to QRPs. We conducted a simulation study using a fictional researcher who applied various hacking strategies to favor the alternative hypothesis. These included running multiple parallel sequential ANOVAs, performing opportunistic subgroup or outlier analyses, flexibly redefining expected effect sizes, reshuffling observation order, and filtering datapoints that weakened interim likelihood ratios. Single hacking strategies and moderate combinations inflated the nominal 5% Type I error rate to 6-19 % (rising to 99 % under extreme data filtering), shifted effect-size estimates upward, increased sample size efficiency and reduced the rate of non-decisions.\n    These findings underscore that while SPRTs offer substantial gains in efficiency, they are not immune to misuse, much like fixed-design approaches. It is therefore critical to promote transparency and preregistrations in sequential designs to prevent the adoption of QRPs early on.",

          "abstract": "As artificial agents become more involved in social and economic interactions that rely on honest behavior from humans, they are increasingly designed with human-like social cues—such as pupil size—to appear more approachable. Pupil size is subtle, but also a powerful cue that can guide our decisions. Yet, we still know little about how pupil size shape people’s behavior, especially across cultures where agents and their signals are interpreted and accepted differently. In this study, 275 participants from Europe and Japan played a coin toss game where lying increased financial gain. They interacted with a human confederate, a virtual avatar, or a robot. Agents' pupil sizes were manipulated to appear large or small; for human confederates, this was achieved using custom-designed contact lenses. Our results suggest that cultures differ in how dishonest behavior is directed toward human and artificial agents, with subtle social cues like pupil size influencing dishonesty in culture-specific ways. Despite these behavioral differences, physiological responses revealed similar patterns of arousal across cultures and agent types, indicating a shared implicit sensitivity to social presence. These findings highlight the need to consider cultural context when designing artificial agents that use human-like cues to guide social behavior: what subtly communicates warmth in one culture may signal something else in another.",

          "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Previous research on distressing life events primarily emphasized negative mental health outcomes. However, there has been a growing focus on positive mental health factors in recent times. To reflect this broader perspective, the present study investigated the relationship between distressing life events, including emotionally impactful or potentially traumatic experiences, and positive mental health (PMH), satisfaction with life (SWL), subjective happiness (SH), and depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–21; DASS-21). Design and Methods: The sample included N = 426 students who participated in an online study testing protective and risk factors in the context of mental health and reports secondary analyses of these data. Results: Correlational analyses showed that experiencing a distressing life event was linked to lower levels of PMH and SWL, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Post-hoc group comparisons supported this pattern. Among those who experienced a distressing life event, higher current distress due to the event correlated with lower levels of PMH, SWL, and SH, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions: This study showed robust correlations between the experience of a distressing life event and levels of both positive and negative mental health. These findings underscore the emotional and psychological impact of adverse life events and highlight the potential value of targeting transdiagnostic protective factors such as PMH and resilience in prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "The pseudohomophone effect refers to an established finding whereby in a visual lexical decision task, non-word letter strings that are pronounced like real words (e.g., WAWK) are harder to reject than non-word strings that are not pronounced like real words (e.g., FLIS). This paper reports three lexical decision experiments that aimed at further exploring the underlying processing mechanisms. In Experiment 1 and 2, we compared pseudohomophones like WAWK with unpronounceable non-words like NRUG and pronounceable non-words like FLIS, making sure that all stimuli (including real-word fillers) were carefully matched in length, bigram frequency, and number of orthographic neighbours. Matching stimuli in this way resulted in the real-word fillers to be of low lexical frequency (lower than for the pseudohomophones’ base words). Experiment 1 employed a standard lexical decision task, whereas Experiment 2 used the 2AFC eye-tracking paradigm originally developed in Kunert &amp; Scheepers (2014). Both experiments converged on showing a reversal of the classical pseudohomophone effect: while unpronounceable strings like NRUG were correctly rejected relatively quickly, pseudohomophones like WAWK were indeed easier to reject than pronounceable non-words like FLIS. Our final Experiment 3, by contrast, confirmed a ‘classical’ pseudohomophone effect when the same non-word stimuli were tested against high- rather than low frequency words as fillers. We conclude that the direction of the pseudohomophone effect strongly depends on the overall material context.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that first-generation students face extra challenges in the transition to university compared to non-first-generation students, including adjusting to the academic demands of university life and building up their social support networks. However, few studies have mapped out these students' social networks in detail. The aim of this study was to compare the social networks and adjustment to university in first-generation students and non-first-generation students in their first year at a UK university. We used a genetic matching algorithm to match 112 first-generation students to 112 non-first-generation students on age, gender and nationality (mean age = 18.71 years old, 69 male, 146 female, 5 non-binary, four did not state gender). We used an online social network tool to elicit the size of students’ social support network and the different types of ties (e.g. family, friend) in this network. We used the Crombag’s Adaption Questionnaire to measure adjustment to university life.  There were no significant differences in the overall size of the support network or adjustment to university life in first-generation versus non-first-generation students. Therefore, the pre-registered hypotheses were not supported. An exploratory analysis suggested non-first-generation students have significantly more non-family social ties than first-generation students (R2 = .019), but the Bayes Factor suggested only anecdotal evidence of an effect (BF10 = 1.1).  Future research could examine whether the characteristics of the university (e.g., percentage of first-generation students) may influence the adaptation of first-generation students to university life.",

          "abstract": "Background: Learning-based cognitive control (CC), the ability to adapt control strategies based on contextual regularities, has been studied in typically developing (TD) children but remains underexplored in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This study investigates whether children with ADHD show intact learning-based CC and how it is affected by increased cognitive demands. Methods: In a multicentric study, 7-14 years old children (145 ADHD [20F, mean = 10.4 ± 2.0], 97 TD [51F, mean = 10.4 ± 2.0]) completed two experimental tasks: a modified Flanker task and a cued go-noGo task. Both included a List-Wide Proportion Congruency (LWPC) manipulation to create different contextual predictability (mostly congruent/valid vs half congruent/valid blocks). Reaction times (RTs) and accuracy were analyzed across blocks and associations between task adaptation and neuropsychological and questionnaire-based CC measures were also explored. Results: ADHD children showed similar LWPC effects to TD peers in the Flanker task, suggesting preserved learning-based CC in low-demand contexts. In the cued go-noGo task, which involved greater attentional and inhibitory demands, ADHD children displayed less efficient modulation of RTs and reduced speed-accuracy trade-off adaptation compared to TD peers. A composite neuropsychological score predicted task adaptation. No associations were found with parental questionnaires. Conclusions: Learning-based CC appears preserved in children with ADHD in simple contexts but is hindered under complex, multi-demand conditions. Inhibition may be a key mechanism underlying these group differences. These findings emphasize the need for ecologically valid paradigms and tailored interventions targeting complex CC challenges in ADHD. Keywords: learning-based cognitive control, ADHD, Flanker task, go-noGo, inhibition, development. Abbreviations: CC – Cognitive Control; ADHD – Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; TD – Typically Developing; LWPC – List-Wide Proportion Congruency; RT – Reaction Time.",

          "abstract": "Las relaciones afectivas intensas pueden detonar circuitos neuroquímicos de fijación similares a los observados en la adicción, activando de forma simultánea sistemas dopaminérgicos (motivación y recompensa anticipatoria), oxitocinérgicos (apego y vinculación) y mecanismos de refuerzo variable, ampliamente documentados en estudios de neuromarketing como responsables de la creación de lealtad compulsiva hacia marcas, productos y figuras. Esta similitud funcional sugiere que los patrones neurobiológicos que sostienen la fijación emocional en relaciones desorganizadas pueden analizarse, predecirse y modularse con herramientas derivadas tanto de la neurociencia del consumo como de la psicología del apego.\n\nPresentamos un ejercicio neuroquímico aplicado como estrategia de reequilibrio para cortar la fijación en vínculos intensos, basado en ayuno de dopamina, sustitución controlada de fuentes de recompensa, reactivación funcional de oxitocina mediante contacto seguro y estabilización de serotonina con hábitos conductuales. A través de una guía de 30 días se propone entrenar al cerebro a reorganizar sus patrones motivacionales, ofreciendo una alternativa para autorregular circuitos de apego mediante experiencias diseñadas, como se hace en intervenciones de neuromarketing que buscan desplazar asociaciones emocionales hacia nuevas metas o marcas.\n\nEste protocolo parte de la evidencia que vincula intermitencia emocional con liberación intensa de dopamina (Schultz et al., 1997) y teorías evolutivas que explican la función adaptativa del apego en términos de retención de pareja (Hazelton &amp; Buss, 2000), así como estudios que muestran que rupturas amorosas activan el núcleo accumbens de forma casi idéntica a la abstinencia de drogas (Fisher et al., 2010). Al traducir estos hallazgos en una metodología práctica, se ofrece un modelo de autocondicionamiento dirigido a cortar fijaciones afectivas con la misma lógica que programas de fidelización o branding neuroemocional, pero orientado a la salud mental individual.\n\nEste trabajo busca abrir un camino interdisciplinario entre neurobiología, psicología del apego y neuroeconomía, proponiendo que, al comprender y dirigir deliberadamente nuestros estímulos internos y externos, podemos guiar al cerebro a reprogramar sus circuitos de apego sin recurrir a fármacos ni a intervenciones exclusivamente psicológicas, sino usando los mismos mecanismos que la industria del neuromarketing emplea para generar deseo, engagement y lealtad, pero aplicados a la liberación emocional y la autorregulación.",

          "abstract": "Introduction \nThe human and economic impact of suicide is significant. Services to prevent suicide, support persons experiencing suicidal distress, and their family and friends, are critical to reducing suicide rates. However, in Australia, guidance on the amount and mix of suicide prevention specific services required to meet population needs is lacking. The aim of this study was to develop a service taxonomy for suicide prevention as the first step in the development of an Australian suicide prevention needs-based planning model (i.e., the Australian Suicide Prevention Planning Model (AuSPPM)).\nMethods\nA desktop review was undertaken to identify potential service types for inclusion in the taxonomy. The scope of the search was restricted to services, programs, initiatives, or campaigns that specifically aim to address or prevent suicidal distress and target whole populations, sub-populations, groups, families, and/or individuals. An initial draft taxonomy was developed based on search findings. Feedback on the draft taxonomy was provided by persons working within service planning, government and policy related roles, academics, clinicians, and persons with lived experience. A final search was conducted to locate further information to accurately describe all service types for inclusion and their evidence base.\nResults\nThe final taxonomy included: (1) a set of nine ‘critical enablers’ for an effective suicide prevention system that should underpin all other service types represented in the taxonomy, and (2) five service streams comprising 32 nested service categories, and 36 service elements. Some key feedback from the sector in terms of development of the taxonomy included the need for significant emphasis on upstream supports, the inclusion of services related to other areas of wellbeing, the early identification of distress, and the provision of brief supports and service navigation. \nConclusion\nThe service taxonomy may be used to inform planning and policy related decisions and is an important component of the overarching needs-based planning model. In the future, it may be refined to include services specific to populations disproportionately impacted by suicide. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of service types included in the taxonomy.",

          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) was developed to provide independent measures of sensitivity and bias for an observer asked to discriminate a signal stimulus against background noise. The sensitivity measure, d' , achieves this goal when the underlying decision space consists of two Gaussian distributions of equal variance. However, d' fails to provide a stable measure of sensitivity when the distributions are of unequal variance. In addition, unequal base rates of stimulus presentations or asymmetries in the payoff matrix for decision outcomes further shift criterion placement and estimations of sensitivity. Alternative sensitivity metrics that attempt to consider these scenarios either require information across multiple confidence levels or make implicit assumptions about the underlying decision space a priori. I propose an optimization approach that accurately estimates information about the underlying decision space without requiring information over multiple confidence levels. The proposed approach requires β and a single false alarm and hit rate pair. The reliance on β limits the proposed method to providing a normative model of performance where the researcher is operating under a theoretical framework of decision. Simulations illustrate that in cases where β is known, or can be reasonably estimated, the optimization approach is successful in recovering the critical characteristics of the decision space.",

          "abstract": "Recently, scholars have questioned the dominance of Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD)-centric values in shaping sociocultural systems. Addressing this requires reassessing instances where non-WEIRD values not only sustained but also influenced WEIRD paradigms. Advances in natural language processing now enable rigorous analysis of classical non-WEIRD texts to illuminate such contributions. This study examines Bushido: The Soul of Japan by Inazo Nitobe, a widely read classic that introduced Japanese moral values to Western audiences. Using Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), we analyzed how Bushido conveys psychological constructs across cultural and historical boundaries referencing the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and HEXACO Personality Inventory. Bushido exhibited consistently higher CCR scores on both instruments compared to over 700 documents related to Christianity, the Bible, and Japanese culture, indicating closer semantic alignment with the target constructs. This suggests Bushido articulates moral values and personality traits rooted in Japanese cultural traditions, while exhibiting a cross-cultural psychological structure that transcends temporal boundaries. Multidimensional scaling further identified Meiyo (名誉) as the conceptual core among Bushido’s seven virtues, a construct distinct from Western pride-based honor. This study demonstrates that classical non-WEIRD texts can be quantitatively analyzed to reveal enduring moral frameworks that transcend the WEIRD paradigm.",

We conducted a systematic review, including 25 studies predominantly employing between-subject framing experiments, involving mainly adult participants from Western regions, and mostly on help-seeking and self-care. Findings on norm nudging and framing (self-other and positive-negative) have been mixed with evidence of positive-framing advantage in encouraging help-seeking. Limited studies on default nudge, decoy nudge, and reminder nudge found mostly beneficial effects. We provided suggestions to advance mental health nudging research, including a call for more theory-driven research with potential mediating and moderating measures, sampling of diverse populations in mental health conditions, age, cultural backgrounds. More research on tailored nudges and comparison between different nudges are also encouraged. Finally, studies with more consequential outcome variables (e.g. mental health, longer term behaviors), and monitoring and addressing risks of adverse effects, will be worthwhile. \nKeywords: Nudges, Decision-Making, Mental Health, Self-care, Help-seeking, Systematic Review",

          "abstract": "This study examines how individuals’ level of education and field of study influence their support for democracy, political interest, political participation, and political consumerism. In doing so, the study represents a key contribution to the literature on the role of education in fostering democratic citizenship, given the lack of previous research taking potential field of study differences into account in this regard. Using data from the Czech Household Panel Study (2015-2019), we assess cognitive, socialization, indoctrination, and allocation effects explanations to determine the mechanisms through which education shapes democratic citizenship. We find a robust positive relationship between one’s overall education level and support for democracy, aligning with cognitive theories holding that improved critical thinking and literacy encourage democratic citizenship. The results also suggest that politically-adjacent fields such as humanities foster democratic citizenship, findings we also consider consistent with cognitive theories. Additionally, we note significant generational differences in the effects of studying social sciences in particular, suggesting that exposure to contrasting political ideologies, namely communism and liberal democracy, may facilitate selective indoctrination. Overall, our results imply that broader access to education promotes democratic citizenship, as educational attainment, regardless of field, is positively associated with democratic support and political engagement.",

Indeed, recent works show that government-opposition relations in parliament do indeed correlate with consequent citizens’ attitudes. Of course, ordinary citizens – and most political experts – do not observe parliamentary activity directly but rather through news outlets, social media (which mostly echoes mainstream media), or the parties themselves. This chapter tests whether parties’ campaign messaging, as depicted in the media in the period leading up to the elections, indeed reflects their interactions in the preceding parliamentary term. Specifically, the chapter addresses three questions: a) is there a positive correlation between the degree to which parliamentary government-opposition relations are conflictual and the degree of conflict reflected in the news coverage of electoral campaigns? b) is there a correlation between government-opposition relations in parliament and their salience in the media coverage? c) does the media coverage mediate the effects of government-opposition relations on citizens’ voting behaviour? The chapter answers these questions using three distinct datasets covering 26 elections in 9 countries, combining parliamentary votes and electoral campaign media coverage.",

          "abstract": "Populations have demographic connections to history: people who were exposed to the past may still be alive or may at least have living kin. Denton and Spencer (2021) and Alburez-Gutierrez (2022) have articulated the concept of “demographic memory” to refer to how the memory of single events lingers in populations through their age or kinship structure. This article works to clarify and further demonstrate the usefulness of this concept. Theoretically, it argues for demographic memory as an idea that unifies and makes rigorously quantifiable many of the scattered ideas of historical embeddedness that exist across the social and biological sciences, including in economics, epidemiology, political science, and genetics. Methodologically, this article offers a flexible and widely applicable model of demographic memory defined by cohort survivorship. This model can estimate the memory of events, eras, and continuously varying conditions of interest, such as socioeconomic, political, and environmental variables, and it allows for social stratification in both the conditions of interest and how they are forgotten. As a proof of concept, this new model is applied to the memory of recent prime ministers in the United Kingdom and the memory of liberal democracy across the world.",

          "authors": "Karen Pelletier",
          "abstract": "This article examines the online debates surrounding COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter, focusing specifically on ‘anti-anti-vaxxers’—a group of users who were particularly active in crusading against anti-vaccination messages. Through a combination of visual network analysis and qualitative content analysis of Tweets, mentions, and user profiles, we map the communicative strategies and network positioning of this group during the critical period of the vaccine rollout. Our findings demonstrate that, despite scholarly evidence indicating that hardcore misinformation was not the primary threat to vaccine campaigns, influential anti-anti-vaxxers decided to focus their campaign on extreme anti-vaccination arguments and failed to recognize the nuanced spectrum of vaccine hesitancy. These misdirected practices of fact-checking and debunking may have generated counterproductive effects and may have ended up amplifying misinformation, alienating hesitant individuals and pushing public opinion toward populist movements. From our 2025 perspective, the analysis reveals social media dynamics that may have led or contributed to the current political landscape, and to the unprecedented electoral success of anti-vaccination leaders. The way in which previously marginalized anti-vaccine discourses have acquired mainstream acceptation and political influence offers valuable lessons on how well-intentioned social media interventions can paradoxically strengthen anti-elite movements, with lasting implications for managing controversies in digital environments.",

This literature review examines three pillars of decision support - Multi‐Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) frameworks, behavioral economics models, and AI‐driven tools - to identify how they can be integrated into a seamless user experience to reduce environmental impact. First, it surveys the current statistics of residential impact and focuses on certain areas of high impact. Next, it explores the behavioral barriers, such as heuristics, temporal discounting, and habit formation, which impede widespread adoption of optimized choices. Finally, it ascertains the worth of emerging AI assistants capable of selecting MCDA methods, defining criteria, and assigning weights based on user inputs, location, and demographics to then feed into an MCDA calculator.",

Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and public health on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. The observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy.

Following the theoretical turn towards the role of empathy for demo- cratic discourse, this preregistered survey experiment tests various changes in an online discussion environments’ user interface (nudges) and an educa- tive intervention targeting users’ motivation to engage in empathy (boost) to reduce reply toxicity. Participants were recruited via Facebook Ads in the United States and Germany to acquire a sample of N = 2,154 highly active social media users. Based on their reported political attitudes, participants were asked to comment on social media statements they likely disagree with. Compared to the control group, neither the empathy or perspective taking nudges nor the friction placebo reduced reply toxicity. Boosting decreased reply toxicity to some degree but the effect was not robust against the inclu- sion of covariates. However, all nudging interventions significantly increased the length of replies. Overall, toxicity was highest among people with high online activity. While reducing toxicity online does not seem to work via simple changes in the user interface (nudging), more complex interventions (boosting) appear more promising to preemptively reduce toxicity before important voices are forced out of the public discourse online.",

          "abstract": "This study explores Omani undergraduate students’ employment readiness, job preferences, and the impact of English language proficiency, within the framework of Oman Vision 2040. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with 43 first-year students, seven themes emerged: occupational preferences, influences on career choices, technology-centric careers, preference for government versus private sector jobs, English proficiency as a prerequisite for employment, societal valuation of English skills, and English for global integration and mobility. The findings reveal a strong preference for comfortable, less physically demanding white-collar jobs, underscoring the need for educational reforms that align curricula with modern job market demands, particularly in enhancing STEM education and digital\nliteracy. English language proficiency has been seen as crucial for securing desirable jobs, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive English training programs across all educational levels. Societal expectations and personal ambitions significantly influence career choices, with a preference for prestigious white-collar jobs over traditional professions. The study recommends educational interventions to address these evolving job preferences, promote all forms of work, and support the critical role of English proficiency in employment and career advancement. These insights contribute to the broader goals of economic diversification and sustainability outlined in Oman Vision 2040, offering valuable perspectives for policymakers, educators, and researchers.",

          "authors": "Connor T. Jerzak",
          "abstract": "This article examines how wartime debates over the possible introduction of military conscription reshaped conceptions of citizenship and political authority in Northern Ireland between 1938 – 1946. Drawing on primary documents from Northern Ireland, Éire, and Great Britain, it traces how Unionists initially championed conscription as a way to affirm equal status with Britain, even as they upheld internal hierarchies that disadvantaged Catholics. Yet divisions within Unionist ranks—exacerbated by British reluctance to enforce conscription—challenged long-standing assumptions of Protestant “loyalty” and Catholic “disloyalty.” At the same time, Nationalists framed conscription as an illegitimate imposition by a foreign state, underscoring their self-identification as Irish citizens under occupation. Perhaps paradoxically, by forgoing conscription, Britain gained a measure of legitimacy in Catholic eyes, encouraging some Nationalists to engage more constructively with British institutions and signaling new possibilities for political accommodation. In revealing these wartime dynamics, this analysis highlights how the conscription controversy helped recalibrate citizenship, unsettle entrenched power structures, and broaden the political landscape in Northern Ireland.",

This policy paper examines how the pandemic affected political cleavages across the European Union. The analysis reveals the emergence of a health-economy trade-off dimension, the differential activation of economic versus cultural grievances, and the strategic role of populist radical right parties (PRRPs) in politicizing the crisis. Key findings indicate that while the pandemic created new arenas of contestation, traditional ideological orientations and trust in scientific institutions remained the strongest predictors of political attitudes and behaviors.

          "abstract": "For millions of women in the U.S., divorce triggers not only emotional upheaval but also longterm economic instability. Yet, while the average consequences of divorce are well documented, far less is known about why some women recover economically while others fall into lasting hardship. This study suggests that the explanation involves not just individual attributes, but also the institutionally structured life pathways that unfold after marital dissolution.\nLife disruptions serve as critical junctures that redirect individuals’ life trajectories. While some people regain stability after experiencing job loss, divorce, or health crises, others face deepening disadvantage that persists for years. This divergence raises fundamental questions about how social stratification unfolds—not just in moments of crisis, but across the extended arc of the life course. Prior research highlights that the consequences of life disruptions are shaped by individual resources and by institutional contexts (Brady 2024; Brady, Finnigan, and\nHübgen 2017; DiPrete 2002)",

As the custodian for both domestic and international travel needs, Nigeria’s aviation sector is vulnerable to a range of threats including terrorism, illicit drugs smuggling, human trafficking and organised crime. These risks underscore the need for a robust aviation security framework to safeguard passengers, infrastructure, and the nations broader security interest. This study, conducted a critical assessment of the existing aviation security arrangement in the country with a view to exploring its implication on national security.\nThe study was guided by the Systems theory while the descriptive research design was adopted. Primary data was gathered through the Key Informant Interview method of data collection, where selected key informants from the aviation security directorates of Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) were interviewed. Secondary data were sourced from official documents, working reports and newspaper editorials, which were collected from public libraries, while some documents of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) were sourced from NCAA and other online sources. Data were content analysed.\nNigeria has made significant strides in improving aviation security through regulatory frameworks, strategic plans implementation, and international collaborations. Findings have however, revealed that issues such as inadequate technology, corruption, limited funding and insufficient training continue to pose significant barriers to its efforts towards exploring its full potential and contributing optimally to national security. Critical issues bothering on defective passenger profiling, obsolete surveillance technology and porous perimeter fencing systems were identified as major impediments that require appropriate attention through massive investment in biometric technology, intrusion detection devices with integrated alarm systems and surveillance drones equipped with real time footage access.\nAviation security plays a critical role in the broader national security framework. However, its full potential can only be realised through government intervention in facilitating significant investment in airport infrastructure, innovative policy implementation, capacity building, and a more robust inter-agency coordination.  \n    \n\n\nWord Count: 330\nKeywords:  Aviation Security, National Security, Surveillance Technology, Airport infrastructure, Nigeria",

We investigated the editing dynamics of the Wiki to understand its users and their biases. We then analyzed the text of 431 job ads posted from 2013–2023. Our analysis addresses the question of how archaeological topics, methods, and geographic regions specified in archaeological job ads have shifted over time. We also explored whether the labor burden for applicants has changed over time: do institutions request more information and documents from applicants at the initial stages of application, compared to a decade ago? Finally, we assessed the influence of socio-political factors on the changing focus of research topics in the field. We conclude with implications for archaeology students, graduates, and advisors seeking to understand the dynamics of the academic job market and the requirements of employers.",

          "authors": "Sarah Perret",
          "abstract": "Since the early 2000s, the EU has funded many R&amp;D projects on border security. However, devices developed through these programmes have met ‘violent ends’: firstly, by appearing to face abrupt ends after EU funding ceased; secondly, by materialising to serve as violent border devices. This article traces the fate of devices funded by the EU’s 7th Framework Programme for managing human and non-human movements. Theoretically, it adds to the literature on ignorance by approaching debates on non-knowledge through a Bourdieusian analytical lens, and methodologically, it proposes to mobilise the concept of ‘symbolic violence’ to investigate and compare what is acknowledged and what is not, what is obscured or obfuscated in and through R&amp;D projects. Empirically, the paper examines several projects that aim to manage people and things on the move, and which have materialised in more or less overt ways. The article argues that projects focused on border security play a precursory role in the enactment of violent devices, and simultaneously obfuscate the non-knowledge of ‘violent ends’ that shape the future of the EU’s border governance. It shows that even if these projects do not apparently materialise, they nevertheless find ways of achieving their violent ends.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how varying levels of hype—defined as a rhetorical framing strategy involving exaggeration or amplification—and the valence of portrayed outcomes in AI news coverage influence audience perceptions of the credibility of scientists, journalists, and science news sources. A total of 622 U.S.-based participants were randomly assigned to view one of ten video segments, which varied in topic (self-driving cars or finance), hype intensity (neutral, low, high), outcome valence (positive or negative), and source (neutral, international broadcaster, or scientific institution). Post-exposure measures assessed emotional responses (e.g., anxiety), message evaluation, and credibility perceptions. Findings indicate that hype intensity and valence had limited direct effects on the perceived credibility of scientists, suggesting that public trust in science may depend more on emotional responses and source characteristics than on sensationalist framing alone. Conversely, journalist and source credibility were more sensitive to individual attitudes to AI, emotional responses, and source characteristics. Notably, heightened anxiety predicted lower credibility ratings across all source types, underscoring the mediating role of affect. Gender differences also emerged, with women rating sources as more trustworthy than men. These results highlight the complex interplay between message framing, emotional responses, and pre-existing attitudes in shaping credibility assessments, emphasizing the need for nuanced science communication strategies that consider audience diversity and emotional engagement.",

          "authors": "Daniel Serey; Maria Aranda; Samuel Parra León",
          "abstract": "The inclusion of affective-sexual and gender diversity is an ongoing challenge due to the persistence of negative attitudes. The educational context is a critical space where either prejudices may be perpetuated or egalitarian attitudes fostered. A crucial step for advancing the inclusion of sexual diversity is being able to measure this construct. For this, several authors develop, validate, or applicate instruments to assess attitudes toward sexual diversity in Education. The objective of the present study was to review this type of measures. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses follows the recommendations of PRISMA and APA’s standards. After the eligibility criteria were applied, 7 papers were included. The instruments were analyzed according to (i) their ability to capture subtle attitudes and the dimensions of diversity addressed; (ii) the context in which they were validated and their target population; (iii) their psychometric properties and methodological rigor. As result, it can be state that most of the instruments present some evidences of validity and reliability. In order to reduce social desirability and reactivity, the scales combine positively worded items, with the traditional use of negatively items. In addition, they incorporate more subtle expressions associated with modern prejudice. However, certain items may no longer effectively capture the subtle attitudes or evolution of language to more accurately name sexual diversity. In conclusion, it would be beneficial to address certain challenges, such as the generality of the items, the reactivity of old-fashioned-prejudice measures, and the need to accumulate further evidence to strengthen their psychometric properties.",

          "authors": "Daniel Run Han Ho",
          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

          "authors": "Christopher Blattman",
          "abstract": "International drug trafficking dominates discussions of organized crime, yet urban criminal groups that focus on dominating local markets, neighborhoods, and politics are equally common and serious. When policymakers do pay attention, they consistently repeat a critical mistake—assuming universal best practices exist—leading to ineffective or harmful interventions. But systems of organized crime are not all alike. There is no single blueprint or general solution; thus, following the latest policy fad rarely delivers desired outcomes. Instead of copying high-profile but context-specific successes like Giuliani’s New York or Bukele’s El Salvador, policymakers must first understand their city’s specific organized crime problem, their local capabilities, and the tools most appropriate for their circumstances. This paper examines how organized crime has structured itself in Chicago, Medellín, El Salvador, New York, Bogotá, and Port-au-Prince. I argue the primary driver of these organizations and their behavior is their criminal revenue source. A second major driver is their degree of hierarchical organization, which ranges from atomized individuals and freelance cliques (prone to sporadic violence), to fragmented firms (profit-driven, volatile), competing confederations (internally peaceful but externally violent), and city-wide cartels (internally stable, politically influential). These forms emerge not just from their criminal revenue sources but also from decades-long competition among groups and with the state. Effective policy tools hinge on accurately diagnosing this local context. Reviewing evidence for various standard interventions—from crackdowns to street outreach—I explain why their impacts vary dramatically depending on the organizational environment.",

We measure foreign policy alignment using ideal point estimates derived from UNGA voting data (Bailey et al., 2017) for the period 1997–2015. The findings suggest that surpassing historical trade partners triggers a qualitative shift in political alignment, decreasing the ideological distance between Brazil and China at the UNGA by 40%.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Health systems in low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs) frequently falter not due to lack of resources alone, but because of inefficient feedback mechanisms that fail to translate frontline data into action. Traditional strengthening efforts have emphasized inputs—such as workforce and infrastructure—while neglecting the dynamic flows of information and corrective processes. We apply a systems‑thinking lens to articulate a framework for closed feedback loops that systematically return decision‑relevant insights from peripheral levels to facility, sub‑county, and national actors. Drawing on case studies from Kenya and Nigeria, we demonstrate how loop thinking, causal‑loop diagrams, and participatory design principles can yield reinforcing cycles of trust, data quality, and adaptive governance. Key enablers include interoperable digital platforms aligned with national eHealth strategies, clear mandates for resource autonomy, and co‑design processes that surface contextually meaningful indicators. We conclude with actionable recommendations for policymakers, health managers, and donors to embed equitable, inclusive, and sustainable feedback loops within LMIC health architectures.\nKeywords: closed feedback loops, systems thinking, LMIC, health systems, responsiveness, equity, digital health",

          "title": "Religious Prohibitions as Encoded Survival Wisdom: A Cross-Cultural Statistical Analysis",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Background: Religious and moral systems represent universal features of human societies, yet their evolutionary origins and functional significance remain subjects of considerable debate. While traditional approaches have emphasized spiritual or social functions, emerging research suggests many religious prohibitions may encode practical survival wisdom developed over millennia.\n\nObjective: This study tests the hypothesis that religious practices systematically preserve survival-relevant knowledge across cultures through the Cultural Survival Framework, which proposes that religious systems function as sophisticated survival technologies transmitted through oral traditions.\n\nMethods: We conducted a systematic analysis of 151 religious practices from 74 cultures across six continents using a comprehensive 29-column coding framework. Each practice was classified across five survival domains (Food Safety &amp; Nutrition, Disease Prevention &amp; Health, Resource Conservation &amp; Management, Social Cooperation &amp; Stability, Environmental Adaptation) and assigned evidence levels (1-5 scale) based on documented survival benefits. Geographic distribution, cultural independence, and environmental factors were controlled to address potential confounding variables. Statistical analysis examined correlations between evidence quality and confidence assessments.\n\nResults: Religious practices demonstrated a strong positive correlation with survival benefits (r = 0.614, p &lt; 0.001). Evidence levels were significantly skewed toward moderate to strong survival benefits, with 73.5% of practices achieving Levels 3-5 evidence and 37.8% reaching definitive or strong evidence (Levels 4-5). Social Cooperation &amp; Stability represented the largest domain (41.7%), while Resource Conservation practices showed the highest average evidence levels. Geographic analysis revealed minimal spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.12, p = 0.23), indicating independent cultural evolution rather than diffusion from common sources.\n\nConclusions: These findings provide compelling empirical support for the Cultural Survival Framework, demonstrating that religious prohibitions and practices systematically encode practical survival wisdom across diverse cultures. The strength and consistency of correlations suggest that survival pressures have shaped religious evolution, with practices providing genuine survival advantages being preferentially preserved and transmitted across generations. This research offers new explanations for religious universals and highlights the potential value of traditional knowledge systems for contemporary applications in public health, environmental management, and social policy.",

          "abstract": "How do single mothers fare in a policy context that seeks gender equality through focusing on two-parent families? The ability to combine paid work and family life gender-equally has been a longstanding policy aim in Sweden, which has sought to solve this problem by supporting dual-earner-dual-carer families. This study explores how low-resourced single mothers meet family needs in the Swedish context, using low-resourced coupled parents as a comparison group. Thirty-one single mothers and coupled parents (16 single mothers, 13 coupled mothers, 2 coupled fathers), recruited through community organisations in four Swedish cities, participated in seven focus groups during spring 2023. While Sweden is considered a frontrunner in the gender revolution, I suggest that the policy assumption of equally shared parenting disadvantages low-resourced single mothers. Swedish social policies are predicated on a perceived equal division of parenting, but there are rarely checks to ensure that parenting is actually carried out equally. When the actual division is highly unequal, low-resourced single mothers lack adequate support to meet family needs. Single mothers are set back both as a direct implication of the dual-earner-dual-carer model and in relative terms, through policies that either assume gender-equal parenting or that do not compensate for its absence. This leads to under-recognised financial, emotional, and practical vulnerabilities, particularly among single mothers experiencing a gendered lack of division of labour with their co-parent. Together, these insights further our understanding of how a stratified and incomplete gender revolution and policies designed to underpin it may disadvantage low-resourced single mothers.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence systems (AIS) on Jean- Jacques Rousseau’s concept of the General Will (GW), proposing a practical framework to address the challenges posed by these technologies to democratic governance. The current dominance of automated systems controlled by a few digital giants (the “Big Tech”) threatens to undermine collective and democratic decision-making. Building on Rousseau’s notion of the general will as a collective and sovereign expression of the common good, I identify four ways AI erodes the GW: (1) the privatization of the public debate; (2) the individualization of practices; (3) the erosion of personal and collective will; (4) the risk of technological despotism. To address these issues, I propose a three-dimensional theoretical framework to address those challenges and recover the sense of the GW. First, education and mediatization of AI issues would enable the (re)formation of the GW. Then, public participation platforms could allow its expression. Finally, coming back to Rousseau, I call for the renewal of the terms of the social contract through public participation in AI choices. By linking Rousseau’s democratic ideals with modern challenges, the paper presents actionable pathways to align AI technologies with democratic principles and collective representation.",

          "abstract": "Nature connection is an important leverage point for both human wellbeing and planetary health. While previous research has identified associations between nature connection and wellbeing, there has been little examination of how different wellbeing measures are associated with nature connection, and how this correlation varies by population groups. We seek to fill this gap through a survey of 4006 individuals in Australia. We find a strong association between nature connection and two measures of wellbeing: life satisfaction, and health-related quality-of-life. The association between nature connection and life satisfaction was similar to that of income and life satisfaction. The association between nature connection and wellbeing was found to be particularly strong for younger people, and those who speak a language other than English at home. Through developing a measure examining one’s life satisfaction relative to their health-related quality-of-life, we find that those with higher levels of nature connection tend to have greater life satisfaction than health-related quality-of-life. These findings highlight the important role policy can play in enhancing nature connection to improve wellbeing, such as expanding green space development and providing individuals with more opportunities to meaningfully connect with nature. \n\nKeywords: Nature connection, wellbeing, life satisfaction, health-related quality-of-life",

          "abstract": "Amid recent shifts towards more punitive responses to youth offending, this study examines public support for punitive youth justice policies in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using survey data from 401 adults, we assessed support for six punitive policies (e.g., boot camps, harsher sentencing) and explored predictors of support. Most participants supported punitive measures for youth who committed serious offences. Support was higher among those with conservative political beliefs and lower educational attainment. Beliefs about youths’ capacity for change were also associated with attitudes: those believing youth could be rehabilitated were less supportive of punitive policies, whereas those perceiving a high likelihood of reoffending were more supportive. These findings show that beliefs about young people’s potential for change influence support for punitive youth justice policies. They highlight opportunities to shift public attitudes toward more evidence-based approaches through educating people about the efficacy of rehabilitation and the developmental nature of youth offending.",

          "abstract": "Current research assessment reform movements advocate for recognizing the full range of academic contributions, including outputs beyond traditional publications. This article examines how technological activities and products (TAPs) are evaluated within Argentina’s CONICET research career system. Drawing on 421 peer review reports in applied fields (veterinary science, civil engineering, and computer science), we analyze the place of TAPs in evaluation discourse and the challenges they pose. Combining lexicometric and qualitative analysis, this research shows that TAPs are rarely central to evaluations, often overshadowed by publications and other conventional outputs. Where TAPs are addressed, reviewers express difficulties due to insufficient documentation, inconsistencies across sources, and uncertainty about originality or relevance. These issues reflect both procedural shortcomings and a lack of shared criteria. Our findings show that the goal of valuing diverse contributions remains difficult to implement in practice: TAPs represent a category where consensus is weak, and expectations are unclear. Reform efforts must distinguish between technical limitations in evaluation design and deeper disagreements over what constitutes academic merit—especially in applied research contexts. We argue that the evaluation of TAPs constitutes a distinct object of study, analytically separate from social impact, and deserving of specific attention within broader debates on responsible research assessment.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates differences in how same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples outsource routine and non-routine housework. Previous research highlights how same-sex and different-sex couples allocate time to housework, but the outsourcing of these tasks remains understudied. Considering variations in household resources and cultural norms, the study explores whether and how these groups differ in outsourcing routine tasks (e.g., cleaning) and non-routine tasks (e.g., home maintenance and yardwork). Using data from the 2003–2019 waves of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and a double hurdle methodological approach, this study analyzes the likelihood of outsourcing and amount spent on overall and specific housework tasks among same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples. Findings reveal minimal differences across couple type in outsourcing home maintenance, yardwork, and cleaning. However, same-sex male couples are generally more likely to outsource any housework compared to different-sex couples, though this association becomes null once household income is accounted for, highlighting the role of economic resources in enabling the “Buying Out” strategy. Notably, differences across couple type are only evident in the probability of outsourcing, with no significant variation in spending among those who outsource, suggesting that selection into outsourcing is more varied than differences in spending intensity. These findings emphasize the importance of economic resources in shaping domestic outsourcing behaviors and suggest that the equitable division of housework often observed in same-sex couples may be attributed to factors beyond reliance on outsourcing.",

I apply a computationally robust approach by using an LLM to categorize user comments into two dummy variables: misogynistic/non-misogynistic and aggressive/non-aggressive, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the responses. Using ordinary least squares regression, I aim to determine whether these linguistic features predict the presence of misogynistic and aggressive comments, and to what extent, controlling for video duration and engagement metrics, and clustering by influencer to account for potential audience variation.",

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

We study how age at arrival shapes earnings potential, worker productivity, and labor market sorting. Drawing on administrative data from Norway, we employ a sibling comparison design to identify the effects of age at arrival on a broad set of adult labor market outcomes. Our analysis shows that later arrival has progressively negative effects across the earnings distribution—although concentrated among low earners; increases sorting into physically demanding occupations with lower communicative, socioemotional, and math–logic skill requirements; reduces full-time work; and lowers access to high-paying employers. A formal decomposition indicates that differences in educational qualifications, work hours, and sorting into math–logic intensive occupations are key mediators of the age-at-arrival effect on earnings. Together, these findings document how immigration at later developmental stages has lasting consequences for skill specialization and economic assimilation. For childhood immigrants, even modest delays in country-specific human capital acquisition can lead to misalignment between their skills and the productivity demands and reward structures of knowledge-intensive labor markets.",

However, the bias that proxy-reports could introduce in the measurement of intergenerational educational mobility is rarely assessed. Our study fills this gap and assesses how reliable people are when they report their parents' or their child's educational attainment. We find that both parents and children tend to underestimate the educational distance between themselves and their family members, thus inflating estimates of educational reproduction. This trend is larger when children act as proxy-reporters. Another limitation of using children’s proxy-reported information is the number of missing answers, which is lower when parents are asked to proxy-report their child's education. In a simulation exercise, we establish that the bias introduced by proxy reports is not negligible, with self-reported intergenerational regression coefficients being 16\\% higher when a proxy-report is used.",

          "abstract": "In contemporary conflicts, public opinion is shaped not only by traditional media and politics but also by digital interactions. The 2022 Russo-Ukrainian war intensified an ongoing crisis, drawing global attention and public engagement. Social media has played a key role in mediating these responses and revealing real-time public interpretation.\n    This study explores the online discourse surrounding the Russo-Ukrainian war on X (formerly Twitter), examining how it shapes and reflects public discourse during the conflict. Focusing on Germany, it analyzes dominant narratives, sentiments, and stances expressed on the platform, while integrating socio-economic indicators—such as unemployment rates, the Social Connectedness Index, and regional demographics—to contextualize regional variations in public attitudes and social dynamics.\n    We employ a Large Language Model for stance detection, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. We then apply statistical modeling to examine how these public expressions relate to socio-economic conditions and emotional tone.\n    This study shows that public attitudes toward the Russo-Ukrainian war are emotionally complex and evolving. Negative sentiment dominates, but positive engagement around inclusion also appears. Supportive stances are more common than opposition, with a clear shift toward greater support after February 24, while opposition is more cautious and tied to socio-economic contexts.\n    The research provides insights into the intersection of digital narratives and offline realities, offering a nuanced perspective on public discourse and its role in shaping responses to complex international crises.",

          "abstract": "Studies of income and regime type typically contrast democracies and autocracies, ignoring heterogeneity in the character of authoritarian regimes. We focus on the consequences of personalist rule, where power is concentrated in an individual or small elite. Extending the dynamic panel strategy of Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2019), we estimate the differential growth performance of democracies, institutionalized autocracies, and personalist autocracies. Across eight GDP series, eight autocracy codings, and six measures of personalism, we observe a consistent pattern: Whenever an \"autocratic penalty\" emerges, it is concentrated in personalist regimes. The growth performance of institutionalized dictatorships, in contrast, is statistically indistinguishable from that of democracies. We document evidence that the \"personalist penalty\" is driven by some combination of low private investment, poor public-goods provision, and conflict. These findings emphasize the analytic payoff of unpacking autocracy and highlight the different incentives facing leaders with narrow and broad bases of power.",

The research evaluates how adapted authentic materials enhance language learning through lexical, communicative, and audio-linguistic methodologies, emphasizing their cultural, and cognitive significance. The study employed the approach combining content analysis with statistical comparisons using Sherman’s test and Phillips’ test to assess perceptions and critical thinking development. The study involved 120 Ukrainian university students. The results demonstrated strong agreement among both teachers (97%) and learners (93%) regarding the benefits of authentic texts. Participants showed high proficiency in completing tasks of varying complexity, achieving success rates of 98% for simple tasks, 95% for creative tasks, and 89% for complex tasks. These outcomes highlight significant improvements in objective text analysis, logical reasoning, self-organization, and problem-solving abilities. The findings suggest that integrating authentic texts into EFL curricula effectively cultivates critical thinking while promoting cultural and linguistic competence. Recommendations include adopting the tripartite lexical-communicative-audio-linguistic framework across language programs, selecting culturally diverse materials, and expanding research to include students at different proficiency levels for broader validation.",

The study used a qualitative methodology and a descriptive research design. The study included 20 English teachers and seventh-grade students from 14 Islamic secondary schools in Semarang city, Indonesia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observation and documentation were conducted to collect the data. The data were analyzed through selection, reduction, and verification. The findings indicate that students’ online assessments of their English ability were done appropriately for their teachers. They made use of numerous platforms and testing tools. Notwithstanding certain obstacles, the students looked for multiple ways to overcome them. It is possible to argue that online student assessments have positive and negative effects. English teachers should employ appropriate and doable strategies to minimize the detrimental washback effects of online English assessments on students while maximizing the favorable washback effects. They can combine student-centered and teacher-centered strategies in a harmonious way by delivering positive reinforcement to students, emphasizing the advantages of full English competence, and including pair and group work in lesson preparation.",

It aimed to measure gifted students’ English language learning autonomy in terms of technical, psychological, philosophical, and sociocultural dimensions. The findings of this study, practically and theoretically, are expected to make significant contributions to the field of language learning and gifted education. The participants of the study were 64 gifted secondary school female students enrolled in gifted schools in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. To measure the level of learners’ autonomy, a scale was used. The scale covers the four dimensions of autonomy with a total of fifty-two items. The findings revealed that, on average, the students demonstrated a high level of autonomy in all four dimensions (Mean = 113.50). The results of the study can be pedagogically contributive to programs similar to the study’s context with regard to learner autonomy awareness and learner autonomy development. The study recommended that the study scale should be used in future research to measure the effectiveness of different teaching methods in developing language learner autonomy as a pre- and post-research tool.",

          "abstract": "In the context of globalization, education systems, including those in Slovakia, are increasingly tasked with creating productive learning environments that integrate life and academic skills. Thus, we aim to validate and establish the reliability of an adapted questionnaire designed to measure the development of critical thinking among young adolescents in Slovakia. The study employs a mixed-methods research which included expert evaluations, pilot testing, and a statistical analysis to assess both the content validity and the internal consistency of the instrument. The research addresses a significant gap in educational studies, as no existing tool currently meets this specific need in the Slovak context. Grounded in a comprehensive theoretical framework, the research explores critical thinking as an essential educational skill. It examines cognitive, moral, and psychological characteristics of young adolescents to ensure the tool’s demographic relevance. The adapted questionnaire demonstrated a strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81) and positive expert validation ratings, confirming its suitability for the targeted population. The findings have established a reliable instrument for assessing critical thinking development and contribute to the broader discourse on enhancing educational practices. The study concludes with some recommendations for future research on applying the validated tool in educational settings to measure critical thinking development of young adolescents over time and to include targeted interventions into Slovak school curricula.",

The cultural diversity of every nation can be explained to a large extent by the ways of communication that have always taken place in history through contact. In terms of learning foreign languages, intercultural communication plays a leading role. The aim of the present study is to analyse the role of intercultural communication in the acquisition of slang vocabulary in English. The significance of the given study is in highlighting the crucial role of intercultural communication in enhancing the acquisition of English slang in order to support a development of more effective, culturally integrated language teaching methods. The method of the study was based on a cross-sectional survey among language students with different levels of English proficiency. The main findings of the study demonstrate that a natural communicative environment can create conditions for learning English slang. Working with native speakers allows for better integration into a new language environment. The study of linguistic variation is necessary at the very beginning of learning a foreign language. The role of teachers in this process is a leading one. It is they who should organise and regulate changes in students’ linguistic and cultural adaptation. To conclude, the intercultural integration plays a leading role in the cognitive integration of slang acquisition. The further use of this study will open up new perspectives in the didactics of English language teaching.",

          "abstract": "Education research emphasizes the significance of students’ perceptions of assessment. This study aimed to investigate how students perceive the assessment tasks designed by their professors and to examine the relationship between these perceptions and their learning outcomes (i.e., grades) across three Moroccan Faculties of Letters and Humanities. The study is particularly important as it provides valuable feedback to test designers within these faculties and supports efforts to improve the quality of assessments for common core students. Furthermore, it aims to raise professors’ awareness of the impact that test quality has on student performance and encourage more thoughtful and research-informed approaches to assessment design. In this regard, the study answers the following research questions: How do Moroccan students in the departments of English studies at the faculties of letters and humanities perceive the assessment tasks designed by their professors concerning the validity, reliability, authenticity, washback, and practicality of assessment tasks? Is there a relationship between students’ perception of assessment and their performance? To investigate the five variables associated with students’ perceptions of assessment, 526 higher education students completed the adapted Students’ Perception of Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to demonstrate the overall perception of students. In addition, multiple regression of the five scales on students’ grades was used to measure the relationship between students’ perception and performance. The results revealed that students across the three Faculties had a positive perception of assessment. However, no significant relationship was found between students’ perceptions of assessment and academic performance.",

The questionnaire comprised forty-three Likert scale items and an open-ended question. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program, employing means, standard deviations, and Independent Samples t-tests. The findings revealed that most students showed positive attitudes towards their non-native English-speaking EFL teacher in terms of teacher characteristics and personality, good preparation for class, and students’ happiness in class. Moreover, students also indicated that they appreciated the non-native English-speaking EFL teacher teaching reading, listening, and speaking skills regarding teaching English language skills. The results also indicated no statistically significant difference in the attitudes of Thai EFL university students from the two faculties toward a non-native English-speaking EFL teacher. The advantages or disadvantages that students indicated regarding learning English with a non-native English-speaking EFL teacher were discussed.

The main aim is to examine whether licensing requirements influence classroom strategies and educators’ enthusiasm toward teaching. The central research questions explore how licensing impacts teaching performance and motivation, and what implications this has for job satisfaction among English language teachers. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was employed. In the first phase, quantitative data were collected through a structured questionnaire administered to 1,084 English language teachers across Saudi Arabia. In the second phase, in-depth interviews with ten teachers were conducted to enrich and explain the survey findings. Results revealed a generally negative perception of professional licensing, with most teachers reporting minimal impact on their teaching practices and motivation. Only teachers aged 41–50 showed a statistically significant positive response. Financial penalties linked to licensing were found to reduce intrinsic motivation. The study highlights a misalignment between the intended purpose of licensing and teachers’ perceptions of its value. It recommends decoupling licensing from salary-related consequences, enhancing communication about its benefits, offering targeted professional development, and providing more frequent and flexible assessments. These steps may foster a more positive attitude toward licensing and improve its effectiveness in supporting educational quality.",

In the United States, English Language Learners (ELLs) often struggle to achieve their learning objectives because of the insufficiently qualified English as a Second Language (ESL) instructors in their home countries. This qualitative study examined how English language learners (ELLs) in Indiana perceive the impact of non-native English as a second language (ESL) teachers in their home countries on their ability to achieve learning goals in U.S. adult education and college settings. The research involved 18 participants, given a questionnaire under pseudonyms for privacy. An inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data, drawing from Krashen’s natural order theory of language acquisition and Vygotsky’s social development theory. The results revealed that experiences with non-native instructors impacted ELLs ‘ language proficiency and confidence in Western academic contexts. Recommendations for further research include evaluating language teaching materials, enhancing online practice opportunities, increasing the number of qualified English teachers in non-native regions, and creating social environments that support ELLs in practicing English. The findings revealed that improved language skills not only enhance capabilities but also increase interest in higher education, leading to better job prospects and social change across individual, family, academic, institutional, and societal levels. This study addressed the question: How do English language learners gain the confidence needed to complete higher academic learning? Understanding ELLs’ experiences in non-native contexts is crucial for helping them achieve educational goals in the U.S.",

          "abstract": "This auto-ethnographic study presents an account of the first author’s journey as an English teacher that covers two phases from the first-person point of view. The journey began in Nigeria, where English is considered a second language, and later continued in Türkiye where it is learned as a foreign one. Using personal memories and documents such as certificates, letters, and reflective journaling, the author retraces key moments that influenced both his teaching journey and his personal development. This work does not seek to offer neat conclusions, but rather to pause, reflect, and pose a question: What becomes of a teacher’s identity when he transitions between different cultural and linguistic landscapes? The researcher hopes to open a space for thinking about the ways our environments, students, and histories shape our professional identities and influence our practices. The study matters because it speaks to something many teachers experience but few name—the quiet transformations we undergo as we move across borders, literal and metaphorical. The findings reveal that transitioning from Nigerian English as a Second Language to Turkish English as Foreign Language contexts presents complex challenges, including conflicting language policies, (mis)use translation, excessive emphasis on exams, and limited target language use. Yet alongside the challenges came growth, renewal, and the deepening of a professional self. What emerges is a portrait of a teacher learning to listen more closely, not just to students, but to the silences within, where meaning often awaits.",

The significance of this research lies in addressing the critical gap between diagnostic assessment theory and practical implementation in examination-oriented educational contexts. The study examined three key questions: how cognitive subskills develop through diagnostic assessment, what feedback processing strategies students employ, and what pedagogical challenges teachers face during implementation. The 16-week intervention at an international school in southwest China involved five Grade 11 students at the Common European Framework of Reference A2 level and one experienced teacher. Data collection included semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, mock test recordings, and document analysis. Findings revealed significant improvements across five subskills: linguistic knowledge, syntactic complexity, pronunciation mastery, discourse management, and speech structure awareness. Students evolved from surface-level feedback engagement to sophisticated metacognitive processing strategies, particularly in pattern recognition and cross-contextual transfer. The teacher’s implementation emphasized culturally sensitive adaptations, addressing face-saving concerns and reconciling diagnostic assessment with examination traditions. The study demonstrates that integrating diagnostic assessment principles with culturally responsive pedagogy enhances speaking development for high-stakes examinations, with implications for curriculum design and teacher education. The single-site nature and small sample size limit generalizability, warranting broader implementation studies across diverse Chinese educational contex",

          "abstract": "Graduate studies have been proven to be a significant teacher’s professional learning. Pursuing graduate studies helps teachers strengthen their professional growth, develop teaching practices, and improve students’ learning experiences. Previous studies have shed light on internal and external factors encouraging teachers to embark on their graduate studies, leaving a knowledge gap in comprehending critical factors impacting the completion of such studies. Drawing upon the Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1989), this multiple case study aims to address this gap by examining factors affecting the completion of EFL teachers’ graduate studies in an English language teaching master’s program. Data were qualitatively collected through semi-structured interviews with ten purposefully selected teachers graduating from this program. Subsequently, data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Findings revealed two categories of influences, personal and contextual factors. On a personal level, intrinsic motivation, a positive attitude, and self-efficacy enabled participants to persist through academic challenges. Contextual factors included professional, institutional, and familial assistance that ignited their inner resilience and sustained their commitment to learning. Notably, most participants identified the former as more decisive in their graduate study completion than the latter. Critically, these findings align well with Bandura’s theory, emphasizing the dynamic interconnection among personal attributes, environmental conditions, and academic behaviors. Understanding these influencing factors is essential for minimizing drop-out rates and maximizing support to these teachers. This research ended with pedagogical implications for university program managers, teacher educators, and EFL teachers pursuing graduate studies.",

While influential corpus tools such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English and the British National Corpus serve as valuable resources for collocation learning, they also pose significant cognitive challenges for low-proficiency learners. Therefore, this study investigated the effectiveness of corpus tools integrated with pedagogical practices in facilitating verb-noun collocation learning among Chinese low-proficiency learners, to identify the most suitable tool tailored to their specific learning needs. A quantitative research method was employed, utilizing an intervention design with pre-and post-tests to compare the impact of using Sketch Engine for Language Learning (SkELL) and COCA in enhancing learners’ verb-noun collocation proficiency. Furthermore, the eight-week intervention integrated SkELL and COCA into collocation lessons respectively, each designed within the framework of Corpus-Based Language Pedagogy (CBLP), presenting how strategic instruction maximized the potential of corpus tools in facilitating learners’ improvement in verb-noun collocation proficiency. The findings of the study revealed that SkELL significantly improved verb-noun collocation proficiency among Chinese low-proficiency EFL learners, attributed to its intuitive interface, simplified search functions, and scaffolded learning environment. Moreover, this study offers valuable contributions to the design of corpus-based instruction by demonstrating the effectiveness of SkELL as a corpus tool tailored to the needs of Chinese low-proficiency EFL learners.

It investigates how multilingual scaffolding, particularly English, can support strategic listening when teachers and students do not share a first language. The study aims to enhance comprehension and learner autonomy through structured multilingual scaffolding. It also highlights the potential of English as a pedagogical bridge to foster comprehension and self-regulation in multilingual settings. An eight-week intervention was conducted with 36 second-year Thai students in an International Business Chinese program, using a framework informed by Lin’s Multimodalities-Entextualization Cycle and Vandergrift’s Metacognitive Pedagogical Sequence. A mixed-methods design was employed, with data collected through parallel Chinese listening tests, the Metacognitive Awareness Listening Questionnaire, attitudinal questionnaires, and interviews. Findings showed significant gains in listening performance and metacognitive awareness. Most students found translanguaging beneficial for understanding and applying strategies, though some expressed concerns about over-reliance on English and emphasized the need for balance. This study contributes to the pedagogy of Chinese as a foreign language by providing empirical support for the strategic integration of pedagogical translanguaging and metacognitive instruction. It recommends the balanced use of multilingual scaffolding to enhance listening development and foster learner autonomy in linguistically diverse classrooms.",

A survey and in-depth interviews were the research instruments used to analyze their attitudes toward using their first language for idea brainstorming during their writing lessons. The findings showed that English-major students had positive attitudes toward the roles of both Vietnamese and English brainstorming in improving writing performance. However, their Vietnamese use depended on the complexity and difficulties of the topics they had to deal with to support them with necessary ideas.

          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "In writing and publishing English academic papers, EFL doctoral students face many challenges, especially in meeting rigorous standards and overcoming language barriers. There are increasing relevant studies on academic writing pedagogy in the EFL context, but research from the emic perspective of students’ cognition in this process remains insufficient. With metaphor as a powerful tool to reflect psychological representation, metaphor analysis is frequently used in educational contexts to reflect students’ and teachers’ inner thoughts. Therefore, this study, using metaphor analysis, aims to explore EFL doctoral students’ metaphor representations of their English academic writing (EAW) experiences. There are two research questions: what kind of metaphors students use to characterize their EAW experience, and what cognitive, emotive, and behavioral features can be found. Eighty-eight Chinese doctoral students from one of China’s top universities participated in a questionnaire survey, where metaphors were collected through the elicited question: “English academic writing is like……because……”. Five source domains were found to characterize the target domain: CONSTRUCTION, MOVEMENT, NOURISHMENT, ACTIVITY, and WORK. Some common features were found despite individuals’ different expressions. The present study offers a new perspective for understanding students’ cognitions and feelings in EAW potentially contributing to EAP pedagogy.",

          "abstract": "This research adopts a quantitative-qualitative mixed-methods approach to examine the role of flipped classroom pedagogy in fostering critical thinking skills in English argumentative essays among Chinese EFL undergraduates. Specifically, the pilot study compares the mean scores of the pretest and posttest, focusing on the performance in English argumentative essays between the experimental group (N=32) and the control group (N=28). It investigates the impact of the flipped classroom on developing critical thinking skills in argumentative essays. It explores the experiences and perceptions of Chinese EFL learners regarding how the flipped classroom enhances their critical thinking skills in such essays. The ultimate goal is to assist these students in improving their writing quality, achieving better academic outcomes, and enhancing their competitiveness in future job markets. The significance of this research lies in its potential to promote the adoption of the flipped classroom as an effective pedagogical tool for supporting Chinese EFL undergraduates. The findings indicate that the experimental group’s mean scores steadily increased throughout the intervention, providing robust evidence of the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach in fostering critical thinking skills in Chinese EFL undergraduates’ argumentative essays writing. We hope this study will inspire more researchers to propose meaningful pedagogical implications and recommendations to improve teaching and learning processes within EFL contexts.",

          "abstract": "Due to globalization, Thai Business English students face challenges in cross-cultural communication, as traditional education often neglects the development of Intercultural Business Communicative Competence, and fails to address the specific needs of different stakeholders. Although some empirical studies have tried to address this issue, none has touched on incorporating IBCC with Content and Language Integrated Learning, especially in Thai EFL classrooms, which are crucial elements for learning language and culture. The current mixed-method study aims to address this gap by identifying essential IBCC contents for a Business English for Cross-Cultural Communication course and determining the CLIL principles needed to support its development. In this study, quantitative data was collected through questionnaires from three groups of stakeholders (84 students, 17 teachers, and 15 prospective employers) to assess key IBCC factors. For qualitative data, semi-structured interviews were used with selected participants to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CLIL principles. The findings suggest that Cognitive Cultural Intelligence should be focused on the most of all the six IBCC factors, while Metacognitive Cultural Intelligence should be focused on the least. The findings also suggest integrating CLIL components, such as business case studies with cultural analysis, language skills for negotiating across cultures, embedded cultural norms in business simulations, and the enhancement of intercultural communication strategies. These findings provide essential knowledge about the particular language and cultural competencies needed by Thai undergraduate students to succeed in international business careers, which makes it valuable for developing CLIL-based Business English courses and curriculum for Thai EFL students.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how writing anxiety and genre affect writing performance in group difference analysis among intermediate EFL learners in China, based on Hayes’s revised writing model. Writing performance was assessed using measures of syntactic and lexical complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Using the Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory, a total of 104 intermediate EFL students were categorized into high- and low-anxiety groups. Participants wrote both argumentative and narrative essays, analyzed with the second language (L2) Syntactic Complexity Analyzer, Lexical Complexity Analyzer, Grammarly Premium, and manual error coding following Polio and Shea’s guidelines. Mixed analyses of variance and t-tests revealed significant impacts of writing anxiety on complexity and fluency, and genre effects on all complexity, accuracy, and fluency, except for interaction effects. These results highlight significant variations in performance due to anxiety and essay type, supporting Skehan’s Limited Attention Capacity hypothesis and Biber and Conrad’s functional explanations. The findings advocate tailored pedagogical strategies to reduce anxiety in EFL genre-specific writing and improve educational outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While beneficiary satisfaction is getting significant traction in academic discourse, learners’ voices in EFL classrooms remain largely overlooked, highlighting a critical gap in second-language education. Explicit and implicit grammar instruction research, for example, is mainly informed and shaped by reductionist performance-based queries or teachers’ reflections on past practices, all while leaving a critical element, the learner, behind. The current study aims to address this gap by exploring the lived experiences of Saudi EFL learners attending a Saudi University (i.e., the University of Jeddah) after being exposed to three different modes of grammar instruction: explicit, implicit, and differentiated, for three weeks, twice a week, in sixty-minute sessions. After the sessions, five students from each instructional group (a total of 15) were randomly selected for comprehensive interviews, during which the study’s main constructs (e.g., explicit and implicit distinctions) were introduced in simplified and relevant terms. The results suggest that differentiated instruction was perceived as the most effective form of teaching (as it was associated with interesting themes like guided autonomy and useful learner-condition or form-condition interactions), followed by implicit instruction (with themes like self-regulated autonomy, authenticity, and involvement standing out) and, finally, explicit instruction (the effectiveness of which is mainly controlled by form-complexity).

Specifically, it sought to address to what extent classroom English proficiency affects teacher self-efficacy in Chinese polytechnic EFL teachers. It is significant as it highlights the crucial role of classroom English proficiency in shaping teacher self-efficacy, offering insights for targeted professional development programs. Data were self-reported by 254 polytechnic EFL teachers using two validated measurement scales. Both Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded satisfactory results, affirming the factor structure and indicating a good model fit. Descriptive analyses showed that both classroom English proficiency and teacher self-efficacy were at moderate levels. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between classroom English proficiency and teacher self-efficacy, with grammatical and lexical accuracy and range, as well as language of interaction, exhibiting stronger correlations with teacher self-efficacy compared to pronunciation, stress and intonation, and language of instruction. The multiple regression analysis further demonstrated that grammatical and lexical accuracy and range, together with language of interaction, have a significant positive impact on teacher self-efficacy. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing strategic training in grammar lexical accuracy and range, and the language of interaction skills for EFL teachers with limited English proficiency. Enhancing these competencies is posited to contribute to the development and sustained enhancement of self-efficacy among EFL teachers in Chinese polytechnics.",

Through symbolic acts, the book shows how colonial power systems and resistance provide their encoding by using conceptual metaphors together with image schemas. The first research questions focus on how cognitive-semantic models describe postcolonial symbolic actions and how those methods work when analyzing Heart of Darkness. The research adapts cognitive semantics and postcolonial theory as its methodological base to evaluate political, cultural and social symbolic acts through Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Image Schema Theory. Social symbolic acts prevail throughout the text as the novel focuses on the dehumanization experienced by colonized subjects and imperial oppression alongside political and cultural symbolic acts that use structured and ontological metaphors to maintain imperial narratives. The research enhances postcolonial literary analysis through cognitive-semantic methods, which explain colonial discourse symbols better. Studies should investigate how cognitive semantics applies to multiple postcolonial literary works to better investigate the relations between language and power structures and ideological forces.",

          "abstract": "The rapid transformation of traditional classrooms to online platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges for educators, particularly those teaching English as a Second Language. This research aims to explore the challenges faced by ESL teachers in adapting to and managing online teaching, as well as the strategies they employ to navigate this new digital landscape. Using a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with three ESL teachers to gather valuable insights into their experiences. Thematic analysis was applied to identify and categorize the challenges encountered by these educators during the implementation of online teaching. Additionally, the study investigated the strategies employed by teachers to overcome these obstacles and enhance the effectiveness of their online instruction. The findings reveal six major challenges faced by ESL teachers, including technical issues, time management, limited student access to technology, monitoring and assessment difficulties, students’ issues, and teachers’ competency issues. To address these challenges, teachers utilized three main strategies: self-empowerment through self-learning and upskilling in technology, effective monitoring and assessment techniques, and enhancing online learning through interactive engagement. The insights garnered from this study can assist educational institutions, policymakers, and educators in identifying areas that require support and improvement for more effective and efficient online teaching practices. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the importance of continuous professional development for ESL teachers to successfully navigate the complexities of online teaching and meet the diverse needs of their students in the digital age.",

The current study investigated the use of discourse markers by Vietnamese EFL students at an English center. The study aims to explore the use of DMs by Vietnamese EFL learners and investigates their perceptions of DMs in conversations. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods, utilizing audio recordings, questionnaires, and interviews to collect data. It involved one hundred twenty-five Vietnamese EFL students and five teachers as participants. The findings reveal that students use some discourse markers more frequently than others. The referential discourse markers prevail in participants’ responses, while using structural discourse markers is almost negligible. The results also indicate that students are practically aware of the importance and functions of discourse markers; however, they are not quite familiar with the different types of these devices. The teachers also recognized the importance of discourse markers for students’ language competence development, but considered their use less effective. This study makes a significant contribution to English teaching and learning in EFL contexts in Vietnam. The research suggests that teachers should raise students’ awareness of the benefits of discourse markers in oral communication. This study also recommends various strategies for teachers to improve students’ fluency and develop their pragmatic competence through using discourse markers in communication.",

Three main topics will be addressed in this study using a quantitative research approach to inquiry and students’ self-reported data: (1) how well the course design supports students’ effective assignment submission, (2) how beneficial the support mechanisms built into the course, (3) and how skilful students are in writing overall after finishing the course. The study incorporated a sample of 119 first-year female university students selected using a convenience sampling strategy. A survey was used to gather data and measure the perceived impact of teaching writing using a genre-based approach—using genres found in the student’s assigned textbooks. The course framework was designed to meet the practical needs of EFL learners, and it provides clear teaching and assistance to master particular writing genres. The results show that the genre-based writing course enhances task submission, offers strong support, and improves writing skills. However, challenges like group dynamics, deadlines, and writing anxiety were highlighted. By demonstrating the value of genre-based teaching strategies and pointing out areas for improvement, the findings of this study would advance the field of EFL instruction.",

Specifically, it challenges the conventional application of frequentist statistical methods in migration research, emphasizing their limi-tations in expressing uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge. From an epistemolog-ical perspective the paper highlights the limitations of traditional tools concerning what knowledge can be produced —the compression of likelihood of hypotheses— and how knowledge is produced —the consequences of relegating prior knowledge to a secondary role in analysis. The paper simultaneously motivates the need to expand tools available for statistical inference by highlighting the latent implications that the choice of method can have on the efficacy of migration research, motivated by literature on the philosophy of sci-ence and drawing concrete examples from migration governance.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the symbiotic relationship between the Cayman Islands and the centrality of the United States (US) in global financial networks, using their connection as a test case for a broader theory of how infrastructural power of states is achieved through transnational and networked strategies. The legal and financial infrastructure of the Cayman Islands is extensively used by US financial institutions. This infrastructure supports the development of a significantly US-centric fund industry, facilitating substantial investments into US capital markets. Additionally, it serves as a global conduit, channelling funds from regions such as Asia and Latin America into US markets, streamlining the process by which foreign investors acquire US securities, and supporting the development of complex USD-denominated financial products. This dynamic enhances the depth, liquidity, and complexity of US capital markets, thereby reinforcing US centrality in global financial networks and bolstering its geopolitical power through financial diplomacy, economic sanctions, regulatory influence, and control over critical financial infrastructure. The relationship underscores the infrastructural power of the Cayman Islands, whose financial and legal framework is essential for sustaining and amplifying US centrality. Consequently, this paper aims to integrate the transnational perspective on infrastructural power within the International Political Economy (IPE) and Geopolitics literature, demonstrating how the Cayman Islands function as a multifaceted networked site that strengthens, projects, and sustains US state power on a global scale.",

          "authors": "Anurag Kadel",
          "abstract": "Social and gender injustices in South Asia are deeply entangled with epistemological infrastructures that define what is known, who is allowed to know, and how knowledge is validated. This paper argues that ontological monocultures—from the Brahmanical logic of Manusmriti and colonial codification of law to modern technocratic rationalism—have produced enduring forms of epistemic injustice. Drawing on the work of Miranda Fricker (2007) and expanding with Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s (2014) concept of epistemicide, alongside South Asian thinkers like B.R. Ambedkar (1936), Uma Chakravarti (1993), Vandana Shiva (1993), and Sharmila Rege (2006), we trace a genealogy of knowledge suppression spanning caste, gender, and colonial power. We employ an interdisciplinary framework grounded in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and feminist and decolonial theory to examine how marginalized knowledge has been systemically discredited. The historical arc spans precolonial traditions through colonial impositions to postcolonial and contemporary developments, illustrating how a crisis of plurality afflicts South Asian knowledge systems. We position this inquiry as Research through Design (RtD), not to propose a singular solution, but to advocate for epistemic plurality as a foundation for social justice. Multiple case studies—from the codification of Hindu law under the British, to the exclusion of Dalit voices in academia, to the erasure of indigenous knowledges in development and technology—ground our analysis in lived realities. Finally, we outline a design-based approach—Seeds of Sovereignty and Friction-Led Inquiry—that operationalizes plural ontologies in civic infrastructures. These frameworks illustrate how participatory design and \"epistemic friction\" can surface suppressed perspectives, planting the seeds for cognitive justice in South Asia's future.",

Internet searches can be precursors of conflict intensity as a result of e.g. an increase in protests, violent behavior, or public announcements. Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties. I demonstrate the value of \\textit{salience} variables using various out-of-sample windows and performance metrics on the country- and province-month level. I find evidence that \\textit{salience} variables have considerable predictive power, outperform other commonly used variables, and are thus a valuable addition to the conflict forecasting toolkit.",

However, research on the determinants of students’ favorite subjects is less-advanced, although the cognitive and non-cognitive skills acquired by studying favorite subjects has potential effects that may be maintained and expanded throughout the entirety of students’ lives. Therefore, using newly available data from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, this pilot study analyzes the relationship between the teaching methods used by teachers and students’ favorite subjects with particular reference to mathematics and English. Empirical result show that the relationship between educational methods and the enjoyment of studying mathematics and English may not be strong. In addition, this study also confirmed that while some approaches are effective regardless of grade, the efficacy of other approaches changes by grade.

We answer the following research question: How do search results for Google Images compare internationally with those for Google Search, and how can these results be explained by changes in Google’s knowledge infrastructure? To answer this question, we carry out four steps: 1) theorise the relationship between web epistemology, calculative technology, platform vernacular and issue configuration, illustrating the dynamics of critical knowledge infrastructures on the web; 2) provide a potted history of Google’s use of computer vision in search; 3) undertake the first international comparison of search results from Google Search with Google Images; 4) analyse the visual content of search results from Google Images. Using quanti-quali digital methods including visual content analysis, social semiotics and computer vision network analysis, we analyse search results related to environmental change across six countries, with two key findings. First, Google Images search results contain fewer authoritative sources than Google Search across all countries. Second, Google Images results constitute a narrow, homogenised visual repertoire across all countries. This constitutes a transformation in web epistemology from ranking-by-authority to ranking-by-similarity, driven by a shift in calculative technology from web links (Google Search) to computer vision (Google Images). Our findings and theoretical model open up new questions regarding the impact of computer vision on the public availability of knowledge in our increasingly image-saturated digital societies.",

          "abstract": "The Roma are the largest stateless ethnic minority in Europe and the largest in Hungary. Roma identity may be endorsed by members of the community, or assigned by external observers, with no clear superiority of either definition. I used two waves of the unique Hungarian Youth Research (Magyar Ifjúság Kutatás) household survey (combined N=16015), which contains both self-reports and observer reports by surveyors about the Roma identity of participants, to 1) compare the size and overlap of the self-reported and observer-reported Roma community, and 2) assess with hypothesis-free, cross validated methods what characteristics are associated with self-reported and observer-reported Roma identity, and the mismatch of the two. I found that observers identified more respondents as Roma than self-reports, and both false negatives and false positives were common. Self-reports, observer-reports and false positives depend on similar variables, centered around large household size, financial deprivation, tolerance toward Roma, and limited adoption of digital technology. False negative observer reports (self-reported Roma considered non-Roma by surveyors) are predicted, however, mainly not by the absence of these characteristics, but by the adoption of cosmopolitan middle-class values such as tolerance towards foreigners, support for sustainable technologies and good health behavior. The results show that census reports about the Roma community are an underestimate of their public presence, either due to the ethnicization of poverty by external observers or identity concealment. Findings also indicate the presence of a large, well-assimilated Roma community who external observers fail to identify due to their non-stereotypical values and lifestyle.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in adults with NF1 and to identify key risk factors.  Methods: We adhered to PRISMA guidelines to search MedLine, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and other electronic databases from January 1980 through September 2023 using keywords “neurofibromatosis type 1,” “NF1,” “suicide,” and “suicidal ideation.” After removing duplicates and screening titles/abstracts, 29 articles underwent full-text review; 3 studies (total N=220 NF1 patients; sample sizes 50–60 each) provided sufficient quantitative data for meta-analysis. Quality appraisal employed standardized checklists. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression results from individual studies were synthesized narratively.  Results: The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among adults with NF1 was 42% (95% CI: 19–65%), significantly exceeding matched control rates of approximately 10%. Key predictors identified across studies included higher pain severity (p&lt;0.01) and greater perceived disability (p&lt;0.01). Comparisons between NF1 and NF2 cohorts indicated consistently higher frequency and intensity of suicidal thoughts in NF1 patients.  Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is alarmingly prevalent in adults with NF1. Chronic pain and functional impairment emerge as principal risk factors. We recommend routine suicide risk screening and targeted psychosocial interventions to support this vulnerable population.",

          "authors": "Enomy Germain",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between political stability, natural disasters, and economic growth in Haiti, a fragile and disaster-prone state. Using time-series data from 1990 to 2024, we estimate a series of regression models to evaluate whether political stability contributes to growth and whether its effect is influenced by the frequency of natural disasters. Baseline results suggest that political stability has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on economic growth. However, the interaction between political stability and natural disasters is not consistently significant across all model specifications. Robustness checks, including corrections for autocorrelation, clustered standard errors, and the exclusion of extreme years, indicate that while the interaction effect may exist, it is sensitive to assumptions about time dependence and model specification. By contrast, variables such as foreign direct investment, population growth, and global economic conditions emerge as more stable predictors of economic performance. These findings highlight the importance of political stability in fragile contexts, but they also suggest that its benefits may be limited when environmental shocks are frequent. Despite data constraints and the focus on a single country, the study contributes to broader debates on fragility and development by emphasizing the need for integrated policy strategies that combine institutional strengthening with climate resilience.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on resistance in a strong authoritarian context focuses on everyday acts of resistance and loose solidarity networks prior to protests and overt discursive resistance during the protests. These trends are disjointed since they ignore the discursive spaces surrounding dissidents in their everyday life. To bridge this gap, I introduce “discursive nonmovements” which refers to latent, diffused, and non-institutional spaces which serve as a gravity center for loose solidarity networks prior to protests and transform to protest discourse during it. By focusing on the case study of Iranian rap prior and during the Women, Life, Freedom movement, I show how songs have changed from implicit, hopeless, allegorical, and melancholic to explicit, hopeful, and vengeful. Further, by relying on phenomenological approaches to political opportunities structures, I argue that “mentioning the unmentionable” after years of implicit discursive resistance, serves as a public open invitation to ordinary citizens to engage in extraordinary acts of resistance.",

          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

Respondents who heard the report were 8 percentage points more likely to reject all forms of early marriage and 5.4 percentage points more likely to say they would report early marriage to authorities.

          "abstract": "This autoethnographic study explores manifestations of antisemitism on a European university campus, focusing on personal experiences as an Israeli Jewish student at the University of Coimbra. Drawing from firsthand observations, documented incidents, and interactions with protesters, administrative officials, and peers, the research highlights how hate-laden stickers, verbal threats, and institutional inaction shape a hostile academic climate. By weaving together personal narrative and scholarly frameworks on hate speech, higher education policies, and antisemitism, the study reveals a troubling dissonance between the university’s stated commitment to inclusivity and its inadequate responses to overt acts of discrimination.\n\nThrough detailed descriptions of unfolding events—from the initial appearance of incendiary slogans to meetings with administrators—the analysis illuminates how deeply entrenched biases can circumvent legal and procedural safeguards. In reflecting on emotional responses and the complexities of positionality, the autoethnographic lens underscores the human impact of hostile environments and the gaps in institutional support. The findings urge higher education stakeholders to reevaluate their protocols for handling hate speech and discrimination, calling for comprehensive measures that protect vulnerable groups and encourage critical engagement with contentious geopolitical issues. This work ultimately argues that acknowledging and actively combating antisemitism in academic settings is crucial for fostering genuine inclusivity and upholding the values of open, respectful scholarship.",

          "abstract": "Much existing research on job devaluation infers the role of cultural beliefs using the proportion of women in an occupation as a proxy. This study, rather than relying on the percentage of female workers, directly measures cultural feminine meanings using Japanese job advertisements analyzed through natural language processing. It empirically tests the devaluation mechanism and extends devaluation theory to the job level. Study 1 applies word embedding-based text analysis to identify culturally feminine meanings in job ads. Results show that postings semantically aligned with femininity, such as those using language semantically close to stereotypically feminine traits or family-oriented work-life balance benefits, are associated with lower wages, even after controlling for occupation. This implies devaluation’s operation at the job level. Study 2 consists of a factorial survey experiment targeting the labor supply side. Findings reveal that workers do not perceive jobs containing feminine cultural meanings as deserving of higher pay, even after controlling for occupation. The consistent perceptions across both labor market sides indicate that shared cultural beliefs legitimize lower wages for work culturally coded as feminine, thus empirically capturing the central mechanism of devaluation theory.",

          "abstract": "Food systems require sustainability transformations to reduce their negative environmental and social impacts. Food policy plays a crucial role in driving sustainability transformations in food systems, but fundamental change appears slow. Currently, there are urgent sustainability concerns in the European livestock sector, including livestock emissions and the pollution of surface water. Important lessons can be learned from the case of the Dutch manure problem (1950-2020), a persistent and salient sustainability issue. This article explains the lock-in of the Dutch agricultural policy regime by using the concept of policy feedbacks, drawing on theories from historical institutionalism and transitions research. Through process tracing, we find that policy feedbacks played a significant role, particularly highlighting the importance of actor coalitions that result in policy regime lock-ins. Based on this case, we draw policy insights relevant to both current and upcoming challenges in environmental pollution from livestock farming. Specifically, we highlight the role of actor coalitions, the siloed nature of policy development and tensions in multi-level governance as factors impeding transformation. We contribute to transitions research by proposing the concept of policy feedbacks as an additional lens to analyse sources of policy regime lock-in in societal systems and suggest for future research to investigate what factors could address these lock-ins.",

A consequence of these constraints is that the correlations in the random effects exhibit special symmetries, like block structure and/or Toeplitz-like diagonal-constant banding. Generating valid, positive-definite prior correlation matrices with such structure is typically non-trivial in the context of Bayesian model fitting. Here, we provide two effective solutions to the problem, the first based on an l2-norm penalty, and the second based on a flexible Cholesky factor parameterization that permits a priori constraints on the elements of the correlation matrix. We compare and contrast the methods using empirical and simulated network data, test for differences in efficiency, and highlight the partial strengths of each method, before discussing opportunities for further improvements. We also  provide generalizable implementations of both methods in Stan code.",

          "abstract": "In the aftermath of globalization, Western democracies have witnessed a surge in political disaffection and radical-right support. While economic and migration shocks have been widely studied, the political effects of border liberalization remain underexplored. This paper theorizes and tests how increased border permeability can generate political discontent, even without necessarily affecting immigration or direct economic competition. We argue that open borders enable brief, routine interactions between groups across historically closed frontiers. When this occurs between regions of unequal perceived status, it can erode symbolic boundaries and foster resentment. We examine this in the context of the German--Czech border, which transformed from a militarized Cold War frontier to an internal EU border. Leveraging two moments of liberalization---the fall of the Iron Curtain (1989) and Czech EU accession (2004)---we apply difference-in-differences and event study designs using municipality-level data from Bavaria. Border liberalization led to a drop in turnout (around  2 pp) and a rise in radical-right support (around 1 pp). This findings have implications on the determinants of backlash against globalization.",

While HE institutions globally have warned against the unregulated use of AI-generated content, the prevailing approach is to guide students in the ethical and transparent use of GAI tools. This research, based on primary data from a questionnaire involving undergraduate and postgraduate students across several UK HE institutions, aims to explore student perspectives on issues such as plagiarism, reliability of outputs, and the impact of GAI on the learning process; and how these perspectives vary across genders and domicile status (domestic vs. international students). Our findings show that students who identify as men report a higher frequency of GAI usage than women and that international students have more liberal standards regarding academic integrity compared to their UK counterparts.",

          "authors": "Chad M. Topaz; Gina Jae; Jude Higdon",
          "abstract": "This scoping review synthesizes recently published research on news media coverage of gun violence in the United States. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic search of Web of Science and Google Scholar databases identified 76 peer-reviewed empirical studies published since 2000. Analysis reveals several recurring themes. First, news media coverage tends to be greater for incidents involving numerous victims, particularly women and/or children; occurring in schools, religious sites, or government buildings; or carried out by perpetrators who are young, ideologically driven, and/or show signs of severe mental illness. Second, race plays a significant role in shaping narrative frames, with media portrayals often depicting white individuals more sympathetically compared to racially minoritized individuals, regardless of whether they are victim or perpetrator. Third, media narratives display dynamic evolution over decades, transitioning from framing gun violence as isolated and episodic to addressing it as a part of broader social contexts and societal concerns. Finally, news coverage of gun violence is associated with negative audience emotions, especially fear, as well as with increased gun background checks suggestive of accelerated gun purchasing. Regarding media coverage's role in inciting further violence, however, studies present mixed findings. Limitations include the exclusion of social media discourse, which warrants study in future research. Future studies should also examine how news media coverage represents individuals across diverse gender identities, LGBTQIA+ communities, and disability statuses, while adopting intersectional perspectives. Three interrelated conclusions emerge from this analysis: the different types of gun violence that occur, the level of news media attention each receives, and the academic research that has investigated these media portrayals to date.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning and algorithmic decision-making technology – i.e., “artificial intelligence” (AI) – is rapidly advancing and becoming more widespread at workplaces. For some individuals, this is beneficial in that it increases their productivity and generates new employment opportunities. Other individuals, however, could see their incomes and employment opportunities decline because AI takes over their work tasks or because they are insufficiently skilled to fully take advantage of AI technology in their work. Some of this is already visible and, given what is known from previous research on the implications of technological transformations, these developments are likely to affect people’s political attitudes and preferences. I investigate this empirically using novel indicators of AI exposure and AI complementarity in combination with data from multiple waves of the European Social Survey. I find that AI exposure and complementarity do indeed have meaningful effects on political attitudes and preferences (specifically demand for redistribution and support for right-wing populist parties): Increasing AI exposure, when combined with AI complementarity, significantly lowers support for redistribution and for right-wing populist parties, while high complementarity in the absence of exposure has the opposite effects. In addition, while the former effect got weaker over the last two decades, the latter became stronger. These findings add to a growing literature that shows that the “AI Revolution” is already having meaningful political effects.",

We additionally describe change across subsequent cohorts. We use harmonized data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Samples (IPUMS). We classify living arrangements into alone, with primary kin only (partners, parents, and children), and in extended households, and into more detailed sub-categories including, for example, single-parent households and extended families. Three historical ages of US living arrangements emerge. A “large household” system (1850–1940) characterized by relative stability in extended households, when primary kin arrangements incorporate the majority of the substantial gains in life expectancy; an era of “primary kin” dominance (1940–1980) when life years spent only with primary kin increase faster than life expectancy, while extended households decline; and a “diversified” phase (1980–onwards), with a decline in two-parent households in favor of greater diversity, including living alone and with extended family.",

          "abstract": "Traditional approach to research is studying a collection of data that is specific to a certain time, space, and level based on a social science theoretical framework. In contrast, this paper synthesises across space, time and level based on system thinking. This method integrates the narrative synthesis with a systemic perspective that recognises the interconnectivity among all global service systems in the global economy. Thus, it  examines, instead of economics, workflows that encompasses all economic phenomena, irrespective of any theoretical framework, in the global economy. The examination is a system thinking on two key definitions: Economic system; Organisational advantages. It substantiates that the social science discipline has yet to realise the systemic perspective for its research on the global economy. Consequently, the result is that an existing insidious hidden non-systemic framework is the root cause of persistent systemic failures in the global economic system that adversely affect all aspects of social life, ranging from financial to healthcare. Thus, the importance of this article is that it brings out the truth about the global economy. That truth is that the advancing global economy is taking the world to self-destruction. Unfortunately, the truth is a paradox that the theoretical framework is unable to unravel due to its non-systemic perspective. Complicating this paradox is the scholarly rigor emphasized by the theoretical framework to keep it as status quo, because the unraveling of truth is a paradigm shift in research on the global economy from economic to system thinking, which is not a social science discipline.",

Recent trends show a decline in hormonal contraceptive use in Western countries, but research has largely relied on cross-sectional data, leaving it unclear whether this trend reflects short-term period effects or broader cohort-driven changes.\nMethod: Using longitudinal data from the German Family Panel (pairfam; waves 1-14), this study applies supervised machine learning to identify potential predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. 37 predictors were included, encompassing areas of family demography, gender role values, health, origin, personality, region, religiosity, and socioeconomic characteristics.\nResults: The analyses showed a decline in hormonal contraceptive use across all birth cohorts over time. Both cohort and period differences shaped the key predictors of hormonal contraceptive use. Predictors shifted from family-demographic factors in older cohorts to personality traits in younger ones, highlighting increasingly personalized decision-making. The relevance of income underscored the economic dimension of access to contraception. \nConclusion: These shifts reflect evolving dynamics in contraceptive use, with implications for public health strategies and policymaking.",

          "abstract": "Visibilizar el trabajo que se realiza en el campo de los estudios de género es una de las labores que ha de desarrollar el mundo académico para fortalecer dichos estudios. Este trabajo se enmarca dentro de la línea de la producción científica con perspectiva feminista utilizando técnicas bibliométricas para hacer patentes las líneas de investigación más productivas en el campo científico de los estudios de género a partir de documentos recuperados de la Web of Science de España y Brasil. Esta representación permite ver las fortalezas y debilidades en las que la agenda feminista trabaja en estos dos países y los aspectos más representados en la ciencia mainstream del feminismo. Se toman como guía las denominaciones de líneas de investigación de trabajos precedentes con el mismo objeto de estudio. Se pretende realizar una reflexión más amplia respecto al feminismo y la objetividad de la ciencia, la academia y la bibliometría, para aportar claves hacia una bibliometría feminista más allá de la “gestión del género”. En cuanto a resultados, se destaca que España presenta un abanico multidisciplinario desde las ciencias médicas y psicológicas a las ciencias sociales (deporte, educación, feminismo, comunicación, sociología, etc.), mientras que en Brasil la línea más productiva es la referida a estudios de género y diversidad. Un aspecto a destacar por su valor e interés es que los estudios de género y feminismo en Brasil se plantean mayoritariamente desde la perspectiva de la salud mostrando poca multidisciplinariedad. Por último, la reflexión llevada a cabo obliga a desgranar los problemas en la delimitación del campo científico, en la base de datos utilizada y en la posible falta de profundidad en el análisis descriptivo, que podrían llevar al estudio a un nivel simplista, como analizan algunas autoras feministas sobre trabajos bibliométricos de estudio de género y feminismo.",

          "title": "Structural Selection Pressure and Cultural Degeneration in Organizations: An Evolutionary-Memetic Framework for the Suppression of Competence",
          "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of structural selection pressure to explain the \nparadoxical phenomenon in which competent individuals are marginalized or eliminated \nwithin organizational systems. Drawing on evolutionary biology and memetic theory \n(Dawkins, 1976; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Henrich, 2015), the study conceptualizes \norganizations as meme-based ecosystems where behaviors, values, and ideas \nundergo selection and replication. However, in many modern organizations, selection \npressure has become distorted: anger, dominance, and procedural rigidity serve as \nnegative filters that suppress memetic diversity and innovation. \nThe analysis identifies three dominant types of suppressive forces—rage-dominant \nleaders, charismatic silencers, and empathy-deficient operators—each contributing to \nwhat we term \"memetic desertification\": a cultural environment in which novelty is \npunished and conformity is rewarded. These dynamics lead to cultural senescence, \nloss of adaptability, and increased turnover. \nTo counteract this degenerative trend, the paper proposes structural interventions, \nincluding lateral promotion systems, anonymous feedback channels, and training for \nnon-dominant leadership. Furthermore, it suggests the incorporation of AI-based \nevaluation systems to depersonalize feedback and detect systemic biases in meme \nselection and suppression. \nBy reframing competence suppression as an evolutionary dysfunction of \norganizational structure, this paper provides a theoretical foundation for designing \norganizations capable of sustained innovation and cultural renewal.",

          "authors": "Seo-young Silvia Kim; Yimeng Li",
          "abstract": "Do Americans support small individual donations over other sources of political fundraising and does it matter for political behavior? Small online contributions are becoming more prevalent, and political elites and the media often idealize them as leveling the playing field in the American political ecosystem. However, we have little understanding of whether and, if so, how much the public supports small donations as a campaign funding source over others and whether such preferences translate into tangible changes in political behavior. We fill this gap with analyses of original surveys and survey experiments. Our results indicate that the public believes that there should be more small donations in American elections, fewer large individual donations, and to a much lesser extent, fewer PAC contributions. Using multiple conjoint experiments, we test whether candidates with higher dependence on small individual donors are preferred. Surprisingly, candidates relying more on small donors attract a higher likelihood of vote choice, not just within primaries or for Democrats, but across primaries, general elections, and all partisan affiliations. Such beliefs are unshaken when presented with information about lawmakers with the highest reliance on small donors, who are generally perceived as outsiders or ideologically extreme.",

          "authors": "Wong S Tan",
          "abstract": "Taiwan faces a critical \"crisis of efficacy\" where democratic institutions function procedurally but fail to deliver coherent governance solutions. The nation is trapped in a constitutional paradox: the very mechanisms that enabled democratic transition now prevent necessary evolution, creating what can be termed a \"democratic consolidation trap.\" The core driver is identity-based polarization that transforms routine policy debates into zero-sum sovereignty battles. This dynamic rewards ideological warriors over pragmatic problem-solvers, creating a leadership deficit that threatens national security. Taiwan's reactive governance model—responding only to acute crises—leaves chronic problems like housing costs, energy security, and institutional decay to metastasize. Constitutional amendment paralysis compounds these challenges, requiring supermajority consensus that polarization makes impossible. This creates a vicious cycle where institutional problems prevent constitutional reform, while reform remains the only legitimate solution mechanism. The analysis draws parallels to Late Qing institutional paralysis, warning of \"too little, too late\" scenarios where delayed responses render eventual solutions inadequate. Taiwan's window for incremental, legitimate reform may be narrower than assumed, requiring immediate action on meritocratic governance, anti-corruption measures, and consensus-building before the democratic system hollows itself out through continued ineffectiveness. The stakes could not be higher, and the moment for bold action was yesterday.",

          "title": "Where Do Theories Come From?",
          "authors": "Peter Beaufort Seddon",
          "abstract": "This book presents a theory of theory building and testing that builds on insights in Lipton’s 2004 book Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).  The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

          "title": "Disasters, Political Instability, and Economic Growth: Why Integrated Policies Matter in Fragile States",
          "authors": "Enomy Germain",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between political stability, natural disasters, and economic growth in Haiti, a fragile and disaster-prone state. Using time-series data from 1990 to 2024, we estimate a series of regression models to evaluate whether political stability contributes to growth and whether its effect is influenced by the frequency of natural disasters. Baseline results suggest that political stability has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on economic growth. However, the interaction between political stability and natural disasters is not consistently significant across all model specifications. Robustness checks, including corrections for autocorrelation, clustered standard errors, and the exclusion of extreme years, indicate that while the interaction effect may exist, it is sensitive to assumptions about time dependence and model specification. By contrast, variables such as foreign direct investment, population growth, and global economic conditions emerge as more stable predictors of economic performance. These findings highlight the importance of political stability in fragile contexts, but they also suggest that its benefits may be limited when environmental shocks are frequent. Despite data constraints and the focus on a single country, the study contributes to broader debates on fragility and development by emphasizing the need for integrated policy strategies that combine institutional strengthening with climate resilience.",
