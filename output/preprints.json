          "title": "Reconceptualising the sense of agency: expanding Decision-level Agency as mental action in the era of generative AI",
          "authors": "Gaiqing Kong",
          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) - the experience of controlling one’s actions and, through them, events in the external world - is a cornerstone of cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy, underpinning autonomy and responsibility. Yet research on SoA has overwhelmingly focused on Outcome-level Agency (control over external effects) and, to a lesser extent, Action-level Agency (control over bodily movements). A third and more foundational dimension - Decision-level Agency, defined as the experience of initiating one’s own decisions or intentions irrespective of overt action - has remained largely neglected. This omission leaves current accounts of agency and autonomy theoretically incomplete. Drawing on philosophical analysis and converging neuroscientific evidence, this paper argues that deciding and intending constitute mental actions in their own right, as the brain actively selects, commits to, revises, or withholds intentions. I propose a three-level framework - Decision, Action, and Outcome - that explicitly incorporates Decision-level Agency as a distinct yet hierarchically integrated component of SoA. This reconceptualization is not only theoretically necessary but ethically urgent in the era of generative artificial intelligence, where external systems increasingly shape human autonomy upstream at the level of decision formation rather than action execution. By outlining testable predictions and experimental paradigms, this work establishes Decision-level Agency as a measurable dimension of human volition and provides a framework for understanding and safeguarding autonomy in AI-mediated environments.",

          "authors": "Marta Migó; Michael Tilghman Treadway",
          "abstract": "To date, the field of computational psychiatry has largely focused on testing for dysfunction within lower-level cognitive processes in psychopathology, such as biases related to attention, reinforcement learning and memory. While this work has yielded important insights, there is clear evidence from empirically validated psychotherapeutic interventions to suggest that these lower-level cognitive processes are often intact. Here, we argue that etiological and maintaining factors for internalizing disorders may be more appropriately situated in higher level cognitive processes such as goal-selection. We further suggest that future research should incorporate behavioral tasks and models that allow for participant-defined goals to reveal higher-level mechanistic targets. We believe that these higher-level deficits in goal-selection, possibly in tandem with low-level impairments, may augment ecological validity and clinical relevance.",

          "title": "Mistaking covariance for combination in sensorimotor adaptation: Regression slopes do not test additivity",
          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

          "authors": "Sarah Nyczaj Kyle; Emma Barkus; Andria Jones; Stephen Dunne",
          "abstract": "Concerning levels of mental well-being have been identified among women in farming communities. However, despite women’s invaluable and essential contribution to the farming sector, studies examining how the unique farming lifestyle shapes women's experiences remain limited. This study, therefore, explores the role of women in the UK farming community. It examined how farming influences women’s roles and its positive and negative effects on their well-being and social connections. \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted between January and March 2023 with 30 women from the UK farming community, including farmers, wives, and daughters (Mage = 41.23 years, SD = 12.9). Data were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis.\nAn overarching theme, “The Farm Comes First,” was supported by three subordinate themes: “Navigating Traditional Family Dynamics,” “Balancing On- and Off-Farm Commitments,” and “Understanding Connections: People, Place &amp; Purpose.” Participants encountered multiple challenges, including restricted autonomy and role incongruence. However, findings also indicated that a deep sense of belonging was experienced through family, work, community, and farmland. \nWe explored how belonging is a dynamic and subjective experience that provides both connection and frustration, depending on individual circumstances. For many, belonging fostered a sense of identity, competence, and contribution; for others, disconnection created tension. Interventions should prioritise strengthening sources of belonging while addressing forms of exclusion. Future research should explore differences in connectedness among women in various farming roles. This paper contributes to psychological and agricultural literature by proposing a conceptual model of belonging among women in farming that reflects the complexity of their experiences.",

          "authors": "Oliver Singleton; Aikaterini Fotopoulou",
          "abstract": "The sense of presence and the sense of reality are often treated as distinct phenomena—presence as the feeling of \"being there\" in a virtual environment and reality as the ability to discern ‘real’ from ‘false’ phenomena. We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "title": "A novel idiographic approach to map subjective experience in endurance sport",
          "authors": "Juan José Pérez-Díaz; Darias Holgado; Tristan Bekinschtein; Daniel Sanabria",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel idiographic approach to mapping the lived experience of endurance athletes by integrating narrative self-reports with Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), a novel method for capturing the temporal dynamics of subjective experience. Two competitive cyclists were followed over eleven consecutive days, providing daily audio narratives and reconstructing their experiences across physiological, cognitive, emotional, and social contextual dimensions. The combined analyses revealed rich interindividual variability in attentional focus, emotional tone, and narrative style, despite comparable training levels and routines. TET trajectories exhibited clear temporal structures linked to session type and context, with competition days marked by peaks in effort, motivation, and flow. Coherence analyses demonstrated strong alignment between narrative descriptions and TET profiles, confirming that subjective dimensions manifest consistently across verbal and graphical modalities. Data driven regression analyses indicated weak correspondence between subjective dynamics, power output and heart rate, suggesting that lived experience might not simply parallel physiological and performance indicators. This methodological synthesis shows that integrating temporal and narrative data provides a multidimensional representation of endurance sport experience, revealing patterns and meanings that conventional metrics obscure. Rather than serving as a predictive tool, TET emerges as a complementary framework for enhancing athlete self-awareness, contextualizing performance fluctuations, and enriching coach athlete communication.",

          "authors": "Sabrina Hansmann-Roth",
          "abstract": "Gloss perception depends on several surface properties, but most studies measure these effects only one or two at a time. Here, we test whether a three-dimensional version of Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement (3D-MLCM) can be used to capture the combined influence of multiple cues on gloss. Observers judged which of two surfaces looked glossier while specular reflectance, albedo, and bumpiness were varied together. The additive model showed clear and reliable contributions of both albedo and bumpiness in addition to specular reflectance, and model comparisons confirmed that these cues significantly affected gloss judgments. The full model further revealed that these effects change with gloss level: bumpiness strongly influenced perceived gloss at low specular reflectance but had little effect at high gloss levels. These results show that 3D-MLCM provides stable, interpretable measurements and is a practical method for studying complex interactions between visual features that influence visual appearance.",

          "authors": "Lijin Zhang; Yiqing Liu; Dylan Molenaar; Joshua Gilbert; Klint Kanopka; Benjamin W. Domingue",
          "abstract": "Simulation studies are commonly used to improve understanding of psychometric models. For many common models, an essential feature of the simulation is the relative (to variation in person parameters) variation in item difficulties. A common practice has been to generate both item difficulty parameters and person parameters directly from a standard normal distribution or to otherwise stipulate distributions for both parameters at the outset of the simulation. This approach implicitly assumes that these distributions can adequately represent empirical data—an assumption that warrants careful examination. In this paper, leveraging 73 datasets from the Item Response Warehouse (Domingue et al., 2023), we examine the variability of item difficulty distributions in real-world datasets and investigate how this variation influences estimation and simulation. We identify key distributional characteristics (e.g., variance and skewness) and propose a new method for simulating realistic item difficulties based on empirical data. This method enhances the realism and applicability of simulation results, making them more reflective of real-world measurement conditions and improving the robustness of psychometric model evaluation",

          "abstract": "Across three studies (N = 849), conducted in Poland and the UK, we developed and validated the Crying in Romantic Relationships Questionnaire (CRRQ), a measure of crying frequency in the presence of one’s romantic partner. In the Preliminary Study, individuals described real-life situations in which people might cry in the presence of their partners. Based on their answers, we created an initial item pool. Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of the pool, revealing that the CRRQ comprises five factors, each focused on a distinct crying context (relationship discomfort, relationship comfort, other-oriented concern, emotion regulation, and manipulation). The results also supported the reliability and validity of the scale. Study 2 provided additional evidence for the 5-dimensional structure of the CRRQ and its good psychometric properties. Overall, our results indicate that the CRRQ can serve as a reliable and valid tool for measuring five distinct types of crying in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Giuseppe De Luca; Martina Benvenuti; Dieter Baeyens; Gerrit Meixner; Tung Khau; Elvis Mazzoni; Friederike Blume",
          "abstract": "Peer exclusion is linked to adverse outcomes, including reduced mood and unmet psychological needs. While the 2D Cyberball paradigm is widely used to simulate peer exclusion, its limited ecological validity has raised concerns. Therefore, this study compared the 2D Cyberball paradigm with a newly developed 3D Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm simulating peer exclusion in a classroom conversation.\nSeventy-six children (aged 8–12) and seventy-four adolescents (aged 13–16) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Participants experienced both paradigms in two separate sessions. Mood and psychological needs were assessed before and after each paradigm. Moderator variables included paradigm features, social support, and previous rejection experiences. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted.\nBoth paradigms led to a decrease in positive mood and psychological needs and an increase in negative mood. However, stronger negative effects emerged after the 2D Cyberball paradigm. The 3D VR paradigm was perceived as more realistic and immersive, and its effects remained consistent across levels of the moderator variables, indicating robustness in responses. Adolescents showed stronger emotional and motivational reactions than children in the 3D VR condition, but not in the 2D Cyberball condition, suggesting greater developmental sensitivity of the immersive simulation.\nOverall, results confirm that the 3D VR paradigm effectively simulates peer exclusion while offering higher ecological validity than the 2D version. Although the 2D Cyberball paradigm elicited more intense negative effects, the 3D VR paradigm better captured naturalistic and age-related differences in peer exclusion experiences, thereby providing a more developmentally appropriate and ecologically valid research tool.",

          "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading difficulty (RD) frequently co-occur, yet it is unclear whether their co-occurrence and cognitive profiles remain stable across the lifespan. This review examined whether the rates and cognitive manifestations of ADHD+RD change from childhood to adulthood. Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PubMed were searched. Studies were included if they reported the proportion of children or adults with ADHD+RD, or assessed cognitive performance in at least one of the following domains: attention, cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibition, general memory, planning, problem-solving, processing speed, or vocabulary. Random-effects proportional meta-analyses synthesised co-occurrence rates across child and adult studies, which were compared using a z-test. Random-effects meta-analyses of standardised mean differences synthesised pooled effect estimates across cognitive domains for children and adults, which were compared using an independent samples t-test. This review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (number: CRD42023463062). Of the 3,981 records identified, 153 studies were eligible: 98 examined prevalence, and 69 examined cognition. Pooled ADHD+RD prevalence was 0.23 (95% CI [0.20, 0.27]) in children, and 0.23 (95% CI [0.12, 0.40]) in adults. Pooled cognitive performance was -1.11 (SE = 0.09, 95% CI [-1.28, -0.95]) for children, and -0.70 (SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.91, -0.49]) for adults, with no significant child-adult differences across domains. Heterogeneity remained high across all syntheses (I2 &gt; 75%). The findings indicate comparable ADHD+RD co-occurrence rates and cognitive performance across development, have implications for the assessment, diagnosis and support of ADHD+RD, and highlight several methodological considerations for future research.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in science is high, but extends unevenly to scientists and their work. Recent accounts of this phenomenon refer to scienciness, suggesting that more prototypical examples and practitioners of science benefit more from the public’s general trust in science. However, current understandings of the public concept of science are too limited to yield definitive predictions about which scientists, and which scientific work, are perceived as more sciency than others. Here, we analyse patterns of linguistic associations in over 100 billion words to characterise the semantics of the public concept of science. These analyses show that sources, occupations, institutions, and social outcomes vary systematically in the strength of their association with science, and that this variation reliably predicts the extent to which they are associated with trust. These results shed light on the public concept of science, confirm sciency exemplars of science are more trusted, and help understand why the public trust science in general but also reject scientists and their work.",

          "authors": "Damien Le Clézio; Maël Delem; Merlin Monzel; Gaën Plancher",
          "abstract": "There is a long-standing debate about the role of visual mental images in reasoning. Knauff and Johnson-Laird's (2002) Visual Imagery Impedance Hypothesis (VIIH) suggests visual imagery can hinder abstract reasoning, as evidenced by slower responses to visual compared to spatial and control problems. Aphantasia — reduced or absent visual imagery— offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis. In an online version of the reasoning paradigm used in VIIH studies, aphantasic and typical imagers completed three problem types (visual, spatial, control), while reaction times and accuracy scores were measured. In addition, a second classification, based on the Object-Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ), was employed to differentiate participants according to their cognitive style and explore possible performance differences between the visualiser, spatialiser and verbaliser clusters. Our study replicated the findings of Knauff and Johnson-Laird (2002), demonstrating robust evidence of a slowdown for visual problems in comparison to spatial and control ones in typical imagers. This effect was inconclusive in aphantasics, along with the difference between the groups. More in-depth analyses distinguishing “complete aphantasia” and hypophantasia suggested that the latter group was more affected by visual problems. Finally, our OSIVQ classification-based analyses revealed a meaningful slowdown in reasoning for the visualiser cluster, pointing to a possible influence of cognitive style on performance. Overall, our results demonstrated the importance of considering the influence of mental images and cognitive styles in theories of reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Many experiments in psychology involve deceiving participants about aspects of the study. Researchers who employ deception sometimes administer post-experiment suspicion probes and exclude participants from analysis if their responses indicate that they were not successfully deceived. However, several studies have found that their suspicious participants behave as if they were deceived as intended. One explanation is that participants infer that they were deceived upon being presented with a suspicion probe, which biases them to overreport being suspicious. We tested whether post-experiment beliefs about deception can indeed induce such biases by manipulating whether we admitted to using deception before administering suspicion probes. Admitting to deception did not increase the amount of suspicion reported (Experiment 1), nor did the content of participants’ suspicions reflect the content of our admission (Experiment 2). Results suggest that it is unlikely that suspicion probes ‘tip off’ participants in a way that causes them to overreport suspicion.",

While much progress has been made using traditional laboratory-based methods of stress induction, we suggest that there is great potential in applying virtual reality (VR) since it enables a diverse range of stressors to be consistently delivered in the form of rich and immersive experiences. \n\nTo validate these VR stressors, however, we must assess their psychophysiological impact and compare them to established lab-based paradigms. In the current study, we recorded the subjective responses to two virtual reality stressors (“Spiders” and “Horror”). Using a repeated measures design, levels of VR-induced stress were compared to a speeded arithmetic task with negative evaluative feedback (a modified version of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST)) in healthy participants. For a subset of participants, basic physiological data (mean heart rate (HR) and respiratory frequency) are available.  \n\nBoth MIST and VR produced significant increases in subjective ratings of stress, desire for avoidance, negative affect, and perceived threat, as well as in respiratory frequency. Sizes of effect were comparable across the stressors, apart from negative affect and perceived threat, which were greater for the MIST. \n\nOverall, VR allows effective stress induction in healthy participants. Moreover, it was associated with a number of advantages, including convenience, and a lack of need for participant deception. These findings support the use of VR for inducing and exploring patterns of stress responses in humans.",

This study addressed this question by directly examining the learning processes. In two experiments, children and adults completed a linguistic (Syllable) implicit learning task and a nonlinguistic (Tone) control task. In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults. These findings suggest that children’s developing language network is especially well suited to efficiently acquire new linguistic inputs.",

          "authors": "Julian Gutzeit; Jasper Amadeus Bischofberger; Lynn Huestegge; Grit Hein",
          "abstract": "Social gaze is a fundamental cue regulating approach and avoidance in social interactions, yet it remains unclear how repeated gaze exchanges give rise to enduring social preferences and closeness. Here, we propose a computational learning account in which gaze-contingent feedback generates prediction errors that update latent social values, thereby shaping social closeness over time. According to this account, direct and averted gaze function as socially rewarding or non-rewarding outcomes whose impact depends on individual reward calibration. We tested this account using a gaze-interaction paradigm in which participants repeatedly chose between two interaction partners that predominantly (70%) responded with direct or averted gaze and rated their perceived social closeness toward each partner. Consistent with the model, participants increasingly preferred and felt closer to the partner who more frequently returned direct gaze. Computational modeling revealed that gaze direction elicited prediction errors that updated the latent value of the interaction partner. Crucially, these learning signals were calibrated by individual differences in the subjective reward value of direct gaze. Initial attractiveness and valence of the interaction partner predicted this calibration, indicating that pre-existing impressions shape how gaze feedback is valued. In turn, reward calibration was reflected in participants’ post-interaction social evaluations, demonstrating how learning experiences contributed to impression formation. Together, these findings provide a computational account of how minimal gaze interactions can give rise to social preference and closeness through reinforcement learning mechanisms. More broadly, they suggest that eye contact functions as a powerful but individually calibrated social signal that dynamically shapes social affiliation.",

          "abstract": "Given the rising prevalence of autism among racial minority children in the U.S., but persistent service use disparities, this study examines potential bias in specific items from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), a highly regarded autism evaluation. We leveraged unidimensional item response theory graded response models and a sample of 735 children to analyze the differential item functioning (DIF) of items within ADOS Module 3. Three items showed significant signs of racial bias: A1 (overall language level), A5 (offers information), and D5 (compulsions and rituals). On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0-48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children, and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. This analysis suggests a small but detectable amount of bias in several specific ADOS items, but not in items central to informing an autism diagnosis. Thus, bias appears statistically, but not clinically, significant. This contributes to examinations of racial bias in the ADOS as the first analysis of Asian children, and the first in-depth look at all items in the most commonly used version among school-aged children.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are popular tools for explaining speeded decisions because their parameters capture different aspects of the decision process. While researchers increasingly use Bayesian methods for estimating EAM parameters, computational costs and the necessity of tractable model likelihoods still pose obstacles for traditional methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Neural posterior estimation (NPE) addresses these obstacles by training a neural network to approximate the joint posterior distribution from simulated data, which only requires a generative model and amortizes computational costs at inference time. However, the quality of the approximation can suffer when the test data at inference time differs from the training data. Both test and training data stem from data-generating contexts and, for EAMs, these are influenced by the experimental design. Using the Racing Diffusion Model as a test case, we investigated how well NPE can generalize across changes in two types of experimental design contexts: number of trials and data-generating prior contexts that affect the error rate. Using MCMC as a reference, we showed in two simulation studies that NPE generalized well across changes in trial numbers but less well across error rates. We applied NPE to empirical datasets from reasoning tasks and found that the patterns observed in our simulation studies held. We discuss challenges and future directions to assess and improve the generalization for neural estimators for EAMs.",

          "abstract": "There is growing concern that smartphones and social media (S/SM) disrupt adolescent sleep, wellbeing and cognition, yet causal evidence from robust interventions is limited. To assess the acceptability of a total 21-day S/SM detox we conducted a preregistered (https://osf.io/79zd2) pilot randomised control trial with eighty-two adolescents aged 13-18 years from UK schools. Participants were randomly assigned to a total S/SM ban (N=26), total S/SM ban with access to a basic “brick” phone (N=26) or a business-as-usual control (N=30). Pre-and post-intervention measures of sleep, wellbeing, and cognition were collected using surveys, wearables, and cognitive tasks.  Retention was high, with 13% attrition across groups. At 21-days, both ban conditions showed tentative improvements in sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and working memory relative to the controls, however these changes were not maintained at a two-month follow-up. Open-ended responses indicated mixed or negative experiences for 50% of participants, including boredom, functional reliance on smartphones, and fear of missing out, although 83% endorsed the need for government action. Digital detoxes appear feasible for generating causal evidence however, complete abstinence can pose challenges. Fully powered trials should ascertain whether more targeted interventions (e.g., limiting bed-time use) are as effective.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Managing mood, cognition, and fatigue are top unmet needs reported by stroke survivors, which impact quality of life. There is currently no standardised UK care pathway to support post-stroke psychological outcomes. The Enhanced Reviews for Psychological Changes (ENRICH) programme, an intervention co-designed with stroke survivors, carers, and healthcare professionals, aims to fill this gap. Here, we describe the protocol for evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of ENRICH. \n\nMethods and Analysis: ENRICH reviews comprise cognition, mood, and fatigue assessment, personalised psychoeducation and tools to communicate results and discuss self-management strategies, delivered at 1, 3, and 6-months post-stroke. N=140 participants (N=80 stroke patients, N=45 carers, N=15 Health care professionals) will be recruited to a single arm multicentre feasibility study.\nStroke patients and carers will complete questionnaires of quality of life, mood, and healthcare resource use at 6- and 9-months post-stroke, and an optional interview on experiences of ENRICH. Process evaluation will include fidelity assessment via audio recordings. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for study outcomes. Key qualitative acceptability outcomes are sought on intervention delivery by clinicians, patients and carers. Key intervention delivery feasibility outcomes are training clinicians, competency and fidelity delivering ENRICH, and review completion rates. Study feasibility outcomes will include site and participant recruitment and retention rates and completion of candidate primary outcomes measures on quality of life. \n\nEthics and Dissemination: The ENRICH study was approved by a UK Research Ethics Committee (reference: 24/LO/0341). Consent procedures include a waiver of consent to the intervention itself due ENRICH’s service-level design and written informed consent/consultee advice for participants providing research data. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences and lay summaries for study participants and healthcare professionals. Results will inform whether ENRICH is acceptable to delivering clinicians and receiving stroke patients and carers, and provide key insights to inform a future randomised trial to determine effectiveness. \nTrial Registration: ISRCTN16018388 (Protocol version 1.3)",

          "authors": "Samuel Finnerty",
          "abstract": "Policy responses to the climate crisis have lagged behind the scientific consensus on its seriousness, prompting a growing number of scientists to engage in activism, including civil disobedience. This shift challenges traditional norms of neutrality and objectivity, raising questions about how scientists reconcile their professional identity with activism and sustain engagement. Drawing on two years of immersive ethnography (participant observation and autoethnography) with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion (S4XR) in the UK, this study traces the lived processes through which scientists enter activism, manage identity tensions, and decide how far to go. Findings show that identity-aligned spaces legitimise first steps and foster belonging. Scientists strategically draw on professional expertise and scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, peer-reviewed papers) to legitimise action and unify scientist-activists; at the same time, these symbols present challenges, as not all scientists identify with them, and they may invite audience expectations about universal expertise. Over time, activism reshapes professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act and producing a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Sustained commitment depends on collective efficacy, peer affirmation, and care practices that enable self-determined roles and buffer burnout. Escalation is non-linear: risk thresholds often rise with experience, yet professional, personal, and ethical considerations continue to influence decisions. Structured around a process-oriented framework, the analysis identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories, from initial hesitation to sustained participation, offering insights for social psychological models of collective action and for strategies to engage scientists in effective, sustained climate action.",

          "authors": "Harriet J Smith; Emma Holmes",
          "abstract": "Do we learn better from a broad range of variable examples, or a narrow set of consistent ones? While higher-variability training is often assumed to generate more robust category learning, it remains unclear how different types of variability affect task performance, and whether variability affects all tasks equally. We examined how different forms of variability influence learning by manipulating pitch variation (but equating average pitch) across shorter and longer timescales when participants learned to identify new voices. To examine task-specific differences, we tested performance on a voice identification in noise task and a speech intelligibility task. The nature of variability during training produced distinct outcomes for subsequent voice recognition in noise: exposure to fine-grained, moment-to-moment pitch variability during learning affected performance more than exposure to broader, between-sentence pitch variability. In contrast, neither form of variability affected speech intelligibility: participants showed a comparable benefit to speech intelligibility when listening to trained voices compared to novel voices, regardless of their previous exposure to pitch variation within trained voices. These findings demonstrate that variability is not uniformly beneficial, but instead interacts with the type of variability and the task. These results challenge current theories of perception and learning, which either propose that variability is stripped away during learning or treat variability as a single construct. Instead, our results demonstrate that at least some types of variability are maintained during learning—but not all types of variability are treated equally, and different types are utilised in distinct ways for different tasks.",

          "abstract": "In controversial ethical issues professional obligations may conflict with personal values. Actors may assume roles that do not correspond with their personal values.  We examined actors in the theater play \"Gott\" by Ferdinand von Schirach dealing with assisted suicide. We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

          "abstract": "Feedback learning supports flexible behavior in changing environmental contexts, but declines with age. Motivational aging theories, however, suggest that socio-emotional feedback can reduce these deficits, though it is unclear whether this effect depends on the social, emotional or communicative information in feedback. Participants from two age groups, n= 24 older adults (M = 72.37 years; SD=3.37) and n = 22 younger adults (M = 22.63 years; SD=1.78), therefore completed a probabilistic learning task in which stimulus–response associations had to be learned via unfamiliar social (hand gestures) or non-social (abstract shapes) feedback. To capture neural correlates of feedback processing, two ERP components were investigated; the feedback-related negativity (FRN), associated with the detection of unexpected events, and the P3b component, linked to working memory updating. Results revealed that younger and older adults learned more effectively from social than non-social feedback, with older adults benefitting most. The FRN was enhanced after social feedback in older adults, but after non-social feedback in younger adults. The P3b was more pronounced for social feedback, primarily driven by larger valence-related differences. In contrast, non-social feedback elicited increased frontal activation, indicating higher processing effort irrespective of participants’ age. These findings reveal a processing advantage for social feedback that appears biologically rooted rather than primarily explained by motivational aging theories, which may require additional facets such as emotional or communicative information.",

Firstly, we argue that the impartial prior distribution is sensible for auditors because it is easy to justify, interpret, and explain. Secondly, we show that Bayes factors computed using this prior distribution have desirable statistical properties. Finally, we compare these Bayes factors with traditional p-values in an audit sampling context and elaborate on the merits of the impartial Bayesian hypothesis test.",

          "abstract": "Understanding habit formation in humans remains a fundamental challenge, partly due to the constraints of laboratory-based studies. Thus, this study investigated whether prolonged, real-world engagement with a novel smartphone-based task could induce habitual behavior. Across five pilot experiments (n=27-43; total N = 177), participants were randomly assigned to either a short (ST) or extended training (ET) condition using a gamified button-press task delivered via a custom web application. Habit formation was assessed through three complementary tests targeting hallmark features of habitual behavior: automaticity, inflexibility, and insensitivity to outcome devaluation. While the ET group showed improved performance on dual-task measures (suggestive of increased automaticity), neither the devaluation nor the inflexibility tests yielded conclusive evidence of habit induction across experiments. Bayesian analysis supported the absence of robust group differences in insensitivity to outcome devaluation. Our findings highlight the difficulty of inducing measurable habits in humans, even under prolonged and ecologically valid training. Crucially, they also call into question the utility of outcome devaluation as a definitive measure of habit, regardless of training duration or setting. We argue that this widely used paradigm may miss important aspects of stimulus–response learning and suggest the need for alternative or refined tools to capture the complexity of human habit formation. Our null results, provide methodological insights for future research and suggest that smartphone-based paradigms, while scalable and flexible, require further refinement to elicit and detect true habitual behavior. All code and data are openly shared to promote replication and advancement in habit research.",

          "abstract": "Identifying shared and distinct profiles, whether in symptom combinations, personality traits, or cognitive abilities, is essential for understanding psychological phenomena, yet doing so requires navigating interrelated theoretical, conceptual, and technical complexities. First, psychological phenomena typically exist along continuous spectra rather than discrete categories, complicating the characterisation of inherently heterogeneous constructs. Second, studying individual differences requires balancing population-level generalisation with person-level interpretability, which is critical for applied science. Third, psychological data often contain missing values, non-linear relationships, and high-dimensional patterns that violate standard statistical assumptions. Commonly used approaches for profile detection fail to address these complexities simultaneously, typically producing oversimplified or difficult-to-interpret results that obscure person-centred patterns. In contrast, Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) offer a powerful, visual, and intuitive solution that addresses these challenges. Despite growing interest, SOMs remain underutilised in psychology, potentially due to a lack of accessible tutorials and clear guidelines tailored to the field. This tutorial introduces SOMs to psychologists without technical backgrounds, emphasising practical implementation. We provide evidence-based guidance for key methodological decisions, accompanied by annotated R code. Using a dataset of depressive symptoms as an illustrative case, we present a complete workflow covering data preprocessing, map initialisation, parameter optimisation, and interpretation. We further discuss advanced SOM extensions relevant to psychological research and highlight key limitations of the method. By providing clear guidance, this tutorial facilitates the adoption of SOMs, advancing nuanced, person-centred analyses that preserve the complexity of psychological phenomena.",

While many intervention strategies have been tested in recent years, the field remains characterized by fragmented findings and context-specific results. Responding to the critical need for cumulative evidence in public relations scholarship, this study employs a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess the overall effectiveness of interventions intended to counter potential misinformation. Across 13 studies (N = 5,650), public relations responses yielded a small to medium-sized negative effect on belief in misinformation (d = −0.24), a medium-sized positive effect on belief in the organization’s corrective communication (d = 0.44), and a small positive effect on pro-organization attitudes and intentions (d = 0.19). Among the specific strategies examined, prebunking emerged as a particularly promising approach. The findings suggest that while current public relations interventions are preferable to inaction, they are often insufficient for fully addressing the growing threat of false claims. By integrating disparate experimental data, this study offers robust quantitative evidence to guide future public relations theory building and evidence-based practice.",

Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

In the present study, we examined historical differences in workers aged between 50 and 52 in either 2011 or 2022/23, based on two samples of the population-based German lidA survey. We found that those interviewed in 2022/23 showed slightly lower intrinsic work motivation (d = 0.11) than their earlier counterparts. Analyses also showed that opportunities for development and social support showed a stronger association with work motivation in the later-born sample, compared to the earlier cohort. Our results suggest that historical changes may affect work attitudes and that job demands and resources are possible targets to address workers’ work motivation.",

In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI drafts emails, summarizes medical results, and shapes social feeds, psychological science faces two questions: What does AI do to human behavior, judgment, and wellbeing? What does it reveal about the theories we use to explain them? This article examines emerging findings on trust and the dehumanization of AI users, literacy-dependent fear and awe, and large-scale persuasion, advice, and delegation. Across these domains, familiar mechanisms—source credibility, mind perception, ownership, control—operate in new environments where content generation is effortless, interaction is seamless, and influence scales invisibly. AI is less a synthetic mind than a stress test on three clusters of human functioning: epistemic (how people handle evidence and uncertainty), social-evaluative (how they perceive and judge others), and motivational (how they pursue goals and maintain identity). When current theories fail to predict behavior around AI—when people simultaneously overtrust hidden AI advice and distrust visible AI users—those failures reveal where core constructs remain underspecified. This framing clarifies what changes in the age of AI (scale, speed, opacity), what does not (the underlying psychological processes), and where theory must be sharpened to accommodate minds operating in AI-saturated environments.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Australian Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS-AU) to detect post-stroke cognitive impairment within three months of stroke.\nParticipants and setting: Stroke survivors (n=53) within 12 weeks of stroke were recruited from three states in Australia.\nMain measure: The OCS-AU.\nOther measures: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.\nDesign: A validation study was conducted to analyse the sensitivity and specificity of the OCS-AU in subacute stroke using a neuropsychological test battery as the reference standard. The MoCA was included for comparative purposes. Impairment was defined as failing any OCS-AU cognitive domain, scoring below 26 on the MoCA, or failing at least two domains on the neuropsychological test battery.\nResults: To detect impairment within individual cognitive domains, most OCS-AU scores had low sensitivity, ranging from 0.12 (Executive) to 0.92 (Spatial Attention). Specificity was higher, ranging from 0.80 (Spatial Attention) to 0.96 (Praxis). Regarding the detection of multi-domain cognitive impairments, MoCA scores showed high sensitivity (0.81) but low specificity (0.42), compared with OCS-AU lower sensitivity (0.70) but higher specificity (0.58).\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the OCS-AU has strong domain-level specificity, but may miss some individuals with mild to moderate memory and executive impairments, while the MoCA appears more sensitive to domain-general impairment, but may misclassify individuals without post-stroke cognitive impairment. Thus, the OCS-AU and MoCA could be utilised for different purposes, to leverage their strengths when addressing specific clinical needs.",

Amid reports of both therapeutic benefit and harm, the scientific evidence supporting these applications remains inconclusive.\n\nFollowing PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar from June 2017 to July 2025. We included peer-reviewed, empirical studies of transformer-based LLMs used to deliver, augment, or analyze mental health support. We extracted data on sample composition, study design, the adoption of responsible evaluation practices, and model and dataset choices.\n\nWe identified 132 studies. Of 36 client-facing studies with human participants, most were small (median n = 42), uncontrolled (26/36), and recruited participants without a diagnosed mental disorder (35/36) using user experience metrics (23/36) rather than clinical outcomes (12/36). Responsible evaluation practices were generally not implemented, including safety protocols for risk detection (18%) and potentially harmful content (16%); real-world implementation was rarely addressed (7%). Across the two highest-quality controlled clinical studies, effect sizes ranged from d = .44 to .90 in symptom reduction.\n\nThis gap between widespread public adoption and the limited evidence base stresses the need for robust methodological standards, including rigorous clinical trials, a focus on safety and implementation, and standardized, clinically meaningful benchmarks. Stronger evidence is needed to document that generative AI systems can safely and meaningfully improve access to mental health treatment.",

          "abstract": "Background:  Approximately 1 in 3 acquired brain injury (ABI) survivors will have post-ABI depression. Behavioural Activation (BA), an intervention that encourages engagement in positively reinforcing activities, shows promise. Here, we conduct a process evaluation of two group-based BA interventions for adults with ABI. \nMethods: Adults (≥18 years) recruited from local ABI services, charities, and self-referral via social media were randomised to receive either “Traditional” BA (scheduling and engaging in positively reinforcing activities combined with cognitive management strategies) or “Experiential” BA (participating in reinforcing activities within-session but without explicit attempts to plan between-session activities). Interventions were delivered once weekly over 8 weeks. A semi-structured interview at 1-month follow-up focused on participants’ perspectives of intervention benefits and processes associated with mood and activity levels. Data were collected in-person and, due to COVID-19, remotely. \nResults: N=49 participants completed interviews (Traditional BA n=25, Experiential BA n=24). A positive therapeutic milieu, a sense of group cohesion and being able to share common ABI-related experiences were felt to foster psychological safety, reduce social isolation and underlie mood/activity improvements by participants in both groups. Processes more strongly linked to Traditional BA included developing their skillset in coping with low mood, avoidance and cognitive barriers to activity engagement, aligning scheduled activities to values, and challenging negative thinking patterns. Conversely, processes more strongly linked to Experiential BA were increased in-session enjoyment, participating in activities in sessions enhancing present-mindedness, and having choice and control into selecting within-session activities. \nConclusions: Positive group processes may enhance outcomes associated with group-based BA delivered to adults with ABI. Specific methods of delivering group-based BA may have differing underlying mechanisms that should be captured and maximised in BA intervention delivery in ABI, including value-based activity scheduling and promoting autonomy in session content. \nTrial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03874650.

          "abstract": "Background: Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) represents a vulnerable period for transitional age youth (TAY), with high risk of disengagement and unmet mental health needs. Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

Shifts described by therapists were organized around four dimensions: process orientation, timing, relational presence, and therapist development. From their accounts, twelve competencies were identified that offer therapists new options to draw on freely, depending on what the moment calls for. These include pausing, trusting the unclear edge, supporting fresh description, and fostering client agency. Therapists described experimenting with these skills in ways that sometimes reduced their own sense of pressure and, in their accounts, were linked with clients engaging differently. In this article we propose an integration model for EFT and Inner Relationship Focusing (IRF).

Initially presented as evidence that humans spontaneously represent others’ actions in a functionally equivalent way to their own, the JSE now serves as an interdisciplinary measure of self-other integration across research on social cognition, human-robot interaction, and animal cognition. However, whether the JSE is better explained by non-social mechanisms remains an open question. The present meta-analytic review sought to provide an overview of the JSE literature and to evaluate its suitability as a measure of self-other integration. Our meta-analysis of 274 JSEs from 80 studies (7042 participants across 186 samples) revealed a significant overall effect of gD = .60. Analysis of 52 canonical JSEs (reflecting the seminal study) revealed a larger JSE of gD =.72. Finally, moderation by study characteristics suggested that JSEs at least partly reflect social representations of one’s co-actor. Importantly, our findings lend support to the continued use of the JSE as a measure of self-other integration.",

Prior laboratory work suggests that this design feature may influence game experience, facilitate immersion, increase arousal, and promote riskier decision making, but whether this generalizes to realistic gambling products remains unclear. In this pre-registered study, we used a realistic slot machine simulator, deployed online, to evaluate effects of win-accompanying sensory feedback (SF) on gambling experience and behavior. Method: Participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk and stratified as online active gamblers (AG) or non-gamblers (NG). Participants were randomly assigned to complete 200 spins on an online slot machine that featured either enhanced or diminished SF. Results: Enhanced SF reduced time to initiate spins (i.e. faster speed of play) but did not affect bet size or self-reported experience. Relative to NG, AG reported greater game immersion and positive affect during the game, and these variables were also predicted across all participants by greater problem gambling severity, and monetary gains in the gambling session. In addition, self-reported immersion and affect were predicted by ADHD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Faster gambling under SF may incur greater losses over time, raising concerns about harm potential. By contrast, game experience was influenced by monetary outcomes and personal characteristics rather than SF. Overall, these findings support the notion that both product and personal characteristics confer risk of harm.",

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and informs computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about motor output combination: whether learning processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope still depends on the covariance structure of the learning processes, which is not constrained by additivity. For this reason, there is no regression slope benchmark for diagnosing additivity. Moreover, the regression slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by shared-error models where implicit and explicit systems are driven by the same error signals, which adhere to the additivity assumption. Regression slopes only tell us whether learning processes covary, not whether they violate additivity.",

          "abstract": "Recent interdisciplinary advances have transformed the study of the evolution of music. Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

          "abstract": "The implementation of Partially Automated Driving (PAD) systems is increasingly common in consumer vehicles. While these systems support longitudinal and lateral vehicle control, they still require drivers to monitor the environment and intervene when necessary. Therefore, drivers must continue to allocate their visual attention effectively and remain aware of potential hazards. However, increased engagement in non-driving-related activities (NDRAs) has been observed during PAD. While the detrimental effects of visual-manual NDRAs on drivers’ visual attention during PAD is well-established, the impact of cognitively demanding NDRAs that take drivers’ mind off but allow their eyes to remain on the roadway is poorly understood. It is also unclear how the effects of cognitive load vary across automation levels. A driving simulator study was conducted to examine drivers’ visual attention under cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, during both manual driving and PAD. An urban section of road, with a range of vehicles and other road users as potential hazards, was used to study drivers’ allocation of attention. Results indicated that, during PAD, drivers adopted a broader visual search strategy, directing more attention to the peripheral driving environment. However, drivers’ visual search was more restricted under cognitive load, with attention concentrated on the road ahead, accompanied by fewer and shorter glances to the periphery, regardless of driving mode. These findings add knowledge on how cognitively demanding NDRAs affects drivers’ visual attention, under different driving automation levels, and highlight the need for targeted countermeasures to ensure drivers safely monitor PAD and the driving environment.",

In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect.

          "authors": "Satoshi Usami",
          "abstract": "Psychological researchers have shown an interest in disaggregating within-person variability from between-person differences. Especially for inferring reciprocal relations among variables at the within-person level, applications of the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) with stable trait factors has increased rapidly. This paper provides a tutorial, simulation, and illustrative example of another recent approach proposed by Usami (2023).  This approach consists of a two-step procedure: within-person variability scores (WPVS) for each person, which are disaggregated from the stable traits of that person, are predicted using structural equation modeling, and causal parameters are then estimated via a potential outcome approach, such as by using structural nested mean models (SNMMs). This method assumes a data-generating process similar to that in RI-CLPM, and has several advantages: (i) the flexible inclusion of curvilinear and interaction effects for WPVS as latent variables in treatment and outcome models, (ii) more accurate estimates of causal parameters for reciprocal relations can be obtained under certain conditions owing to them being doubly robust, even if unobserved time-varying confounders and model misspecifications exist, (iii) no models for (the distributions of) observed time-varying confounders are needed for estimation, and (iv) the risk of obtaining improper solutions is reduced. After explaining the data-generating process and the analysis procedure using the R package DTRreg for SNMMs, estimation performances are compared with RI-CLPM through large-scale simulations. We show that the proposed approach works well in many conditions if longitudinal data with T≧4 are available, and that the accuracy increases as T becomes larger. An analytic example using data regarding sleep habits and mental health statuses from the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) study is also provided.",

          "authors": "Joshua James Liddy",
          "abstract": "Sensorimotor adaptation depends on implicit recalibration and explicit strategy. These processes are commonly assumed to sum (A = I + E), and this additivity assumption justifies subtractive measurement and shapes computational models of motor learning. Recent work has challenged additivity by examining regression slopes between implicit and explicit measures. When slopes deviate from β = –1, the interpretation has been that the processes are \"sub-additive\" and fail to sum as expected. Here, we show this reasoning is mistaken. Regression slopes reflect covariance structure: how learning processes relate across individuals. Additivity is a claim about output combination: whether processes sum within individuals. These are different questions, and regression slopes do not address the latter. We derive the expected slope under subtractive logic and show it equals β = –1 only when total adaptation is uncorrelated with the measured learning component. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this benchmark is routinely rejected under realistic covariance between the learning processes, even when additivity is enforced. Under independent measurement, the slope depends on the correlation and variance ratio between processes. Neither condition is constrained by additivity, and therefore there is no benchmark. The empirical slopes reported in the literature fall within the range predicted by competitive models where implicit and explicit systems share error signals, which are built on the additivity assumption. Thus, regression slopes only tell us that learning processes covary, not that they violate additivity.",

          "authors": "Habib Forooshani",
          "abstract": "Trauma-Focused Social Adjustment Therapy (TF-SAT) is a short-term, integrative, and tailored intervention specifically designed to address trauma-related difficulties in psychosocial adjustment among youth with interpersonal trauma histories (e.g., chronic childhood abuse, extreme violence, neglect, or insecure attachment). The initial protocol and therapeutic phases were developed through a six-year process of intervention mapping, followed by three additional years of empirical investigation with diverse international samples of youth and young adults. These efforts aimed to enhance the TF-SAT’s theoretical framework and intervention protocol in terms of applicability, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability.\nThis report, presented in the style of a pre-print book chapter, summarizes the theoretical framework of TF-SAT, its nine-year development journey, and the empirical studies led by the author that informed both the initial design and subsequent refinements of the TF-SAT framework and intervention protocol. In addition, the report offers practical recommendations for future empirical studies, especially clinical trials to replicate and advance the TF-SAT framework, as well as guidance on implementing this approach in real-world clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "Negative affect has been shown, in both humans and non-human animals, to bias decision-making under ambiguity away from so-called ‘optimistic’ responses that can yield higher rewards but also risk greater losses. The judgement bias task, a cognitive task that uses ambiguous stimuli to measure such decisions as indicators of affective state, has successfully been translated from humans to animals and back again. However, questions remain regarding how exactly affect influences ‘optimistic’ or ‘pessimistic’ decisions, and the extent to which dispositional pessimism also influences these decisions. To further understand links between affect and decision-making, we carried out a judgement bias task in humans and measured self-reported affect and dispositional pessimism. In a pre-registered online experiment, participants completed questionnaires assessing anxiety, depression, and pessimism, and undertook a judgement bias task. Our results mirrored previous findings showing that self-reported negative affect is associated with negatively-biased decision-making under ambiguity; individuals who reported higher anxiety and depression made a significantly lower proportion of ‘optimistic’ responses to ambiguous stimuli in the judgement bias task. However, we found no evidence that self-reported dispositional pessimism is associated with ‘pessimistic’ responses in the task. Drift-diffusion modelling revealed that the more negative (less ‘optimistic’) judgement bias associated with self-reported anxiety and depression, can be explained by a bias generated during the decision-making process, represented by a lower drift rate. But due to high comorbidity, we were unable to determine whether negative judgement bias is driven primarily by anxiety or depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) represents a vulnerable period for transitional age youth (TAY), with high risk of disengagement and unmet mental health needs. Evidence on effective transition models remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify how many TAY achieved the CAMHS-AMHS transition, assess implementation of transition protocols, identify systemic barriers, and synthesize service improvements. Methods: Studies published between January 2013 and November 2025 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Cochrane. Results: Forty-four studies using quantitative or mixed methods were included in the systematic review, and twenty-three provided data for meta-analysis, which encompassed a total of 12,466 youth (mean = 542 ± 1.65). The random-effects model estimated that 33% of youth transitioned to AMHS (95% CI: 24-44). Duration of past care varied by condition, from 1 year for emotional conditions to over 5 years for neurodevelopmental conditions. Structured interventions, including transition coordinators, joint CAMHS-AMHS planning, and youth-specific clinics, improved engagement, reduced waiting times, and increased successful handovers. However, guideline implementation was inconsistent, and barriers such as non-referral, strict diagnostic criteria, youth refusal, and fragmented services led to high disengagement rates, with up to 55% losing contact post-transition. TAY not referred often remained in CAMHS, were redirected to primary care, or disengaged entirely. Conclusions: Although some progress has been made, organizational and clinical obstacles still shape transition pathways more than TAY care needs or developmental readiness. Structured yet flexible frameworks are needed to improve continuity.",

          "abstract": "Regulatory flexibility, defined as the ability to use strategies in accordance with contextual demands, is thought to be central to psychological health. In the current research, we test the boundaries of this claim by examining: (1) how broadly does regulatory flexibility relate to different facets of psychological health?, and (2) is more flexibility always better? Across six samples, participants (N = 2,939) reported their ability to use strategies flexibly when managing impulses (e.g., temptations) and completed indicators of ill-being and well-being. Findings indicated that people who are more flexible report not only report less anxiety and depression but also more positive functioning, including more life satisfaction, meaning, thriving, and positive mental health. There was some goal-to-goal variation, but the same pattern held when controlling for goal-specific covariates and replicated in both meta-analytic and mega-analytic approaches. Interestingly, there was a significant quadratic association between flexibility and well-being but not ill-being. This suggested diminishing returns, such that being more flexible was beneficial for well-being, but only to a certain point. Overall, these findings suggest that having the ability to use strategies flexibly has no apparent downside.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill basic affiliation needs. To describe how these needs are regulated, theories connect daily-life processes of social contact, social desire, and affect. Still, such processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared to in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Even as concepts like emotion and emotion regulation are emphasized as central to psychological health and functioning, the affective field remains rife with debates on how to conceptualize emotion and related constructs like affect or mood. In this paper, I identify two key features that pervade and characterize affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the theoretical assumption of innate valence, i.e., an innate and universal neurophysiological capacity to distinguish good from bad that underlies hedonic tone and (b) a conceptual approach that involves grouping sets of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often believed to be hereditary patterns with aims corresponding to the situation or its appraisal. I interrogate the assumption of valence as an innate process and expose the pitfalls of grouping seemingly correlated responses into higher level emotion constructs. I suggest that affective concepts can obscure critical and more meaningful treatment targets in clinical settings. This can lead to neglect of physical health and poor treatment efficacy, overinterpretation of physiological changes, misdirection in decision making, and issues of social control and justice, with ultimately adverse social and clinical implications.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

          "abstract": "While academic departments and institutions frequently champion ideals of meritocracy, egalitarianism, and inclusion, many are defined by status hierarchies that can undermine their stated commitment to these ideals. This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

Later, he began to develop a theory of human development, a Eupsychian theory of human flourishing with his theory of needs at the center. This theory was shortly represented by the iconic Pyramid of Needs. Building upon the work of Abraham Maslow, this article rejects the pyramid of needs as an ideologically rooted, sanitized, and stripped-down version of Maslow’s nascent Eupsychian Theory. Instead, the article proposes an Indigenous-rooted Circle of Seven Essential needs as the core of a sophisticated and integrative theory of human development, human potential, and human flourishing, a theory that Maslow was in the process of developing before his untimely death and that, given his known interest in Indigenous communities, more in line with the direction of Maslow’s early thinking.",

          "abstract": "Recent interdisciplinary advances have transformed the study of the evolution of music. Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality—the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies reveal that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings further show that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

          "abstract": "Making an informed decision often depends on observing sequential outcomes, which may be temporally spaced across a sequence of immediate decisions or decisions made over weeks or months. Making decisions based on multiple observed sequential outcomes is the cornerstone of optimal stopping theory. Here, we review and describe four optimal stopping problems: The Secretary Problem, The Burglar Problem, The Devil’s Task, and the Game of Pigs. We outline their respective optimal policies and draw comparisons between these problems. Simulations of the standard Secretary Problem highlight the generalizability of its optimal policy across several different set sizes and show that with larger set sizes, the optimal policy stabilizes. Conversely, simulating the Burglar Problem illustrates how the outcome of pseudo-optimal policies can be directly tied to assumptions of the choice environment. A brief discussion of the usefulness of optimal stopping policies in the real world is also outlined. Using sequential decision tasks with optimal policies may provide a better understanding of how people make decisions, deviate from optimality, and help inform how to make people more accurately engage in optimality.",

In both tasks, participants heard continuous auditory streams containing trisyllabic or three-tone “words”. Learning was measured via reaction time acceleration to predictable items and by neural responses to structured versus random streams within language regions identified via an independent story-listening task. Children showed faster learning than adults only in the linguistic learning task. fMRI revealed earlier and stronger learning-induced plasticity in children’s language network than adults. Greater neural sensitivity was further associated with faster linguistic learning in children, but not in adults.

Participants received the inoculation or no intervention, then rated their belief in accurate and misleading headlines, half of which were accompanied by a supporting graph. Graphs consistently boosted belief in misleading headlines but had inconsistent effects on accurate headlines. An inoculation focusing on multiple misleading visualisation techniques was ineffective at reducing the impact of misleading graphs, instead inducing general scepticism. A single-technique inoculation focusing on dual axes reduced the influence of misleading graphs using that technique; this benefit did not, however, transfer to graphs using cherry-picking. Findings demonstrate that graphs can boost false beliefs and suggest that a specific technique-focused inoculation can reduce this impact.",

          "abstract": "The scope of knowledge is constantly evolving, due to such factors as environmental changes, cultural evolution, and scientific discovery. Consequently, we are frequently confronted with gaps in our knowledge, compelling us to seek information from available sources. Sometimes the information we seek is easy to find; other times it has yet to be established by others, requiring us to creatively come up with an original perspective. Yet, little is known about how our foraging strategies change depending on the ease with which the information we seek is readily available. We investigated how the need to generate new ideas influences the rate at which individuals explore or exploit existing information. Participants (N = 138)   answered questions either fully answerable (low-creativity condition) or not fully answerable (high-creativity condition) with information they foraged for on Wikipedia. We created knowledge networks from the foraged information, wherein Wikipedia pages were nodes. The edges linked pairs of Wikipedia pages when they were visited by the participant either sequentially or within the same condition, and were weighted based on the semantic similarity between the pair of pages. This approach allowed us to measure exploration (jumping between disparate pages) and exploitation (viewing closely related pages). In the high-creativity condition, participants were more likely to trade-off between exploration (lower average edge weights) and exploitation  (higher average clustering coefficients). This trade-off was associated with responses that were more novel, diverging further from the Wikipedia text, compared to less novel responses. These findings reveal how foraging strategies differ in creative versus non-creative contexts, and provide insight into the processes that underlie learning and scientific discovery.",

This study examined how risk (perceived in-group rejection, discrimination) and protective (in-group identification, social support) factors are associated with identity integration, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. A total of 306 LGB-religious individuals participated in this study. Perceived rejection from the religious in-group – reflecting the belief that religious communities view LGB and religious identities as incompatible – was significantly associated with lower identity integration. It was also linked to lower life satisfaction, particularly when discrimination was high. Social support related to being both LGB and religious was a consistent protective factor of identity integration and life satisfaction. In-group identification showed a more complex pattern: religious identification was positively related to identity integration but intensified the negative association between religious rejection and life satisfaction. In contrast, strong identification with the LGB in-group buffered against this negative effect. No significant correlates emerged for psychological distress, suggesting it may be shaped by broader factors unrelated to identity. Findings underscore the importance of creating and promoting inclusive in-group norms, particularly within religious communities, and fostering support for individuals navigating both LGB and religious identities.",

          "authors": "Amanda Seyler; Roxy O'Rourke; Nhu Huynh; Christie Burton; Paul Arnold; Theodore Cheung; Jennifer Crosbie",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Qualitative methods offer rich insights into human experience, yet the expanding volume of textual data presents analytic challenges. Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), may help researchers organize and interpret qualitative data while maintaining depth and accuracy. It is important to assess the validity and practical suitability of LLMs for qualitative analysis. This systematic review evaluated the extent to which LLMs, specifically generative transformer models such as ChatGPT, can identify themes and patterns consistent with human analysts. Methods: Studies published up to June 2025 were retrieved from PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies directly compared LLM- and human-generated outputs derived from thematic, narrative, or discourse analyses. Results: Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Most used versions of ChatGPT (70.8%), while others utilized Gemini (8.3%), Claude (4.2%), among others. Comparative analyses spanned diverse disciplines, though standardized protocols for conducting LLM-assisted qualitative analysis were lacking. Overall, LLM performance relative to human analysts was rated as moderate to high. Among those studies reporting quantitative indexes, the median % agreement score was 0.80 (range: 0.19-1.00), median Cohen’s Kappa was 0.74 (range 0.38-0.82), and median Cosine coefficient was 0.58 (range: 0.47-0.80), with stronger alignment for semantic or descriptive themes and lower accuracy for interpretive, context-dependent themes. Discussion: Findings provide support for LLMs as complementary tools in qualitative data analysis. Rather than replacing human interpretation, LLMs may serve as efficient aids for data organization and inter-rater comparison to support, but not substitute, qualitative engagement.",

          "abstract": "Recognizing the importance of affect to well-being, a growing number of low-barrier online interventions aim to reduce negative affect and promote positive mood. This broad class of interventions, named positive activity interventions (PAIs), was developed with the intent to enhance positive emotions, meaning, and connectedness, among other positive states. Recent reviews of the PAI literature highlight that many studies are underpowered and lack pre-registration, raising concerns about the validity of their findings. Furthermore, existing research has focused primarily on self-focused PAIs and assumes treatment effect homogeneity, despite research on happiness and well-being highlighting the importance of social connection and person-activity fit. In the current study, we extend past research by conducting a pre-registered field experiment with a large sample (n = 6,411) to compare the mood-boosting effects of five social PAIs and an active control. We found that four of the five PAIs improved mood valence compared to the active control, but there were no differences between the five activities in terms of change to mood intensity or bearability. We found support for the person-fit hypothesis but not for the person-activity fit moderation hypothesis, suggesting that PAI delivery for mood improvement can be standardized and more cost-effective than previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "Psychometrics involves the development and evaluation of mathematical models that connect the observable behaviors of persons to attributes. Because psychometric models produce numeric quantities that are typically assigned to persons for some purpose, psychometrics is sometimes characterized as a scientific discipline concerned with the practice of psychological measurement. The historical roots of psychometrics come from an interest in the quantitative study of individual differences. Technological advance through the first quarter of the 21st century has led to the development and evaluation of increasingly complex and specialized mathematical models. There can be significant syntactical barriers to understanding these models, making it easy to lose sight of philosophical questions and debates about the meaning and interpretation of the latent variables these models contain. In this entry these debates are brought to the surface and future possibilities for the field of psychometrics as it evolves are considered.",

Using longitudinal UK panel data from 2009-2023, we compare Leave and Remain supporters across three phases of the referendum process: anticipation, negotiation, and implementation. Directly before and following the outcome of the vote, Leave voters reported relatively higher wellbeing compared to Remain voters, with this wellbeing advantage being especially prominent after the formal implementation of the referendum in 2020. Differences are observed across indicators of both psychological and economic wellbeing. The effects are particularly pronounced among men, older adults, low-income individuals, the self-employed, and those with local minority political views. The findings suggest that in polarized democracies, psychological and economic wellbeing are shaped not only by objective financial realities but also by political identity and emotional attachment.",

          "abstract": "Academia suffers from various equity issues. One such issue is gender inequality in authorship, where many studies show that women are less represented compared to men. Due to authorship differences across disciplines, the goal of this study is to provide a current overview of the gender distribution of authorship within music psychology. A total of 3,373 papers published between 2000 and 2025 across five core music psychology journals were analysed with respect to author gender and authorship role (first, last, solo, and coauthor). In addition, we explored gender patterns related to citations, open-access publishing, and keywords. Overall, women authors were in the minority, accounting for 40.2% of all authors. However, the distribution of authorship roles diverged notably from this overall proportion: women were more likely to be first authors (odds ratio, OR = 1.41), equally likely to be solo authors (OR = 1.11) or coauthors (OR = 1.00), but less likely to be last authors (OR = 0.73). These patterns have become more pronounced over the past 15 years. No substantial gender differences in citation counts were observed. Analyses of geographical variation revealed clear country and continental differences, potentially reflecting both the status of women and the historical development of the discipline in particular regions. Finally, an examination of keywords suggested broad thematic preferences differing by gender. Although this work overall shows that the field of music psychology is more balanced than some other (STEM) fields, it provides a picture to inspire discussions and initiatives to further promote fairness and equity in academia.",

          "abstract": "When asked to count using basic-level noun descriptions (e.g. fork), children often count both whole objects and 'partial objects' (e.g., a broken fork-piece) as one unit, diverging systematically from adults. We test one class of explanations for this ‘over-counting’ behavior: that children apply nouns to objects more permissively than adults, and then count those objects they have labeled with the noun. In a two-task study, we examined how categorization of a partial object under a count noun related to numerical evaluations of sets that included that object, including cases where the numerical expressions involved fractions. Adults categorized and counted partial objects conservatively, often excluding them from the category and counting them, at most, for a fractional share (1/2). Children were more permissive in both tasks: they frequently accepted partial objects as noun category members and counted them on par with wholes (as |1|). Strikingly, children’s numerical judgments were often incongruous with their categorization: they sometimes rejected a partial object as a category member, but still counted it as |1|. We argue that while children are indeed more flexible in their noun application, their counting behavior calls for a different account. We propose that children lack the numerical capacities to represent and reason over fractional amounts, and default to a natural number scale even when adults use a finer-grained measurement scale. Children may recognize that the partial fork contributes some non-zero amount to a sum, but the only way they can add it to that sum is as |1|.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and  demonstrate how our approach differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study. We further illustrate its application to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam and a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding with broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

People endorsing more\nsexuality myths also accepted fewer sexuality facts, endorsed more myths in other domains,\nand had a stronger conspiracy mentality. While virtually uncorrelated with sexual satisfaction\nand risk behavior, sexuality myth endorsement was associated with less confident sexual\ncommunication and, in the public, lower life satisfaction and fewer safer sex practices.\nParticipants demonstrated limited self-insight into their susceptibility to sexuality myths.\nTaken together, our findings highlight the need for psychological research on sexuality myths,\nthe mechanisms behind them, and their consequences—research that should go beyond highly\neducated and young populations.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness, or sickness caused by virtual reality (VR), represents a significant threat to the usability of VR applications. Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study aimed to investigate whether pre-stroke cognitive reserve moderates the relationship between executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms in long-term stroke survivors. We hypothesized that higher post-stroke executive dysfunction scores would be associated with higher depressive symptom scores, and that greater pre-stroke cognitive reserve would attenuate this association. \n\nMethod: This study utilized data from the OX-CHRONIC study, involving 105 remotely-assessed long-term stroke survivors at approximately 4.57 years post-stroke. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and executive dysfunction was assessed using the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), OCS-Plus, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Hayling Sentence Completion Test, and Backwards Digit Span. Cognitive Reserve was measured using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq), including education, working activity, and leisure activity subscales. Multiple regression models evaluated the moderating effect of Cognitive Reserve on executive dysfunction and depressive symptoms.\n\nResults: Higher executive dysfunction scores were significantly associated with higher depressive symptom scores (ρ = -.32, p = .003). Cognitive Reserve moderated this relationship, with higher levels of pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve strengthening the relationship between executive functioning and depressive symptoms (interaction term: β = -0.04, p = .01). Exploratory analyses revealed that the education subscale of CRIq significantly moderated this relationship (β = -0.06, p = .002), while working and leisure activities did not.\n\nConclusions: Pre-stroke Cognitive Reserve, particularly educational attainment, may strengthen executive function’s protective effect on depressive symptoms in long-term stroke. This underscores the importance of fostering cognitively stimulating activities throughout the lifespan to enhance resilience against post-stroke cognitive and emotional challenges.",

To stave off disaster, individuals must address polarizing climate issues across deep social and ideological divides to take collective action. Drawing on social perspective taking theory, we investigate the effects of a “common ground” strategy–i.e., first acknowledging compelling aspects of respondents’ opinions on a proposed climate solution before disagreeing. Across four online experiments (N=1,839), participants exposed to this strategy reported enhanced relationship-relevant outcomes—including greater perceived similarity, fairness, and mutual perspective taking—compared to those who faced immediate disagreement. These findings demonstrate the power of perspective-taking communication and suggest a practical, scalable strategy for fostering constructive engagement across ideological divides. Effortfully taking another’s perspective appears promising as a strategy to establish a sense of common ground with those holding opposing points of view. The resulting relational benefits enhance the prospects for continued collaboration across differences—precisely what will be required to address the climate crisis.",

          "abstract": "Background \nAdolescents are a notoriously hard-to-engage audience in digital health communication. Many strategies have aimed to increase communication effectiveness by personalising what is said, but have largely neglected how it is said. Addressing this gap, we introduce an innovative approach to personalised health communication: automated AI-based linguistic tailoring. Using large language model style transfer, we mimic adolescents’ individual communication style to test if linguistically tailored health messages promote attitude change and healthier dietary behaviour. \n\nMethods \nWe conducted a preregistered 2-week randomised controlled trial with 587 adolescents (aged 13–16) in the UK and Ireland. Participants were allocated to one of four arms: no health messages (passive control), non-tailored health messages (active control), tailored health messages, or both message types presented in counterbalanced order in weeks 1 and 2. This enabled between-subject and within-subject comparisons. The primary outcome was plant-based lunch choice  (yes/no); secondary outcomes assessed evaluations of the messages and their source. \n\nFindings \nAdolescents receiving health messages (tailored or not) increasingly chose plant-based lunches more often over time than those receiving no messages (OR = 1.06, 95% CrI [1.02, 1.09]; pd = 1.000; BF₁₀ = 35.39). This effect was similar for tailored and non-tailored conditions (OR = 1.01, 95% CrI [0.98, 1.05]; pd = .731; BF₁₀ = 0.12). However, exploratory analyses indicated higher ratings of relevance (BF₁₀ = 3.50), personalisation (BF₁₀ = 4.93), and source liking (BF₁₀ = 3.38) for linguistic tailoring in the second week of the intervention. \n\nInterpretation \nFact-based dietary health messages effectively promoted plant-based lunch choices, although this behavioural effect seemed driven more by content than by style. However, with repeated exposure, linguistic tailoring enhanced several message and source evaluations, indicating promise for future AI-driven personalised health campaigns and youth communication.",

          "abstract": "To advance work on subjective well-being (SWB), this study developed a psychometrically optimized measure of life satisfaction/quality (the Satisfaction and Quality of Life Scale; SQLS) to overcome the limitations of existing measures (the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL), and the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)). This study conceptualized life satisfaction/quality as subjective global evaluations of one’s life, including perceived quality, satisfaction, and happiness. This conceptualization allowed life satisfaction/quality to vary over time for a broader range of individuals (including differently-abled individuals). An online sample of 2271 individuals completed a survey and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses were used to create the 10-item and 5-item SQLS scales. The IRT findings demonstrated that the SQLS offered markedly higher information for discriminating individual differences than existing scales, translating into higher precision and power (larger effect sizes) for detecting between-group differences. EFA and CFA analyses in separate sample halves supported the single factor structure of the SQLS. IRT parameter invariance analyses and CFA-based measurement invariance analyses suggested stringent invariance of the SQLS across gender, age, sexual orientation, race, education level, and income groups, outperforming the SWLS. Furthermore, the SQLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency of the across 37 more focused demographic groups. The SQLS scales demonstrated robust convergent validity and discriminant validity with 22 conceptual boundary constructs. Bifactor models highlighted the advantages of the SQLS at an item level, with all of its items showing strong trait loadings on a global factor and markedly lower divergent loadings on a scale-specific factor. Finally, the SQLS demonstrated significantly larger Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) effect sizes for detecting improvement in life satisfaction than existing scales, suggesting that it is markedly more responsive to detecting improvement over time. Implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Morphological knowledge serves as a powerful heuristic for vocabulary growth and contributes significantly to the speed and efficiency of reading. While research has long sought to explain how the knowledge of derivational morphology is acquired, previous approaches have struggled to capture the nuanced and complex ways in which derivational morphemes are used in written language, particularly that these morphemes contribute to meaning in a graded manner and that noise introduced by misleading forms (e.g., deliver) can impede learning. Our approach builds on earlier insights but moves beyond them by combining a large-scale analysis of vocabulary used in 1,200 popular books with computational modelling to explore how learning of derivational affixes may occur from text containing naturally occurring noise. We use a compositional distributional semantic model to investigate what can be learned about the meanings of individual English prefixes and suffixes through reading and evaluate the model’s performance against data from 120 adults in a lexical processing task. Our findings demonstrate that, despite the presence of noise, natural text contains sufficient structure to support the extraction of core affix semantics, and that readers are attuned to the complex patterns that shape affix use in the wild. This work contributes a new dimension to a more principled and psychologically grounded account of morpheme learning, and we discuss both this contribution and the broader insights it offers for language research.",

          "authors": "Reiner Vinicius Perozzo; Felipe Flores Kupske",
          "abstract": "This article aims to present a historiographic reflection on the trajectory of speech sounds in linguistic studies, from the earliest systematic records to more\ncontemporary approaches. The starting point is the work of Panini, whose Sanskrit grammar represents one of the earliest known attempts at a systematic description of linguistic sounds. The analysis continues with the 19th-century Neogrammarians, who established a scientific model of sound change and laying the groundwork for what is now recognized as historical phonology. At the turn of the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure’s contribution redefined the role of sound in linguistic theory by integrating it into the linguistic sign within a relational and structural system. The article then examines the contributions of Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle, who introduced the notion of acoustically based distinctive features, developing a phonological model strongly supported by the spectrographic analysis of speech. This model was reinterpreted by Chomsky and Halle from an articulatory perspective, within the framework of generative phonology. This way, sound came to be conceived as a set of abstract articulatory features capable of explaining both phonological regularities and constraints in natural languages. This paper also considers contributions from speech perception schools, such as the psychoacoustic theory, the motor theory, and the direct realist theory. These perspectives investigate speech sounds based on mental, motor, and gestural dimensions, emphasizing the relationship between perceived sounds, the articulatory movements that generate them, and the sensory mechanisms involved in their decoding. The final part of the text highlights gestural proposals that conceptualize the speech sound as an acoustic-articulatory gesture and seek to overcome traditional divisions between phonetics and phonology. The discussion emphasizes the role of gestural borders in\nthe symbolic projection of sounds, the importance of the auditory-acoustic link, and the processes of gestural realignment and reconfiguration through which phonological regularities become grammaticalized. As a major contribution, the article also introduces a perspective that incorporates pragmatic and contextual elements into the perception of sounds, proposing a view of speech sounds as embodied indices, socially situated and symbolically charged. Ultimately, sound is portrayed as a omplex phenomenon that articulates physical, social, perceptual, and indexical dimensions of verbal language.",

          "abstract": "Organizational support theory suggests that human resource practices are important antecedents of perceived organizational support which, in turn, influences employees’ orientation toward their organization and their work behavior, including further engagement with human resource practices. Based on organizational support theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesized positive and reciprocal within-person relations between work flexibilization and perceived organizational support. We tested these hypotheses using 30 waves of longitudinal data collected between July 2020 and December 2022 from n = 1,000 full-time employees in Germany. Using an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR), results suggest that higher levels of work flexibilization are associated with subsequently higher levels of perceived organizational support, and vice versa. These results suggest a dynamic and reciprocal within- person process wherein positive deviations from one’s average trajectory of work flexibilization (perceived organizational support) are subsequently related to higher levels of perceived organizational support (work flexibilization). These findings imply a virtuous cycle where work flexibilization leads to more favorable perceptions of organizational support which, in turn, leads to an increase in employees’ use of work flexibilization. However, such positive effects may be short-lived (i.e., lasting between approximately 15- and 20-months), likely diminishing in strength over time.",

          "abstract": "The literature on how smartphone and social media use affects adolescent mental health is highly fragmented. To synthesize the evidence, we convened over 120 researchers with diverse perspectives to evaluate 26 commonly cited claims using a Delphi process. A large majority agree that: Adolescent mental health has declined in several Western countries; heavy smartphone and social media use can cause sleep problems; such use correlates with attention problems and behavioural addiction; among girls, social media use may be associated with body dissatisfaction, perfectionism, exposure to mental disorders, harassment and predation. Most other claims were judged to have insufficient evidence due to limited, inconsistent, or non-causal data. Researchers also raised broader concerns, including challenges in measuring mental health and establishing causality, geographic bias in existing evidence, and the need for policies that account for diverse risks and avoid unintended harms. This collective review offers a foundation for future research and policy.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is typically defined as the production of ideas or artifacts that are both novel and appropriate, yet there is still no simple formalism that specifies how generative, evaluative, integrative, and metacognitive processes combine over time to yield creative outcomes. This article proposes a compact “geometry” of creative cognition expressed by the equation E = (G R I M)^T, where E denotes Eureka-level creative effectiveness, G wide stochastic generation, R focused reflection and evaluation, I multimodal integration and iteration between intuitive and analytic codes, M metacontrol via implicit and explicit metacognition, and T temporal consistency across episodes. To make E empirically tractable, creative effectiveness is operationalized through novelty, usefulness, and diversity (NUD), which mirror evolutionary tactics of variation, selection, and maintenance of variation. The article maps each equation factor onto behavioral and neural indices, highlights the central role of metacontrol in balancing persistence and flexibility, and situates the framework within developmental, individual-difference, and evolutionary perspectives. It then derives implications for the assessment and training of creativity, emphasizing creative metacognition as a key leverage point, and extends the geometry to artificial architectures and human–AI co creation. The resulting formulation provides testable predictions about how measures of generation, evaluation, integration, metacognition, and practice should interact to shape NUD profiles over time, and offers a principled bridge between human and artificial creativity.",

          "abstract": "Science has long struggled with unsuccessful replications and reproductions, a challenge that raises questions about the robustness and credibility of research findings. One potential contributing factor is selective reporting or nonpublication of certain results based on their direction or strength, leading to publication bias. To better understand its extent and risk factors, we examined 178 successful study submissions to two German probabilistic panels (GESIS Panel, SOEP-IS), fielded between 2013 and 2021, and compared the hypotheses and exploratory analyses stated in the original study submissions with their presentation in subsequent publications. Using a coding scheme, we extracted information on the submissions, publications, and authors, and investigated which characteristics are associated with publication bias. Experimental study design, third-party funding, preregistration of hypotheses, and economic studies were the strongest and most stable predictors of lower risk of publication bias across multiple outcomes: publication likelihood, test and hit rate of hypotheses. The study highlights the complexity and multi-faceted nature of publication bias in the social, economic, and behavioral sciences, and shows that researchers (e.g., preregistration), funding agencies (e.g., incentives), and journals (e.g., peer review) play distinct roles in shaping publication bias. It thereby points to areas for reform in the research and publication process.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing debate in cognitive science is whether cognitive control recruits domain-general or domain-specific processes. A useful paradigm to study this is the congruency sequence effect, which reflects the reduced impact of congruency after an incongruent trial. Many studies examined the congruency sequence effect across task in order to investigate domain generality. However, differences in how task dissimilarity was manipulated led to different conclusions about the nature of adaptive control. Therefore, we conducted a systematic, preregistered meta-analysis of 174 experiments (229 effect sizes). On average, the cross-task congruency sequence effect (Hedges’ gz = 0.252) decreased as task dissimilarity increased, with some factors influencing adaptive control more than others. Especially when tasks used a different response modality or conflict arose from different irrelevant stimulus dimensions, we observed a decreased cross-task congruency sequence effect, suggesting adaptive control is both action-oriented and involves distractor suppression. Notably, however, when tasks shared the same conflict type, larger congruency sequence effects were observed when stimulus and response sets were distinct rather than partially overlapping. Together, these findings refine current theories by pointing to a central role for the different motor modalities, distractor suppression, and shared versus separate task representations, moving beyond a simple domain-general versus domain-specific distinction.\n\nKeywords: meta analysis, conflict adaptation, congruency sequence effect, domain generality, cognitive control",

          "abstract": "Observing others’ actions and imagining oneself performing the same actions (motor imagery) have been linked in the literature in several ways. They have been shown to have overlapping neural representations, both seem to relate to one's ability to move, and both have been shown to positively affect movement rehabilitation. Whether these overlaps reflect a direct functional relationship between motor imagery and the ability to derive relevant information from observed kinematics (action understanding) has not yet been investigated. A previous study found that individuals with low self-reported motor imagery vividness exhibit weaker motor system engagement during action observation than those with typical imagery vividness. The present study provides the first behavioural test of the relationships between motor and general visual imagery vividness and a quantifiable behavioural measure of action understanding - specifically, the ability to judge the weight of objects based on observing someone else lift them. To test the research question across the full imagery spectrum, our recruitment strategy included a high proportion of individuals with very low imagery vividness (often referred to as ‘aphantasia’).  An online sample (N = 392) completed a weight judgement task alongside a matched speed judgement control task. Neither motor imagery vividness (Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2) nor general visual imagery vividness (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) predicted action understanding, with a Bayesian analysis suggesting moderate to strong evidence against any relationship. Overall, our findings suggest that self-reported motor and general visual imagery vividness are functionally independent from action understanding of manual interactions.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on cultural models of agency suggests that intrinsic motivation, such as passion, is a stronger predictor of performance in individualistic contexts (e.g., the United States) than in collectivistic contexts (e.g., China). Much less is known, however, about cultural differences in the perceived value of intrinsic motivation, which may more directly shape daily social processes surrounding motivation. The present research examined cross-cultural differences in the perceived importance of intrinsic motivation for both predicting others’ behavior and influencing others’ behavior. Counterintuitive patterns emerged. Faculty members in Chinese and Japanese higher education institutions ranked passion as a more important evaluative criterion in student selection than did their counterparts in American institutions; across 24 societies, country-level individualism negatively predicted teachers’ self-reported practices of upregulating their students’ intrinsic motivation, as indexed by self-efficacy, value, and interest. These findings suggest that, despite its lower observed value in predicting performance in collectivistic than in individualistic contexts, intrinsic motivation is nevertheless perceived to be more important for both predicting and influencing others’ behavior in collectivistic contexts. Rather than negating previous evidence on cultural differences in the predictive value of intrinsic motivation, our results offer a complementary picture of cultural differences in its perceived value and call for more nuanced interpretations of the roles that passion, interest, and other forms of intrinsic motivation play in collectivistic societies.",

          "abstract": "Although skilled readers make use of information about words adjacent to the fixated word, developing readers are limited in their uptake of parafoveal information, leading to the expectation that they may be entirely insensitive to the presence of adjacent stimuli. However, lack of benefit from nearby items does not imply that those items cannot negatively impact the recognition process. Here we report two experiments with 62 Norwegian children attending Grade 2 and 141 in Grade 5 using a modified version of the visual world paradigm with masked flanked visual word targets. Compared to a baseline condition with no flankers, we found that the presence of flanking words or unfamiliar-font strings strongly interfered with lexical activation of the foveated target word; in contrast, strings of repeated symbols had no effect. The results were very similar for the two grades, except that the more advanced readers also exhibited an interaction of flanking condition with target word frequency, specifically, smaller frequency effects when flanked by words. The findings indicate that adjacent stimuli are to some extent simultaneously processed along with the foveated word and strongly interfere with it, from the earliest stages and throughout reading development. We propose that management of interference from adjacent words is a major factor modulating the development and expression of reading skill.",

          "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is maintained by dysfunctional trauma-related appraisals. Cognitive Bias Modification for Appraisals (CBM-APP) aims to train patients to make more functional trauma-related appraisals and has been shown to reduce PTSD symptoms. However, little is known about how this training affects the functional interrelations among symptoms and cognitive appraisals. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involving 77 adult patients diagnosed with PTSD (CBM-APP: n = 37; control training: n = 40), we applied cross-sectional network analysis to examine changes in the structure and centrality of associations among PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, hyperarousal) and trauma-related cognitive measures. To capture multiple levels of cognitive processing, we included responses during a scenario task (reflective, idiosyncratic, spontaneous appraisals) and the Implicit Association Test (automatic self-associations). Four Gaussian Graphical Models were estimated (pre-/post-training × CBM-APP vs. control group). While overall network connectivity did not differ significantly across networks, descriptive patterns indicated that Alterations in Cognition and Mood emerged as the most central node in both groups at post-training assessment. Further, in the CBM-APP group, the centrality of implicit trauma-related associations decreased pre- to post-training, suggesting potential decoupling of automatic negative self-associations from symptom activation. Given the small sample and moderate network stability, findings are preliminary but suggest that CBM-APP may influence the relational structure of PTSD symptoms and cognitions, offering insight into putative mechanisms of cognitive therapeutic change.",

          "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) is a highly influential modeling framework for studying decisions under uncertainty, allowing researchers to disentangle two central components of judgment: Discriminability, the ability to accurately distinguish signal from noise, and response bias, the tendency to favor one type of judgment over the other. The present work compares two approaches for analyzing hierarchically-structured SDT data: The commonly-used two-step approach, which is based on independent individual-level SDT estimates, and a maximum likelihood mixed-effects SDT approach, which uses generalized linear mixed models to estimate individual-level parameters based on a joint population distribution. Across three simulation studies, we demonstrate that the two-step approach produces substantial distortions in both single- and multilevel estimates of discriminability, response criterion and differences therein. These distortions depend in complex ways on the true population means, true population differences, the numbers of trials and participants, and dependencies among individual parameters. Crucially, they also lead to inflated Type I error rates for tests of condition differences in both SDT parameters. In contrast, mixed-effects SDT models yielded effectively unbiased parameter recovery, maintained nominal Type I error rates across a broad range of simulated conditions, and provided higher statistical power for detecting differences in discriminability and response criterion. To facilitate the adoption of this approach,we provide an easy-to-use R package called mesdt and an accompanying tutorial.",

To advance theorizing on user-algorithm interactions, we leverage Principal–Agent Theory—an economic perspective on negotiation scenarios—for interactive communication between users (principals) and algorithmic recommender systems (agents). We explicate the potential of Principal-Agent Theory for the case of short-video apps (e.g., TikTok). Using dyadic agent-based modeling, we examine two widely discussed phenomena: perceptions of responsive algorithms that ‘know’ users, and users’ attempts to curate content by ‘training’ recommenders. By combining a rational choice perspective with computational modeling, we offer a blueprint for critically examining the dynamics of agency in algorithmic media, with implications for further domains such as well-being, privacy, and media governance.",

The single-factor solution fit the data best and showed good reliability and validity. Higher SPOVI 2.0 levels were associated with higher symptoms of panic disorder and higher disgust sensitivity.

We develop the counterfactual replacement model, which runs simulations of alternative scenarios to determine the probability that the outcome would have differed if the person of interest had been replaced. The model predicts that a person is held more responsible, the more difficult it would have been to replace them. To test the model's predictions, we design a paradigm that quantitatively varies replaceability by manipulating the number of replacements and the probability with which each replacement would have been available. Across three experiments featuring increasingly complex scenarios, we show that the model explains participants' responsibility judgments well in both social and physical settings, and better than alternative models that rely only on features of what actually happened.",

          "abstract": "Museums are increasingly shifting from passive spaces of display to active sites of learning where knowledge is co-created through material and social engagement. This chapter examines how models and modelling can serve as powerful mediators of understanding in museum education, bridging conceptual knowledge and embodied experience. We first synthesise key theoretical traditions, i.e. experience-based learning, constructionism, tinkering, makerspaces, object-based, model-based learning, etc., to clarify how these approaches conceptualise modelling as a form of “learning by making.” Despite widespread assumptions about its benefits, empirical research on modelling in museums remains largely qualitative, case-based, and fragmented, leaving causal mechanisms underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a Factorial Mixed methods (FM) paradigm, an interdisciplinary approach that combines experimental design with qualitative inquiry “in the wild” of real museum contexts. This paradigm allows for controlled, systematic testing of educational variables while preserving ecological validity. We illustrate the FM approach through a field experiment at Steno Museum involving 152 eighth-grade students participating in astronomy workshops. Using a 2×2 factorial design, we varied two key factors, physical modelling and social interaction, to examine their individual and combined effects on learning, engagement, and enjoyment. The results showed that both factors independently enhanced learning and that their combination produced an additive effect, yielding greater outcomes than either factor alone. Qualitative observations further revealed how collaborative model-building fostered deeper conceptual reflection, creativity, and embodied understanding. Together, these findings provide rare causal evidence that modelling and social collaboration jointly enhance learning in museum settings. The chapter concludes by outlining how the FM paradigm can advance a more generalisable, experimentally grounded science of modelling across museums and disciplines.",

          "abstract": "Sense of agency (SoA) refers to the feeling that one’s actions cause environmental changes. A previous study showed that SoA is enhanced when keypress-triggered motion stimuli move faster, suggesting that SoA depends on the extent of action outcomes. We examined whether the numerical magnitude of action outcomes similarly affects SoA. Participants pressed a key, which triggered the presentation of dots (Experiments 1–2) or digit values (Experiment 3), and then rated their SoA on a 10-point scale. Results showed that SoA ratings increased with greater numerical magnitude. However, Experiment 4, using an intentional binding paradigm, found that the interval between the keypress and dot onset was perceived as longer when more dots were presented. This contradicts Experiments 1–3 and suggests the observed SoA enhancement might stem from response bias (e.g., higher numerical magnitude of the outcomes leading to higher values in the rating/estimating phase). To test this, Experiment 5 replicated Experiment 2 with a reversed rating scale (1 = strongest, 10 = weakest) and again found higher scores with greater magnitude, supporting the response bias account. In contrast, the effect of motion speed was unaffected by rating direction, suggesting a genuine influence on SoA. These findings highlight the importance of carefully distinguishing true effects from mere response biases when evaluating how outcome magnitude influences SoA.",

Here, we propose a new hypothesis, where violations are recognised as dignity-related when they target attributes that are stigmatised and that victims plausibly and immutably hold. Participants (N = 277) performed a novel task; they rated a set of textual vignettes describing a ‘perpetrator’ making offensive remarks to a ‘victim’ on how well each offensive remark corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. Before rating, participants were informed (across 3 within-subject conditions) whether the attribute targeted by the offence was immutable, improvable, or absent. After completing the main ratings, participants also reported how stigmatised the offence-targeted attributes are in their society. Our hypotheses, methods, and analyses were preregistered. Comparing across within-subject conditions, we found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that the plausibility and immutability increase how much the violations relate to dignity. Using Bayesian general linear mixed models, we also found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that perceptions of the offence-targeted attributes as stigmatised predict increases in dignity-relatedness. These findings are first to provide empirical anchors for a distinct ethics of dignity. Our implications include evidence-based actionable guidelines for treating people with dignity that can be used to promote ethical practice in organisations and service industries.",

          "authors": "Sepehrdad Rahimian",
          "abstract": "Despite notable empirical advances, the science of consciousness lacks firm conceptual footing. Competing theories not only disagree on mechanisms but also define consciousness in mutually incompatible ways, and criteria for evaluating theoretical success remain vague. I argue that this situation arises from a lack of pragmatic pressure within the field. Theories are rewarded for offering ever more elaborate explanations of “consciousness-as-such” rather than for solving concrete, real-world problems. This paper proposes a pragmatic shift. Rather than beginning with metaphysical commitments about what consciousness truly is, scientific inquiry should focus on developing models that demonstrably advance well-defined objectives. Such an approach does not deny the possibility that consciousness includes aspects beyond scientific access; it takes a neutral stance toward that possibility, holding that scientific practice must be guided by problems with pragmatic relevance and clear criteria of success. Drawing on analogies from stock-market trading and examples from the history of science, I suggest that scientific progress does not require a single, final ontology. Newtonian mechanics and relativity, for instance, present incompatible pictures of space and time, yet both function effectively within their domains. Likewise, consciousness research can proceed under an ontologically pluralist framework, enabling genuine scientific progress rather than endless theoretical disputes.",

          "abstract": "Health policy is motivated by a variety of factors including moral concerns, values and convictions. Policymakers are motivated to consider how constituents and those directly impacted by policies will react to the policies they enact. Thus, it is advantageous for policymakers to understand the psychological processes that shape constituents’ reactions toward health policies. We outline how and when policymakers and constituents are motivated to empathize, moralize, and compromise on divisive health policies, such as opioid-related policies, by considering the motivational frameworks of empathy and the plurality of moral values that inform attitudes. We offer insight for policymakers balancing tradeoffs between different moral values and concerns, suggesting that policymakers should consider cultivating an active dialogue around the relevant moral emotions felt by both supporters and opponents. For example, when considering syringe services programs, supporters and opponents may both be motivated by the moral concern of harm––as supporters may see services as preventing infections and keeping people healthy, while opponents may see services as promoting drug use and in turn, harmful health outcomes. We suggest that such a morally pluralistic effort will (1) highlight moral alignment amongst supporters to cultivate collective resolve and (2) acknowledge the competing moral concerns of opponents so that they feel understood and in turn, feel more willing to understand competing perspectives. While leaning into moral emotions may feel like a turn toward divisiveness, we suggest that acknowledging the plurality of moral values at stake sets the foundation for support and compromise.",

          "abstract": "Prominent theories of visual search state that goal-relevant information is maintained in working memory (WM) to guide attention to relevant, searched-for items. Prioritization from WM is sufficiently strong to direct attention towards items that are irrelevant to current search goals. These ‘incidental capture’ results have typically been observed when remembering color or shape stimuli, but, in principle, should similarly occur using other strong guiding features such as motion. However, recent work suggests that neural representations of remembered motion directions are transformed into spatial coordinates. If so, then remembered stimuli which can easily be spatially recoded (e.g., remembered motion direction) should not interfere with visual search when feature-matching distractors are present any more than interference caused by a salient distractor that does not match the contents of WM. We replicated the traditional incidental capture finding for color: distractors matching the remembered color captured attention more than feature singletons. In contrast, when participants were required to remember a motion direction, capture was equal across distractor conditions: salient distractors captured attention, but no additional capture was observed when the remembered motion direction matched the distracting motion direction. Intriguingly, responses were faster when the search target was at a location that neural studies predict would be prioritized if remembered motion was spatially recoded. Our results indicate that some features in WM are more likely to impact attentional processing than others and that this difference in attentional capture between feature dimensions may emerge due to the ability to reformat memory representations.",

          "abstract": "Background. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a marker of deficient socioemotional processing linked to severe conduct problems. Although resting-state studies implicate altered large-scale network organization in CU traits, few have comprehensively examined connectivity both within and between the default mode (DMN), salience (SN), and frontoparietal (FPN) networks and none have done so across development in large samples. Methods. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N = 11,868, 48% female), we examined associations between CU traits and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between the DMN, FPN, and SN with repeated timepoints (4) across youth spanning 9 to 18 years-old. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess main effects of CU traits along with moderators of age and sex, and sensitivity analyses included covariates for co-occurring psychopathology. Results. CU traits were associated with reduced within-DMN rsFC. No interactions between CU traits and sex were found, but an interaction between CU traits and age emerged, showing a negative association between CU traits and DMN-SN rsFC was evident in mid-to-late adolescence, with higher-CU youth showing an age-related decline in DMN-SN rsFC. Conclusions. These findings suggest youth with elevated CU traits exhibit atypical development of resting-state connectivity in networks crucial for empathy and salience processing. Specifically, youth with elevated CU traits showed persistent DMN hypoconnectivity and a later-emerging but accelerated age-related segregation of DMN-SN connectivity during adolescence. This pattern may reflect delayed yet ultimately exaggerated differentiation of socioaffective networks, highlighting adolescence as a developmental window for interventions targeting socioemotional functioning.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the proposed regulatory changes by the College of Psychologists and Behaviour Analysts of Ontario (CPBAO), which seek to modernize entry-to-practice standards for psychologists and psychological associates in the province. The analysis places Ontario’s changing regulatory environment within the broader Canadian context, comparing provincial standards, training pathways, and workforce availability. Using empirical data, stakeholder feedback, and consensus reports, this manuscript examines evidence to test three implied hypotheses of the proposed changes: 1) they will increase the number of psychologists in Ontario, 2) they will improve access to psychological services, and 3) they will not elevate the risk to public safety as practitioner competence will remain the same. Findings suggest that lowering entry standards and shifting from external accreditation to a college-approved process are unlikely to significantly increase access to psychologists. Evidence does not support the view that competence will remain unchanged among trainees from programs that substantially deviate from accredited models. Removing evaluative regulations may allow some less-prepared individuals into practice. An evidence-based, data-driven approach grounded in transparent consultation and continuous evaluation is recommended to ensure that regulatory changes genuinely improve access to competent psychological care across both Ontario and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains limited by reliance on cognitive symptoms that appear only after significant neurodegeneration has occurred. Although the traditional memory-first model assumes that early pathology begins in medial temporal lobe structures, growing evidence shows that initial decline often emerges in distributed association cortices that support sensory processing, perceptual integration, motor planning, timing precision, executive control, and affective regulation. These findings motivate the AD Spectrum Hypothesis, which proposes that early AD manifests through heterogeneous combinations of sensory, perceptual, motor, cognitive, and emotional changes rather than a uniform trajectory of episodic memory loss. To evaluate whether existing behavioral tasks capture this multidomain variability, we reviewed studies comparing healthy controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with early AD using the Sensation, Perception, Action, Cognition, Emotion (SPACE) framework. Across modalities, MCI and early AD showed graded impairments in anticipatory motor control, gait dynamics, speech acoustics, visuomotor organization, fine-motor timing, perceptual stability, and emotional modulation. These findings indicate that early AD affects multiple functional systems and is most sensitively detected by tasks that engage several SPACE domains simultaneously. Based on this evidence, we propose a multidomain behavioral battery as a promising noninvasive approach for improving early detection of AD.",

In this study, we systematically compared eight CST: sleep² with Polar Verity Sense (VS) and Polar H10, Oura Ring 3, Apple Watch Series 9, Fitbit Charge 6,  Garmin  Vivoactive  6  &amp;  Venu  3,  WHOOP  4,  and  Circul+,  against  home-based ambulatory PSG. Eighteen participants completed five consecutive nights (Monday  to  Friday)  of  home  PSG  while  wearing  two  paired  devices  of  each CST. Controlled sleep manipulations, such as restricted and extended sleep, were included in the protocol to challenge the devices’ algorithms under varied levels of difficulty. Performance evaluation followed a standardised framework incorporating both epoch-by-epoch and discrepancy analyses to assess multi-class sleep-staging performance and agreement across key sleep parameters. Epoch-by-epoch accuracy  and  Cohen’s κ  were  as  follows:  sleep² -Polar  VS  =  83.7%  (κ  =  0.76), sleep²-Polar H10 = 84.04% (κ = 0.76), Oura Ring 3 = 72.5% (κ = 0.59), Apple Watch Series 9 = 72.3% (κ = 0.56), Fitbit Charge 6 = 66.16% (κ = 0.47), Garmin Vivoactive 6 &amp; Venu 3 = 63.4% (κ = 0.41), WHOOP 4 = 65.15% (κ = 0.48), and Circul+ = 55.59% (κ = 0.33). Discrepancy analysis revealed systematic and proportional biases across CST devices: most wrist-worn devices overestimated sleep time and underestimated wake after sleep onset, with error magnitude increasing drastically in atypical nights characterised by fragmented, restricted, or extended sleep. Cardiac-derived arm- and chest-band sleep² derived sleep metrics showed minor deviation from PSG, whereas Oura devices exhibited moderate but variable levels of bias. Overall, these findings reveal substantial variability across CST and highlight the importance of standardised bench marking to support the scientific and clinical use of wearable-derived sleep macrostructure.",

We evaluated probability nomograms and machine learning (ML) algorithms (logistic regression, LASSO, SVM, random forest) on accuracy, calibration, and generalizability for predicting current ODD or CD diagnoses. \n\nMethod: Youth aged 5–18 receiving outpatient care were recruited from academic (n=622) and community (n=506) clinics. Predictors included demographics, comorbid diagnoses, mood and behavioral indicators. The criterion was K-SADS diagnoses of ODD/CD. Models were trained in the academic sample, using the community sample for external validation. AUC quantified accuracy, Spiegelhalter's z indexed calibration, and cross-site performance measured generalizability. \n\nResults: For ODD prediction, the nomogram selected CBCL Aggression as the strongest predictor and reached AUC≈.70 in both samples. ML models achieved good discrimination (AUC≈.86) with good-to-moderate calibration in the academic sample, deteriorating to fair accuracy with severe miscalibration in the community setting. For CD prediction, the nomogram built on CBCL Rule-Breaking showed good accuracy (AUC≈.82) in both samples. ML models showed near-excellent accuracy (AUC≈.88) in the academic sample but underperformed in the community sample (AUC=.73-.76), though LASSO, SVM, and random forest maintained good calibration. \n\nConclusion: Across both disorders, nomograms demonstrated lower accuracy but strong cross-site stability, while ML using more predictors achieved superior accuracy that did not generalize. The nomogram offers a low-cost and parsimonious tool. Machine learning is best suited for well-resourced clinics where model training data closely resemble the new cases encountered in practice.",

In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding. For both groups, tracing was not beneficial for feature binding.

          "authors": "Hynek Cígler",
          "abstract": "Reversed publication bias—the idea that politically sensitive findings may be selectively suppressed in favor of null effects—has recently gained attention in public and online discussions. Roth et al.’s (2015) meta-analysis of the association between intelligence and school grades (ρ = .54) has been frequently cited as supposed evidence, because its funnel plots appear to show larger correlations in studies with smaller sampling error. However, this study demonstrates that the pattern is entirely spurious. Reanalysis of the original data reveals that the asymmetry arises from the use of the conditional standard error of the correlation coefficient, which depends on the observed value of r and mechanically induces funnel-plot skew. When more appropriate methods, such as Fisher’s z-transformation with unconditional standard errors, are applied, the asymmetry disappears and Egger’s test becomes nonsignificant, t(238) = −1.41, p = .160. A complementary simulation study further confirms that conditional-error weighting can generate strong false signals of reversed publication bias and inflate total effect-size estimates even when no bias is present. Overall, these findings provide no evidence for reversed publication bias in research on intelligence and school grades. Using conditional standard errors of raw correlation coefficients in meta-analyses should be completely avoided.",

          "abstract": "Introduced in 2014 and revised in 2018, the entropic brain hypothesis has accrued a wealth of supportive evidence. The hypothesis states that— along a dimension of breadth of conscious experience— ‘expansive states’ reliably exhibit increased brain entropy whereas the inverse applies for states of no or reduced consciousness. Examples of expansive states include those of expert meditation, flicker light stimulation, the near-death experience, atypical breathing, rapid-eye-movement sleep, the pre-ictal aura, unmedicated early psychosis and psychedelic drug states. Example states of no or reduced consciousness with low brain entropy, include disorders of consciousness, deep sleep, the anesthetized state, seizure, post-stroke, ageing, cognitive impairment, and neurodegenerative disorders. It is shown here that the entropic brain has convergent, correlative, predictive, discriminative and external validity. Regarding its predictive validity, increased brain entropy under psilocybin predicts subsequent improvements in mental health (improved well-being 1-month post-dose). Regarding its discriminative validity, changes in brain entropy selectively index the breadth of subjective experience versus alternative dimensions, such as arousal. Regarding portability/external validity, an entropy (temperature) function is used in generative artificial intelligence. In conclusion, the entropic brain is proving to be a useful model of conscious states.",

          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making—where users retain responsibility for the final decision but receive input from algorithms prior to or during the judgment process—has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ romantic relationships are consistently rated as some of their most stressful experiences, ranging from breakups to decoding subtle cues on social media. Most adolescents turn to friends (74%) as well as parents (69%) for help. In parallel, nearly 75% of U.S. teens have experimented with Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs). Here we report a preregistered [osf.io/md2ek], randomized experiment (N=404 adolescents aged 13-17) to compare the quality of relationship advice from parents against that generated by LLMs. In a within-subjects, repeated-measures design, participants read three realistic dating conflict scenarios, each drawn from a popular relationship advice application, and then read advice about how to respond. The advice was randomly assigned (and counter-balanced) to either an LLM or a parent. The LLM-provided advice was split into two sources: a fine-tuned LLM (AskElle) that was trained to provide relationship advice or an off-the-shelf LLM (either ChatGPT or Gemini). Participants then rated the responses for help with coping, likelihood of implementation, and trustworthiness. Data were analyzed using a random-intercept model estimated with a Bayesian, machine-learning method (stochtree). The LLMs outperformed parents’ advice by approximately 0.3 standard deviations across the primary outcomes, all pr(ATE&gt;0)&gt;.99. The fine-tuned LLM was just as effective as the off-the-shelf LLMs, when averaging across the three trials. Secondary analyses (see Figure 1) showed that participants preferred the off-the-shelf LLMs when they were the first piece of advice they saw, pr(Diff)&gt;.99. But they strongly preferred the fine-tuned LLM when it was third or after repeated exposure. Once participants could directly compare all three sources, they overwhelmingly preferred the fine-tuned LLM’s advice, pr(Diff)&gt;.99 over both parents and off-the-shelf LLMs. Thus in real-world contexts, with repeated consultation of an AI tool, generic advice from an LLM is likely to become less effective with adolescents seeking more attuned relationship advice. Qualitative, natural-language analyses identified elements of the advice that were most and least successful. Parents’ language tended to diminish adolescents’ feelings, dismissing their relationship problems as temporary and superficial. Off-the-shelf LLMs were overly accommodating and affirming, sometimes reinforcing more extreme appraisals and possibly entrenching young people in harmful patterns of rumination. The highest-performing answers validated participants’ feelings while challenging their appraisals of the situation, leading teens to a more optimistic appraisal, accompanied by clear action steps with example scripts.",

          "abstract": "Higher education is widely believed to have a liberalizing effect on students, yet empirical findings are mixed. In two studies (total N = 483,885), we investigated the “diploma divide” in the United States. In the past half-century, we found that adults with more education have consistently held more left-leaning views on social but not economic issues. Before the 2010s, however, there were no meaningful, educational differences in the degree to which people identified as liberal versus conservative. In the years since, college graduates have increasingly identified as liberal, while those with some or no college education remained steady. Moreover, in the mid-1990s, students did not come to identify as more left-leaning during their time in higher education. However, they have increasingly done so in the years since. Such within-person changes differ across fields of study, demographics, and other individual characteristics, but are minimally related to the kinds of institutions that students attend. Overall, these findings reveal a striking change in the relationship between higher education and political identity. They also undermine sweeping claims about liberalizing effects of education, calling instead for fine-grained theories about how, when, and for whom attending higher education affects which aspects of ideology.",

          "abstract": "Conversation requires rapid and efficient language processing, which in turn depends on a high degree of automatization. Yet, it remains unclear how such automatization develops in languages that are typically not used for spoken communication, such as Latin. In an online learning experiment, we examined how time pressure and strict linear reading influence sentence processing in Latin. Two groups of participants received identical training materials but differed in these two factors during the learning phase. The results showed that time pressure facilitated automatization in the retrieval and evaluation of linguistic cues (subject animacy and argument order), but it also made it more difficult to override automatized routines when processing semantically unacceptable sentences containing animacy violations. In addition, strict linear reading enhanced incremental and predictive processing, particularly for verb initial sentences. These findings indicate that time pressure and linear reading support the development of efficient processing routines in Latin, highlighting their potential role in optimizing second language learning strategies even for non spoken languages.",

          "abstract": "Theories of political belief systems and inter-attitude structure predict that central attitudes in a belief system will be more resistant to change than peripheral attitudes. The theories hold that by way of their interconnections to many other attitudes, central attitudes in political belief systems are more likely to be held in place by their connections than peripheral attitudes. We formalize this prediction using simulations (Studies 1 and 2). Methodological challenges have previously prevented empirical tests of the prediction at the appropriate, individual level of analysis. We conduct such empirical tests using panel (Studies 3-5, combined N = 2,731) and experimental studies (Studies 4 &amp; 5, combined N = 2,195) of U.S. Americans. We find that central attitudes in political belief systems are more stable over time (Studies 3-5), and elicit more negative cognitions, emotions, and evaluations of argument quality when targeted with a persuasive message (Studies 4 &amp; 5). These results are consistent with the prediction that central attitudes are more resistant to change than peripheral attitudes. Notably, central attitudes were similarly persuadable as peripheral attitudes. These findings both confirm the importance of attitude position in the belief system for attitude stability and highlight the possible need for theory revisions to capture the full pattern of results.",

          "abstract": "This study examined global eye-movement reading behavior in a second language (L2) using a scanpath-based approach with the Multilingual Eye Movement Corpus L2 dataset. Specifically, utilizing data from 443 bilingual participants from 11 diverse L1 backgrounds reading 12 English (L2) texts, we investigated 1) the stability of individual reading strategies across texts, 2) cross-linguistic influences of the first language (L1), 3) correspondences between L1 and L2 eye-movement behavior, and 4) the relationship between global reading strategies, L2 comprehension, and L2 proficiency. The analyses that employed the scasim method to quantify scanpath (dis)similarity, that is, how similar global reading strategies are within and between participants and across languages, revealed that individual L2 reading behavior was consistent across L2 texts, but L1 scanpaths did not reliably predict L2 scanpaths. L1 background left a weak but detectable imprint on L2 scanpaths. Finally, global L2 reading behavior was significantly associated with L2 comprehension accuracy and proficiency, with more typical scanpaths linked to better comprehension and higher proficiency. We discuss the results in relation to traditional word-level analyses in L2 reading and emphasize the added value of a scanpath-based approach for assessing global reading behavior cross-linguistically.",

          "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions are a group of emotions related to the social self and navigating the social world. These emotions are theorized to originate from the interplay between early parent-infant interactions and personal temperamental predisposition. However, little is known about their early ontogeny. In this preregistered longitudinal study, we examined the developmental and socialization factors contributing to the emergence of self-conscious emotions: focusing on infants’ reactions to social exposure, a known elicitor of these emotions. Infants participated in a social exposure task, in which they were lavishly complimented in four situations at six-months (N=103) and 15-months (N=77). At the six-month measurement, mother–infant dyads also engaged in two interaction tasks coded for mind-mindedness and positive affective synchrony, and mothers reported on infant temperament. Self-conscious emotional reactions were indexed through coy smiling – a smile accompanied by head and/or gaze aversion. Results showed strong evidence for an effect of time, with six-month-olds displaying more coy smiles than 15-month-olds. Higher negative temperament predicted fewer coy smiles across both measurements. No effects of mind-mindedness or positive affective synchrony were found. These findings suggest that the first self-conscious emotions emerge early in infancy and may be initially shaped primarily by temperamental predispositions, rather than socialization.",

          "authors": "Johanna Funk; Florian Hintz",
          "abstract": "Adults acquire new words, including written and spoken forms across the lifespan. Learning novel words is a dynamic process that progresses from initial familiarization through consolidation towards lexicalization. These processes exhibit substantial interindividual variability. In this study, we leverage this variability to investigate the mechanisms that characterize different learning stages, focusing on the distinct contributions of domain-specific linguistic and domain-general skills.\nAcross three sessions distributed over three weeks, 140 native German participants learned Mandarin Chinese spoken and written (Pinyin) word forms and were tested on the retention of the new knowledge. Additionally, participants completed nine tests assessing linguistic experience, processing speed, auditory and visual short-term memory, and nonverbal reasoning.\nStructural equation modeling, including latent growth curve analysis, revealed that the acquisition and linking of word forms was primarily shaped by domain-general skills: Processing speed supported word form learning at all stages, while auditory short-term memory supported initial but not later learning. A weaker association to linguistic experience was observed in exploratory network analyses with links between receptive vocabulary at all and spelling at initial stages of learning.\nThese findings highlight that learning is conditioned by how fast and efficient incoming information are processed, and that initial learning is constrained by short-term memory capacity. Consistent with the Complementary Learning Systems account, this points towards distinct stages of learning with effortful and controlled processing at early familiarization stages, and more automatic processing at later consolidation-associated stages. The findings suggest that learners may benefit from tailoring initial input to individual memory capacity.",

This illusory shift can be as large as the distance the frame moves, making it one of the most significant position shift illusions. The frame effect persists under many variations of the frame’s shape and motion trajectories, suggesting a position encoding mechanism that relies on relative location rather than motion. With one exception (the double-drift), motion-induced position shifts produce similar effects on saccadic eye movements and perception. Here, we compare the effect of a moving frame on perception and on saccades across spatial and temporal variations of the frame and the probe. The first experiment showed that saccades targeting the probes were displaced by only about a third of the shift seen for the perception of the probe. A second experiment showed that this difference was constant across a large range of frame speeds. These results add novel evidence in support of dissociable position representations for perception and action.",

          "authors": "Daniel Spinoza-Martín; Gordon Pennycook",
          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

In Experiment 1, participants generated positive and negative behaviors related to either morality or ability and then evaluated each behavior on the other dimension. Negative moral behaviors led to stronger inferences of low ability than negative ability behaviors led to inferences of immorality (i.e., asymmetric Horn effect). No asymmetry emerged for positive behaviors (i.e., symmetric Halo effects). Experiments 2a-2b confirmed the asymmetric Horn effect and showed it was stronger for extreme versus moderate negative behaviors. Experiment 3 showed that immoral behaviors elicited more perceived threat than unable behaviors, which partly explained the asymmetric horn effect. These findings complement and extend prior models of impression formation by highlighting the primacy of morality in influencing judgments on other fundamental content dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nDepression is a highly recurrent condition, and many individuals remain vulnerable to relapse during the remission phase. Cognitive Control Training (CCT), particularly the internet-delivered adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (aPASAT), has shown promise in preventing relapse, yet its health economic value has not been evaluated. This study assessed the cost-utility of adding aPASAT to treatment as usual (TAU) for adults in remission from major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\nMethods\n\nA Markov state-transition model simulated a hypothetical cohort of Belgian adults aged 18-65 years in remission from MDD over a five-year time horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Model parameters were mainly derived from published literature. Outcomes included incremental costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and incremental monetary benefit (INMB). Uncertainty was evaluated using one-way sensitivity, two-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5,000 simulations), and multiple deterministic scenario analyses.\n\nResults\n\nIn the base case, aPASAT + TAU dominated TAU alone, yielding additional QALYs (Δ = 2192) and lower healthcare costs (Δ = –€77.38M), resulting in an INMB of €182.6M at a €48,000 per QALY threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 99.9% probability of cost-effectiveness. Scenario analyses varying adherence, coverage, remission prevalence, and time horizon consistently confirmed cost savings and improved health outcomes.\n\nConclusion\n\nInternet-delivered CCT using the aPASAT appears to be a cost-effective strategy for preventing MDD relapse. Its low-cost and fully unguided format supports scalable integration into stepped, prevention-oriented mental healthcare systems.",

          "abstract": "Refugees with diverse sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE) experience alarming rates of mental health conditions, often exceeding those of non-SOGIE refugees and the general population. Despite this, quantitative research on this population remains extremely scarce, with less than a handful of studies looking at the impact of post-migration stressors. This critical review examines the existing literature to identify a methodological gap where current quantitative approaches fail to capture the structural and psychosocial hardships documented in qualitative research, such as retraumatizing asylum processes, intersectional discrimination, and exclusion from both home and host communities. To address this, the article proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating Minority Stress Theory with the taxonomy of Social Identity Threat. This model delineates both distal and proximal stressors mapped with SOGIE refugee experiences. It concludes by outlining measurable domains aligned with best practices for scale development, providing a foundational framework for future quantitative research to validate these stressors and improve culturally sensitive mental health care for SOGIE refugees.",

          "abstract": "Often, causal effects of interest in psychological research involve causes that cannot be randomly assigned. Instrumental variables (IV) regression, a cornerstone of the econometric literature on causal inference with nonrandom causes, allows for unbiased causal inference in the face of several threats to the validity of causal inference using ordinary least squares regression. IV is enabled by an instrument – a third variable that affects the outcome only through its influence on the hypothesized cause. One way to study causal effects in psychology is thus the random assignment of an intervention that drives change in the cause of interest but is otherwise unrelated to the outcome, followed by IV analysis to produce a valid causal effect. Moreover, IV regression models can be estimated straightforwardly as structural equation models (SEMs). Based on open data from a recently published study in the economics literature, this tutorial outlines the use of SEM to estimate the causal effect of a behavior of interest, exercise, on an outcome of interest, academic performance, enabled by an instrument –  a randomly-distributed free gym card – that constitutes a random, non-binding manipulation of exercise. The role of covariates in IV is discussed, and R code is provided for all analyses.",

The present study analyses the factors influencing AI acceptance in adults. A quantitative synthesis based on Kelly et al. (2023) was conducted using one-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling (OSMASEM; Jak et al., 2021).\nA total of 40 studies comprising 36,403 subjects were included, yielding 43 correlation matrices and 110 correlation coefficients. The OSMASEM results support a dual-pathway model to AI acceptance: perceived usefulness (PU) is a strong predictor of trust in AI (TR) (β31 = .75, p &lt; .001), which in turn predicts behavioral intention (BI) (β53 = .43, p &lt; .001). Concurrently, performance expectancy (PE) predicts attitudes towards AI (ATT) (β42 = .75, p &lt; .001), which also predicts BI (β54 = .40, p &lt; .001). TR and ATT mediate positive relationships between PU (β51 = .32, p &lt; .001) and BI, and between PE (β52 = .30, p &lt; .001) and BI.\nThis review contributes to understanding the factors influencing AI acceptance. In practical terms, these findings emphasize the importance of internal factors such as TR and ATT, alongside conventional acceptance factors (PU, PE). The need for further research in this area is highlighted, with the recommendation to employ specific AI acceptance models.\nThese results suggest that while core cognitive evaluations (PU, PE) remain crucial, their influence is channeled through more proximal affective and relational constructs (TR, ATT) indicating a potential evolution from traditional technology acceptance frameworks when applied to AI.",

The influence of the administration methods on internal consistency, criterion validity, and nonresponse rates was nonsignificant. Swipe-Video was much slower than both other methods; the textual Swipe scale was only slightly slower than the Likert format. Respondents’ ratings of enjoyment, ease-of-use, and intention-to-use did not differ significantly across methods.

          "abstract": "Adult aging is associated with a decline in memory for the specific details of past experiences, but the reasons for these declines remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we consider the potential of computational process models of memory to reveal mechanisms underlying age-related changes in memory specificity. We define empirical benchmarks in the most widely used tasks for studying age differences in memory -- recognition and free recall. We then systematically review two broad classes of process models -- global matching and retrieved context models -- that are well-suited to explaining these benchmarks. We discuss and at times illustrate through simulations how age differences in memory specificity can arise from different mechanisms in these models, such as reductions in encoding fidelity, cue-selectivity of retrieval, contextual reinstatement, or retrieval monitoring. These models hold great promise for uncovering the latent mechanisms of age-related memory change, but several explanatory shortcomings must be addressed for a more comprehensive theory to emerge. Because process models often incorporate simplifying shortcuts, they risk advancing descriptive rather than mechanistic explanations for age differences in memory. Furthermore, models that have identified multiple processes of age-related memory impairment have left unaddressed the ways in which these processes affect each other.  By illuminating these and other challenges in current process models, our review aims to stimulate future advances that can dramatically reshape our understanding of the processes of age-related changes in memory specificity.",

They felt disinterested and even uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed that it should remain private and hidden, especially at work. They acknowledged that menstruating colleagues were framed as emotionally unstable, weak, and less competent, reinforcing misogynist and femmephobic stereotypes. Our findings extend applications of femmephobia to the devaluation and regulation of menstruating bodies in the workplace, and broaden the concept of dirty femininity to include menstruation. To promote inclusive workspaces, interventions should foster dialogue and build empathy.",

Confirmatory factor analyses support-ed unidimensional structures for the Knowledge and Use scales, both showing good model fit and internal consistency. For the Attitude scale, a two-factor solution emerged, distinguish-ing Enthusiastic and Cautious Attitudes. Both Attitude subscales demonstrated good model fit and reliability. Latent correlations revealed expected associations: Knowledge and Use were moderately positively correlated; Enthusiastic Attitudes were strongly associated with Use, while a moderately strong correlation was observed between Cautious Attitudes and Knowledge. Exploratory analyses indicated higher Enthusiastic Attitudes in boys and higher Knowledge, Use, and Cautious Attitudes scores in older students. The KUAI-Kids offers a psychometrically sound tool to study children’s engagement with AI chatbots and to inform educational interventions and longitudinal research on AI literacy.",

          "abstract": "Research on the underrepresentation of women in academia and other professions indicates that women may be underrepresented in fields associated with intrinsic aptitude (or “brilliance”) because women are stereotyped as not possessing brilliance. At the same time, women may be less likely to pursue careers in such fields because few women are in them, highlighting the importance of understanding the role of gender representation. Across four studies (N = 1680), we found that people have knowledge of the male-female breakdown of employees for a broad range of occupations (Study 1) and that current gender demographics predict interest and belonging in hypothetical advertised employment (Studies 2-4). The effect of gender demographics was robust, even prioritized over messaging about ability, particularly among women (Study 2 &amp; 3), and scaling parametrically according to the ratio of male and female employees (Study 4). Especially among women, professions with more females elicited greater interest and feelings of belonging than those with more males, even when those professions were associated with brilliance. These findings suggest that altering beliefs about brilliance for success in specific professions, though important, may be insufficient for increasing female representation in fields where women are underrepresented. Instead, increasing future female representation may benefit from increasing the presence of more women now.",

Parental lying has been linked to parent-child relationship quality and children’s social and moral development, underscoring the importance of accurately measuring this behavior. Existing instruments primarily assess prevalence, rely on a narrow conceptualization of parental lying, and their psychometric properties remain understudied. This study therefore introduces the Parental Lying Scenarios Scale (PLSS), a 40 item self-report instrument measure of parental lying prevalence and frequency across a broad range of parental lies. We assess its test-retest reliability, convergent and predictive validity, and factor structure. \nData were collected from Dutch parents of children aged 5-12 years (n = 247 for test-retest reliability and factor analysis; n = 316 for validity analyses). The PLSS demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and evidence for convergent and predictive validity. Exploratory Factor Analyses at two timepoints consistently identified two distinct factors: lying to influence children’s behavior and lying to shape children’s knowledge or emotions.\nThis study provides initial support for the PLSS as a reliable and conceptually meaningful instrument for capturing a broader range of parental lying. The PLSS thereby offers a promising methodological foundation for future research on the antecedents and socio-moral implications of parental lying for both parents and children.",

          "abstract": "Background: Phantom Phone Signals (PPS) are false perceptions that a smartphone has vibrated or made a sound. PPS are typically non-distressing, non-disruptive hallucinations. Increased PPS likelihood is linked to frequent and problematic phone use, mood, anxiety and hallucination-proneness. This study aimed to investigate the role of resilience, delusion-proneness, and metacognition on PPS.\nMethod: This online, self-report, questionnaire study included 265 participants (mean age: 19.74; 84.2% female, no experience of psychosis). Participants completed the Phantom Phone Experiences and Appraisal Scale (PPEAS) to assess PPS, along with the Problematic Use of Mobile Phone Scale (PUMP), Resilience Scale (RS-14), Multi-Modality Unusual Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (MUSEQ), Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI-21), and Metacognition Self-Assessment Scale (MSAS).\nResults: PPS were prevalent, with 86.8% of participants reporting at least one phantom phone experience. These experiences were generally infrequent, non-distressing, and non-disruptive, as reflected in low PPEAS Composite Impact Scores (M = 4.25, SD = 3.66). PPS were significantly correlated with Problematic phone use (r = .345), hallucination-proneness (r = .321) and delusional ideation (r =.226), but not resilience or metacognition. Regression analyses indicated that higher MUSEQ and higher PUMP scores were associated with higher odds of experiencing more PPS and explained 18% variance in PPEAS Composite Impact Scores. This direct relationship was not mediated or moderated by resilience or metacognition.\nConclusion: PPS are highly prevalent amongst university students and are primarily a benign experience influenced by problematic phone use and hallucination-proneness. Behavioural interventions may be the most effective approach for reducing PPS where required.",

          "abstract": "Faced with the severe consequences of climate change, organizations are increasingly adopting formal environmental management practices (e.g., ISO 14000) to reduce their ecological footprint. Yet, given the complexity of environmental challenges, voluntary “green” behaviors of employees play a crucial complementary role. These behaviors can be considered as organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE), defined as discretionary, unrewarded individual behaviors contributing to organizations’ environmental management. Empirical research over the past 15 years has addressed the conceptualization, antecedents, and outcomes of OCBE, however, a systematic integration of these findings is still lacking. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review synthesizes evidence from 151 articles across seven databases, offering a comprehensive overview of conceptual and methodological approaches to OCBE. We further summarize extant evidence on antecedents, mediators, moderators, and consequences of OCBE at the individual, team, leadership, organizational, and societal level. Where possible, we meta-analytically aggregate empirical findings. This review culminates in an integrative OCBE framework, outlines future research avenues, discusses methodological limitations, and provides practical recommendations for employees, supervisors, and human resource managers.",

Employing two large scale, preregistered online surveys in Germany and the UK, the credibility judgments about 16 conspiracy theories (eight plausible, eight implausible) were analyzed. Results showed that news media knowledge structures and actively open-minded thinking were consistently associated with participants’ discernment. Conspiracy mentality, in turn, was a key determinant of participants’ response bias. The framework presented clarifies why rational and irrational elements of conspiracy belief ought to be distinguished - as differences in belief content also relate to differences in citizens information processing capabilities.\n\n\tKey words: conspiracy theories, plausibility, signal detection theory",

However, questions remain about the optimal metrics for real-time data capture and the applicability of these solutions for enhancing user experiences. The present research examined a novel form of adaptive XR, called “prediction-based attention computing” (PbAC), which tailors simulations based on computational models of the brain and, thus, the dynamic sensorimotor processes theorised to underpin human perception and learning. Specifically, this study aimed to demonstrate whether PbAC can adaptively capture users’ internal state predictions and modulate associated neuropsychological responses. To test this, we used an XR-based racquetball paradigm, in which participants were tasked with intercepting virtual balls that emerged from different starting locations. For PbAC conditions, in-situ eye tracking data assessments were utilised to index participant’s prior beliefs and manipulate levels of expectedness (i.e., prediction error) on each trial. Various measures of predictive sensorimotor behaviour were then extracted and compared with data from probability-controlled and matched-order control conditions. Results showed that sensorimotor responses were affected by the expectedness of XR stimuli, and that clear, prediction-related biases emerged within PbAC conditions. The novel computing software also provoked marked surprisal responses on trials designed to elicit high levels of prediction error, and these surprisal effects were similar, or even greater than, those in our comparison conditions. Together, the findings provide proof of concept for PbAC and support its development within future research and technology innovations.",

          "authors": "Antti-Eero Lattula; Leonardo Weiss-Cohen; Christopher R Madan",
          "abstract": "Depending on how information is conveyed, people show different risk preferences. Odds and outcomes could be described (e.g., Option A [90%: £20, 10%: £8] and Option B [certain £18]), where people often overweight rare outcomes [10%: £8]. However, when odds and outcomes are learned through experience (sampling), people tend to underweight rare outcomes, a phenomenon known as the Description-Experience Gap. Previous studies demonstrating these effects have relied on numerical risk representations. However, risk communication could also be visual, using pictographs, which may lead to different preferences due to the integration of elements from both description- and experience-based paradigms and pattern recognition processes. Across two pre-registered experiments, we examined the D-E Gap across numerical and visual risk representations. Participants made risky choices under four within-subjects conditions: (1) Numeric Description—full numeric summary of each lottery; (2) Pictograph Description—lotteries represented with arranged icon arrays; (3) Numeric Sampling—numeric outcomes sampled sequentially; and (4) Pictograph Sampling—outcomes sampled sequentially from icon arrays. We observed a reduced D-E Gap with visual formats—primarily driven by the Pictograph Description. In Experiment 2, we further tested how variations in these conditions, related to attenuating memory reliance (via a visible history of past samples) and sampling effort (via automated sampling), accounted for the between-condition differences. Our results persisted despite these changes—providing new insights into how distinct cognitive processes relate to this risk preference behaviour. Exploratory analyses indicate that observing of all outcomes during sampling had a substantial effect on the magnitude of the D-E gap.",

          "authors": "Corinna Lorenz; Nicola Kristina Ferdinand",
          "abstract": "Understanding why some individuals are more prone to problematic risk-taking requires examining how they process feedback during escalating risk scenarios. Traditional laboratory paradigms fail to capture two critical\naspects of real-world risky behavior: the dynamic nature of risk escalation and the orthogonal manipulation of risk parameters. We addressed these limitations using an ERP-adapted Columbia Card Task (CCT), enabling precise temporal analysis of neural responses as risks accumulate within decision episodes. Twenty-five participants completed the CCT while we recorded EEG, measuring early outcome detection (FRN/RewP, 240-340ms) and later evaluative processing (P3b, 300-500ms). We systematically manipulated gain amounts, loss amounts, and loss probability while examining how individual risk propensity—measured through actual task behavior—predicted neural feedback processing patterns. Critically, rather risk-averse and rather riskprone individuals employed fundamentally different temporal adaptation strategies that emerged dynamically as risks escalated. During early outcome detection, risk-prone participants showed progressive sensitization to negative outcomes across feedback sequences, while risk-averse participants showed habituation. These opposing patterns reversed for positive outcomes. During later evaluation, risk-prone individuals selectively maintained working memory updating for positive outcomes despite accumulating losses, while risk-averse participants enhanced negative outcome processing. These context-dependent effects were most pronounced under specific high-stakes conditions: smaller gains and larger losses amplified group differences in early processing, while probability information revealed that risk-prone individuals showed enhanced neural responses to improbable positive outcomes—providing a mechanism for persistent risk engagement despite unfavorable\nodds. Behavioral results revealed that risk-prone individuals achieved higher efficiency without performance costs, suggesting these neural patterns reflect adaptive individual differences rather than pathological dysfunction. Our findings fundamentally reframe risk propensity as a dynamic regulatory process triggered by escalating risk, with direct implications for identifying vulnerable individuals before maladaptive patterns crystallize.",

Following the analytic template for outcome-wide designs, we conducted a series of country-specific weighted multivariate regression analyses where each Wave 2 outcome was regressed on Wave 1 forgivingness (controlling for Wave 1 sociodemographic and retrospectively recalled childhood variables). Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool country-specific estimates of association for the 56 main outcomes covering psychological, social, physical, volitional, and material dimensions of well-being. We found some evidence of association between forgivingness and higher well-being for both composite well-being indicators and numerous specific indicators across different domains of functioning (observed associations were mostly very small in magnitude). Associations were generally stronger and more consistent for some domains (e.g., psychological well-being) compared to others (e.g., physical health &amp; health behavior). Meta-analyzed estimates of association generally attenuated after using a more conservative analytic approach that additionally adjusted for principal components extracted from the Wave 1 outcomes treated as covariates. Country-specific results showed some cross-national variation. Our findings contribute novel population-level evidence on the potential benefits of forgivingness for different aspects of well-being.",

Neural systems must therefore integrate temporal with representational structure, linking the evolving input with the hierarchical units it instantiates. These operations give rise to two fundamental statistical dependencies in linguistic and neural data: covariance, the instantaneous shared structure across features or recording sites, and temporal dependence, the influence of past states on the present state. As experiments become more naturalistic, neuroimaging and electrophysiological data increasingly express both forms of structure, producing correlated variables and continuous temporal dependencies that complicate interpretation. Because statistical models handle covariance and temporal dependence differently, they support distinct kinds of inference about language-brain mapping. We introduce a Dual-Dependency Taxonomy that classifies modelling approaches by the dependencies they represent. This framework clarifies the linguistic-neural relationships each model family can reveal, the questions they cannot address, and the methodological implications that follow.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nArts on Prescription (AoP) programmes occur within primary care and community settings. The current study extended this to examine the impact of AoP, in secondary care, on patient wellbeing, social connection, and experiences of care.\nMethods:\nA mixed methods design was used. Quantitative data were collected with 61 patients referred to AoP at a UK Hospital, where they received outpatient treatment for cancer, chronic pain, weight management, breathlessness or neuromuscular conditions. Programme-level outcomes assessed wellbeing and loneliness. The immediate wellbeing impact of art workshops was assessed by tracking mood and loneliness. Qualitative data focused on experiences of AoP and were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups (n = 12) and analysed using thematic analysis.\nResults:\nWellbeing scores significantly increased across the programme, alongside reductions in loneliness. Art workshops increased relaxation, contentment, and social connection. The thematic analysis led to four themes: (1) Connection to others – feeling supported, inspired and understood; (2) Making space – providing calm, protected time, and mental respite; (3) Becoming – renewed confidence, and opening to new opportunities; and (4) Clinical implications – reframing relationships with the hospital, validating referrals, and supporting the management of health conditions.\nConclusions:\nAoP in secondary care demonstrates potential as an effective approach, replicating effects in primary care, including improved wellbeing and social connection. However, additional merits in the context of secondary care relate to the ‘hospital-patient’ relationship, and using art to manage health conditions. Embedding AoP within hospital settings may reduce burden on secondary services by supporting psychosocial needs alongside medical care.",

          "abstract": "Background\nDepression remains a critical mental health issue in military contexts, where timely recognition and appropriate treatment are essential. Military general practitioners (GPs) in the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) serve as primary gatekeepers for mental health concerns. To strengthen depression management and suicide prevention, the community-based 4-level approach was adapted to the Bundeswehr context and implemented at eight military garrisons. This study explores military GPs’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of the 4-level approach.\nMethods\nSemistructured interviews were conducted with 17 military GPs across eight intervention garrisons, following a 4-hour training on depression recognition, treatment, and the use of digital tools. The interviews were based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF), combining deductive coding and inductive belief statement synthesis. Intercoder reliability was high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.96).\nResults\nEleven of fourteen TDF domains were relevant for implementation. The most significant domain was social influence, particularly concerning the stigma surrounding mental illness. Other key domains included environmental context and resources and professional identity. The key facilitators were a perceived reduction in stigma, active involvement of commanding officers, high clinical relevance of depression and a strong intention to apply the intervention content. The key barriers included persistent stigmatization, time constraints, work-related causes of depression and the variability in perceived relevance of depression across units. \nConclusion\nImplementation of the 4-level approach within the Bundeswehr is shaped by organizational, cultural, and contextual factors. Persistent stigma, high workload, and military-specific stressors impede effective implementation, whereas leadership engagement and the perceived clinical relevance of depression facilitate it. Despite training, some GPs appeared to hold a simplified view of the development of depression, which highlights the need for more tailored training to address misconceptions about depression and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Digital tools are seen as very useful but require better integration into routine clinical practice.",

Here we investigate the influences of external and internal factors on lay audiences' belief updating based on scientific evidence with a diverse sample of U.S. residents from which data was collected in May 2023. Participants were presented a series of fictitious hypotheses. For each hypothesis, we assessed their initial beliefs and subjective expertise, presented them fictitious study outcomes, and then assessed their beliefs again. Importantly, the outcomes' presentation format and ordering were manipulated. Participants exhibited more belief updating when study outcomes were presented simultaneously (all on one page) instead of sequentially (split up across different pages). While chronologically ordering outcomes given sequential presentation did not affect belief updating, participants weighted more recently presented outcomes more strongly. We further found that belief updating was less pronounced with increasing subjective expertise, and more pronounced with increasing trust in science and scientific literacy. These results provide practical implications for science communication and the consumption of scientific evidence.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian hypothesis testing via Bayes factors offers a principled alternative to classical p-value methods in meta-analysis, particularly suited to its cumulative and sequential nature. Unlike the commonly reported p-values in standard null hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors naturally allow for quantifying support both for and against the existence of an effect, facilitate ongoing evidence monitoring, and maintain coherent long-run behavior as additional studies are incorporated. Recent theoretical developments further show how Bayes factors can flexibly control Type I error rates through connections to e-value theory. Despite these advantages, their use remains limited in the meta-analytic literature. This paper provides a critical overview of their theoretical properties, methodological considerations—such as prior sensitivity—and practical advantages for evidence synthesis. Two illustrative applications are provided: one on statistical learning in individuals with language impairments, and another on seroma incidence following post-operative exercise in breast cancer patients.

          "abstract": "What makes mental images high in detail? Drawing on Construal Level Theory (CLT) and Reality Monitoring Theory (RMT), we consider in six studies (N = 1,660) the effect of psychological distance on the meta-cognitive assessments of an episode’s level of detail. Although CLT has argued for a relationship between an episode’s proximity and the degree to which it is represented concretely, and level of detail within visual imagery is an important manifestation of concreteness, research within CLT has not considered level of detail of mental images as a key outcome variable. We adapted a methodological approach advanced by RMT to examine memories to the realm of imagined scenarios. In Studies 1 to 5, participants evaluated the level of detail of proximal and distal episodes. In Study 6 participants imagined episodes with high or low level of detail and rated their perceived psychological distance. We found that distance influences meta-cognitive assessments of level of detail and is influenced by a level of detail manipulation. We discuss the relevance of these findings for CLT, RMT, and prior work on meta-cognition, and consider the findings’ practical implications.",

          "abstract": "The first years of life are characterized by pronounced advances in cognitive and language abilities, yet children differ markedly in the pace and pattern of this development. This study addresses gaps in understanding how a broad range of early-life factors relate to such heterogeneous developmental profiles during infancy. Using longitudinal data from 911 infants in the Little in Norway study, cognitive and language abilities were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Longitudinal latent class analysis identified three subgroups: “Rapid learners” (23.5%), “Typical learners” (64.3%), and “Delayed learners” (12.2%). Multinomial logistic regressions tested whether early-life factors reflecting prenatal growth, parental socioeconomic status, parental mental health and stress, and mother-infant interactional quality predicted class membership. As expected, higher paternal education increased the likelihood of belonging to the “Rapid learners” class relative to the “Typical learners”, whereas better mother-child interactional quality distinguished “Rapid learners” from “Delayed learners”. By examining diverse prenatal, family, and social influences, including paternal characteristics often overlooked in prior research, this study provides new insights into the origins of individual differences in early cognitive and language development.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) hold growing potential for scaling the analysis of qualitative\ndata in the learning sciences. One essential step in qualitative analysis is coding verbal data.\nAlthough several approaches have been proposed for automating coding with LLMs, few\nappear well-suited to the needs of the learning sciences, where coding requires identifying\ndescriptive content categories and pedagogical functions of utterances, often implicit and\ndifficult to detect. To address this challenge, we provide the Theory–Prompt–Validation\n(TPV) approach, a three-step process comprising theory modeling, prompt engineering, and\nvalidation. This approach provides a blueprint for evidence-based application of LLMs for\ncontext-sensitive coding of verbal data. The TPV approach builds on existing methods while\nincorporating requirements specific to the learning sciences. We emphasize a theory-driven,\nevidence-based process, including validation analyses to verify that pragmatic functions are\naccurately captured in coding. To illustrate the TPV approach, we applied it to AI-student\ntutoring dialogues. We developed a theory-driven codebook and implemented it in a Python-\nbased script leveraging GPT-4o to segment utterances and assign codes automatically.\nIntercoder agreement between the LLM and a human coder was substantial (κ = .73, 95% CI\n[0.69,0.76]) and descriptively higher than between two human coders (κ = .69, 95% CI [0.66,\n0.73]). Validity analyses revealed theoretically meaningful patterns, such as positive effects\nwhen the code feedback was assigned more frequently. Our work demonstrates that LLM-\nbased coding can reliably and validly scale the analysis of verbal data, bridging the gap\nbetween time-intensive qualitative methods and large-scale, evidence-based educational\nresearch.",

Yet Autistic people with complex support needs (CSN) – including those who are minimally- or non-speaking, use augmentative and alternative communication, or require intensive daily support – remain disproportionately excluded from both neurodiversity discourse and participatory research. In this commentary, we clarify the relationship between the neurodiversity paradigm and Autistic people with CSN, addressing persistent misconceptions that the movement overlooks disability or minimizes support needs. Drawing on theoretical analysis, empirical evidence, and recent research experiences involving Autistic people with CSN, we argue that when applied rigorously, the neurodiversity paradigm offers a powerful framework for advancing autonomy, dignity, and inclusion for those with the most complex support needs. We examine structural, attitudinal, and methodological barriers that limit participation, and highlight emerging studies demonstrating that inclusive, co-produced research with Autistic people with CSN is both possible and beneficial. Finally, we offer four actionable recommendations to guide researchers in creating conditions that support meaningful involvement of Autistic people with CSN throughout the research process. Ensuring that participatory approaches include those historically excluded is not only an ethical imperative but essential for producing accurate, responsive, and socially just autism research.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of research on human reasoning, a deceptively simple question remains empirically underexplored: what makes us reason? Classical Dual Process Theories (DPTs) struggle with this question because they posit an intuitive System 1 whose outputs are monitored and sometimes overridden by a deliberative System 2. This creates a theoretical paradox: System 2 would need to both detect the need for additional processing and perform that processing, behaving like a system that triggers itself. In contrast, “hybrid” DPTs resolve the paradoxical tension by proposing that conflict between competing (System 1 generated) intuitions serves as the cue that triggers analytic engagement. Although this view has become dominant, little empirical work has attempted to manipulate the strength differential of competing intuitions to test the core prediction that, by doing so, deliberation should be triggered. We test this prediction by modifying the classic base-rate neglect paradigm in a within-participant experiment with six counterbalanced conditions (N=263). Our design extends the classic base-rate–versus–stereotype conflict by introducing a novel source of conflict: within-stereotype conflict. We systematically vary whether the stereotypical descriptions by themselves evoke one or two competing intuitions—and manipulate whether the base-rate supports one or another stereotype-derived intuition. Increasing conflict between intuitions in this manner led to probability judgments that “neglect” the base-rate less, are less confident, and (suggesting increased deliberation) take more time to be generated. Thus, our results provide empirical support for hybrid DPTs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Heightened maladaptive risk-taking associated with affective disorders has created a double burden for adolescents suffering from depression and anxiety. Yet, how and through what mechanism risk-taking and internalising symptoms covary across development remain poorly understood. This study examines the role of negative self-referential memory bias, which is proposed to modulate mental representations of past risk-taking experiences and so to influence future risk-taking. \n\nMethods: Data was drawn from the CogBIAS Longitudinal Study that assessed adolescent development across three waves (N = 504, Mage = 13.4). Risk-taking was measured with the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and self-referential memory bias was indexed as the proportion of endorsed negative relative to positive traits recalled on the Self-Referential Encoding Task. \n\nResults: Adolescent risk-taking increased across waves. Multigroup random-intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that greater memory bias at one wave predicted increases in risk-taking at the next wave in girls but decreases in risk-taking in boys. Decreases in male risk-taking in turn reinforced their negative memory bias. In contrast, internalising symptoms did not on their own, or in interaction with memory bias, predict risk-taking over time in this cohort. \n\nConclusion: Changes in memory bias may be a precursor of gender-atypical increases in risk aversion in male adolescents and heightened risk appetite in female adolescents. Risk-taking may serve as both an indicator and a potential intervention target in adolescents.",

We highlight problems resulting from neglected aspects of indicator\nsampling and investigate how item selection can help to resolve pervasive validity issues (e.g., poor\ncontent coverage, jingle-jangle fallacies). We discuss three stages of item selection: Stage 1, defining\nthe item universe, which requires a clear, non-overlapping delineation of psychological constructs; 2)\ncreating an initial item pool through comprehensive approaches such as cumulative item pools to\nensure full content coverage; and 3) compiling final scales using psychometric optimization\nprocedures such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We argue that traditional prioritization of high\ninternal consistency in Stage 3 leads to overly redundant and conceptually narrow scales and propose\nexpanded selection strategies aimed at maximizing content coverage and optimizing the nomological\nnet (convergent/discriminant validity). Overall, rigorous consideration of item selection is crucial for\nsignificantly enhancing the generalizability and validity of psychological assessment. We advocate for\nviewing item sampling as a strategic intervention for validity enhancement rather than a passive,\nritualistic filtering step.",

The 23 items loaded onto three subscales: U.S. supremacy, individual freedoms, and bootstrap mentality. The scale demonstrates convergent validity with measures such as Protestant Work Ethic, Social Dominance Orientation, meritocracy, Right Wing Authoritarianism, and political conservatism, and divergent validity with lay beliefs in structural racism and critical consciousness. The scale predicted greater support for anti-immigrant policies above and beyond meritocracy and right-wing authoritarianism.

          "abstract": "The Bayesian Brain framework posits that the brain continuously updates its beliefs about a dynamic world by inferring hidden states, including multi-level volatility. The link between volatility and norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter which is imbalanced in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), warrants an investigation of the precise nature of volatility estimation in ADHD, which remains unexplored to date. Thus, the current study used a probabilistic associative learning (PAL) task to extract participant-specific belief trajectories and volatility estimates from adults with and without ADHD. We found only small evidence in favour of a difference in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility and even less evidence for differences in learning rate updates between adults with and without ADHD. Similarly, adults with and without ADHD showed comparable estimates for environmental volatility and response model parameters. Nonetheless, exploration revealed strong evidence for an increase in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility in adults with ADHD not currently taking ADHD medication. Furthermore, ADHD medication was associated with a decrease in estimates for cue-outcome tonic volatility, suggesting a causal relationship between the catecholaminergic imbalance in ADHD and cue-outcome tonic volatility processing. This provides crucial new evidence suggesting that the catecholaminergic imbalance in ADHD may specifically manifest as an altered processing of cue-outcome tonic volatility, offering a novel, computational target for understanding the disorder's neurobiology.",

We used the Multilingual Eye-movement COrpus (MECO) to investigate the distribution of visuo-spatial attention during natural text reading via orthographic parafoveal-on-foveal effects. Fixation durations were analysed as a function of the amount of orthographic overlap between the foveated word and parafoveal regions of text. The results suggest that attention may extend beyond the upcoming word (N+1), especially around the areas that are the most likely to comprise an inter-word space. Cross-linguistic comparisons between four different alphabetic languages further imply that the scope of attention during reading is not universal, and is instead dependent on, e.g., the average word length and other properties of individual orthographies. Furthermore, not all languages show linear effects, and instead reflect a combination of facilitation and disruption, depending on where in the visual field the orthographic overlap occurs and how high this overlap is.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol and cannabis co-use is the most common form of polysubstance use in the U.S. Some evidence suggests that there is an association between cannabis use and reducedalcohol consumption, however data on this topic are mixed. Further research is needed toelucidate the individual factors that determine whether cannabis substitutes for alcohol.\n\nMethod:  This study is an exploratory analysis of data from a within-subjects, crossover laboratory study on alcohol and cannabis co-administration. Participants completed two sessions: one in which they self-administered alcohol after using cannabis, and one in which they self-administered alcohol but did not use cannabis. We aim to compare behavioral phenotypes of individuals who self-administered less alcohol after cannabis (“substituters”;  n=23), more alcohol after cannabis (“complementers”; n=7), or the same amount of alcohol regardless of whether cannabis was used (“non-substituters”;  n=16). We utilized Welch’s ANOVAs and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare baseline group differences, drawing on domains from the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) framework. Wilcoxon tests were employed to test differences in laboratory self-administration measures between sessions for each group. \n\nResults: Substituters had significantly lower scores on measures corresponding to ANA domains of negative emotionality (BDI-II, DASS-Depression) and executive function (UPPS-P Lack of Premeditation) than non-substituters. Substituters endorsed higher positive cannabis expectancies than non-substituters, though expectancy differences did not reach significance. Conclusions: Individuals who use cannabis and alcohol and have lower levels of negative emotionality and impulsivity may be more likely to substitute cannabis for alcohol.

          "authors": "Spencer Caplan; Karthik Durvasula",
          "abstract": "Among the foundational questions for cognition is whether perceptual systems encode sensory input as continuous values or transform it into discrete mental representations. Speech—long a model system for probing the nature of perceptual representation—offers a critical testing ground. Yet the literature routinely conflates the content of representations (cue-based vs. category-based) with their granularity (continuous vs. discrete). Likewise, the well-known observation that incrementally varied stimuli often elicit graded behavioral responses, particularly when averaged across trials, is commonly taken as evidence for continuous internal representations. We challenge this assumption and synthesize the surrounding debate by introducing the Discrete Sampling (DS) framework, a novel theory under which listeners map continuous input into discrete, category-based internal states via a biologically plausible sampling procedure. We formalize a specific instantiation of DS computationally and demonstrate how it accounts for a wide range of core phenomena. We compare DS to a general class of continuous alternatives using data from 575 subjects across three experimental paradigms, with precise, differentiating predictions confirmed by the results. DS provides a single cognitive architecture for a parameter-independent derivation of binary and scalar categorization responses, concave reaction-time patterns centered on category boundaries, the joint modulation of categorization slope and processing speed by task demands and noise, and the distribution of inter-listener variability. We show how sampling from discrete categories can produce behavior traditionally taken to imply continuity, offering a unified reinterpretation of decades of evidence and reframing how uncertainty and apparent gradience are represented in perceptual and psychological systems more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Aims and Objectives/Purpose/Research Questions: This paper introduces the Supplemental Language Attrition Questionnaire (SLAQ), a standardized instrument that evaluates whether and to what extent an individual’s previously acquired language may have undergone attrition. Current language background questionnaires identify patterns of language acquisition and use but rarely include variables thought to influence attrition. We ask whether the SLAQ shows evidence of construct and incremental validity.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The SLAQ was developed through extensive review of attrition research and expert feedback. It collects self-report data about acquisition environment, peak proficiency, attitude, motivation, period of disuse, and current contact. This paper compares SLAQ responses to responses from two existing language background questionnaires and evaluates its reliability and validity.\nData and Analysis: Participants completed either the LHQ (n = 36) or LEAP-Q (n = 22) and the SLAQ. Twenty-seven participants reported attrition of at least one language. Quantitative SLAQ items were analyzed using polychoric correlation matrices, item–total correlations, and descriptive statistics.\nFindings/Conclusions: Results indicate that existing questionnaires fail to capture attrition, with more than half of the attrited languages not mentioned in LHQ/LEAP-Q responses. Additionally, SLAQ items demonstrated minimal overlap and strong internal consistency. Thus, the SLAQ provides a comprehensive account of language experience that is tailored to attrition contexts.\nOriginality: This is the first validated background instrument for language attrition. Its branching design and short average completion time (7.7 minutes) make the SLAQ an unobtrusive addition to multilingualism research designs.\nSignificance/Implications: The SLAQ offers a standardized method for evaluating attrition, which contributes to cross-study comparability, improves participant classification, and supports more accurate models of multilingual experience. Its adoption has the potential to strengthen research on attrition, bilingualism, and language assessment practices.",

Psychological factors were more strongly perceived to be effects than causes, and were perceived to be causally influenced by both biological and social factors. Stronger between-category than within-category causes reveal a contrast between lay perceptions and network approaches to mental health symptoms, which typically emphasise connections between psychological factors independent of biological and social causes. Overall, we conclude that this sample appreciate the complex interplay between adverse biopsychosocial factors, but primarily view this as operating from biological and social factors to psychological outcomes.",

Despite growing prevalence, little is known about episode-level patterns of use and impairment prior to driving. This study examined detailed features of recent and heaviest CID episodes to better understand high-risk driving contexts.\nMethod: Participants were 149 emerging adult cannabis users (ages 18–29) reporting ≥3 instances of driving after cannabis use in the past three months. Event-level data were collected via retrospective self-report of the most recent and heaviest CID occasions. Participants reported method of use, amount consumed, wait time before driving, subjective intoxication, driving distance, alcohol co-use, and presence of passengers. Paired-sample t-tests examined within-person differences between episodes.\nResults: Over 60% reported actively using cannabis while driving, and more than one-third reported driving after simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use. Passengers were present in 46% of most recent driving episodes and 35% of heaviest driving episodes. Subjective intoxication ratings were significantly higher during heaviest episodes (M = 6.96) compared to most recent episodes (M = 4.71, p &lt; .001), yet wait time before driving and distance driven did not differ.\nConclusions: Findings highlight high-risk contexts in CID, including simultaneous substance use and driving while intoxicated, often with passengers present. Event-level analysis offers a nuanced understanding of CID behaviors and underscores the need for prevention strategies that address situational risk factors.",

          "abstract": "Scalar implicatures (SIs) such as the inference from “some” to “but not all” are known to vary in processing cost. According to the Polarity Hypothesis (van Tiel et al., 2019; van Tiel and Pankratz, 2021), this cost depends on the polarity of the scalar term: SIs from positively polar expressions (e.g., “some”) are expected to be slower to compute than literal interpretations, while the reverse should hold for SIs from negatively polar expressions (e.g., the inference from “not all” to “but some”). We tested this prediction in a sentence--picture verification experiment with 538 English-speaking participants. Each participant judged whether sentences containing weak or strong scalar terms matched a corresponding picture, allowing us to measure response times as an index of processing effort. While our omnibus analysis found no reliable response–polarity–condition interaction, scale-specific analyses revealed mixed results: One pair of scales showed the predicted interaction, one showed a reversed effect, and two showed no effect. A meta-analysis combining our data with prior studies yielded moderate support for the Polarity Hypothesis. We conclude that polarity may influence the speed of scalar implicature processing, but that this effect is not robust across all scalar domains.",

          "abstract": "When using tests to assess individuals, precision of individual test scores is of great importance. Although it is generally known that different test scores are measured with varying precision, traditionally, measurement precision is quantified using a single value known as the standard error of measurement (SEM). In the practice of testing, the SEM is used as a one-size-fits-all measure for each test score. This practice emphasizes the need for a score-related precision estimate that shows which scores are precise and which scores lack precision. We discuss several score-related precision estimates based on classical test theory and item response theory, and provide open-source statistical software included in JASP that enables computation of these estimates. Using score-related precision estimates, decisions based on test scores are expected to show less bias than the common score-unrelated SEM.",

Numerous published studies have found that stereotype threat might lower mathematics test performance among women.

This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender.

A significant amount of VR research has been conducted by psychologists examining a variety of topics such as developing unique VR experiences for gaming and cinema, investigating social interactions in virtual environments, and how VR impacts cognition and perception. Previous research has aptly focused on the effects of VR use, but no studies have examined the foundational aspects of VR adoption by providing a comprehensive demographic overview. In this research we aspire to provide a nuanced understanding of the current landscape of VR users, thereby laying the groundwork for more contextually relevant and impactful investigations utilizing virtual reality. Across two studies, we recruited hundreds of VR users in Canada, The United States, and the United Kingdom to assess their demographic backgrounds (Sample A N = 638, Sample B N = 642). Males and females had similar response patterns regarding their VR experiences and participants reported using VR in a variety of contexts, such as solitarily or with friends or family. Participants from Sample A, who owned VR headsets, generally had longer and more enjoyable VR experiences than those in Sample B, with a notable finding that feelings of novelty persisted even with frequent VR use and headset ownership. The current research highlights several demographic indicators that are important to consider for sample selection or potentially controlled for in future VR research.",

Numerous studies focus on electrodermal activity, which is easy to measure and can provide important insight on the relationship between pain and arousal through the quantification of skin-conductance response (SCR). Despite SCR’s value, there is no standard way to quantify SCR in response to noxious stimulation, and conclusions may vary depending on analytic approaches. We used a multiverse analysis to evaluate associations between SCR and pain across 8 studies of thermal pain (total n = 567). For each dataset, SCRs were quantified using five common analysis approaches (preprocessing only; manual scoring; automated scoring; model-based analysis; physiological pain classifier), leading to 18 distinct SCR measures. Associations with pain and temperature were strongest when automated scoring was combined with manual artifact detection, regardless of model comparison approach, study type, and whether pain was rated continuously or categorically. More specifically, Bayesian and model-based comparisons revealed the strongest associations with pain when the software Ledalab quantified the sum of amplitudes on each trial and we excluded trials with artifacts. We apply these findings across datasets both with and without psychological interventions to show that subjective pain statistically mediates associations between temperature and heat-evoked SCR, and that SCR is modulated by pain- predictive cues regardless of verbal instruction. This work advances a simple analysis pipeline that can be adopted in future pain studies to improve efficiency and reproducibility and aid the development of objective pain biomarkers.",

          "abstract": "Working parents constitute a substantial segment of the workforce. Nevertheless, misconceptions surrounding how parental role impacts working parents, particularly working mothers, have perpetuated stigma and workplace discrimination. To better understand the contributions of parents in professional contexts, we developed the construct of family-centered symbolic meaning of work (FCSMW), which captures individuals’ cognitive orientation to construe work meaning through its symbolic relevance to family. Specifically, it refers to individuals’ perception of their work as a vehicle for expressing their professional ethics and principles to their family and serving as role models. We then draw upon self-construal theory to theorize that, in comparison to non-parents, working parents are more likely to develop higher FCSMW. We further posit that the positive association between parental status and FCSMW is more pronounced for women than for men. Additionally, we argue that FCSMW positively correlates with employees’ display of exemplary behaviors at work, such as increased work effort and organizational citizenship behavior. Finally, we propose that the indirect effects of parental status on work outcomes via FCSMW are stronger for women than men. To assess our proposed model, we first developed and validated a scale for measuring FCSMW. We then tested our hypotheses using three sets of data: two multi source, field samples from China and one field sample from the U.S., all of which supported our hypotheses.",

Coding open-ended vignette responses indicated that adolescents’ explanations for social inequities are multifaceted, mixed, and interlinked. The vignette-based measure demonstrated reliability and validity, i.e., expected relations with quantitative CC scales. Those with more books in the household and girls (vs. boys) demonstrated more integratively complex attributions for social inequities, with the latter also providing more structural attributions. The findings underline the potential of vignettes to capture the complexities and nuances of adolescents’ critical reflection on social inequities.",

          "abstract": "Autism diagnoses among adults have risen markedly over the past decade, with women increasingly identified later in life. Many autistic women remain undiagnosed until mid-late adulthood due to gendered diagnostic biases, camouflaging behaviours, and internalised coping strategies. Although existing research highlights grief and relief following diagnosis, little is known about how these emotions coexist and evolve over time. This study explores how autistic women diagnosed in mid-late adulthood make sense of their diagnosis and navigate the ‘in-between space' receiving an autism diagnosis and beyond. \nUsing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), semi-structured interviews were conducted with five (n =5) autistic women aged 38–76 years who received a clinical autism diagnosis after age 30. The first author, a late-diagnosed autistic researcher, adopted a reflexive, lived-experience approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and first analysed ideographically, generating individuals’ Personal Experiential Themes, and then at a sample level to obtain Group Experiential Themes. Three sample-level themes were identified: Identity Grief and Missed Opportunities, Relief as Permission and Empowerment, and Living in the Liminal Space. Participants described profound grief for lost or misunderstood identities alongside significant relief through validation and self-understanding. These emotions were not sequential but coexisted dynamically, reflecting an enduring state of liminality - a simultaneous experience of loss and liberation persisting years after diagnosis. Receiving an autism diagnosis in mid-late adulthood may create a sustained liminal identity state in which grief and relief coexist as interdependent processes rather than stages of adjustment. Post-diagnostic support should recognise this enduring complexity, validating the coexistence of contradictory emotions as a normal and meaningful part of identity reconstruction rather than a failure to adapt to an autism diagnosis.",

          "abstract": "Bias-based bullying describes bullying behavior in an intergroup context in which someone is bullied because of their membership of a particular group. This constitutes a significant health concern for children with socially devalued identities, characteristics, and attributes. Compared to interpersonal bullying, bias-based bullying is driven by processes of stigma and, therefore, strategies focusing on stigma reduction need to be incorporated in intervention development. Chapter 21 aims to support intervention developers, policymakers, school personnel, and other professionals by providing an overview of evidence-based behavior change methods, with examples of practical applications, for tackling bias-based bullying. The first part of the chapter explains bias-based bullying within the context of stigma theory. We utilize Bos et al.’s (2013) model of stigma as a framework to differentiate between public stigma, stigma-by-association, structural stigma, and self-stigma. A brief literature review illustrates how these stigma types apply to key actors involved in bias-based bullying in schools. We identify main determinants that facilitate or reduce bias-based bullying. Building on these determinants, the second part of the chapter presents an overview of relevant behavior change methods derived from stigma theory to address bias-based bullying. The chapter concludes with the recommendation that addressing bias-based bullying requires comprehensive stigma-focused interventions.",

Although the benefits of self-disclosure have been examined for three decades, several factors have been identified that may mediate its impact. The purpose of this study was to (a) conduct a systematic review of the literature on self-disclosure of stuttering, and (b) summarize the effects of self-disclosure to examine potential factors influencing its impact.\n\nMethod: A systematic review of studies examining self-disclosure of stuttering was conducted. Speaker- and observer-based outcome measures were examined with respect to six factors known or suspected to mediate the effects of self-disclosure: (1) gender of speaker/observer, (2) type of disclosure (i.e., apologetic, non-apologetic), (3) loci of disclosure, (4) age of speaker and/or observer, (5) frequency and/or severity of stuttering, and (6) familiarity with a person who stutters.\n\nResults: A total of 18 quantitative studies were included in the systematic review. Findings indicate an overall favorable impact of self-disclosure (15 of 18 studies [83.3%]). Non-apologetic self-disclosure statements, when included as a condition, were viewed more favorably than apologetic and/or no disclosure (12 of 13 studies [92.3%]). Gender effects varied across studies.  Loci, age, frequency/severity effects, and familiarity with a person who stutters were infrequently examined across studies.\n\nConclusions: Findings support incorporation of non-apologetic self-disclosure to mitigate stereotype threat in PWS.",

Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "authors": "Bence Bago; Zoe Alexandra Purcell",
          "abstract": "Collective climate action requires shared climate beliefs in line with the scientific consensus. However, climate discourse is flooded with fallacious information and people often fail to evaluate it correctly, accepting weak arguments and rejecting strong ones. Understanding these failures is critical for developing evidence-based interventions, yet it remains unclear whether they are driven by partisan identity protective tendencies, entrenched prior beliefs, or failures in logical reasoning. This opacity stems from a persistent empirical challenge: realistic climate argumentation inherently mixes these factors together, making it difficult to isolate their independent effects without sacrificing ecological validity. Across three preregistered studies (N = 3,000), we introduce a protocol that resolves this trade-off by orthogonally manipulating argument logicality and direction across realistic contexts. In neutral contexts, prior beliefs dominated judgments, with smaller effects of partisanship and logicality. Contrary to identity-protective accounts, embedding arguments in hostile partisan contexts did not increase partisan bias or impair logical reasoning. Instead, partisan attacks reduced reliance on prior beliefs, prompting participants to downgrade belief-consistent arguments. In a third study, minimal logic warnings—brief alerts indicating possible fallacies—enhanced discrimination between weak and strong arguments. These findings challenge single-factor accounts of climate argumentation, showing that argumentation is context sensitive and that this sensitivity can be exploited to improve climate argumentation by adding simple logic warnings that are effective, scalable, and politically neutral.",

Accurate saccadic targeting is crucial for efficient reading. This study examines whether children at the end of their first year at school target saccades toward the center of words, whether this behavior is influenced by reading proficiency, and whether children are able to rapidly adapt their eye movements to visual input.\nMethod: Seventy-four Russian-speaking first graders (37 girls and 37 boys; mean age = 7) read sentences composed of words of uniform (3, 4, or 5 letters) and nonuniform length (3-to-5 letters) while their eye movements were tracked. Children’s saccades and fixation locations were compared to a matched adult dataset from Parshina et al. (2024).\nResults: Results revealed that, unlike adults, children tended to land near the beginning of the word, with longer saccades and landing positions shifting slightly closer to the beginning of the word as word length increased. Children’s reading proficiency was associated with longer saccades and landing positions closer to the word center, suggesting that more fluent readers process words more efficiently, resembling adults. At the same time, children were able to quickly adapt their eye movements in uniform sentences. \nConclusion: These findings indicate that efficient saccadic targeting is shaped by reading experience rather than by maturation of the eye-movement system, and that at the end of their first year at school, children have not yet accumulated sufficient experience to fully resemble adult-like saccade targeting.",

At the group level, children have a 13% higher probability of making a mistake on trials following negative than positive feedback. However, children showed substantial individual differences: some demonstrated large adverse effects of negative feedback, others showed large favorable effects of positive feedback, and again others more moderate effects, effects in the opposite direction, or no effects.

          "abstract": "In this paper, I present 5 critiques of Self-Categorization Theory: (1) categorization into equivalence classes is neither sufficient nor necessary for perceiving groups as entities; (2) the boundary conditions on self-categorization (vs. categorization) are underspecified; (3) the person level is relatively underexamined; (4) meta-contrast is implausible as a basis for entity formation; and (5) comparative and correlational relations are overemphasized. I propose as resolutions to these critiques that: self-categorization is the categorization of intentional agents; persons and groups are holistic entities, perceptually triggered by cues to individual or collective intentionality, and cognitively represented as “conceptual atoms” with an associated object file; group phenomena have person equivalents and vice-versa; and relations between intentional entities and between intentional entities and their properties are represented propositionally in a “language of thought”. Taken together these resolutions result in an updated Self-Categorization Theory 2.0 (SCT2.0). I discuss this expanded theory in general terms, and then go into greater detail about the key mechanisms of salience, depersonalization, and prototypicality.

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322), participants evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while Study 2 (N = 451) examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found robust associations between values-similarity and friendship interest for openness and conservation values, with more limited effects for self-transcendence values and minimal effects for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

          "abstract": "Background: Genetic variants in family members may exert environmentally mediated indirect genetic effects on children’s attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits. We set out to quantify the indirect genetic effects of parents’ genotypes on children’s ADHD traits as measured in early and mid-childhood. \nMethods: We analyzed data from genotyped trios of children, mothers, and fathers of European ancestry from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) birth cohort. Child ADHD data were available for analytic subsamples of 12,374 trios at age 5 (children 50.5% male), and 12,714 trios at age 8 (children 50.9% male). We quantified direct genetic effects of children’s genotype and indirect effects of mothers’ and fathers’ genotypes on children’s ADHD traits at each age. \nResults: At age 5, maternal indirect genetic effects explained roughly twice as much variance in children’s ADHD traits as did child direct genetic effects. At age 8, maternal indirect genetic effects and child direct genetic effects explained roughly equal portions of variance in child ADHD traits. However, issues with power were evident throughout analyses and precluded confident interpretation of indirect genetic effects. \nConclusions: We find tentative evidence for heritable parental traits exerting environmental effects on child ADHD traits in early and mid-childhood, suggesting that maternal genotypes exert indirect effects on children’s traits after accounting for the direct effects of children’s own genotype. However, future studies with larger samples are needed to enable clear inferences on the importance of indirect genetic effects for children’s ADHD traits.",

In this preregistered study, the association between three types of parental lying (child-oriented, parent-oriented, instrumental) and parental psychological and behavioural control is explored using cross-sectional self-report data in 308 Dutch parents. Parents reported on lying behaviour to their own children and parental control strategies. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that instrumental, but not child-oriented or parent-oriented, lying was related to higher levels of behavioural control. Our findings suggest that instrumental lying is more common in parents with a more demanding and strict parenting style. Future research should shed light on the question of how parental instrumental lying relates to children’s behaviour and development and should further explore how different parental lie types relate to domains of parenting.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) has been linked to impaired mental health and academic functioning in young adults. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a 3-week mobile-based approach–avoidance task (AAT) training (PROTECTapp) for reducing PUI in university students. Method: Ninety-two participants (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated levels of PUI were randomized to the PROTECTapp intervention (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47). Primary outcomes were PUI severity and internet-related craving. Secondary outcomes included motivation to change, psychopathological symptoms and academic functioning. Participants were assessed at baseline and postintervention; the intervention group completed additional 3- and 12-week follow-ups. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated greater reductions in PUI following the PROTECTapp intervention compared to the waitlist (p = .003; d = -0.80, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.38]). No significant effects emerged for craving or broader psychological outcomes (ps &lt; .05), though favorable effects were observed on motivation to change (ambivalence: p = .020; d = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.17]; taking steps: p = .002; d = 0.45, [0.04, 0.87]). Satisfaction with the intervention was moderate (M = 18.32 of 32), and participants completed on average 35.52 training sessions. Adverse events were reported infrequent (7.1%). Conclusion: PROTECTapp is a promising mobile-based intervention to reduce PUI and enhance motivation to change in young adults. Its brevity, scalability, and safety profile highlight its potential as a low-threshold preventive or adjunctive intervention for young individuals at-risk.",

          "abstract": "The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.",

Study 1 used conceptual content analysis to identify common argument frames; Studies 2 and 3 experimentally tested their effects. Men found interpersonal ties arguments more persuasive than moral ones, but no more persuasive than economic arguments. Women, by contrast, evaluated persuasiveness based on their perceptions of men’s motivations, leading to a different and more complex pattern of responses. These findings underscore the importance of both argument framing and perceived ally motivation in shaping responses to workplace gender equality messaging aimed at men by men.",

          "authors": "Pavo Orepic; Ana Pinheiro",
          "abstract": "The self-voice plays a fundamental role in communication and identity, yet remains a relatively neglected topic in psychological science. As AI-generated and digitally manipulated voices become more common, understanding how individuals perceive and process their own voice is increasingly important. Disruptions in self-voice processing are implicated in several clinical conditions, including psychosis, autism, and personality disorders, highlighting the need for integrative models to explain self-voice across contexts. However, research faces two major challenges: a methodological one – replicating the bone-conducted acoustics that shape natural self-voice perception, and a conceptual one – a persistent bias toward treating the self-voice as purely auditory. To address these gaps, we propose a framework decomposing the self-voice into five interacting components: auditory, motor, memory, multisensory integration, and self-concept. We review the functional and neural basis of each component and suggest how they converge within distributed brain networks to support coherent self-voice processing. This integrative framework aims to advance theoretical and translational work by bridging psychology, neuroscience, clinical research, and voice technology in the context of emerging digital voice environments.",

          "abstract": "One-to-one face matching is widely used for identity verification yet becomes difficult with unfamiliar faces or when parts of the face are covered. We investigated whether observers could accurately verify identity from different non-overlapping facial fragments. Each stimulus of our novel face matching task had the appearance of a single face image as revealed through four circular ‘spotlights,’ one from each quadrant of the face. Observers judged whether the designated target spotlight (from image A) depicted the same identity as the three reference spotlights sampled from a different image (all from image B). Across three experiments, we examined observers’ matching performance for familiar and unfamiliar faces under Baseline (Experiment 1), Scrambled (Experiment 2), and Inverted (Experiment 3) spotlight arrangements. Observers’ accuracy reliably exceeded chance (proportion correct: 0.53–0.59), except when the faces were familiar and inverted. Accuracy was higher for familiar faces when the spotlights were presented in an upright orientation, but scrambling their spatial location and inverting them reversed this familiar face advantage. Notably, accuracy with the unfamiliar face spotlights significantly improved with inversion. These findings show that observers can make use of latent visual information distributed across different images and regions of the face to distinguish identities.",

However, existing theories suggest laypeople can be politically biased, and these political motives undermine accuracy. Alternatively, we propose that political and accuracy motives operate separately, and show theoretically that this implies that more politically motivated individuals may often be more accurate. We empirically assess this proposal using a survey study and field data from X’s Community Notes. As predicted, politically discordant false posts are flagged most often, and more politically motivated users flag more posts while exhibiting equal or higher flagging discernment (along with more political bias). These users also provision high-quality ratings without undermining system-level outcomes. Politically motivated individuals are integral to provisioning a high quantity and quality of crowdsourced fact-checks.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims: Online gambling operators collect detailed behavioural data that can be used to identify customers at risk of harmful gambling. This study examined the value of machine learning in this context. We compared models trained on 30 days versus six months of behavioural data and explored whether incorporating self-reported survey responses enhanced performance.\nMethods: Customers from two Australian sports and race betting sites (N=1,470) completed a survey including the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and measures of employment, income, gambling satisfaction, number of gambling accounts, and estimated past-30-day expenditure. Survey responses were matched to participants’ account data provided by operators. We built a series of machine learning models to classify participants into risk groups (PGSI 1-7 [no-to-moderate-risk] vs. PGSI ≥8 [high-risk]), comparing performance across data windows (30 days vs. six months), and with or without survey variables.\nResults: Models using only behavioural data achieved adequate classification accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUROC]=0.74–0.75), with similar performance across 30-day and six-month data windows. The most predictive account-based variables were age, deposit intensity (deposits per active day), average stake size, and days since last bet. Combining behavioural data with self-reported variables substantially enhanced performance (AUROC=0.76–0.85). Two self-reported variables—number of gambling accounts held and gambling satisfaction—were primarily responsible for improvements.\nConclusions: Machine learning models can effectively detect at-risk customers on online sports and race betting sites using only 30 days of behavioural data. Performance can be improved by adding minimal, non-intrusive self-report measures.",

          "abstract": "We present a polygenic score (PGS) for general cognitive ability (GCA) that demonstrates a substantial increase in predictive accuracy both among unrelated individuals and within-families relative to existing predictors. In the UK Biobank (UKB), our PGS achieves a standardized regression coefficient with fluid intelligence of β=0.406 (SE 0.009), corresponding to an R² of 16.4% (95% confidence interval: [15.1%, 17.9%]). In a sample of 4,642 sibling pairs from UKB, we estimate the standardized within-family effect of the PGS to be δ=0.355 (SE 0.0218), indicating only slight attenuation of prediction ability within-family (δ/β=0.876, SE 0.050). We obtain similar results in a sample of 736 9-10-year-old European ancestry sibling pairs from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. After correcting for the reliability of the UK Biobank and ABCD phenotypes, the inverse-variance-weighted within-family association of the PGS with latent general ability is estimated at 0.448 (SE 0.025). Our PGS predicts higher educational attainment, occupational status, and family income within families, and retains good performance in non-European ancestry samples, with the correlation retaining 64% of its magnitude in the African American subset of the ABCD cohort, in line with expectations. In UKB siblings, higher scores correlate with better self‑reported health and lower risk of multiple cardiometabolic diseases. Our study shows that it is possible to attain powerful within-family prediction of GCA using a PGS, enabling future research to clarify how cognitive ability influences health-related outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Arousal and wakefulness regulation (AWR) is increasingly recognised as a transdiagnostic mechanism underlying psychiatric disorders, including major depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania, and post-COVID syndromes. Despite its clinical relevance, no psychometrically robust self-report instrument exists to assess AWR. This article introduces the 14-item Arousal and Wakefulness Regulation Scale (AWRS), a self-report measure capturing behavioural correlates of neurobiological processes governing arousal and wakefulness.  The scale was developed and validated in two large, population-representative German samples (NStudy 1 = 432; NStudy 2 = 859, ages 18–67). Following systematic item generation informed by literature review, existing instruments and expert consultation, exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a dominant general factor (ωHg = 0.79) alongside three specific factors: (1) inner tension and exhaustion, (2) daytime AWR impairment and (3) nocturnal AWR impairment, with good model fit (χ²(63) = 434.53, p &lt; .001; CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.089). The AWRS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.92, ω = 0.95) and strong construct validity through substantial correlations with established measures of sleepiness, fatigue, depressive symptoms and rumination (r = 0.44 - 0.77). AWRS total scores ranged from 14 to 70 (M = 39.31, SD = 13.00) and were normally distributed. Younger adults reported significantly higher AWR scores than older adults, indicating greater dysregulation of arousal and wakefulness. The AWRS combines a psychometrically robust global score with domain-specific subscales, enabling rapid identification of specific AWR domains requiring targeted intervention.",

          "abstract": "Traditional measurement approaches assume that metacognitive features like perspective-taking, open-mindedness, or intellectual humility manifest as stable dispositions. Focusing on intellectual humility (IH)—recognizing the limits of one’s knowledge and fallibility—we proposed an alternative situated approach, testing it across diverse populations: English- and Spanish-speaking North Americans (N=633) and adults from 136 rural Honduran villages (N=2,567). Participants recalled three recent disagreements from their lives–one freely chosen, one where they were wrong, one where they were right—and reported specific epistemic behaviors (e.g., careful listening, considering others’ views) through binary-chained probes to avoid numeric rating scales. This method revealed coherence of the IH construct across cultures, while varying substantially across situations. Most variance (74-81%) occurred within (vs. between) people across situations: heightened when recalling being wrong versus right and, in Honduras, when disagreeing with higher-status partners. Situational effects also fully explained gender differences in the Honduran sample. The situated approach showed efficiency outside Western and educated contexts and helps overcome the humility paradox—when least intellectually humble overclaim their humility while more humble individuals underestimate it. We discuss how the methodological principles we apply here—focus on behavioral expression of target characteristics in specific situations (vs. self-reports of one’s abstract tendencies), sampling from actual experiences (vs. hypothetical scenarios), decomposing numerical scales into binary-chain prompts to increase accessibility across diverse populations, and explicitly modelling intra-individual variability—offers a framework for assessing other metacognitive and self-regulatory constructs across diverse populations, beyond abstract dispositional self-views dominating psychological literature.",

          "abstract": "Pointing fingers are among the most common hand gestures in early modern painting. Art historians have\nlong assumed that they directly guide the viewer’s gaze toward key elements. However, this assumption\nhas never been tested empirically. To investigate how depicted pointing gestures influence eye movements,\nwe digitally removed the pointed forefingers from 15 paintings (16th–17th century) and compared the perception\nof these edited versions with the originals. While pointing fingers attract few direct fixations, their\nfleeting perception significantly reshapes how other elements are viewed. Semantically related areas—such\nas the targets of pointing gestures and the faces of pointing characters—receive increased direct attention.\nAlso, our novel areas of interest dwell time correlation method reveals that viewers establish different semantic\nconnections between characters and objects when pointing gestures are present. In the second phase of the\nstudy, open-ended interviews revealed that interpretations of the original paintings differ from those of the\nedited versions. These results underscore the central role of depicted pointing gestures. They reshape the\nnarrative connections between elements, ultimately leading to different interpretations. Among all the artworks\nwe analyzed, Caravaggio’s and Raphael’s compositions were the most affected by the removal of\npointing gestures.

However, it remains unclear whether social support buffers the risk conferred by family history across a range of psychiatric conditions within a single, large cohort.\n\nMethods: We used data from the NIH All of Us Research Program (N=276,261; age M=56.97, SD=16.97; 61.4% female). Logistic regression analyses examined family history of disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar-disorder, schizophrenia), social support, and electronic health records.\n\nResults: Family history of a matched disorder was the strongest predictor for each diagnosis (ORs from 1.45 95% CI [1.41, 1.50] for depression to 2.69 95% CI [2.27, 3.16] for PTSD); significant cross-disorder effects supported a transdiagnostic model.

          "abstract": "As psychedelic use increases, understanding how demographic and behavioral factors influence the effects of psychedelics is essential for both research and public health. This cross-sectional retrospective study examined 365 people who currently use psilocybin, analyzing differences in acute experiences, psychological outcomes, and substance co-use patterns. Participants were categorized into young (18-25), middle-aged (26–54), and older (55-77) adults. Results showed that younger participants reported significantly more adverse experiences while older adults had milder effects. Despite differences in adverse experiences, age did not significantly impact mystical experiences, psychological insight, or psychological outcomes. Polysubstance use patterns also varied by age, as younger adults were more likely to co-use nicotine with psilocybin. Cannabis co-use specifically was associated with greater perceived improvements in quality of life, anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse, suggesting potential synergies between psilocybin and THC. These findings emphasize that age and cannabis co-use may modulate aspects of psilocybin’s acute effects and therapeutic outcomes. Given the increasing legalization and accessibility of psychedelics, future research should further investigate mechanisms underlying individual differences and assess the impact of polysubstance use with psychedelics.",

We combined manual annotation with natural language processing to identify and analyze individual memory details, categorized as either observable external experiences or subjective internal experiences. We found that internal experiences were more prone to omission and semantic distortion over time compared to external ones. However, those with higher emotional intensity and stronger semantic connections to external event features were more likely to be retained. Memories richer in internal experiences were also judged as more important, and semantically precise reinstatement of internal experiences across recalls predicted increased importance over time. Together, these findings show that although memories of internal thoughts and feelings are relatively fragile, they nonetheless play a meaningful role in shaping the subjective significance of autobiographical memory.",

          "abstract": "People often disagree when aesthetically evaluating the same scene.  Here we propose that aesthetic disagreements are caused in part by differences in visual attention.  We demonstrate this using a new method of ‘attentional transplants’.  In Experiment 1, 50 online ‘donors’ viewed scenes through a cursor-controlled window and rated how aesthetically pleasing each was.  100 new ‘recipients’ then viewed the same scenes through a window which passively replayed the viewing pattern of either the donor who liked the scene best, or the donor who liked it least.  Recipients gave substantially higher ratings to a scene when they saw it via the viewing pattern of the donor who liked (vs. disliked) the scene.  In subsequent experiments, we replicated this effect, and found that attention patterns which drive greater liking allow better prediction of upcoming visual information.  We conclude that disagreements in aesthetic preferences are partly caused by differences in how we attend.",

          "abstract": "When recalling events from the personal past, older adults typically produce fewer episodic details than younger adults. However, this pattern is often assessed in interview-style studies in which participants recall events to younger adult experimenters, raising the possibility that the older adults shape autobiographical recall to accommodate the knowledge of a younger listener. Here, we investigated this question by having younger (n=76) and older adults (n=80) initially recall personal events with no audience in mind, before recalling these again to target listeners who were either younger or older adults. Notably, when the listener was an older adult, there was no age-related episodic memory decline. Moreover, although both groups downshifted episodic details when recalling to a different-aged listener, older adults also varied the similarity across their retellings and incorporated more listener-specific information at recall, indicating greater flexibility. These findings demonstrate how the social context can mitigate memory changes across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Rationale: Loneliness is being increasingly recognised as a public health concern with serious adverse consequences. Given its prevalence, it is important to understand what kind of strategies are effective for reducing loneliness and for whom.\nObjective: This umbrella review provides a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of loneliness interventions to date, summarising evidence from 79 systematic reviews and meta-analyses. \nMethod: A systematic search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on loneliness interventions was conducted using PsychINFO and MEDLINE in November 2024. Only studies focusing specifically on loneliness were included. No exclusion criteria on target group, intervention type or study design were applied to get the broadest possible evidence base. \nResults: The evidence on the effectiveness of loneliness interventions is mixed, with some intervention types working better than others. In line with the existing literature, we find that psychological interventions show the strongest and most consistent effects in alleviating loneliness across population groups. Providing social support or promoting social connection also show some positive impact, though their effects are generally weaker than those of psychological approaches. Interestingly, multicomponent interventions yield consistently positive results across studies but have mostly been conducted with samples of older adults. A number of limitations of the existing literature were noted, including some methodological weaknesses as well as low geographical and demographic heterogeneity. \nPolicy implications: These findings enhance our understanding of which interventions to alleviate loneliness have the strongest potential and for whom, thus are of importance to policy-makers and practitioners focusing on this issue.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCannabis use is highly prevalent worldwide. Craving, a key feature of cannabis use disorder, drives continued and problematic cannabis use. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that people who use cannabis exhibit heightened neural reactivity during exposure to cannabis cues, which were associated with self-reported cannabis craving and use problems. However, to date, long-term changes in neural cannabis cue-reactivity have not yet been examined. \nMethods\nThe aim of this longitudinal study was to preliminairily investigate how neural cannabis cue-reactivity changes over time in adults who use cannabis regularly. Cannabis-related behavioral measures and neural reactivity to cannabis cues versus neutral cues were measured at baseline and 1-year follow-up in fourteen adults who use cannabis on a near-daily basis (age 22.4 ± 3.9 years, interval 367.1 ± 74.6 days) and sixteen non-using controls (age 22.2 ± 2.7 years, interval 353.8 ± 85.7 days). \nResults\nThe cannabis group exhibited significant reductions in neural cannabis cue-reactivity over time in default mode regions compared to controls, along with significant decreases in cannabis use disorder symptoms. Within the cannabis group, changes in cue-reactivity across default mode, frontal, visual, and limbic regions were associated with changes in self-reported cannabis craving, related problems, and withdrawal symptoms.\nConclusions\nLongitudinal reductions in neural cannabis-cue reactivity in the cannabis group track with improvements in cannabis use disorder symptoms. This suggests that neural cue-reactivity may be a meaningful biomarker of symptom change over time and could be used to monitor progress or treatment response in cannabis use disorder.",

Building on recent theories that emphasize the interdependence of fictional characters, this study introduces a network-based framework for explaining storytelling success. We conceptualize narratives as networks composed of characters and their interactions and apply large-scale computational analysis to over 10,000 novels and 1,000 movie screenplays. Across these two studies, structural features of the narrative character networks, including lower clustering, shorter path lengths, and higher modularity, explain greater popularity and audience ratings. These findings demonstrate that storytelling success is shaped by how characters are structurally connected and organized. By formalizing story architecture as a measurable network, we provide a scalable framework for advancing media entertainment theory, linking cognitive models of graph learning with the structural organization of stories at scale.",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions are becoming an increasingly important part of psychological care, especially as technology continues to shape how people communicate and access support. These tools can help individuals receive mental health support even when distance, stigma, or limited services make traditional therapy difficult to access. This narrative review summarises current evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions for conditions such as depression, anxiety, sleep problems, stress, and trauma. It also describes common intervention types, including internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT), mobile mental health apps, teletherapy, self-help programs, and AI-based conversational agents.\n\nResearch generally shows that guided iCBT and teletherapy can be as effective as in-person treatment for mild to moderate symptoms, while digital CBT for insomnia has some of the strongest clinical support. At the same time, challenges remain, including privacy concerns, high dropout rates, unequal access to technology, and the need for stronger scientific evaluation. The review highlights opportunities to improve digital mental health care, such as better integration with existing health systems, more cultural adaptation, and ethical frameworks for the use of artificial intelligence. With thoughtful development and responsible implementation, digital mental health interventions have the potential to expand access to effective support and improve global mental health outcomes.\n\nKeywords: digital mental health, iCBT, mental health apps, teletherapy, artificial intelligence, sleep, anxiety, depression, narrative review",

Caregivers with poor mental health were associated with greater child externalizing problems, and parenting stress was associated with problems across all categories (responsibility, internalizing, and externalizing).

          "abstract": "The ability to process visual objects as symbols is fundamental to the interpretation of depictions such as maps, graphs, diagrams, and animations. We outline a cognitive mechanism that may underlie the interpretation of depictions and present three eye-tracking and looking-time experiments (n = 192) indicating that this ability is already in place in 15-month-old infants. Experiment 1 showed that infants can assign arbitrary shapes (e.g., a triangle) to familiar discourse referents (e.g., a duck) based on labeling (e.g., “Look, a duck!”). Experiment 2 showed that infants do not generalize these mappings to a new speaker. This rules out the alternative hypothesis that infants interpret such labeling events literally. Experiment 3 revealed that infants are sensitive to the conceptual identity of the referent. After being told that one shape stands for an agent (e.g., a duck) and another for a object (e.g., a cup), infants distinguished congruent trials, in which the agent symbol moved towards the object symbol, from incongruent trials with the opposite movement pattern. This rules out the alternative hypothesis that infants interpret the labeling events as referential pacts. To our knowledge, this is the earliest evidence for a general symbol concept in infancy. This concept underlies the ability to use arbitrary objects to communicate and may constitute a foundational element of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "The feeling of psychological ownership, the belief that something belongs to you, strengthens both satisfaction and commitment in professional settings. Doctoral study often mirrors the demands and responsibilities of employment. However, it can differ in terms of its emphasis on self-directed work, extended timeframes of projects and, for many, a substantial personal stake in the outcomes. Such differences may critically shape the ways psychological ownership impacts PhD students. This study investigated two distinct targets of ownership among PhD students: ownership of the doctoral programme and ownership of the research. Participants were a sample of 127 PhD students (range 22-66, Mage = 34.39, SD = 9.53; males = 25, females = 100, prefer not to say = 2) recruited from 98 universities worldwide. They completed a survey measuring psychological ownership, programme satisfaction, and affective commitment at both the programme and research levels. At the programme level, belonging and control emerged as the strongest antecedents of ownership and satisfaction, while satisfaction was the primary predictor of commitment. In contrast, at the research level, ownership significantly predicted satisfaction, and ownership and satisfaction independently predicted commitment. These results suggest that ownership processes operate differently across collective (programme) and individual (research) contexts. That is, belonging and control are central for programme level satisfaction, whereas agency over one's research project directly supports satisfaction and commitment. The findings extend psychological ownership theory to doctoral education and underscore the value of fostering both programme belonging and research ownership as pathways to strengthen doctoral student satisfaction, motivation and retention.",

          "abstract": "Objects in scenes follow a hierarchical organization, with “scenes” at the top level, followed by “phrases —clusters of objects that share spatial and functional proximity. Within these phrases, “anchor” objects help predict the identity and location of smaller, dependent “local” objects. Previous research has shown that this hierarchy is reflected in the mental representations of objects in adults. The current study examined whether children’s object representations already reflect this hierarchy. We implemented an odd-one-out task with 36 object images to collect pairwise similarity ratings from children aged 5-10 years. Two different groups of children received different similarity judgment instructions: One group received no explicit definition of similarity, while the other was told to base similarity on actions typically performed with the objects. We created a priori and data-driven scene hierarchy measures to evaluate how well they aligned with children’s similarity judgments. Results showed that children’s representations were clearly structured at the scene level, as indicated by strong effects in both hierarchy measures. In contrast, we found no reliable phrase-level effects, and only a small data-driven object-type effect, suggesting that finer-grained relational structure is still emerging during this age period. Scene-level structure strengthened with age, whereas phrase- and object-type levels showed no age-related change. Importantly, similarity patterns were highly comparable across both tasks, suggesting that children’s object representations by default are action-based. These results suggest that children organize objects along the scene level of the hierarchy incorporating actions related to the objects in their representations, while finer-grained representations continue to develop throughout early childhood.",

          "abstract": "Adopted children are at higher risk of being exposed to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and consequently developing complex trauma. Abuse and neglect in early childhood have been shown to impact emotion regulation.  Given that cognitive processes underpin regulatory success, the extent of neurocognitive influence on emotion regulation is examined in a sample of forty-five adopted children (aged 6-12 years) with developmental trauma presentation. The children underwent a cognitive assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale – Fifth Edition (WISC-V), which measured general ability and cognitive proficiency. In addition, teachers rated the childrens’ emotion regulation within a classroom environment. A multilinear regression model revealed that lower cognitive proficiency was associated with more difficulties with emotion regulation. In an exploratory follow-up, findings suggested that only slower processing speed was associated with more difficulties with emotion regulation. Lower cognitive processing speed may be linked to changes in attention, as cognitive resources might be allocated to manage psychological distress or unpleasant internal experiences. Implications for school include recommendations, including the provision of psychoeducation to support staff with the understanding of learning and other needs of children who are adopted and present with developmental trauma, such as building positive relationships and creating safe environments. Moreover, teachers might consider amending instructions for children who present with processing difficulties provide them with strategies to support their individual learning and development of emotion regulation strategies.",

This misperception is seen as a major barrier to collective climate engagement, and correcting it is viewed as a way to boost action. However, little is known about whether pluralistic ignorance actually occurs regarding consequential behavior, what mechanisms underlie it, and whether correcting it changes actual behavior. Across five preregistered experiments (total N = 5,081), we replicated underestimation of broad support, but found that pluralistic ignorance reverses for rare, consequential behaviors: Participants overestimated the proportion of others donating or engaging politically for climate action. We further show that rational, general cognitive processes involved in estimating proportions can account for both under- and overestimations. Finally, correcting these misperceptions partly affected self-reported donation willingness, but not actual donations. These findings suggest that pluralistic ignorance in the climate domain may be more intricate and less consequential than previously thought.",

While spatial orientation is crucial for human survival and\n environmental navigation, the influence of early attachment relationships on spatial\n skills remains understudied.

Conversely, anxious-ambivalent attachment was expected to predict\n poorer navigation skills, as individuals may prioritize relationships over spatial\n engagement. Avoidant attachment was predicted to show minimal effects or potential\n advantages in autonomous spatial tasks, with anxiety mediating the attachment-spatial\n performance relationship.

Self-Reflective Resilience-Recovery Activity Promotion Training is an intervention that aims to improve coping efforts and recovery activity practice by asking EMS personnel to provide written responses to open-ended questions prompting reflection on these topics. The current study identifies linguistic patterns that characterize EMS personnel who did vs. did not experience mental health benefits in response to the intervention. \nMethod: We recruited 37 emergency medical service providers (95% White, 54% male) who completed the intervention for 8 days. We performed an N-gram analysis and a market basket analysis (techniques that identify word association rules) to find linguistic features differentiating personnel experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety symptom reductions (treatment-responders) vs. providers not experiencing reductions (treatment non-responders). For each group, we examined the most frequently occurring N-grams and the top 10 MBA based upon lift, support, and confidence metrics.\nResults: Treatment responders described a diverse set of coping strategies (e.g., “breaths-deep”, “management-anger”). Non-responders described a narrower set of strategies focused on self-restriction (e.g., “discipline-control”, “discipline-self”). \nConclusions: Findings suggest that modifying the intervention to encourage adoption of a broader array of coping responses might improve its efficacy.",

          "abstract": "This tutorial introduces and illustrates the estimation of Bayesian multilevel latent time series models with the R package `mlts`. We provide a conceptual overview of Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) for intensive longitudinal data, highlighting how it combines time series analysis, multilevel modeling, and latent variable approaches. Step-by-step guidance is given on specifying, estimating, and interpreting two-level vector autoregressive models using `mlts`. We illustrate modeling extensions provided in `mlts`, including multiple-indicator measurement models, between-person covariates, latent interaction effects, the handling of censored variables, and multiple-group models. Practical considerations such as data preparation, model diagnostics, and handling of varying measurement intervals are discussed. Assessment of model fit is provided via posterior predictive checks. By use of working examples with empricial data, we showcase how `mlts` enables flexible Bayesian DSEM analyses while avoiding the complexities of custom Stan programming. This tutorial aims to make advanced dynamic modeling of intensive longitudinal data more accessible to applied researchers across the behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Background: There is growing concern that smartphones and social media (S/SM) are disrupting adolescent sleep, wellbeing and cognition. However, there is a lack of causal evidence from robust S/SM interventions to inform actionable solutions.\n\nMethods: To assess the acceptability of a total 21-day S/SM detox we conducted a preregistered (https://osf.io/79zd2) pilot randomised control trial (RCT) with eighty-two 13-18-year-olds from UK schools. They were randomly assigned to: total S/SM ban (N=26), total S/SM ban with access to a “brick” phone (N=26) or a business-as-usual control (N=30). Pre-and post-intervention measures of sleep, wellbeing, and cognition were collected via surveys, wearables, and cognitive tasks.  \n\nResults: Retention was high, with 13% attrition across all groups. Ban conditions showed tentative improvements in sleep duration, sleepiness, depression, perceived stress, and working memory at 21-days post-intervention relative to the control group, however these changes were not maintained at a two-month follow-up. 50% of participants expressed mixed/negative feelings in open questions about their experiences of the ban, including boredom, functional reliance on smartphones, and “fear of missing out”; 83% nonetheless endorsed the need for government action, including restrictions, guidance and education.\n\nConclusions: Digital detoxes in adolescents appear feasible as a route to causal evidence and their potential to act as tools for promoting digital health should be examined. Nevertheless, complete abstinence can pose challenges such as functional reliance and reduced connection. Fully powered RCTs should ascertain whether more targeted interventions (e.g., limiting bed-time use) are as or more effective.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with nearly 5 billion users worldwide. Its ubiquity has sparked concerns about the potential effects on sleep, particularly among young people. Previous research has generally shown that greater social media engagement is associated with poorer sleep outcomes, such as later bedtimes and longer sleep onset latency. However, most evidence is cross-sectional, limiting causal claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal studies published in the last five years examining the impact of social media use on subsequent sleep in young people. In accordance with cross-sectional findings, the majority of studies (~70%) provide evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use, including at bedtime. However, methodological limitations, such as heavy reliance on self-reports and non-validated measures of social media use and sleep, restrict the strength of these conclusions. Future studies should employ validated measures and move beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how content, patterns of problematic use, and the timing of use influence sleep longitudinally. It will also be important to consider bidirectional pathways and interactions with other key variables such as neurodiversity, socioeconomic status and mental health.",

          "authors": "Kenzo Nera; Karen Douglas; Bertin; Olivier Klein",
          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are often viewed as a means to externally attribute ingroup sufferings by blaming them on the actions of powerful groups. Building on this assumption, we tested the hypothesis that the threat induced by facing an internal (vs. external) attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings would result in increased endorsement of an alternative, conspiracy attribution. We also examined how being confronted with an internal attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings impacts people’s sympathy for the author of a conspiracy attribution. In five preregistered experiments (Ntotal = 2,695), being confronted with an internal attribution for an ingroup’s sufferings did not increase the endorsement of conspiracy attributions (BF01 = 37.88, very strong evidence for the null), sympathy for the conspiracy advocate (BF01 = 4.38, some evidence for the null), or self-reported agreement with them (BF01 = 17.70, strong evidence for the null). A potential explanation for these results is the social stigma surrounding conspiracy beliefs – which may result in participants being reluctant to endorse conspiracy attributions. In contrast, stable propensities to internally attribute inequalities (political orientation in Study 1, meritocracy beliefs in Studies 2–3) were negatively associated with all three dependent variables.",

          "abstract": "Peer exclusion is linked to adverse outcomes, including reduced mood and unmet psychological needs. While the 2D Cyberball paradigm is widely used to simulate peer exclusion, its limited ecological validity has raised concerns. Therefore, this study compared the 2D Cyberball paradigm with a newly developed 3D Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm simulating peer exclusion in a classroom conversation.\nSeventy-six children (aged 8–12) and seventy-four adolescents (aged 13–16) participated in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Participants experienced both paradigms in two separate sessions. Mood and psychological needs were assessed before and after each paradigm. Moderator variables included paradigm features, social support, and previous rejection experiences. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted.\nBoth paradigms led to a decrease in positive mood and psychological needs and an increase in negative mood. However, stronger negative effects emerged after the 2D Cyberball paradigm. The 3D VR paradigm was perceived as more realistic and immersive, and its effects remained consistent across levels of the moderator variables, indicating robustness in responses. Adolescents showed stronger emotional and motivational reactions than children in the 3D VR condition, but not in the 2D Cyberball condition, suggesting greater developmental sensitivity of the immersive simulation.\nOverall, results confirm that the 3D VR paradigm effectively simulates peer exclusion while offering higher ecological validity than the 2D version. Although the 2D Cyberball paradigm elicited more intense negative effects, the 3D VR paradigm better captured naturalistic and age-related differences in peer exclusion experiences, thereby providing a more developmentally appropriate and ecologically valid research tool.",

Unlike music, which varies across cultures, musicality encompasses universal traits that enable engagement with music, even among non-musicians. This shift in research perspective, from studying music to studying musicality, is reflected in key works, such as The Origins of Music (Wallin et al., 2000) and The Origins of Musicality (Honing, 2018). While cross-cultural studies of music’s structural elements have yielded valuable insights, they remain limited in distinguishing the contributions of culture and biology. Investigating musicality directly allows for disentangling these influences and exploring shared traits with other species, providing a clearer understanding of the biological, cultural, and environmental foundations of the human capacity for music.",

          "abstract": "The divergence point analysis using bootstrapping (DPA-B) has become an increasingly popular approach for analysing visual world paradigm data.  However, several researcher degrees of freedom must be considered, and the impact of these decisions has not been systematically in-vestigated.  We examine the influence of five degrees of freedom: (1) region of interest size, (2) inclusion/exclusion of incorrectly answered trials, (3) bin size, (4) significance window length, and (5) bootstrap iteration number.  We illustrate these effects using two datasets collected from human participants. Because this data does not have a known divergence time, we additionally present a publicly available data simulator that allows users to specify a true divergence time, thus allowing us to more directly assess the impact of these degrees of freedom on DPA-B outcomes.  Across both empirical and simulated data, we found that bin size and significance window length exerted the strongest influence, with 50 ms bins and a 200 ms significance window length producing the most stable and interpretable results.  Additionally, we found that the DPA-B tends to overestimate divergence times; however, this bias was consistent across conditions, preserving its utility for cross condition comparisons. Based on our findings, we offer empirically grounded recommenda-tions for DPA-B implementation and emphasise the importance of transparent reporting, coupled with post-hoc flexibility tailored to individual datasets.  Together, these results provide practical guidance to improve the quality, reproducibility, and comparability of research employing DPA-B.",

          "abstract": "High prior knowledge facilitates learning of new related material by providing structures enhancing comprehension and facilitating recall. Previous studies examining the effects of prior knowledge used single-event stimuli while neglecting the repetitive nature of everyday experience and the potential of repetition to generate knowledge structures. In the current study, we used the repeated event paradigm to investigate the interaction between the effects of prior knowledge and repetition on event memory. In Experiment 1, we validated three sets of stimuli in which we manipulated prior knowledge. Participants viewed and later recalled four instances of a repeated event (e.g., four variations of a story). As predicted, participants recalled more correct details and rated their level of understanding higher for instances where prior knowledge was high than low. In Experiment 2, we extended the examination by comparing the effect of prior knowledge on recall of a single event and instances of a repeated event. We replicated findings from previous research (typically using high prior knowledge stimuli): participants recalled more correct details of a single event compared to the final instance of a repeated event, and contrary to our expectations, this pattern was consistent across prior knowledge conditions. Exploratory comparison of recall between the single event and the first instance of a repeated event showed a small and nonsignificant difference. Findings of this study inform us about the underlying processes that impact recall of instances of repeated events for different levels of prior knowledge.",

          "authors": "Abigail Bradshaw; Clare Press; Matthew H. Davis",
          "abstract": "Active inference is a domain-general theory of brain functioning which reconceptualizes the perception-action interface in terms of a common process of minimization of sensory prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013; Friston et al., 2010). Such accounts have been extensively applied to the control of manual action guided by visual sensory feedback; however, they have received relatively little explicit attention in speech motor control. This is despite speech providing a critical test-case, arguably being one of the most crucial and intricate of human sensorimotor functions. The application of active inference to speech motor control can allow crosspollination of decades of work from neighbouring disciplines, and could highlight where speech motor control mechanisms may be similar to, or differ from, those in other motor control domains, by establishing mechanistic explanation in common terms. We present here the first detailed description of an active inference framework of auditorily-guided speech production. We compare the architecture of active inference models to existing computational models of speech motor control, and describe an active inference account of how compensation and adaptation result from perturbations of auditory feedback. We highlight several unique aspects of active inference, as well as emerging hypotheses for future empirical work. In particular, active inference accounts emphasise a role for proprioception in speech motor learning, and offer the potential to model the effects of other voices on speech production in phenomena such as phonetic convergence.",

Nevertheless, civic identity is a major factor for explaining the support for liberal democracy. This article introduces an integrative model of civic identity (IMOCI). By synthesizing insights from personal and social identity theories, and identity as a complex dynamic system, we pose three testable propositions to sharpen the concept of civic identity – highlighting the role of developmental processes and content. The propositions are: (1) civic identity development is dynamic, (2) long-term development is rooted in short-term processes and accelerated by conscious or intentional processes, and (3) civic identity encompasses subjective personal and social contents. We conclude the article with discussing methodological elements that can be implemented in empirical studies to test the model’s propositions.",

Therefore, a systematic literature search was conducted in Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar for experiments testing interventions that could potentially reduce conspiracy beliefs. The present Bayesian three-level meta-analysis with 273 effect sizes from 56 samples (N = 27,996) provides the first comprehensive overview of factors affecting intervention effectiveness, including sample characteristics, intervention design and conspiracy belief features. Although the average intervention effect was small (g = 0.16, 95% CR [0.12, 0.20]), individual effect sizes exhibited substantial variability. Interventions adopting several evidence-based recommendations, such as fact-checking conspiracy claims, tailoring intervention content to specific beliefs and avoiding single-item measures of conspiracy beliefs, can potentially achieve effects exceeding g = 0.3. These findings advance theoretical models on the role of sender, message and recipient characteristics in combating harmful conspiracy beliefs. At the same time, extensive sensitivity analyses revealed that various bias sources might lead to under- or overestimation of certain effects. Furthermore, although study-level risk of bias scores (RoB 2 tool) were unrelated to intervention effectiveness, 82% of the available studies were at high risk of bias. The identified limitations and research gaps, such as the prevalence of underpowered studies and the scarcity of research on long-term intervention effects, provide clear directions for strengthening future intervention research.",

          "abstract": "Attentional flexibility, the ability to switch between external and internal information, is characterized by an internal shielding benefit, as reflected behaviorally by an asymmetric switch cost in the Switching Attention Task (SAT). However, besides internal shielding, other processes such as reconfiguration (i.e., a preparatory attentional component) might also contribute to attentional flexibility. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we ran three behavioral experiments based on the SAT and used a drift diffusion model (DDM) enabling to disentangle reconfiguration from shielding, which are reflected in the non-decision time and drift rate, respectively. In Experiment 1, we manipulated reconfiguration by varying the cue-stimulus interval (CSI; short, intermediate, or long). Internal shielding, which was visible only at the intermediate CSI, was impaired at both the short and long ones, suggesting that modulating preparation time affects internal shielding during attentional flexibility. In Experiments 2 and 3, we reduced the stimulus set size either proportionately or disproportionately for external and internal attention to vary working-memory load and hence internal shielding. With a proportionate reduction of the two set sizes, internal shielding decreased. Moreover, external attention showed enhanced shielding when a smaller set size was used for it compared to internal attention, whereas reconfiguration prevailed when internal attention was less heavily taxed compared to external attention. Together, these findings suggest that both reconfiguration and internal shielding contribute to attentional flexibility, but their weights vary depending on the strength of the competition between internal and external attention.",

          "abstract": "Digital media are pervasive and offer various short-term rewards, yet they may undermine the achievement of long-term goals by fostering procrastination—the irrational delay of intended tasks. Research documents that media users try to avoid procrastination through digital disconnection, the voluntary and temporary reduction of digital media use. We examine the effectiveness of such disconnection strategies. Combining theoretical perspectives on psychological processes of self-regulation and digital disconnection, our study investigates whether goal conflicts and trait self-control make using disconnection more likely and whether disconnection is in turn associated with less procrastination. In an experience sampling study with N = 237 young adult participants and T = 12,408 observations, we find that in situations in which participants experience stronger goal conflicts they are more likely to engage in digital disconnection and that individuals who experience higher goal conflict are more likely to disconnect. Additionally, those with higher trait self-control disconnected more. Most notably, disconnection was associated with lower procrastination on the within-person level: In situations with more disconnection, procrastination was lower. Exploratory analyses find that this effect also persisted to the following situation. Our results show that engaging in digital disconnection can be an effective self-regulatory strategy to reduce procrastination.",

Six speakers produced fifteen mimetic items across bilabial, alveolar, palatal, and dorsal places as singletons and geminates. Data was recorded using Electromagnetic Articulography. Analyses focused on intra-gestural timing, kinematics, and inter-gestural timing properties. Geminate production shows a modestly longer closing phase but a much longer plateau phase duration, with no difference in release phases. Dynamic Time Warping analyses also localize temporal expansion to the plateau. Kinematically, geminates exhibit greater constriction amplitude, reduced peak velocity, and lower stiffness. Inter-gesturally, vowel–to–target and vowel–to–vowel lags increase, leading to increased acoustic duration of preceding vowels, while vowel–to–closure lags remain stable. Linear Discriminant Analyses reveal that temporal cues outperform spatial ones in classification. Based on these findings, we propose possible phonological accounts, including a unified gestural account: a local prosodic temporal modulation ($\\mu_{T}$) prolongs activation, yielding plateau extension and emergent spatial strengthening, parsimoniously explaining gemination across articulators.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To examine how mindfulness, metacognition, resilience, and creativity influence psychological distress in young adults and test two alternative pathway models. \nMethods: Cross-sectional structural equation modelling (SEM) tested two models in N = 841 non-clinical young adults aged 18 to 30. Psychological distress was operationalised as a latent factor using anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and stress (PSS-10). Mindfulness facets (FFMQ), metacognition (MSAS-18), resilience (ER89), and creativity (RDCA) were modelled as predictors or mediators depending on the model. Fit was assessed with standard indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR).\nResults: The model in which metacognition, resilience, and creativity related to lower psychological distress indirectly via mindfulness facets showed better fit than the reversed ordering (R2 = .54). Acting with awareness (β = -.29), nonjudging (β = -.39), and nonreactivity (β = -.20) uniquely predicted lower distress; observing showed a small positive association (β = .08). Resilience showed both a direct effect and indirect associations via increased awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity. Metacognition showed indirect associations via increased awareness and nonreactivity. Creativity showed bivalent indirect associations: higher distress via increased observing and lower distress via nonreactivity.\nConclusions: In young adults, attitudinal mindfulness facets, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity, showed the most consistent links with lower distress and appeared to carry the effects of metacognition, resilience, and creativity. The dual pathway of creativity suggests context-sensitive implications for mental health intervention design. Findings support prioritising these facets alongside careful integration of metacognition, resilience, and creativity when designing prevention and therapeutic strategies for this population.",

          "abstract": "Violating linear regression assumptions, specifically homoskedasticity, can noticeably influence the validity of null hypothesis significance tests on regression coefficients. Commercial software like SPSS already includes many tests for assumption violations, and robust inference alternatives can be applied just as easily. Hence, it may seem reasonable to first test linear regression assumptions, and then, depending on the outcome, decide whether a robust inference method is used instead of the classical method that relies on assumptions being met. This simulation study evaluates the performance of such a two-step decision process in scenarios where neither, one, or both the homoskedasticity and normality assumptions are violated. Additionally, we assess the general performance of four inference methods (classical, HC4, pairs bootstrap and wild bootstrap) as well as tests of normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk, skewness, and z-kurtosis tests) and of homoskedasticity assumptions (Breusch-Pagan, Modified Breusch-Pagan, White’s, and the F-test) that are available in SPSS. We find that, if the goal is to generally detect deviations from normality, homoskedasticity, or a combination of both, the z-kurtosis test performs most consistently but has low power in small samples. Further, in small samples, we cannot recommend the typical two-step approach due to inflated type I error rates, whereas in large samples it provides no benefit over choosing a robust inference method without a prior assumption check. Thus, we can generally not recommend the typical two-step approach to inference in linear regression problems.",

          "abstract": "In the past decade, different computational models have been developed for face recognition. Despite their widespread use in cognitive neuroscience studies, it is not well understood whether their excellent recognition performance means that they “see” faces like humans do. Here, we collected a large dataset of human similarity judgments across a diverse set of faces, and shared it publicly. We examined whether state-of-the-art recognition models mimic how humans subjectively perceive faces. We observed that models with superior recognition ability often diverged from humans’ subjective similarity judgments, i.e., how they rated faces as similar or dissimilar to each other. Models with high, but not superior, recognition performance are often best aligned with these ratings. Although these models may not explicitly maintain the same similarity relations, we tested whether such information may still exist within them, potentially allowing them to be transformed into a more human-like form. Therefore, we computationally derived such a transformation function for each of the models. Models with superior recognition benefited the least from the transformation, suggesting a deep structural mismatch with human perception. Furthermore, the transformation generally reduced recognition performance, except in low-tier recognition models, where it slightly boosted their recognition ability instead. Overall, our results indicate that, in computational models, there exists a trade-off between the ability to recognize faces and their semblance to human-like perception. This may inform future work on developing more human-like computational models for face recognition.",

          "abstract": "Executive Functions (EFs) are higher-order cognitive skills that enable individuals to regulate impulses, retain information, filter out distractions, and shift attention in response to changing demands. Various measures have been developed to assess these functions in toddlers across different contexts. However, convergence between these measures has not yet been established. Nor has it been verified whether these measures work in similar ways amongst children more-likely to experience EF difficulties, such as children at elevated likelihood for autism or ADHD or already showing autistic traits. Here, we measure associations between performance-based scores (from a battery of 5 EF tasks), parent ratings of EFs using Early Executive Functions Questionnaire Cognitive EF (EEFQ-CEF) and emotion-regulation (EEFQ-Regulation) scores, and observer-report of Self-Regulation scores (Adapted Toddler Self-Regulation Assessment) in a neurodiverse sample of 110 toddlers aged 20 months. Additionally, we investigate whether these associations are moderated by likelihood of autism/ADHD, or elevated autistic traits. Correlational analyses reveal positive moderate associations between all scores, except for performance-based EF and EEFQ-Regulation (r=.01). Moderation analyses indicate the association between EEFQ-CEF and EEFQ-Regulation is stronger for children with low levels of autistic traits than those with high levels. No other associations were significantly moderated by autistic traits. These results demonstrate that toddler EF can be captured with moderate consistency across different evaluative contexts (parent-rating, child performance, and researcher observations) and populations (neurodivergent or neurotypical), and that (parent-reported) day-to-day emotion regulation does not link with performance on structured tasks, but is associated with day-to-day cognitive EF, particularly amongst neurotypical toddlers.",

          "abstract": "Background. Research on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often relies on nomothetic (group-level) data to infer idiographic (person-level) processes, limiting its clinical relevance. While idiographic studies do capture individual dynamics, they lack a theoretical framework that enables generalization beyond single cases. This study aimed at bridging this gap by operationalizing Ehlers and Clark’s cognitive model of PTSD within an idiographic network framework.\n\nMethod. In Study 1, a large simulation analysis determined the minimum data requirements for reliably testing model-derived hypotheses. Study 2 applied this approach to intensive longitudinal data from trauma-exposed individuals. Fifty-five participants (31 diagnosed with PTSD, 24 with clinical-level symptoms) provided personalized items reflecting higher-order components of the model—negative appraisals, trauma memory, triggers, sense of current threat, and maladaptive strategies. A subsample of 41 individuals (23 diagnosed, 18 clinical-level symptoms) completed a 3-week Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), yielding 2,594 observations (M=63.2 ± 32.1 per participant over 22.8 ± 10.6 days). We applied various nested network algorithms to explore dynamic PTSD mechanisms.\n\nResults. We found strong empirical support for the Cognitive Model’s core assumptions, particularly the central role of sense of current threat and its robust associations with trauma memory, negative appraisals, matching triggers, and maladaptive strategies. Cluster analyses of individual networks revealed four common PTSD formulation profiles: threat reactivity, cognitive, re-experiencing, and trigger-threat subtype.\n\nConclusions. These findings demonstrate how idiographic network analysis can extend beyond single-case formulations to identify reproducible clinical patterns. Integrating theoretically grounded constructs with individualized data collection offers a scalable path toward bridging research and practice in PTSD.",

Nature-based Programmes (NbPs) are increasingly promoted as alternative or supplementary interventions for Mental Health and Wellbeing (MHWB), but evidence in secondary schools is under-explored. \n\nAim: In this scoping review, we map existing NbPs in secondary school contexts; identify reported outcomes for mental health, wellbeing, and learning; and assess evidence quality for NbPs in secondary-school provision. \n\nMethods: We followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines (protocol: https://osf.io/qczas), searching five databases and the grey literature. Eligible studies reported school-based NbPs for students aged 10–18. The review process included screening, data extraction, and appraisal (using MMAT), and was co-produced with policymakers, educators, and young people. \n\nResults: From 17,723 records, 22 studies were included. NbPs encompassed school gardening, outdoor education, conservation, forest pedagogy, recreation in nature, and passive nature engagements. Most NbPs were delivered weekly on school grounds or in local greenspaces. Reported MHWB outcomes included reduced anxiety and stress, improved self-esteem and resilience, enhanced prosocial behaviour and school connectedness, and enhanced nature connectedness. Evidence for academic outcomes was mixed, with modest gains in science engagement and arithmetic but little evidence of broader academic performance benefits. Overall study quality was moderate, with small samples, limited use of control groups, and heterogeneity in outcome metrics. \n\nConclusion: NbPs show promise for supporting adolescent MHWB in secondary schools, with school and nature connectedness emerging as potential mediators. However, evidence for cognitive and academic gains remains limited. In future, robust, UK-based Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) with standardised outcome measures are needed to assess efficacy of NbPs.",

          "abstract": "Reading requires the coordinated operation of perception, memory, and sequential decision-making under tight cognitive and temporal constraints. Yet a unified computational account explaining how these processes jointly shape eye movements and comprehension has remained elusive. Here we show that human reading behavior emerges from a resource-rational control mechanism in which readers allocate fixations to maximize expected gains in understanding while minimizing effort and time. We develop a hierarchical control model that formalizes reading as sequential information sampling under limited visual and memory resources. Implemented as a multi-level partially observable Markov decision process trained with deep reinforcement learning, the model links high-level comprehension with low-level eye-movement control within a single optimization framework. Across independent datasets and a new experiment involving time pressure, the model reproduces canonical behavioral patterns—including effects of word length, frequency, predictability, skipping, regressions, and coherence—while capturing adaptive changes in gaze and comprehension. These findings demonstrate that many canonical properties of reading arise from boundedly optimal information gathering and support a computationally unified account in which memory, perception, and control interact to guide intelligent behavior.",

Across two experiments, we investigated the roles of retrieval practice, motor enactment, and iconicity in American Sign Language (ASL) vocabulary learning among hearing adults, using both holistic and fine-grained phonological scoring. Critically, we observe a selective interaction between retrieval practice and enactment in the handshape dimension: testing improved handshape accuracy only when learners physically enacted the signs, suggesting that motorically complex articulators require the combined support of retrieval-based reinforcement and procedural motor rehearsal. In contrast, dimensions with lower motoric complexity (e.g., location, movement, orientation) showed additive or independent contributions of retrieval and enactment. Together, these findings show that retrieval practice extends to visual–manual language learning, but its effectiveness varies by phonological complexity and motor demands. The results highlight the importance of considering embodied processes in theories of retrieval-based learning and offer practical implications for optimizing sign language pedagogy.",

          "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a core feature of many personality disorders. Dozens of dispositional aggressiveness scales exist with their own idiosyncratic factor structures, but they can be distilled down into six factors: Relational, Angry, Violent, Retaliatory, Intimate, and Alcohol. Yet it remains unknown how this comprehensive factor structure might change or remain stable at relatively high levels of aggressiveness — knowledge with considerable relevance to the study of personality pathology. To examine this, I used factor mixture modeling on self-report data from 1,447 diverse undergraduates from a Minority Serving Institution, which combined the person-centered and variable centered approaches of profile and factor analyses. Analyses revealed three latent profiles that were initially characterized by high (~14% of sample), medium (~41%), or low (~45%) levels of all six aggressiveness factors. Looking at the profile-specific factor solutions, five of the six original factors re-emerged with considerable similarity across profiles. These factors exhibited profile-specific configurations and correlations that support a reactive-to-proactive shift, in which more aggressive profiles were characterized less by angry responses to provocation and more by antagonistic tendencies that were less contingent on environmental inputs.",

          "abstract": "We provide an historical perspective on the development, empirical support, and evolution of the behavioral disinhibition theory of addiction that has been a central aim of the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS). Conceived by David Lykken, the MTFS initiated a 35-year collaboration between Matt McGue and Bill Iacono, who together built the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (MCTFR). The behavioral disinhibition model posited that a heritable psychobiological liability expressed as the failure to conform to normative behavior and deficits in self-regulation underlies the co-occurrence, family transmission, and early onset of substance use problems and externalizing psychopathology. MCTFR longitudinal investigations spanning childhood through adulthood and twin, adoption, family, and genome-wide association studies support the genetic basis of behavioral disinhibition and its associations with numerous impulse control problems. Heritability of externalizing peaks in late adolescence, while there is consistent evidence for shared environmental influences on child antisocial behavior and early adolescent problem behaviors. Environmental adversity amplifies genetic vulnerability, driving an adolescent onset of substance use problems while behavioral disinhibition is key to their persistence. We also present an updated behavioral disinhibition model that spans childhood through young adulthood and report novel cotwin control analyses of 1382 twin pairs finding that heavy substance use has robust casual non-familial effects that contribute to greater antisocial behavior and a more disinhibited personality structure in adulthood. Genetic and shared environmental influences on behavioral disinhibition and the non-familial effects of heavy substance use create a system of person-environment transactions that maintain stable developmental trajectories and changes in adjustment across young adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Human time perception is highly flexible, shaped not only by sensory input but also by high-level cognitive influences. Among these, self-referential stimuli automatically capture attentional resources and are hypothesized to interfere with concurrent temporal processing. We investigated whether temporal expertise, developed through extensive musical training, provides a cognitive buffer against this interference. Using a temporal bisection task with novel visual and auditory stimuli arbitrarily associated with the self or another person, we compared trained and untrained participants (total N = 136). Our results showed that self-association selectively attenuates temporal precision only in the untrained group, while participants with extensive musical training maintained stable precision. Crucially, no effect on perceptual bias was observed in either condition. These results demonstrate that the temporal impact of high-level cognitive factors is not universal, confirming that extensive musical training confers robust resilience to top-down influences in duration perception.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have long debated the evolutionary functions of music and language. The Music and Social Bonding hypothesis proposes that music is particularly effective for strengthening cohesion in large groups because acoustic features that characterise song facilitate synchrony and promote social bonding. Ozaki and colleagues (2024) showed that singing exhibited a higher pitch, a slower temporal rate, and higher pitch stability, but their reliance on experienced musicians and a solo-singing format limited generalizability of their findings. This Registered Report compared singing with speaking within a single experimental paradigm, examining the relationship between group singing and conversation in Aotearoa New Zealand among 23 English-speaking participants. We analysed three acoustic features (pitch height, pitch stability, and temporal rate) and explored pre- and post-experiment changes in self-reported social bonding. Relative to conversation, singing showed higher pitch (d = 0.81, P = .0007, n=20), slower temporal rate (d = 1.14, P &lt; 1x10-9, n=20), and more stable pitch (d = 0.23, P = .006, n=20), replicating Ozaki et al.’s (2024) acoustic findings in a New Zealand English group context. Exploratory analyses suggested that social bonding increased more after singing (49% increase, n=8) than after conversation (26%, n=7) or lyric recitation (4%, n=8), though these results are tentative pending comparison with more global data. Our findings add support for acoustic and behavioral differences between song and speech, and highlight directions for future large-scale tests of the Music and Social Bonding hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Language processing relies on a distributed network of white-matter pathways connecting frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of cortex. While the arcuate fasciculus in the left hemisphere connecting the posterior inferior frontal gyrus to the posterior temporal cortex is considered universal across languages and modalities (i.e., spoken vs. signed), little is known about how other language-related pathways in both hemispheres adapt in deaf individuals who use a sign language. Here, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to characterize the macro- and microstructural properties of fiber pathways in the core and extended language network in 24 early deaf signers and a control group of 24 hearing non-signers. Automated fiber quantification revealed no macrostructural group differences in left-hemispheric pathways, including the canonical left arcuate fasciculus. In contrast, deaf signers manifested increased streamline counts in the right posterior arcuate fasciculus connecting posterior temporal and parietal regions. Moreover, microstructural group differences were observed in several right-hemispheric tracts, including the right arcuate and right superior longitudinal fasciculus, as well as bilateral uncinate fasciculus. These data suggest that most language-relevant left-hemispheric pathways develop in a similar fashion regardless of the modality of language use, while several right-hemispheric tracts exhibit structural alterations potentially reflecting modality-specific processing demands associated with sign language. In sum, our findings highlight the crucial role that right-hemispheric structures play in processing a visuo-spatial language and, at the same time, indicate that the typical development of left-hemispheric language-relevant pathways does not depend on acquiring and using a spoken language.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that frontline workers often discriminate based on race or ethnicity. However, citizens can also display discriminatory behavior—for instance, by requesting service only from workers of the same ethnic or religious background. This discrimination exercised by citizens towards frontline employees remains underexplored. Drawing on studies of citizen–state interactions, discrimination, and political ideology, we investigate when the public finds such requests acceptable. Using a vignette survey experiment with 2,067 Danish citizens, we find that language-based requests are seen as more acceptable than those based on religion. Political ideology significantly shapes these views: right-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from the ethnic majority, while left-leaning individuals are more accepting when the requester is from an ethnic minority. While these single-country findings may not generalize beyond one-to-one interactions characterized by high intimacy, they shed light on how ideology influences public attitudes toward ethnically motivated service preferences and highlight the need to further examine citizen-driven discrimination in public service settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The structure of causes of death has changed in low-mortality countries, with recent trends showing increasing cause diversity. However, most research overlooks that several conditions often contribute to the process leading to death.\nObjective: This paper develops a framework for studying cause-of-death diversity that accounts for multiple causes of death (MCoD).\nMethods: We introduce novel MCoD life tables to estimate cause diversity based on age-standardized metrics. Two dimensions of diversity are assessed: the average number of causes contributing to death and how diverse are these causes. For the latter dimension, two indexes derived from the Gini-Simpson index are proposed, each based on a different perception of the role of the contributing causes in the process leading to death. All metrics are decomposable and applied to data from Denmark, France, Spain and the U.S.\nResults: The results show increased cause diversity, both in terms of the average number of causes and how evenly deaths are distributed across groups of causes. MCoD yields higher diversity than the underlying causes of death (UCD), confirming that relying solely on UCD downplays the complexity of the mortality process. However, the increase over time in diversity is more modest\nwhen using MCoD compared to UCD. The main driver of increasing cause diversity is the decline in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system.\nContribution: This study offers a novel framework for analyzing cause diversity using MCoD. The proposed metrics are intuitive, life-table-based, and provide valuable insights into the growing complexity of the mortality process across countries.",

          "authors": "Yixiao Sun; David Matthew Markowitz; Yaotian Zhang; Cheng-Jun Wang",
          "abstract": "Inspired by the theoretical tension between Goffman’s frontstage self-presentation and McAdams’s narrative identity theory, this study investigated if politicians’ public social media personas are strategic performances or reflect an internalized identity predicting backstage political behavior. We examined this authenticity paradox via U.S. legislators’ dissent voting, linking the language in 3.26 million tweets from 680 U.S. House Representatives (115th–118th Congresses) to 1.32 million roll-call votes. We used different natural language processing and network analysis techniques to measure narrative (agency, communion) and social identities (partisan interaction, structural holes) with fixed-effects panel models to observe that frontstage narratives predict backstage actions. Both agency and communion on Twitter were significantly associated with more dissent voting. Social identity, particularly higher inter-party interaction and spanning inter-party structural holes (lower Burt’s constraint), also positively predicted dissent. Mediation analysis confirmed social identity factors as key mechanisms linking narrative identity to dissent behavior. These findings suggest politicians’ self-narratives are public narratives that help to internalize an identity, shaping a self-concept that drives identity-congruent political action.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become more common in K–12 settings, questions remain about whether AI competence can meaningfully support teachers’ psychological health. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, this study examined how teachers’ AI pedagogy efficacy relates to their instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, anxiety, and overall mental wellbeing. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 402 U.S. K-12 teachers, we employed hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test direct and indirect pathways. Regression analyses indicated that AI self-efficacy, instructional self-efficacy, engagement self-efficacy, workload, and anxiety all significantly predicted teacher wellbeing. The SEM revealed an indirect pathway in which AI pedagogy efficacy strengthened teachers’ self-efficacy, which in turn reduced perceived workload, lowered anxiety, and ultimately improved teacher mental wellbeing. Findings highlight the importance of building teachers’ AI competence. As AI becomes embedded in K-12 instructional practice, supporting teachers’ confidence in using these tools may serve as a valuable lever for improving teacher wellbeing.",

          "authors": "Huafeng Lu; Lei Zhang; Silvia Gullino; Miguel Hincapié Triviño",
          "abstract": "Digitalisation has transformed public transport services worldwide, yet disparities in access, skills, and outcomes continue to reinforce a digital divide in how citizens engage with these services. While previous studies have examined the digital divide in internet use and smart technologies, few have explored how these inequalities manifest in everyday interactions with digital public transport platforms. To this end, we investigated user experiences of public transport applications in Birmingham, whose digital inclusion is disproportionate to its status as a major urban and economic hub in the UK, by analysing 4,275 user reviews on public transport services collected from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store between 2016 and 2025. Using a mixed natural language processing (NLP) approach combining topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we identified key themes and emotional tones in user feedback. Results revealed three dominant topics: App Performance, Usability, and Service Satisfaction, each corresponding to the access, ability, and motivation dimensions of the digital divide. Sentiment analysis showed generally negative evaluations, particularly around technical access barriers and satisfaction issues. By integrating user-generated data with digital divide theory, these results provide novel empirical evidence of how inequalities in digital engagement persist within digital twin planning and smart city transport systems, and highlight the importance of inclusive digital design for equitable and sustainable mobility access.",

          "authors": "Justyna Ratkowska-Pasikowska",
          "abstract": "This article examines writing—specifically the researcher diary—as a method of embodied and affective knowing within a qualitative study of initiatory experiences in sensitive research contexts. Drawing on autoethnography, affect theory, and the hermeneutics of experience, I argue that writing functions not merely as a tool of documentation but as a pre-analytic epistemic practice through which meaning emerges in the relational space between researcher and participants. The article is grounded in a qualitative project exploring initiation as a biographical, educational, and existential process among three groups: individuals working in thanatopedagogy, people involved in sex work and embodied sexual practices, and adults seeking or experiencing spiritual initiation. Within this study, the researcher diary played a central role in capturing embodied reactions, affective tensions, silences, and somatic traces that precede formal interpretation. The analysis demonstrates that embodied epistemology—understood as knowledge arising through the body, emotion, and relational presence—is crucial in research involving death, sexuality, spirituality, and biographical thresholds. The findings reveal recurring narrative structures of initiation, including symbolic crossings, processes of transformation, and micro-initiations understood as subtle internal shifts. At the same time, the diary documents the researcher’s own transformation, showing that fieldwork becomes a shared initiatory space in which knowledge is co-created. Conceptualizing writing as an epistemic micro-ritual, the article shows that writing is not the final stage of research but an ongoing mode of inquiry that intertwines analysis with reflexivity, vulnerability, and ethical relationality. The study contributes to reflexive qualitative methodology by demonstrating how embodied writing practices support the production of situated, affective, and relational knowledge in sensitive research contexts.\n\nKeywords: embodied knowing, autoethnography, researcher’s journal, initiation, affective epistemology, sensitive research",

          "abstract": "Social groups are arenas for both cohesion and conflict. Whereas prevailing theories focus on how these processes unfold at the boundaries between groups, the authors focus on the tensions that emerge within groups and that give rise to uncivil discourse. They develop a novel theoretical account of its network-structural antecedents. In polarized online groups, they hypothesize that the greater the structural similarity between two individuals, the less likely they will be to direct uncivil language toward one another. They further argue that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of group polarization. Using a node embedding algorithm (i.e., node2vec) to derive an omnibus measure of interpersonal structural similarity, they find support for the theory using a dataset that encompasses more than 25 million comments made by over 1.7 million users in six polarized communities on Reddit. They discuss implications for research on intergroup animosity, group polarization, the measurement of structural similarity, and the interplay of structure and culture.",

This study investigates how the Dutch public evaluates such trade-offs in the context of a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to a representative sample of 1,045 respondents from the LISS panel, we examined preferences across six policy outcomes: mortality, lasting physical and mental injuries, postponed healthcare, social restrictions, and one-off tax payments. A latent class logit model identified four distinct preference profiles, revealing substantial heterogeneity in moral and economic reasoning. Two classes exhibited taboo trade-off aversion (TTOA) when values such as life or human dignity were traded against monetary costs. Respondents displaying TTOA emphasized solidarity and governmental responsibility, while cost-sensitive groups prioritized economic efficiency. These findings highlight that public acceptance of pandemic policies depends not only on effectiveness and cost but also on perceived moral legitimacy. Accounting for TTOA in economic evaluation can improve the ethical considerations and societal acceptability of future pandemic preparedness strategies.",

          "authors": "Mila Desi Anasanti",
          "abstract": "Indonesia, the world’s largest palm-oil producer, has undergone extensive forest conversion over the past two decades through forest-release policies and plantation licensing, particularly in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These land-use changes have degraded watershed buffering capacity and increased the frequency and severity of hydrological disasters for downstream communities. Yet such transformations are routinely obscured by political narratives that present palm oil as a green, pro-poor, and sovereign commodity, while dismissing concerns over deforestation as biased or misleading. Recent presidential claims that “palm oil is just trees that absorb CO₂” exemplify an emerging post-truth environmental discourse that equates plantations with forests and weakens climate commitments.\n\nThis article develops a political-ecology analysis of Indonesia’s palm-oil–disaster nexus by bringing together three conceptual lenses: (1) the political ecology of commodity frontiers and forest governance; (2) post-truth environmental politics and the strategic denial of ecological harm; and (3) disaster populism and crisis-time “governance by spectacle.” Drawing on validated secondary evidence on deforestation, licensing decisions, watershed degradation, and major flood events, complemented by NGO investigations, media reporting, and selected policy documents, the article employs a within-case interpretive design combining process tracing and discourse analysis.\n\nWe show how state–business coalitions facilitating forest conversion are legitimised through post-truth narratives, and how subsequent flood disasters become stages for personalised, mediatised food-aid spectacles that reinforce elite legitimacy while diverting attention from structural drivers of vulnerability. These findings suggest that Indonesia’s climate and disaster governance is increasingly organised around symbolic relief and denial rather than risk reduction and justice. Policy implications include re-evaluating forest-release permits in high-risk watersheds, clarifying legal definitions of “forest” versus “plantation,” improving data transparency, and de-personalising disaster relief within rights-based frameworks.",

          "abstract": "The two most notable Asian giants of the century are China and India. China's rapid ascent in South Asian nations in recent years has alarmed India’s dominance. Bangladesh is a sought-after partner for China due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal. Previously, India seemed to have a significant amount of control over Bangladesh. However, India's long-standing concerns about its power over Bangladesh have gradually been eroded by China's growing influence in the political, military, economic, and infrastructure spheres. The paper demonstrates the degree to which China has already surpassed India in Bangladesh's key industries. It also determines if China's increasing influence in Bangladesh is weakening India’s image in South Asia by examining regional ramifications, repercussions for Bangladesh's foreign policy, and India-Bangladesh relations.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the role of amber in Russian culture during the reign of Anna Ioannovna (1730–1740), as well as the empress’s engagement in this process. Amber is presented as a material used in decorative art, an object of scientific research, and a potential collectible. An analysis of early to mid-18th century documents and publications suggests that Anna Ioannovna shared the interest in amber typical of many European aristocrats of that time; she also made some efforts to promote the development of the natural science amber collection at the Saint Petersburg Kunstkamera and of research into amber at the Academy of Sciences. The importance of archival documents for reconstructing the cultural and historical context of the formation of collections, identifying the sources and conditions of this process in the first decades of the 18th century in Russia, is justified. Special attention is paid to amber artworks that are typologically comparable with those now stored in Russian museum collections. The activities of scientists in the formation and scientific description of amber collections are shown using the example of a project submitted for consideration to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences by A. P. Volynsky, and the first popular science article on amber written by G. V. Richman. A document from the collection of the Russian State Historical Archive, titled “On the theft of amber items from the house of Anna Ioannovna”, which contains information on popular types of amber objects included in everyday life of Russian society, is introduced into scholarly discourse.",

          "abstract": "The paper examines the situation of growing attention to the practices of confession, which took place at the turn of the 10th–11th centuries and which lasted until the end of the 12th century. The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the statements by representatives of the Middle Byzantine canonical thought and discover methods (concepts, categories, hierarchical systems) by which they integrated the phenomenon of secret confession into a complex system of relationships in Byzantine society, and to evaluate their compatibility with the discourse of the time. The article consists of two parts which trace the situation during the 11th and 12th centuries, respectively. Each of these is further divided into two sections: in the first one the positions of the main authors of the period are described, while in the second they are analyzed and provided with historical contextualization. Part One compares historical narratives concerning the development of the institution of confession developed by three authors: St. Symeon the New Theologian, Patriarch John IV the Oxite of Antioch, and ex-chartophylax Nicephorus. It turns out that all three see the situation in a similar way, although they differ in their evaluation of it. The juxtaposition of these stories and their historical context allows us to conclude that the interests of the state and church authorities coincided on the issue of regulating confessional practices. This part serves as context for the subsequent assessment of the views of 12th-century authors. Part Two of the article describes and examines the phenomenon of a significant increase of the occurrence of the concept of “power” (ἐξουσία) in texts containing reflections on confession. The positions of key 12th-century church canonists are analyzed: Alexius Aristinus, John Zonaras, Theodore Balsamon, and Anonymous, the author of an unpublished commentary on Nomocanon contained in the Codex Sinaiticus 1117. Their ideas about how the “power to bind and loose” arises, exists, and is transmitted in the Church are reconstructed. The correlation of these ideas with the discussions of the 11th century allows us to assert that although Balsamon’s model was the most detailed, it also turned out to be the least organic to the views of its time, which predetermined its fate. In conclusion, a connection is made with the subsequent late Byzantine period, in which the ideas of the previous time were partly adopted and partly abandoned.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Nikolay Konstantinovich Antonov",
          "abstract": "The article continues the study of the principles of constructing the image of a priest in late Antiquity using the example of the “Apology” by St. Gregory the Theologian. It is demonstrated that the literary image of a priest is constructed by using images of other bearers of authority and is thought of as one of them: Gregory uses the topoi and vocabulary of political literature. The key image is that of the Platonic philosopher-ruler, as well as vocabulary from the monarchical rather than democratic tradition. The origin and tradition of using the formula “the art of arts and the science of sciences” (τέχνη τεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἐπιστημῶν), by which the author defines the priesthood, is studied. It is shown that in this way Gregory puts the priest in the place of the philosopher of the Platonic tradition. This is confirmed by an analysis of allusions to Plato’s Gorgias, which contains images of two universal power roles: the rhetorician and the philosopher. The comparison of caring for the soul with medicine, which originates in this dialogue, is further developed by Gregory, who incorporates into it provisions of the Christian gospel and describes principles of spiritual counseling that have no precedent in earlier writings. In addition, the author combines the functions of a rhetorician and a priest in the described image, thus making him a comprehensive leader of the church space, conceptualized by analogy with the polis. In conclusion, a comparison is made with the image of Pythagoras as described by Iamblichus, who, like the priest, combines a political dimension (rule of a community) with a soteriological perspective through varied types of influence on the soul: through public speech, individual communication, example, and a cult. The comparison allows us to see that the priest and the local Church are thought of by Gregory not as a separate new political space with its own power structure, but as its metaphorical projection, universal in defining identity, but not denying the existing political institutions.",

          "abstract": "Education policy in transitional democracies is particularly vulnerable to politicization due to weak institutional safeguards, polarized political environments, and unstable policy continuity. This study examines the politicization of education reform in Georgia, analyzing how recently announced policy changes reflect broader patterns of political control rather than evidence-based educational development. Using qualitative policy analysis, the research focuses on government-announced reform proposals, official statements, and public discourse to assess how political priorities and ideological narratives are embedded in the reform agenda.\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the reform is shaped by centralized agenda-setting, ambiguous political concepts such as “university identity,” and governance mechanisms that increase state control over academic institutions. Proposed structural changes, including the reduction of schooling and degree durations, are shown to undermine Georgia’s alignment with the Bologna Process and restrict international academic mobility. Drawing comparative insights from the Russian precedent, the study highlights the risks of academic isolation and ideological capture associated with politically driven education reforms.\n\nThe findings suggest that the reform does not enhance educational quality or institutional autonomy but instead advances the politicization and centralization of the education system. By weakening academic freedom, marginalizing professional expertise, and distancing Georgia from European education standards, the reform poses significant risks to democratic development and European integration. The study concludes that safeguarding education policy from political interference is essential for democratic resilience in transitional democracies.",

          "authors": "Pier Luigi Sacco",
          "abstract": "The study of cognitive biases has dominated behavioral economics and cognitive psychology for nearly half a century, proposing a view of human cognition as systematically flawed. This chapter presents a fundamental reconceptualization of cognitive biases through the lens of ecological rationality and developmental plasticity. Building on Oeberst and Imhoff's (2023) insight that many biases reflect belief-consistent information processing, we argue that these phenomena may be better understood as instances of adaptive mismatch—situations where cognitive strategies that were adaptive in their original environmental context produce suboptimal results when applied in novel environments. Rather than viewing these mismatches as products of fixed, evolutionarily-designed modules, we propose that they emerge from the flexible reassembly of basic cognitive capabilities through cultural learning processes, as suggested by the cognitive gadgets approach. This framework integrates several theoretical perspectives: the reconceptualization of decision-making as continuous environmental navigation rather than discrete choice; understanding cognitive strategies as ecologically rational adaptations to environmental structure; viewing mismatches as informative signals within a vector field of potential adaptations; and analyzing heuristics through the lens of predictive processing. We provide concrete examples from empirical research that demonstrate how seemingly irrational behaviors can be understood as adaptive responses to specific environmental structures. Our synthesis offers a theoretical integration across multiple research traditions while suggesting new approaches to research methodology and policy intervention. This ecological perspective not only provides a more nuanced account of why cognitive \"biases\" persist but also suggests more effective approaches to education, decision support, and public policy that work with, rather than against, the ecological design of human cognition.",

          "abstract": "The newly introduced ‘sealing of public security violation records’ system under the revised Public Security Administration Punishment Law has sparked intense debate due to its implications for public safety expectations concerning highly sensitive activities such as drug-related offences, occupational access boundaries, and data governance risks. This paper refrains from making factual determinations regarding online allegations against any specific individuals or institutions. Instead, it adopts a ‘systemic security governance’ methodology to explore how the legislature can achieve risk containment, factual clarification, and institutional consolidation within the rule of law framework when significant societal doubts arise (including ‘indications of potential external undue influence during the legislative proposal stage’) and supporting regulations have yet to form a rigid closed-loop system. This paper proposes: guided by the normative benchmarks of scientific, democratic, and lawful legislation emphasised in Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, and framed by the risk management principles of coordinating people's security, political security, and institutional security as required by the overall national security outlook, the NPCSC should lawfully arrange for the temporary suspension of Article 136's key application provisions within a specified timeframe. concurrently initiating investigations into specific issues or specialised reviews. This would establish an auditable governance chain of ‘first contain risks, then investigate thoroughly, finally consolidate,’ thereby minimising systemic spillover costs to public safety, data security, and public trust without undermining institutional objectives.",

Facebook y YouTube emergieron como las plataformas dominantes para acceder a noticias, particularmente entre los grupos de mayor edad, mientras que TikTok mostró una tendencia predominante entre los jóvenes de 18 a 29 años. Estos resultados subrayan la complejidad y el dinamismo de los repertorios mediáticos de consumo de noticias en la era digital y la importancia de considerar los factores demográficos como variables clave en el contexto del Perú.",

          "authors": "Dariia Davydova; Emil Eldarovich Otakulov",
          "abstract": "This article analyzes the origin and development of the legend of Charlemagne’s journey to Jerusalem and Constantinople. Its roots lie in ninth-century Frankish historiography: authors transformed Charlemagne’s diplomatic exchanges with the East into a narrative centered on Caliph Harun al Rachid’s concession of jurisdiction over the holy sites in Jerusalem. The evolution of the Emperor’s image as an ecclesiastical benefactor and collector of relics further contributed to the legend, as sending ambassadors with gifts and meeting pilgrims were replaced by his independent pilgrimage to the Holy Land in search of Passion relics. Charlemagne’s acquisition of relics of the Passion became a politically significant symbol of the transfer of imperial dignity from the Greeks to the Franks, beginning with his imaginary journey to the East. As the idea of a crusading movement developed, the friendship between Harun and Charlemagne faded, and his pilgrimage assumed the characteristics of a military campaign imbued with crusading rhetoric. The sources recounting Charlemagne’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem were composed independently of one another, which precludes the possibility of a continuous development within a single tradition. However, in each case, the author’s perspective may have been shaped by a collective belief in the potential reality of such an occurrence, and adapted to specific contexts. Consequently, Charlemagne’s journey to the East and the liberation of Jerusalem came to be seen as part of a broader sequence of events, alongside emperor Heraclius’ victory over the Sasanian Empire and the First Crusade.\n\nВ статье рассматривается, как возникла и развивалась легенда о путешествии Карла Великого в Иерусалим и Константинополь. Ее истоки можно найти уже в каролингской историографии: авторы преобразовали упоминания о дипломатических отношениях с Востоком в передачу Гроба Господня франкскому императору. Становлению легенды также способствовало и развитие образа Карла как покровителя Церкви и собирателя реликвий, так как обмен послами и встречи паломников сменились его самостоятельным путешествием в Святую землю за реликвиями Страстей Господних. Перенос реликвий играл и важную политическую роль, символизируя преемственность империи на Западе. По мере развития идей крестоносного движения на Восток дружба Карла Великого с Харуном ар-Рашидом исчезла из истории, а его паломничество приобрело милитаристские мотивы в духе крестоносной риторики. Источники, повествующие о путешествии Карла Великого на Восток, были созданы обособленно друг от друга, что не позволяет утверждать о поступательном развитии этого сюжета в рамках единой традиции. Однако авторская позиция в каждом случае могла опираться на сформированное в народе представление о возможности такого события, отчего впоследствии этот сюжет даже вошел в историографию и встроился в череду исторических событий наряду с победой императора Ираклия над персами и Первым крестовым походом.",

          "abstract": "How do voting laws impact elections? We highlight how laws targeting a specific group of citizens can have weak effects on turnout and vote shares but substantial effects on policy platforms, thereby influencing substantive representation even if there are no observable effects on participation. To parse these effects, we analyze a model of electoral competition with endogenous turnout and targeted voting costs. Each party anticipates the direct effect of raising one side's voting costs: discouraging targeted citizens from voting. Consequently, both platforms shift towards the untargeted group. These platform adjustments mobilize targeted citizens and demobilize the untargeted, muting the net impact on turnout and vote shares—consistent with empirical evidence for small electoral effects. Policy effects, however, hurt targeted citizens and their aligned party. The targeted group's size amplifies these effects. Our results address party competition, participation, representation, and normative and empirical evaluations of voting laws.",

          "abstract": "Using Brazilian municipal audit reports, I construct an automated corruption index that combines a dictionary of audit irregularities with principal component analysis. The index validates strongly against independent human coders, explaining 71–73 % of the variation in hand-coded corruption counts in samples where coders themselves exhibit high agreement, and the results are robust within these validation samples. The index behaves as theory predicts, correlating with municipal characteristics that prior research links to corruption. Supervised learning alternatives yield nearly identical municipal rankings (R2=0.98), confirming that the dictionary approach captures the same underlying construct. The method scales to the full audit corpus and offers advantages over both manual coding and Large Language Models (LLMs) in transparency, cost, and long-run replicability.",

          "authors": "Jan Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Economic historians increasingly stress that Europe’s early modern economic growth cannot be explained by changes in production alone. Demand-based accounts, notably Jan de Vries’ “Industrious Revolution,” describe a shift toward a “New Luxury” of inventiveness and style, set against older views of consumption driven by emulation. This article argues that such dichotomies obscure the coexistence of Old Luxury (rank and emulation) and New Luxury (innovation and novelty). Their interplay, rather than their succession, expanded consumption by allowing rank to be reaffirmed through innovation. Textile pattern books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exemplify this process. Produced by commercially driven publishers and marketed to women, they diffused design trends while accommodating a hierarchy-oriented moral order. The analysis of prefaces and dedications reveals that a prestige of industriousness was central; yet this did not replace the prestige of noble birth, but rather made it possible to shift distinctions by redefining rank through labor. In this sense, social hierarchy did not stand in the way of innovation through producer–consumer interaction but was, in fact, constitutive of it. However, as the analysis shows, this expansion required design as a luxury based on the virtues of knowledge and labor.",

The findings of the study revealed that person deixis functioned as assertiveness and personal responsibility, spatial deixis served as scope of governance, time deixis performed the function of historical milestones and future commitments, discourse deixis signified references and transitions and social deixis expressed interpersonal relationships in the selected speeches respectively.

          "authors": "Marco Mele; Alberto Costantiello; Fabio Anobile; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper evaluates the structural, environmental, and climatic factors influencing carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector (CBE) in 27 European Union member states from 2005 to 2023. This analysis uses panel data from the World Bank and four econometric models—Random Effects, Fixed Effects, Dynamic Panel GMM, and Weighted Least Squares—coupled with machine learning and clustering to provide a robust analysis of emissions. The econometric models show that all models support a negative relationship between agriculture, forestry, and fishing value added (AFFV) and forest area (FRST), suggesting that a robust rural economy and substantial natural carbon sinks are accompanied by lower emissions in the building sector. On the other hand, water stress (WSTR), PM2.5 pollution, heating and cooling degree days, and nitrous oxide emissions (N2OP) are found to significantly, yet positively, affect CBE. Tests of diagnostic analyses support Fixed Effects and Weighted Least Squares models, whereas results from GMM models are limited by instrument validity violations. In machine learning analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models are found to be most diagnostic, with all performance metrics being improved, establishing a prominent role for coal electricity, water stress, agricultural intensities, and climatic factors. Subsequently, a solution with 10 clusters, selected using Bayesian Information Criteria and silhouettes, identified a set of environmental and economic characteristics based on differences between low- and high-emission groups. High-emitting groups result from agricultural intensification, pollution, and low energy efficiency, while low-emitting groups are associated with renewable energy, low pollution, and a favorable climate. This analysis, hence, presents a multifaceted assessment of building sector emissions, with climatic, structural, and energy transition patterns as driving factors for meeting decarbonization targets for the European Union.",

          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the investment opportunity cost, and that a GDP growth rate lower than the risk-free rate is actually negative. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of the risk and the risk-free rate that probably follows a blended normal distribution of Nie (2023).",

          "authors": "Kyle Siler; Philippe Vincent-Lamarre; Vincent Larivière",
          "abstract": "Predatory publishing – for-profit academic publishers and journals publishing academic articles with inadequate quality control – is a professional and societal problem in modern science. Due to their illegitimacy and unprofessionalism, predatory publishers and journals are seldom indexed by major journal bibliographic indices, such as Scopus or the Web of Science. This lack of indexed metadata makes analyzing the predatory publishing market difficult. To fill this gap, we collected journal metadata of corpuses of six probable predatory publishers, comprised of 310,924 articles. We also collected metadata of four other publishers of higher – but contested – legitimacy, to compare with metadata of 54 million articles indexed in the Web of Science. Our research pinpoints precise geographic, institutional and disciplinary sites where probable predatory publishing occurs. Scholars affiliated with developing countries and lower-status institutions disproportionately publish in probable predatory journals. However, since academically central countries and high-status institutions are prolific publishers, they provide much of the money and articles that support the predatory publishing market, even if predatory publishing is a proportionately smaller problem in privileged institutions. Predatory publishing is a worldwide problem, with varying niches and consequences in different institutions and countries. Inequalities in resources and scientific reward structures influence intellectual choices of scholars throughout the world, including propensities for knowingly or naively publishing articles in predatory journals. Research integrity is an emerging axis of stratification in contemporary science.",

          "authors": "Nihan Karagul",
          "abstract": "Natural disasters span political boundaries, yet their devastating impacts vary widely across political jurisdictions. I argue that this is because of the differences in political incentives to uphold regulations concerning disaster preparedness. Turkey’s 2023 earthquake provides a rare empirical window to observe the cumulative effects of otherwise hidden political incentives. Leveraging the quasi-random shock of the earthquake, I employ a spatial regression discontinuity design along municipal boundaries in the earthquake region. I treat long-term party rule as the treatment and neighborhood-level destruction as the outcome. The analysis shows that neighborhoods governed by the same municipal party for more than 25 years experienced approximately 20\\% less destruction than their adjacent, politically contested counterparts. These findings translate into substantially lower exposure of hundreds of residents to known disaster risks. The results demonstrate that electoral competition without institutional brakes can deteriorate long-term policy outcomes. My paper underscores the importance of sharing accountability with technocratic oversight in policy areas requiring sustained infrastructural investment, such as disaster preparedness.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Larger gaps in political engagement between individuals with high and low socioeconomic status (SES) are increasingly viewed as a threat to democratic quality. This paper investigates how such gaps in interpersonal political discussion have evolved in Western Europe over the last fifty years. While prior empirical work has often found these gaps to be stable, leading models of political behavior suggest they should have changed in response to rising economic inequality—though they differ on whether those changes were driven by increases or decreases in participation, and whether they were led by individuals at the top or bottom of the SES distribution. To evaluate these expectations, I analyze nearly one million survey responses from 843 Eurobarometer surveys conducted across 141 time points between 1973 and 2021. I find that SES gaps in political discussion followed an inverse quadratic trajectory: narrowing from the 1970s through the 1990s, and then widening again to levels comparable to those observed in the 1980s. Using Cross-Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) models, I identify economic inequality as the strongest predictor of this trend. Its effect, however, is negative—higher inequality is associated with narrower gaps in political discussion. The results also show that the evolution of these gaps was driven largely by shifts in political discussion among high-SES individuals, rather than disengagement among the less advantaged. Overall, the results do not suggest that economic inequality has driven increases in political discussion gaps. Instead, they point to the role that internet expansion and party fragmentation may have played in widening these gaps since the early 2000s.",

          "abstract": "The global games industry engages nearly three billion players, yet instrumental applications of\ngames for behavioral change, from gamification to serious games, demonstrate a puzzling\ninconsistency between short-term engagement and long-term outcomes. While these interventions\nconsistently generate initial enthusiasm, meta-analyses reveal that behavioral effects typically\ndiminish beyond three months, with changes rarely persisting after interventions conclude. This\npattern contrasts markedly with games' demonstrable cultural influence as evident in community\nformation, identity development, and sustained engagement over years or decades. We propose that\nthis discrepancy reflects fundamental theoretical inadequacies in how behavioral interventions\nconceptualize games' influence on human behavior.\nDrawing on converging evidence from cultural economics, computational neuroscience, cognitive\nscience, and game studies, we develop a framework that reconceptualizes gameplay as cultural\nmeaning-making rather than behavioral conditioning. The framework articulates how sustainable\nbehavioral transformation emerges through dynamic interactions between four interrelated\ndimensions: games as designed cultural artifacts, play as evolved behavioral disposition, gameplay\nas situated embodied experience, and re-play as reflective cultural practice. Situating this\nframework within active inference and free energy principle perspectives provides computational\nprecision to these meaning-making processes, whereas cognitive gadget theory illuminates how\nplay serves as a foundational environment for constructing distinctively human cognitive capacities.\nCentral to our analysis is what we term the ludic dilemma, a tension between play's intrinsically\nmotivated, autotelic nature and attempts to instrumentalize it for predetermined behavioral\noutcomes. We suggest that this tension helps explain the persistent failures of mechanistic\ninterventions while pointing toward alternative approaches that preserve play's essential qualities\nand enable behavioral transformation through extended cultural processes. The framework\ngenerates testable predictions about temporal dynamics, cross-cultural variations, and\ndevelopmental trajectories that distinguish cultural meaning-making accounts from mechanistic\nalternatives, with implications for an understanding of cultural learning, behavioral change\ninterventions, and human cognitive evolution.",

          "authors": "Sergio Galaz-García",
          "abstract": "How do historical events—emergent, intense, and collectively experienced instances of political contingency—generate sweeping bursts of political engagement immediately after they occur? Rational choice perspectives see this capacity as stemming from how events perform as purveyors of information for citizens with exogenous and invariant political identities. Available cultural approaches, by contrast, contend that events politicize by changing the meanings people use to navigate political life. Different as they are, both perspectives assume that events’ politicizing impact remains contained within the domain of political experience. But, since politics is rarely instantiated in everyday life, they cannot fully adequately explain how events generate sweeping political activation. I offer an alternative “spillover” approach to understanding how events produce immediate politicization. I argue that the locus of this influence is located events’ ability to generate semantic disruptions that allow political narratives to infiltrate the stories and identities that guide social action within social domains that have more routinary instantiation. I develop this argument by drawing on qualitative fieldwork conducted in São Paulo in the wake of the unexpectedly strong victory of right-wing extremist Jair Bolsonaro in the first round 2018 Brazilian presidential election. My observations in public spaces and moments of sociability between left-leaning citizens portray this moment as one characterized by “politicization without politics”. Bolsonaro’s surprising electoral showing intensified feelings of vulnerability, prompting political perceptual and behavioral shifts that were rooted in personal rather than explicitly personal domains of social experience. These spillovers to the personal domain produced an environment of political “engagement without action” where visible political behavior drastically decreased and political conversations and interactions in intimate places skyrocketed.",

Extending his insight into the political realm, we frame political social distance as the (dis)comfort citizens feel toward supporters of the party they would never vote for, as in-laws, friends, co-workers, or neighbors. Using original survey data from eight European democracies, we show that social trust consistently reduces distance toward political outgroups, while ideological orientation influences this disposition asymmetrically: respondents on the left exhibit higher political social distance than those on the right. Moreover, citizens who attach strong importance to democracy display greater distance toward opponents, a paradox we term democratic exclusivism, grounded in a moral rather than procedural conception of democracy.

          "authors": "Ruth Eva Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "Parental partnership dissolution appears to hamper educational outcomes among children, but the question of whether this association reflects a causal effect versus selection mechanisms remains contested. By triangulating two quasi-experimental approaches: Children-of-Twins design (CoT) and adoption design, this study assesses the educational penalties of parental partnership dissolution in Norway. Administrative population registers are used to identify adoptees and a matched sample of non-adopted peers. For the CoT-design, these data are linked to the Norwegian Twin Registry, which includes adult twin pairs and their offspring. Both analyses rely on child cohorts born between 1986 and 2006. The CoT-design compares educational outcomes of offspring of twins, exploiting variation in dissolution within and between twin pairs, while the adoption analysis compares the association in adoptees versus a matched sample of non-adopted peers. Two key educational outcomes are analyzed: grade point average (GPA) at the end of compulsory schooling and high school completion. Results from CoT analyses show that parental dissolution is negatively associated with both GPA and high school completion. Yet, the association attenuates once shared family background and genetic factors are accounted for. The adoption design similarly shows a negative association for both adoptees and non-adoptees, but the notably weaker association among adoptees indicates that genetic confounding partly underlies the observed link. Taken together, the findings suggest that parental separation exerts an adverse effect on children’s educational outcomes, while selection mechanisms also account for a non-trivial share of the association.",

          "authors": "Federica Bologna; Ian Lundberg; Matthew Wilkens",
          "abstract": "Stakeholders in the publishing industry observe strong gender homophily between authors and readers, but it is unclear what causes this alignment. One possible mechanism involves reader preferences for gendered characters – specifically, the largely untested hypothesis that men are less inclined to read books with women protagonists, while women are more willing to read stories featuring protagonists of any gender. This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character? Would women be more likely to read it if it featured a woman character? Our study provides new causal evidence on these questions in a well-powered study. Using a randomized survey experiment involving 3,000 participants, we isolate the causal effect of protagonist gender on reader preferences. Our findings reveal that the effect of character gender is close to zero. Contrary to popular belief, men’s reading preferences were unaffected by the gender of the protagonist. Women, on the other hand, displayed a slight preference for stories featuring women protagonists. These results challenge a subset of industry assumptions and reassure publishers and authors that books about women characters will not necessarily alienate readers.",

          "abstract": "How do epistemic cultures – as originally defined and reconstructed by Karin Knorr-Cetina (1999) – fuel expert controversies and contribute to lasting stale-mate situations in evidence-based regulatory disputes? Are there scientific cultures that transgress the epistemic dimension, e.g. in technosciences that combine an orientation towards better understanding with an ambition to intervene, control and create, or in so-called post-normal sciences (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1992) that combine an orientation towards better understanding with a mission to address societal problems? How do contemporary innovation regimes impact on scientific cultures and academic living spaces (Felt 2009)? These are the central questions I address in my ‘Rahmenschrift’ and the relating published texts.\nThe ‘Rahmenschrift’ starts with an outline of the initial introduction of the concept of ‘epistemic cultures’ within science and technology studies. It adds further approaches that became influential in our understanding of scientific cultures, like Becher’s (1989) investigation of ‘academic tribes and territories’, higher education research into campus cultures and academic socialisation processes or Lave and Wenger’s work on ‘communities of practice’ (Lave and Wenger 1991, Wenger 1999). This first part of the ‘Rahmenschrift’ ends with an overview of current scholarly discussions that focus on reconstructions of and critical reflections on change in epistemic cultures.\nIn the second part of the Rahmenschrift, I introduce my own engagement with the concept of epistemic cultures that goes back to my PhD project on disciplinary socialisation processes. I then move on to outline my reconstruction of ‘cultures of non-knowledge’ within expert controversies and explain how this research ignited my interest in more-than-epistemic cultures, namely techno-epistemic cultures and post-normal scientific cultures. In a short third part, I summarise the aspects that I see the most central for further developing our understanding of epistemic cultures and for applying this understanding to open questions in science and society.",

          "authors": "Mikolaj Szoltysek; Mateusz Grzyb; Bartosz Ogorek; Siegfried Gruber; J. David Hacker",
          "abstract": "This article revisits the Patriarchy Index (PI) a decade after its introduction, extending its scope to the United States around 1900 and situating it within the broader North Atlantic demographic regime. Using harmonized census microdata from IPUMS USA, NAPP, and Mosaic, we estimate PI values for the 1880 and 1910 U.S. censuses and compare them with contemporaneous European populations. The study provides the first systematic spatial mapping of family-based patriarchy in the United States, disaggregated by race and region, and identifies clusters and anomalies through spatial autocorrelation.\nResults show that U.S. counties at the turn of the twentieth century generally exhibited low levels of family patriarchy, with most values falling within the “low” range defined by earlier research. Yet beneath this pattern, significant internal variation emerges. Certain regions display PI values consistent with the Northwestern European model of weak family structure, while others—especially the South and West—register markedly higher scores, approaching those of Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Racial disaggregation reveals divergent trajectories: white households in parts of the South show moderately elevated PI values, whereas Black households tend to display lower scores, underscoring distinct family-driven gender dynamics.\nBy 1910, the overall trajectory was one of depatriarchalization, with high-PI zones retreating and low values consolidating across most regions. These findings complicate the assumption that the Northwestern European model was simply transplanted into the United States. American regional profiles position themselves between the lower tails of Eastern European values and those of Ireland and Central Europe, while remaining distinct from the “core” North Atlantic populations. Rather than a straightforward transatlantic transfer, the U.S. family system appears as a composite formation: selectively receptive to Northwestern European norms in some regions, while retaining or intensifying patriarchal structures in others.\nThe study underscores both the utility and the limitations of the PI framework. While effective in capturing family-based patriarchal structures in the period under investigation, the index becomes relatively insensitive once very low levels are reached and may not adequately reflect twentieth-century transformations. Future research should supplement the PI at least with dimensions of male and female wage labor to provide a more nuanced account of long-term depatriarchalization.",

This paper examines how shifts in the racial and ethnic composition of city councils influence land use and housing development, particularly in relation to decision-making diversity. Using data on city council elections and the distribution of new housing permits, I identify the causal effect of electing a minority representative on housing supply. The findings reveal that minority representation increases single-family housing construction at the expense of multi-family housing, challenging conventional expectations about ideology and race. Qualitative interviews with city council members suggest that efforts to address minority underrepresentation drive active support for single-family housing, while distrust of developers—rooted in fears of gentrification—fuels skepticism toward multi-family projects. Overall, the study presents a nuanced view of racial representation: while minorities achieve better representational outcomes, these gains can come with costs.",

We propose a framework for evaluating descriptive empirical social science, premised on the idea that descriptive research -- like all empirical social science -- should be grounded in theory. First, we articulate the social scientific purpose of description, which provides criteria for assessing descriptive questions. Good descriptive questions uncover facts in need of explanation, build and refine theory, or help to assess and revise theory. Second, we articulate three ideal characteristics of descriptive analyses: clarity, comparability, and completeness. Good description is thus tightly and transparently linked to specific research questions (and thus to theory), well contextualized, and as comprehensive in measurement and specification as possible.",

The PH rides occur weekly and bear titles such as \"Central Contour of the 1929 Flood,\" \"Mouth of the Meninos to the Mouth of the Zavuvus,\" \"Dry Valleys of the Tietê from Remédios to Osasco,\" and \"Going Uberaba Upstream and Descending Cupecê with a Desmorrodouro in the Middle,\" among others. Participants move in varied directions, contributing to the construction of a collective memory around the mosaics of landscapes, anomalies, and rivers in a city that many insist is shapeless, ugly, and dirty, but which reveals itself as a witness to a complex labyrinth where humanity and nature are indistinguishable. From its inception on September 9,2024, to November 12, 2025, the PH led 237 people to traverse 71 distinct routes, delivering a total of 324,186 kilojoules of movement energy to perceive the watercourses. This amount of energy is equivalent to 8 liters of gasoline, although covering the same distance with a motor vehicle would require 2,290 liters of gasoline.It is empirically demonstrated that the bicycle uses 286 times less energy per kilometer than a car to move within the urban site of São Paulo when choosing to pedal along paths that were once obvious but have been buried, obstructed, or erased as possible ways.",

This exploratory pilot study examines demographic, behavioral, and intersectional predictors of summer melt among incoming first-year and transfer students at a large Southern California university. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed survey responses (N = 1,679), text message engagement, and post-orientation workshop observations. Among the students who participated in the survey, only 1.85% experienced melt. Of the survey participants, 467 agreed to be contacted via text, email, or Zoom for continued post-orientation engagement, and the melt rate for contacted students was 1.93%. On the other hand, the institutional melt rate for all first-year students for that academic term was 21%. Non-resident students exhibited significantly higher melt rates, while first-generation status and race/ethnicity did not significantly predict melt. Behavioral factors such as cannabis use correlated with increased melt likelihood, while self-reported social engagement and financial concerns did not reach statistical significance. Qualitative findings revealed substantial student interest in mental health services, academic support, and logistical guidance, with transfer students expressing increased concerns about social integration. These findings underscore the importance of pre-matriculation support, tailored interventions for non-resident students, and proactive engagement to inform about financial and mental health resources.",

          "authors": "Scott Oatley; Dharmi Kapadia",
          "abstract": "Social class analysis has been a vital component of sociologists’ research agenda for many decades, informing our understanding of social inequalities. However, current measures of social class are, by their neo-Weberian design determined by employment status and occupation. Consequently, measures of social class that are determined by employment relations restrict sociological understandings of social class to concepts related to working life. The study of later life – research that focuses upon the study of ageing and its impacts – typically focuses on individuals that have left the world of work and have entered a retired or semi-retired portion of their lives. To apply current measures of social class to the study of later life presents several challenges. Sociologists are often forced to use a ‘legacy’ class measure that uses an individual’s last recorded occupation prior to retiring. This is problematic, as legacy occupation may not reflect an individual’s current social class location. This paper seeks to remedy these problems by adopting a Bourdieusian inspired framework based on Capitals, Assets, and Resources (CAR) to construct a relevant social class measure for the study of later life. First, we set a theoretical foundation for the construction of this new measure of social class in later life. Then, using multiple correspondence analysis and latent profile analysis, we identified a five-class model of social class for use in later life. Our five-class model constitutes a small but very privileged Elite; followed by an established middle and culturally engaged high earners which make up a decently sized middle class; most respondents fall into a traditional working class with the rest making up a sizeable precariat class. We find a stark composition of social class membership characterised by a sizeable Traditional Working Class and a large Precariat population with a small middle class and tiny but exceptionally privileged Elite. Our findings from formal statistical modelling on determinants of security, stability, and prospects in later life demonstrate that CAR based approaches present clear points of stratification across social classes. This clarity is possible without having to rely on legacy based measures that are tied to forms of employment relations. We also find evidence to support the use of both legacy and CAR based measures of social class in the analysis of later life.",

          "authors": "Selçuk Bedük; Anna Yong",
          "abstract": "While any experience of child poverty can affect life chances, longer exposure is particularly concerning due to its lasting effects on education, health and earnings. This study examines the trends and drivers of long-term childhood poverty in Britain. Using a life-course perspective, we track poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born between 1991 and 2017. Across these cohorts, on average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the post-1997 welfare reforms, and rose again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. These cross-cohort trends are primarily driven by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors rather than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in 1990s was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, whereas the post-austerity surge stems mainly from reduced redistribution. For cohorts born in the 2000s, social transfers played a substantial role in containing long-term poverty despite deteriorating predistribution. Overall, the findings show that long-term childhood poverty is a major challenge in Britain and highlight the need to strenghten both redistribution and predistribution to address it.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "The workers of the world have not united. In three successive elections, white workers in the US voted for Donald Trump, many hoping that he would deport immigrant workers who were “taking their jobs.” A century earlier, US labor unions regularly disparaged and excluded Black and Asian workers from their ranks and later berated them as strikebreakers. In anti-oppression movements globally, infighting and backstabbing are rampant: western leftist coalitions have been coopted and pacified by centrist party machines while the center of mainstream politics shifts sharply to the right;  Third World revolutions have given way to despotic postcolonial governments that punch down at indigenous people, racial/ethnic minorities, women, and queer people; and once-victims of genocide have today become perpetrators. \nWhy is it so hard for oppressed peoples to come together in solidarity and sustain movements for change? What role do oppressed groups play in oppressing others, and what role can we all play in bringing forth emancipatory political alternatives? Questions like these have been raised by social psychologists and Marxist organizers, black feminists and social movement theorists. Answers, however, too often fail to make connections across academic literatures and levels of analysis. Some blame capitalist ideology, while others blame material conditions, and still others point to psychological predispositions. \nErich Fromm, I argue, offers a way out of the impasse. More than most, Fromm explored why and how people act contrary to rational self-interest. Why did the German masses choose Nazism over Marxian class solidarity? Why did the US populace allow itself to be taken in by mediocre consumerism? To answer both questions, Fromm suggests that our fundamental human need for relatedness leads us to seek social acceptance by conforming to the dominant character of our society. Individual personalities are brought into alignment with the wider character structure by way of social filters that inculcate some traits and suppress others. Unhealthy societies tend to produce similarly unhealthy relational patterns, which Fromm terms socially-patterned defects, while repressing more productive orientations. \nPutting Fromm—and those he influenced, like Paulo Freire and bell hooks—into conversation with Marx, Foucault, Collins, and others, I develop a model of complicity of the oppressed wherein marginalized people seek to elevate themselves by cooperating in the oppression of others. Insofar as capitalism fosters competition and filters out solidaristic tendencies, marginalized people tend to choose narrow self-advancement over broad movements for change. Complicity of the oppressed is a socially-patterned defect, a byproduct of intersecting oppressions that turn people against one another. The challenge, then, is to readjust our filters toward love and solidarity.",

The review covers key debates on tactics, class composition, organizational infrastructure, ideological framing, and regime type. It also analyzes the evolving role of civil society, digital media, and participatory institutions in both enabling and constraining democratic outcomes. While much of the earlier literature emphasized the democratizing potential of collective action, recent studies reveal a more ambivalent picture in which mass mobilization can bolster authoritarian incumbents or lead to fragmented political settlements. The essay concludes by outlining key directions for future research, including attention to discursive contestation, and the organizational strategies of both pro- and anti-democratic movements.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Despite the Third Reich's efforts to rewrite German history, post-WWII scholars and activists have worked valiantly to unearth the inspiring legacies of Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee (WhK) before Nazi takeover. But by lionizing Hirschfeld, these same scholars/activists have too often erased (1) WhK’s limitations, (2) other, less savory competitor groups like the masculinist Community of the Self-Possessed (GdE) and collaborationist Human Rights League (BfM), and (3) surprisingly generative critiques put forth by these latter groups. In a comparative-historical analysis of WhK, GdE, and BfM organizers, I suggest that fin-de-siècle German capitalism inculcated an illusory proximity to power that limited organizers' insights into bourgeois heteronormative German society and their precarious place within it. Despite criticizing some particulars, all of these activists nonetheless identified with and demonstrated adherence to classist models of normative Germanness by excluding other gender- and sexually-nonconforming people. WhK medicalists constructed themselves as upright, learned \"homosexual\" professionals against criminalized \"pseudohomosexual\" sex workers; GdE masculinists constructed their Hellenistic literary circle of enlightened \"homoerotic\" against crude, hypersexual, effeminate decadents. BfM homonormatives constructed themselves as respectable, everyday middle-class citizen-subjects against perverse, pathological, in-your-face activists. These attempts to gain inclusion at one another’s expense undermined their ability to work together and with other oppressed groups. Apart from a brief rapprochement, these competing groups constantly distinguished themselves from and denigrated one another. Hidden beneath this impulse is, to borrow from current discourse about Trump supporters, a sense of being “temporarily embarrassed elites\" that obscured friend from foe and obscured their extreme vulnerability to the coming storm of fascist reaction. I conclude by bringing the strengths and limitations of these three groups to bear on the current fascist, genocidal moment, suggesting that learning from their mistakes and capitalizing on their strengths is essential for bringing about a non-fascist movement, society, and world.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Zimmeck; Harshvardhan J. Pandit; Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius; Cristiana Santos; Konrad Kollnig; Robin Berjon",
          "abstract": "In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive mandate informed consent for behavioural advertising and use of tracking technologies. However, the ubiquity of consent banners and popups has led to widespread consent fatigue and questions regarding the effectiveness of these mechanisms in protecting users' data. In contrast, users in California and other US jurisdictions can utilize Global Privacy Control (GPC), a browser-based privacy signal that automatically broadcasts a legally binding opt-out request to websites. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, GPC can be adapted to the EU legal framework to mitigate consent fatigue and improve privacy protections for EU residents.\n\nWe analyse GPC as a technical specification standardized at the World Wide Web Consortium and examine its standing under current EU data protection law. Generally, GPC can be mapped to the various legal bases for processing under the GDPR. However, our evaluation also identifies friction between the GPC specification and EU data protection law as it stands. These discrepancies are resolvable and present an opportunity for EU legislators and regulators to interpret GPC in alignment with EU data protection requirements, particularly, considering the European Commission’s recent Digital Omnibus proposal. We conclude that while GPC is not a silver bullet, its adoption—supported by clear authoritative guidance and specification updates—can offer a pragmatic path toward more automated and effective data protection in the EU.",

          "authors": "Samadhi Lipari",
          "abstract": "It is no mystery that we are living in times of multiple ecological crises. Not only are phenomena such as climate change, widespread pollution, biodiversity loss, and soil artificialisation threatening irreversibly the ‘natural’ world. They imperil human society too, for human society is part of nature.\nTaking a historical materialist perspective, this thesis understands those crises as originating in capitalist social relations, which maximise the exploitation of both human labour and the ecosystems. The thesis maintains that mainstream responses to the crises are fully framed within the capitalist paradigm of perpetual and privatised ‘accumulation for accumulation’s sake’, only now legitimised through ‘green’ credentials. Building on theoretical and political approaches calling for the incorporation of an ‘ecological’ rationality within capitalist relations, these responses articulate faith in and commitment to the modernisation of productive cycles and governance systems, from which a more sustainable – ‘green’ – capitalist economy can apparently arise.\nDifferently, this thesis interprets such a ‘green’ turn as capitalism’s adaptation and expansion in the context of the ecological crises. The thesis deploys and innovates a range of historical materialist categories to analyse the relationship between the ‘green’ as an accumulation opportunity and its leveraging as a legitimation framework.\nEmpirically, the thesis investigates the accumulation of surplus value in and around renewable energy generation at the level of production areas, the enclosure and trans-formative processes it triggers, the class and factional cleavages it entails, and the regulatory mechanisms and legitimation narratives to which it is associated. Methodologically, it combines a comprehensive theoretical elaboration with case studies in southern Italy on wind energy and in eastern Germany on agricultural biogas.\nThe thesis maintains that under capitalism, renewable energy generation expands accumulation frontiers over not yet or ‘inefficiently’ commodified spaces and natures. This occurs through their privatisation and abstraction into fictitious capital –that is through their commodification and financialization. In contrast with marginalist approaches, this thesis reconciles the socially necessary labour time theory of value with political ecology. It rejects the assumption that privatised spaces and natures might ‘innately’ provide exchange value, maintaining that they serve as a collateral to capture –by way of rent- surplus value produced in society at a different point in time and space.\nSecondly, the thesis defines ‘green’ capitalism as a hegemonic project in the making. This is characterised by two dialectics: one tending to restructure the forces and relations of production; the other to re-build hegemonic narratives and apparatuses, around re-significations of the ‘green’ made compatible with sustained accumulation.",

          "authors": "Chad M. Topaz",
          "abstract": "We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Such conflicts are often asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger normative constraints on acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game. This framework yields two outcomes—cyclic authoritarian resurgence through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist–authoritarian coalition excluding resistance—depending on confrontation responses. We demonstrate how an established dynamical framework with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions clarifies conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.",

          "abstract": "Political prediction markets have exploded in size and influence, moving billions of dollars and shaping how journalists, donors, and voters interpret electoral odds. If these prices truly capture rational expectations, they should efficiently aggregate information about political outcomes. But do they? We analyze more than 2,500 political prediction markets traded across the Iowa Electronic Markets, Kalshi, PredictIt, and Polymarket during the final five weeks of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign involving more than than two billion dollars in transactions to assess whether prices accurately and efficiently aggregate political information.  While 93\\% of PredictIt markets correctly predicted outcomes better than chance on the Election Night eve, the average accuracy was 78\\% on Kalshi and 67\\% on Polymarket among all active political markets. Even the most accurate markets showed little evidence of efficiency: prices for identical contracts diverged across exchanges, daily price changes were weakly correlated or negatively autocorrelated, and arbitrage opportunities peaked in the final two weeks before Election Day. Together, these findings challenge the view that prediction markets necessarily efficiently and accurately aggregate information about political outcomes and suggest that traders often react not only to political developments but also to the dynamics of the markets themselves.",

          "abstract": "Racial segregation is widely understood to be a mechanism linking racial stratification to zero-sum Black-\nWhite outcomes. However, historical and demographic evidence show that segregation also shapes broader,\nmacro-level dynamics, such as income sorting, the availability of public goods, and policy outcomes that\nundermine the well-being of all residents. This paper tests the argument that segregation leads to White\nadvantage and, simultaneously, Black disadvantage. To do so, I link 1905-1920 birth cohorts in the 1940 Census\nto Social Security death records and use an instrumental-variable design leveraging variation in government\nfragmentation to estimate the effect of segregation on longevity. Estimates reveal a 10-point increase in\nsegregation reduced Black and White longevity by 0.44 and 0.29 years, respectively, with pronounced harms\nfor less-educated Whites. These findings highlight how mechanisms of racial stratification intersect with\npopulation processes and social class to shape life chances across racial groups, thus countering zero-sum\narguments.",

The second Trump administration has systematized this violence through unprecedented expansion, dismantling of oversight, and concentration of executive authority. Drawing on government policy, administrative datasets, facility records, and case documentation, the analysis demonstrates how detention institutionalizes medical neglect, retaliation, solitary confinement, reproductive coercion, language exclusion, deathbed releases, and jurisdictional manipulation as routine administrative practice. Bilateral transfer agreements extend this system extraterritorially, outsourcing custody to sites of documented torture where U.S. officials create conditions meeting the legal definition of enforced disappearance. The article theorizes this configuration as extractive authoritarianism, a mode of governance where legal formalism enables capital accumulation through the exploitation of civil vulnerability. This framework advances critical socio-legal scholarship by demonstrating how procedural compliance produces structural violence within formally lawful systems. It reveals the persistence of detention’s harms across cycles of reform and establishes the necessity of abolitionist responses.",

          "authors": "Aaron Helmbrecht",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump’s sophisticated use of speech manipulation strategies has inspired numerous research studies. O.I. Nazarenko and O.Ye. Nesterenko (2023) looked beyond Donald Trump at the Republican Party at large and found a pattern of manipulative effect in Republican discourse supporting Russia in the Russian-Ukrainian war. This raises many important questions for researchers. What is the political motivation for Republicans to side with Russia against Ukraine? How did this come to be? To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of Russian speech manipulation strategies in Republican discourse. Continuous sampling of Republican discourse employed pattern analysis and purposive and random selection to establish a corpus of 10 quotes presented as a series of historical episodes forming a narrative with a plot. Pragmatic analysis and critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies consistent with Russian thinking of reflexive control connected across speakers and generations. The findings reject the “ideological asymmetry hypothesis” and support the novel “freedom grift hypothesis” which proposes conservatives’ unique susceptibility to political misrepresentations is the result of covert Russian information warfare. This exploratory study supports the need for further speech manipulation research of Republican discourse from a historical perspective as a matter of urgent global security.",

This account is underpinned by conceptual work on the leadership of education provision in crises (the ‘endogenous systems leadership’ framework), and the politics of knowledge production on education in Africa. The empirical focus of this article is the partnership between Mekelle University researchers and the Tigray Region Education Bureau (TREB) around the introduction of an Accelerated Education Programme (AEP) across all schools in the region in 2023. As we show, this initiative demonstrates the key role of university-based researchers in knowledge production and exchange as a condition for the endogenous leadership of education provision during crises.",

          "abstract": "By using mostly binary measures of individuals’ sex or gender category, most existing quantitative social science literature has underestimated variations in gender self-concepts among cisgender individuals as well as increasing transgender or non-binary identifications. Some recent mostly non-representative studies from the US, Germany and Sweden have proposed novel gradational measures based on self-rating of masculinity and femininity. We extend these studies by systematically exploring how gender identification and self-perceived (non-)conformity relate to gender socialisation and performance in different domains as well as to gender equality in political, economic and normative dimensions across European regions. We draw on European Social Survey data collected in 2023/24 and apply multi-level regression models for 37,587 individuals across 199 regions of 26 European countries. The results show the expected associations of gender identification and non-conformity with bodily characteristics and personality traits, regional gender regimes and partly with relationships but not with labour market- and care-related aspects. We find some systematic variation in these associations across gender regimes pointing to altered meanings of masculinity and femininity. On the whole, gradational measures of gender identification are promising to include in future quantitative studies to complement gender category and domain-specific beliefs but contextual comparisons require adjustments to improve comparability.",

I first document a negative relationship between being a seigneurial town and central state capacity in ancien-regime Spain. Next, I focus on the Kingdom of Granada after its conquest by Castile in 1492 to leverage on that the initial distribution of lordships was conditionally exogenous, with the results corroborating the negative effect of lordships on state capacity. I further show two additional important results. First, the effect is very persistent, with former lordships towns featuring less state capacity almost a century after the abolition of the seigneurial regime. Second, there is a non-monotonic effect on economic growth. Contrary to conventional wisdom, lordships towns did not underperform royal towns during the Ancien Régime. Yet, despite not having started with disadvantage, former seigneurial towns experienced lower population growth from the 1910s onwards, a period in which the Spanish state started to play a bigger investment role. Thus, towns with historically less state presence benefited less from state’s investments, lagging behind.",

The mostly linear approaches such as represented in the current agricultural discourses and by the agricultural sciences fall short in explaining the real-life complexities and overlapping crises experienced by small-scale farmers.\nBased on my recent qualitative fieldwork in Thailand, this paper aims to picture the complexities within which households' farming practices operate, and how these arise from a web of socio-cultural, political, economic, and ecological factors.\nBy pleading for relational approaches to farming such as those acknowledging its immanent human-ecology interaction, this paper suggests a novel \"health-nutrition-ecology\" nexus to guide enquiry into the intimate relations between ecology, livelihoods, and health and well-being. It is employed to gain understanding of small-farming households' situations, deep-rooted causes of these, and their resilience in facing crises. \nThe paper further pleads for a shift in existing technocratic agricultural discourses towards their inclusiveness of real-world narratives by small-scale farmers. These narratives can deliver insights for policies that aim at actual transformations of crisis-prone agro-food systems and could benefit both farmer livelihoods and farm ecologies.",

These layers \nare combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for \ncustoms review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than \ngeneral goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the \nmost significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in \nearly 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.
