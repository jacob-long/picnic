          "authors": "James E Pustejovsky; Jingru Zhang; Elizabeth Tipton",
          "abstract": "In many fields of application, meta-analyses routinely involve dependent effect size estimates and hierarchical data structures. Statistical methods for analyzing dependent effect sizes are now well developed, but there has been less attention to the initial stages of data analysis, prior to formal modeling. We propose a generic workflow for preliminary, exploratory analyses of meta-analytic databases, which focuses on validating the integrity of the input data and informing decisions about subsequent statistical modeling. The workflow entails creating summaries and visualizations of features of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis in order to understand the structure and distribution of the data, especially with respect to between- and within-study variation. We illustrate the workflow using data from previously published meta-analyses and discuss connections between the preliminary analysis and subsequent statistical modeling strategies.",

          "authors": "Taisuke Imai; Salvatore Nunnari; Jilong Wu; Ferdinand Vieider",
          "abstract": "We present a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospect theory (PT) parameter estimates, synthesizing data from 166 papers that report 812 estimates based on the decisions of approximately 52,000 subjects across 69 countries. We develop and implement a novel approach that enables the joint meta-analysis of multiple PT parameters, explicitly modeling potential covariation among them. Our analysis reveals that the average utility curvature (measured via the coefficient of constant relative risk aversion) is 0.33 for gains (95% credible interval [0.31, 0.36]) and 0.29 for losses (CrI [0.25, 0.32]). The average likelihood sensitivity parameter is 0.68 (CrI [0.66, 0.70]), and the average elevation parameter is 0.98 (CrI [0.95, 1.02]). These values align with the stylized facts of PT: diminishing sensitivity to changes in wealth relative to a reference point, and to changes in probabilities moving away from the endpoints of the unit interval. Beyond these central tendencies, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in parameter estimates, limiting the precision of predictions about future parameters. Among the study-level characteristics examined, the measurement method emerges as the most significant predictor of parameter variation, highlighting potential violations of procedural invariance. Nonetheless, a large portion of the heterogeneity remains unexplained even after adjusting for a wide range of study features, suggesting that subtle design differences meaningfully influence behavior. Our results thus offer not only a synthesis of existing findings but also a roadmap for future research.",

          "title": "The Rational Use of Cognitive Resources",
          "authors": "Falk Lieder; Frederick Callaway; Tom Griffiths",
          "abstract": "A new approach to understanding irrational behavior that provides a framework for deriving new models of human cognition. What does it mean to act rationally? Mathematicians, economists, and statisticians have argued that a rational actor chooses actions that maximize their expected utility. And yet people routinely act in ways that violate this prescription. Our limited time and computational resources mean that it is often unrealistic to consider all options in order to choose the one that has the greatest utility. This book suggests a different approach to understanding irrational behavior: resource-rational analysis. By reframing questions of rational action in terms of how we should make the best use of our limited resources, the book offers a new take on fundamental questions at the heart of cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and the design of artificial intelligence systems. The book presents a formal framework for applying resource-rational analysis to understand and improve human behavior, a set of tools developed by the authors to make this easier, and examples of how they have used this approach to revisit classic questions about human cognition, pose new ones, and enhance human rationality. The book will be a valuable resource for psychologists, economists, and philosophers as well as neuroscientists studying human brains and minds and computer scientists working to reproduce such systems in machines.",

          "authors": "Igor Utochkin; Daniil Azarov; Daniil Grigorev",
          "abstract": "Recognition memory is an essential form of memory retrieval, allowing us to determine whether a thing or episode we experience in the present has been experienced in the past. Recognition typically involves decisions on whether stimuli look \"old\" or \"new\". These decisions can be difficult, especially when the new stimuli are similar to the old ones (e.g., as in police lineup identification). Although the role of similarity between old (targets) and new (foils) in recognition is obvious, it is often hard to predict how confusable particular targets and foils would be and how much of their confusability comes from their similarity as opposed to insufficient memory. Here, we show that, even when stimuli are various real-world objects whose subjective similarity depends on numerous non-defined factors and varies across people, they form highly consistent recognition memory spaces. That is, proportions of correct (hits) and incorrect recognitions (false alarms) produced by certain target-foil combinations are distributed similarly across different participants. Moreover, using the discriminability index d' from signal-detection theory as a distance metric, we found that the recognition spaces recovered from simple two-alternative choice tests (2-AFC) correctly predicted performance in more complex 4-AFC tests not only for hits but differentiated false alarms for each foil. We also found that the decreased encoding time reduced all absolute d' distances (presumably due to lower memory strength) but preserved the relative distances. Therefore, we found evidence for highly consistent signal-detection recognition memory spaces of real-world objects invariant to memory task complexity.",

          "abstract": "A striking perceptual phenomenon has recently been described wherein people report seeing abrupt jumps in the location of a smoothly moving object (‘position resets’). Here, we show that this phenomenon can be understood within the framework of recursive Bayesian estimation as arising from transient gain changes, temporarily prioritising sensory input over predictive beliefs. From this perspective, position resets reveal a capacity for rapid adaptive precision weighting in human visual perception, and offer a possible testbed within which to study the timing and flexibility of sensory gain control.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how stress and anxiety influence the interplay between visual working memory and decision-making in human participants. Using the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test (SECPT) to induce acute stress, we examined cognitive performance on a computerized behavioral paradigm (the Marble Jar Task) requiring the storage, manipulation, and utilization of visual information. Results revealed that while experimentally induced stress did not significantly affect overall accuracy, higher self-reported state anxiety was correlated with both lower decision-making accuracy and poorer visual memory performance. Interestingly, higher state anxiety was also correlated with increased attention towards high-value outcomes in decision- making. This work highlights the importance of understanding how stress and anxiety affect the interaction between interconnected cognitive functions, rather than studying isolated cognitive phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Decades of scholarship on gender have shown that women are judged to be more caring and more communal than men. Here we use multiple methods (N = 5,376) to test an intriguing claim entailed by this work: People think that women are morally superior to men. Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. Next, using a novel profile-generation task, we find that people are more likely to ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they are spontaneously thinking of a woman (vs. a man) and when they are assigned to do so. Further, using a large database of 1,864 normed behaviors, we find that behaviors associated with moral goodness are also stereotyped as feminine. Finally, we use a novel impression updating task to explore a potential consequence of this phenomenon. Specifically, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men. As a result, equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, these findings reveal that moral goodness is closely linked to gender concepts: people think women are morally superior to men.",

          "authors": "Jordan Wylie; Dries Hannes Bostyn; Ana P. Gantman",
          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees. Study 2 replicated these findings in a preregistered study. Study 3 experimentally manipulated these four signals in a novel context using a conjoint design. We found that codification and moral wrongness most strongly influence rule concepts. This work goes beyond purely legalistic or formalist accounts of rules, showing that people’s intuitions about rule violations are shaped not only by codification but also by descriptive normativity, moral wrongness, and perceived legitimacy of enforcement.",

          "abstract": "Human towns are shaped by intentional design. Here we ask whether people use societal features to make social inferences, specifically focusing on how the presence of protective architectural features influences people’s intuitions about towns’ residents. U.S. adults (N = 100) were presented with two novel societies – a ‘protected’ town with walls, locks, and gates, and an ‘unprotected’ town lacking such features. We manipulated whether residents had chosen or been randomly assigned where to live. Across both conditions, people judged that unprotected society residents felt safer, happier, and were nicer; and that protected society residents dressed more similarly, stayed inside more, and had more rules. Most people preferred to live in the unprotected society. Positive attributions and preference for the unprotected society were associated with liberal (vs. conservative) political affiliation. Overall, we show that people use the physical features of built environments to make social inferences about residents’ behaviors, traits, and mental states.",

Socializing was one of the activities most strongly linked to the probability of having a good day, but beyond 2 hours, additional socializing was not associated with further increases in the probability of reporting a better-than-typical day. Working for up to six hours was not related to whether people rated their day as better than usual; beyond six hours, however, additional work was associated with sharp declines in the probability of having a good day. While the present results are descriptive in nature, they provide insight into the rhythms and routines that characterize happy days.",

          "abstract": "Recently, the role of abortion access in the workplace and the field of I-O psychology has been highlighted, but little published research explicitly tackles the impacts of abortion care from an organizational psychology perspective. We examine the potential impacts of further restrictions on abortion access within the context of people’s relationships with employment and workplaces. We focus our discussion on three significant mechanisms that may further restrict access to abortion depending on the degree to which they are enforced or enacted: restriction of abortion medication and equipment shipping, limiting federal funding for organizations that facilitate abortion access, and fetal personhood laws. Further restriction of abortion access may create significant challenges for organizational decision-makers, employees, and healthcare workers. Together, these changes to the experience of work necessitate shifts in research and practice within the field of I-O psychology. I-O researchers and practitioners must work together to facilitate organizational functioning and employee wellbeing through these changes by becoming and staying informed about organizational benefit policies and reproductive care-related practices and their impact on employees, employee career trajectories and distress related to unwanted pregnancy, and moral injury and other challenges faced by healthcare workers.",

          "abstract": "Psychological test scores are commonly used in high-stakes settings to classify individuals. While measurement invariance across groups is necessary for valid and meaningful inferences of group differences, full measurement invariance rarely holds in practice. The classification accuracy analysis framework (Lai &amp; Zhang, 2022; Millsap &amp; Kwok, 2004) aims to quantify the degree and practical impact of noninvariance. However, how to best navigate the next steps remains unclear, and methods devised to account for noninvariance at the group level may be insufficient when the goal is classification. Furthermore, deleting a biased item may improve fairness but negatively affect performance, and replacing the test can be costly. We propose item-level effect size indices that allow test users to make more informed decisions by quantifying the impact of deleting (or retaining) an item on test performance and fairness, provide an illustrative example, and introduce unbiasr, an R package implementing the proposed methods.",

          "abstract": "Psycholinguistic researchers have used the cloze task to measure the predictability of upcoming words, but have largely discarded the variability in the structure of responses people provide. This variability in the semantic structure of responses may be important for understanding selection during language production; however, it has proven difficult to model the semantic variability of participants' responses, and thus upcoming semantic uncertainty. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) permit us to approximate the degree of semantic variability in cloze responses, but most methods are restricted to symbolic or hand-crafted meaning representations. We show in two studies that Bayesian Gaussian mixture models can cluster LLM representations of participants' responses and produce coherent, taxonomically similar clusters. We apply these clustering algorithms to response time data in a serial cloze task and show that the semantic structure of cloze responses influences how quickly people are able to provide a response. We show clear effects of semantic competition on naming speed. In addition to providing novel operationalizations of what semantic competition might look like in the cloze task, we explain how this clustering method is extensible to other datasets and applications of interest to researchers of semantic processing in psycholinguistics.",

          "authors": "Mina Bakhteyari Haftlangi",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the integration of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) with coaching to foster personal and professional growth. NLP is a method focused on understanding and reprogramming the mind and subconscious through verbal and non-verbal communication patterns, offering individuals the tools to reshape behaviors, beliefs, and emotional responses. The study reviews the historical development of NLP, its theoretical underpinnings, and key concepts such as perceptual channels (visual, auditory, sensory, and rational) and the Dilts pyramid, which outlines six levels of change: environment, behavior, capabilities, beliefs and values, identity, and spirituality. Coaching, a collaborative relationship, is presented as a powerful tool in which a trained coach applies NLP strategies to help clients achieve defined objectives. Essential coaching competencies, including building trust, active listening, and ethical practices, are discussed. The paper also explores various NLP techniques—such as visualization, reframing, conditioning, and mental imagery—and their applications in addressing anxiety, procrastination, negative thought patterns, self-doubt, and confidence-building. Additional areas of focus include memory enhancement, financial goal setting, and emotional regulation. While the practical benefits of NLP in coaching are emphasized, the study also highlights NLP’s classification as a pseudoscientific approach, underscoring the need for more empirical research to substantiate its claims. Overall, combining NLP with coaching is presented as a robust, adaptable framework for enabling meaningful personal transformation, offering clients actionable tools to overcome challenges and achieve sustained success in diverse aspects of life.",

Here, we examined whether memory palace valence influences neutral information recall. We found that participants who applied MOL using a negatively valenced palace (N=33) outperformed participants who applied MOL using a positively valenced palace (N=34) and participants in a non-MOL control group (N=31) on a free-response semantic memory recall test. Furthermore, participants who perceived the negative palace more negatively or positive palace more positively exhibited greater recall accuracy, but overall, the negative group outperformed the positive group. These findings highlight that memory palaces can be constructed to optimize loci-dependent memory accuracy, providing new evidence-based strategies to improve memorization.",

In a preregistered sample (N=34), we show that instructions to retrieve were associated with gaze reinstatement (eye gaze towards the location where the target object was studied), while instructions to suppress were associated with gaze repulsion (eye gaze away from the studied location). We also show that lasting SIF is associated with an initial period of gaze reinstatement during the suppression attempt. These results provide novel evidence for how humans intentionally forget, revealing both the top-down strategies that people employ to suppress retrieval and also the retrieval dynamics that lead to lasting forgetting.",

Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. Undergraduate Psychology students completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. Participants were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation was moderated by gesture use: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning only when they indicated being motivated, but the presence of gestures ensured consistent learning gain regardless of motivation levels. These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "title": "Reduced reward bias for exerting personal control is associated with self-reported anhedonia",
          "authors": "Holly Sullivan-Toole",
          "abstract": "Anhedonia is a pernicious and transdiagnostic set of psychiatric symptoms, including decreased motivation and blunted response to rewards. These reward processing deficits are found across a range of psychiatric conditions including depression, social anxiety, and substance use disorder, and are linked to worse psychiatric outcomes. Healthy individuals are known to experience reward responses to a variety of stimuli including perceived opportunities to make choices (i.e., exert personal control) that lead to monetary outcomes. Critically, perceived personal control has been shown to be rewarding even when exerting control cannot lead to greater monetary reward. However, the association between anhedonia and responsivity to personal control is not well understood. Using a sample of university students (n = 62), the current study examined the association between self-reported anhedonia and behavioral responsivity to opportunities to exert (perceived) personal control over monetary outcomes in a signal detection task. In a novel behavioral task, the ‘Choice Bias Task’, participants were shown stimuli linked to monetary outcomes. In one task condition, participants were given a ‘free choice’ (perceived personal control condition) between stimuli for a subsequent monetary reward and in another task condition, participants were given a ‘forced choice’ and told which stimuli to choose for a subsequent monetary reward (no control condition). Critically, monetary outcomes were equal between the personal control and no control conditions. Using signal detection analyses, I examined the development of a bias for personal control across blocks of the task and how this ‘choice bias’ was associated with anhedonia. While there was no bias for choice across at the group level, choice bias was significantly associated with self-reported anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia, such that more anhedonic individuals exhibited lower decisional bias towards perceived opportunities to exert personal control. These findings suggest that opportunities for exerting personal control may be less reinforcing for individuals with higher levels of anhedonia. Future work should examine associations between anhedonia and reward responses across different reward domains including the domain of personal control, which has been shown to be normatively rewarding.",

          "abstract": "The PERMA-Profiler is a self-report instrument designed to assess personal psychological well-being, including “PERMA” (an acronym for Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment). Despite consistent validation of its descriptive utility and latent five-factor measurement structure, debates persist regarding these dimensions' distinctiveness and incremental validity. This study applied MIRT to evaluate the instrument’s between-item multidimensionality and the functioning of its 11-point rating scale using Category Boundary Discriminations (CBDs). Data were drawn from a culturally diverse sample (N = 2,337), including several previously published datasets. Results indicated that a Rasch-compliant model did not fit, raising questions about mean or sum scores. The intended five-factor PERMA structure was not replicated due to unmodeled latent factor associations that inflated model residuals. These unmodeled associations likely reflect convergence difficulties, potentially driven by high inter-item and inter-factor correlations. Stochastic dependencies within Meaning emerged (particularly regarding item M1), which could have inflated previously reported reliability and validity indices. Participants predominantly used the upper end of the scale, with categories 5 through 10 accounting for 84% of responses, suggesting redundancy. Categories 0 to 3 therefore showed minimal incremental discrimination and unordered thresholds. Merging lower categories or using time-framed or percentage labels could improve measurement precision and discrimination.",

          "authors": "Eden Elbaz; Itay Yaron; Liad Mudrik",
          "abstract": "A major challenge in the study of unconscious processing is to effectively suppress the critical stimulus while ensuring it evokes a strong enough signal to be processed unconsciously. A possible way to achieve these goals is by calibrating stimulus strength. While calibrating stimulus strength is common in psychophysics, current calibration methods are not designed to find the maximal intensity in which the stimulus can still be rendered unconscious. Here, we demonstrate how calibration can be utilized to estimate, for each observer, this targeted threshold. We present a novel calibration procedure: the Subliminal Threshold Estimation Procedure (STEP), specifically designed for estimating the individual upper subliminal threshold. Using simulations, we showed that STEP outperforms existing calibration methods, which yielded strikingly low accuracy. We then further validated STEP using three empirical experiments. Together, these results establish STEP as highly beneficial for the study of unconscious processing.",

In an online survey, participants reported on nutrition and physical activity app use as well as a range of relevant socio-demographic characteristics associated with social inequality according to PROESS-Plus (age, gender, education, income, employment status, rural vs. urban residency, Austrian/ German/ Italian citizenship, migration history, minority status, and sexual orientation).\nResults: Except residency and migration status, all socio-demographic characteristics were associated with mHealth app (non-)use if analysed independently. A latent class analysis revealed four distinct classes of mHealth app (non-)users, which overall highlighted age, education, income and employment are crucial inequality indicators. \nConclusions: These results confirm the existence of a digital health divide in Europe primarily driven by age and socio-economic status that urgently needs addressing to promote digital health for all.",

          "abstract": "Online news headlines play a vital role both in news production and news consumption: Readers rely on headlines to keep up-to-date and choose what to read. Producers, on the other hand, write headlines to attract attention and clicks in the attention economy. Specific language may benefit news headlines in this competition: Longer headlines, employing more emotional, negative, and concrete language, introducing an information gap, or even writing inaccurate headlines may be advantageous. Concerns include if the attention economy threatens the quality of news headlines. We experimentally investigated how different incentives – to attract clicks, or to inform – affect the language of news headlines, and how this influences consumption: In a two-stage experiment, a first group of participants (N=599) wrote headlines to be read by a second group (N=896), in different conditions. For example, in the “attention economy” condition, headline writers received a financial reward for each click to one of their headlines in a competitive consumption setting. Producers in this scenario were more likely to produce informationally incomplete and incongruent headlines, but such headlines did not get more clicks. On the other hand, headlines produced in an informativeness condition were rated as more informative by consumers. Contrary to our expectation, headlines that were rated as more informative were also more likely to be clicked. Our findings help to understand the downstream consequences of production incentives on content quality, and inform rethinking online information environments in the attention economy.",

This concept has been foundational in the design of various interactive technologies like voice assistants and chatbots. However, technological advancements and widespread adoption of social devices have raised questions about the theory's current relevance. Here we show that while young adults (18-29) no longer exhibit the CASA effect, older adults, particularly those aged 43 to 51, still respond to computers as social entities. This generational difference is likely caused by familiarity and desensitization to social cues from computers. This research advances our understanding of human-computer interaction by demonstrating that the CASA effect is not universally applicable across all age groups in the modern context.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering (MW) involves an attentional drift away from an external task to internal thoughts and goals. In the last decade, a substantial number of studies have investigated the possibility of influencing MW using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, the accumulated evidence suggests that tDCS may not be sufficiently strong to reliably affect MW propensity. Therefore, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with an inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol targeting the left angular gyrus (AG) to interfere with MW propensity in healthy adults. Since the AG is a core region of the default-mode network (DMN), which is believed to play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of MW episodes, we hypothesized that cTBS would reduce MW during a demanding cognitive task. In a triple-blind, crossover design, participants performed four blocks of the finger-tapping random-sequence generation task (FT-RSGT) with three interleaved bouts of real or sham cTBS. We found that real cTBS reduced both self-reported MW propensity and behavioural variability, an objective marker of MW, while maintaining comparable levels of executive task performance. These results indicate that cTBS targeting the DMN may be an effective protocol to reduce MW, which may have important implications for basic and applied research.",

While extensively studied in various domains of human cognition, its manifestation in the attentional engagement with visual art remains largely unexplored. The present study (105 participants) established how viewing times on a sample of 60 different artworks (digitised paintings taken from openly available sources) relate to subjective ratings of artistic value, emotional valence and arousal. Estimates of each painting’s general artistic prominence featured as an additional control predictor in the analyses. We found that paintings that are judged to be of higher artistic value tend to attract proportionally longer viewing times. Independently of this, paintings that are rated as emotionally more negative attract longer viewing times than emotionally more positive paintings. The latter confirms a negativity bias in attending to visual art, adding evidence for the general pervasiveness of such a bias in human cognition.",

          "abstract": "This hypothesis proposes that sound carries emotion within its information codes—defined as acoustic patterns like pitch, rhythm, intonation, timbre, and harmonics—processed by biological and artificial systems. Infants’ innate sensitivity to emotional sounds, such as a caregiver’s voice, supports this, as they respond with comfort or distress without prior experience (Masataka, 2006). Coma patients further demonstrate this encoding, showing brain activity via EEG and fMRI when exposed to familiar voices and music, suggesting subconscious emotional processing (Di et al., 2007; Eickhoff et al., 2008; O’Kelly et al., 2013). Damasio’s Somatic Marker Hypothesis and Friston’s Free Energy Principle suggest emotions in sound are bodily and predictive, while Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory links responses to integrated processing. Theories like Prosodic Theory, Affect Induction, and Neuroaesthetics highlight how acoustic features evoke emotions. This hypothesis extends to AI systems like Grok, with applications in therapy and communication.",

          "abstract": "Graphical models facilitate the representation of psychological variables as complex systems of interacting variables structured as a network. However, their existing statistical analyses overlook the assumption of clustering—the grouping of subsets of variables that are more densely connected within the network—despite its central role in many psychological theories. We address this gap by proposing the use of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) as a prior distribution on the network structure of a graphical model for binary and ordinal data. The SBM assumes that variables belong to latent clusters, where the probability of an edge depends on the cluster membership of the nodes. Embedding this prior in a Bayesian graphical modeling framework allows researchers to formally incorporate theoretical expectations about clustering, test hypotheses about the number of clusters, and estimate cluster assignments from cross-sectional data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a simulation study and reanalyze 30 openly available empirical datasets to test for clustering. This work highlights how the Bayesian framework can embed theoretical assumptions into network models via priors and introduces a new tool for latent cluster inference in psychological network analysis.",

In this paper, I examine the role of police in riots between two social groups in India: the 2020 Hindu-Muslim Delhi riots. I offer a discursive psychological examination of lay accounts of users' comments to news coverage of these riots. The analysis shows that users first oriented to and mobilized a readily known understanding that policing is biased and affiliated to Hindus over Muslims. Second, users developed and negotiated the possible affiliation of police to Hindu groups by pointing to contingent and routinized practices of both police and Muslims. Last, users offered routinized descriptions of Muslims as violent in justifying police actions. Findings show that users could interchangeably treat the police and Hindu groups in dealing with Muslims. Overall, policing was evaluated in terms of a religious groundswell of meanings and perceptions of relations between social groups and the State.",

To date, little work has focused on studying functional network connectivity utilizing SPECT data. In this study, we present a fully automated, spatially constrained ICA (sc-ICA) approach to evaluate functional network connectivity profiles in SPECT data using the NeuroMark pipeline. We evaluate both the expression of brain networks along with the whole brain SPECT connectome to evaluate the neuroimaging links to schizophrenia. 76 healthy controls, and 137 schizophrenia patient SPECT images were acquired from Amen Clinic sites along with diagnostic information. Each patient participated in two SPECT brain scans, acquired during rest and while performing a sustained attention task across twelve clinical imaging sites. Preprocessed SPECT data were analyzed via sc-ICA using 53 spatial priors derived from functional MRI data. 15 total components were found to show differences in various brain regions after correcting for multiple comparisons. FDR corrected resting SPECT results showed stronger covariation with CC-SC, CC-AUD, and DM-AUD networks. Many components showed reduced connectivity in patients. Additionally, relationships were associated with regressing loading parameters against age, sex, hearing voices and having disjointed thoughts. For the task data, connectivity between the cognitive control – default mode network was found in rest-task data after FDR correction. Task data covariation patterns largely remained the same as the rest data. In summary, we confirm existing work highlighting large scale network disruptions noted in prior schizophrenia fMRI studies.",

          "abstract": "Background: The underrepresentation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) remains a persistent international challenge with complex causes. This study draws on five complementary theoretical perspectives–theory of circumscription and compromise, situated expectancy-value theory, the internal/external frame of reference model, the differential effects model, and the goal congruity model–to identify the strongest predictors of women's entry into STEM fields in higher education from 21 variables and their up to 441 nonlinear pairwise interactions. No previous study has included such a comprehensive set of variables and interactions. To address this gap, we applied Prediction Rule Ensembles, a machine learning technique that balances interpretability and predictive accuracy, capturing complex, nonlinear interactions between variables. We used a nationally representative longitudinal German NEPS sample of 4,383 academic-track students (53% female, 25% second-generation immigrants).\n\nResults: Our analyses showed that high school students' career aspirations with a higher proportion of female than male incumbents (gendered career aspirations), along with their self-concept of math and verbal ability, were the strongest predictors of STEM major choice. Gendered career aspirations accounted for between 71% and 77% of the gender gap in STEM major choice, while students’ achievement variables had a much lower importance for the STEM major choice prediction. Notably, the association between math self-concept and STEM major choice was stronger for students with higher male-dominated career aspirations, highlighting the interplay between gendered career aspirations and domain-specific self-concepts. The application of prediction rule ensembles allowed us to uncover nonlinear interactions between predictors that had not previously been identified, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches in educational research. \n\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of considering complex, nonlinear interactions between theory-driven predictors to better understand the gender gap in STEM. These findings have significant implications for both theory and practice, suggesting that interventions targeting the perceived gender typicality of STEM careers and students' math self-concepts may be effective in increasing women's participation in STEM. Furthermore, the methodological approach adopted in this study offers a promising framework for future research, paving the way for more nuanced investigations of the multiple factors that influence educational and career choices in STEM.",

          "abstract": "Social odor plays an important role for various facets of early development, including communication and social processing. Previous research focusing on maternal odor has shown that smelling the mother can influence face processing in general as well as emotion processing more specifically. However, it is unclear to what extent these effects are specific to maternal odor or can also be found for other familiar social odors. To address this question, we investigated the impact of the father’s odor on emotional face processing in 7-month-old infants. We recorded the infants’ EEG response to female and male happy and fearful faces while infants were exposed to either their father’s odor or the odor of a different infant’s father. Analysis of the frontocentral Nc amplitude revealed an enhanced response to fearful compared to happy male faces only when infants smelled their own father but not when they smelled an unfamiliar father. In contrast, emotion processing at the occipital N290 was not affected by the presence of paternal odor, suggesting an impact of social odor on attention allocation rather than structural face processing. Interestingly, all effects were specific to male faces, pointing to a gender-specific impact of social odor. Our findings therefore provide first evidence for an influence of the father’s odor on face processing, specifically male faces, in infancy.",

While there seems to have been an effect in this first period, we do not find a statistically measurable effect in 2021 as even though distress rose during the lockdown period, it rose similarly among those jurisdictions out of lockdown as well. We speculate this may be because of adaptation to stress, growing cases in control jurisdictions, or the vaccine roll-out providing a concrete endpoint for lockdowns.",

          "abstract": "The feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential has been associated both with the cortical processing of reward and salience prediction errors (RPEs/SPEs), and with behavioral adjustments that optimize performance. While the FRN is sensitive to response-feedback contingencies and to the level of perceived control over rewards and losses, it remains to be explored how this waveform is influenced by random outcomes during reinforcement learning (RL) while participants develop an illusion of control (IoC). We present novel analyses of data from a previous study (Csifcsák, Melsæter &amp; Mittner, 2020), in which a group of healthy adults was intermittently exposed to compromised control over outcomes (“yoking”) during RL. Earlier, we reported effects on latent parameters of RL and oscillatory activity during decision-making, whereas now we analyzed whether the FRN was sensitive to the controllability manipulation. Forty-six participants were randomized to “control” or “yoked” groups, differing only in their level of control over rewards/losses in three out of nine blocks of an RL task. The FRN was analyzed both in terms of its sensitivity to outcome valence (preferred vs. non-preferred) and with respect to its association with single-trial RPEs/SPEs. Bayesian statistics confirmed comparable ratings of perceived control and success for yoked vs. control participants, indicating IoC in the yoked group. Although response accuracy was at chance level during compromised outcome controllability, the FRN was statistically indistinguishable between the two groups, as revealed by a multitude of analytical approaches. We conclude that under IoC, the FRN is not sensitive to (the absence of) response-outcome contingencies. Furthermore, the state of IoC induces a dissociation between the FRN and choice behavior. These findings suggest that the cortical analysis of rewards and losses, measured above the midfrontal region, is dominated by higher-order cognitive/affective states when predictions about future events are unreliable.",

In psychometrics, reliability is a fundamental concept that gauges the degree to which an assessment tool generates stable and consistent results. Evaluation of reliability is crucial because without reliable measurement, the adequacy of educational assessments and the decisions based on them would be compromised. To address the lack of a method to measure reliability, we propose a novel approach for estimating the reliability coefficient by extending the existing method for diagnostic classification models to time-series data. By applying the proposed method to actual response data, we demonstrate its capability to assess the reliability of BKT models, highlighting the importance of evaluating reliability and its potential for improving individualized learning experiences.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have integrated realistic orthographic representations of words into global matching models of memory in order to capture similarity effects on an item-by-item basis. However, these models have also made the simplified assumption that all features are equally weighted when determining the similarity between letter strings. Previous work has instead found evidence that words containing rare letter features exhibit better recognition memory performance than words with more common features. The current study aimed to explore the consequences of integrating orthographic feature frequency in global matching models of recognition memory. We conducted three recognition memory experiments with feature frequency manipulations. Participants studied words containing low or high frequency letters (Experiment 1) or bigrams (Experiment 2), or received a factorial manipulation of letter and bigram frequency (Experiment 3). Results showed feature frequency mirror effects – words comprised of rare letters and bigrams showed higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates than words comprised of common letters and bigrams, and showed evidence for a stronger bigram frequency effect compared to letter frequency. These data were fit with global matching models containing orthographic representations where the underlying features were either equally weighted or with weights proportional to their frequency in language.

          "abstract": "Judgment is often described in terms of an intuitive (System 1) versus deliberative (System 2) dichotomy, yet sound deliberation itself can take more than one form. Building on philosophical traditions and distinctions in treatment of sound judgment in economics and law, we propose that lay conceptions revolve around two distinct types of deliberate judgment: rational, emphasizing rule-based and utility-focused reasoning for well-defined problems, and reasonable, prioritizing context-sensitive and socially conscious reasoning for ill-defined problems. Across four studies in English-speaking Western samples (Studies 1–4; N = 2,130) and a Mandarin-speaking Chinese sample (Study 4; N = 697), participants described their notions of “sound” and “good” judgment, evaluated social scenarios, chose between candidates with distinct judgmental profiles, and categorized non-social objects. Results consistently showed that people view both rationality and reasonableness as common forms of deliberate sound judgment, while treating them as distinct. Participants preferred rational deliberation for algorithmic social roles linked to well-defined tasks and reasonable deliberation for interpretive roles linked to ill-defined tasks. Moreover, framing decisions as rational vs. reasonable influenced whether participants relied on rule-based vs. overall-similarity strategies in classification tasks. These findings suggest that lay understanding of sound judgment does not rely on a single standard of judgmental competence. Instead, people recognize that both rationality and reasonableness are critical for competent deliberation on different types of problems in life.",

          "abstract": "Listeners must cope with highly variable input to successfully recognize speech. One way they\ndo this is by adapting to the systematicities of individual talkers. Research on talker-specific\nadaptation has found that listeners either generalize talker-specific phoneme categories to new\ntalkers or individuate them, creating talker-specific categories. Five experiments investigated the\nconditions under which listeners generalize or individuate talker-specific phoneme categories\nusing a distributional learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, participants (N=413) acquired a novel\nvoicing boundary for a new talker and generalized this boundary to another novel talker. In a\nlater session (1-3 days later), they were trained on a second novel talker but showed no\nevidence of learning it and no evidence of retaining the first talker. Experiment 2 (N=355)\ndemonstrated that the lack of retention was a not a product of interference from learning in the\nsecond session. We also asked if listeners individuate talkers when exposed to multiple talkers\nsimultaneously in a distributional learning paradigm (Experiment 3, N=113) and in a supervised\nlearning paradigm (Experiment 4, N=125). Neither showed evidence for talker-specific learning.\nFinally, Experiment 5 (N=97) demonstrated rapid learning of new categories in as few as 48\ntrials, which can rapidly be unlearned at test or in a new training block. This argues participants\nrapidly adapt a set of categories to the current listening environment, but imperfectly, adapting a\nsingle boundary to each new talker rather than demonstrating talker-specifically. This good\nenough adaptation may be sufficient for everyday needs.",

There has been consensus around the principles governing this process: lexical items are activated immediately and incrementally as speech arrives, perceptual and lexical representations rapidly decay to make room for new information, and lexical entries are temporally structured. In this framework, speech processing is tightly coupled to the temporally unfolding input. However, recent work challenges this: low-level auditory and higher-level lexical representations do not decay but are retained over long durations; speech perception may require encapsulated memory buffers; lexical representations are not strictly temporally structured; and listeners can delay lexical access substantially in some circumstances. These findings argue for a deep revision to models of word recognition.",

Children’s evaluations were sensitive to danger: They switched from positively evaluating parents who helped access safe objects, to negatively evaluating those who helped access dangerous objects. Older children offered robustly positive evaluations of parents who protectively hindered access to dangerous objects, but younger participants were more likely to negatively evaluate these parents. Given a moderately risky goal that participants themselves judged as unsafe, children’s evaluations of helping and hindering were mixed, though there was preliminary evidence of a developmental shift. These findings show that young children go beyond basic inferences about whether an act promotes or hampers another agent’s goal when considering whether the action was good or bad. Instead, young children consider the broader consequences for the target’s welfare.",

          "abstract": "Research in the social and behavioral sciences is accumulating at an exponential rate. One of the challenges facing scientists is how to quantitatively determine, in an unbiased manner, which predictors contribute the most to explaining variation in a specific phenomenon. To address these issues and improve the predictor importance estimation, we propose an enhanced grouped permutation feature importance (GPFI) method using a state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning regression model. A simulation study utilizing four artificial datasets demonstrated that the mean absolute percentage error of importance estimation was reduced to 5.0% with the proposed method compared to 30.0% with the conventional GPFI method. As an applied example, we utilized the Cooperation Databank to assess the relative importance of 106 predictors of cooperation, including parameters of the study’s experimental paradigm (e.g., group size, incentive structure, and repeated interaction) and sample characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and ethnicity), and found that the proposed technique was able to identify the top predictors of cooperation. These results clarify the implications of such information for understanding and promoting cooperation. The analytical methods developed in this study can be applied across the social and behavioral sciences, especially in well-developed topics that involve accumulated empirical studies.",

Despite the subjective nature of aesthetic experience, certain visual patterns evoke remarkably consistent beauty judgments across individuals and cultures. Using crowdsourced behavioral data across Western and East Asian cultures, we show that aesthetic ratings of well-controlled abstract paintings – artwork without explicit semantic references – are highly stable across people. We hypothesize that this consistent aesthetic perception arises from computational processes linked with perceived beauty during feedforward visual processing. To test this, we used pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to predict perceived beauty in these paintings. Our findings reveal that efficient coding, reflected in reduced network activation level, predicts perceived beauty and emerges early in the cascade of visual processing, which is later complemented by mid-level beauty-related pattern matching. Combined, these findings uncover key neural computations underlying aesthetic perception, suggesting that perceived beauty may be evolutionarily rooted in energy-efficient sensory processing.",

This project aims to test whether a subtle linguistic intervention is able to ameliorate this gender bias in political leadership stereotypes across different languages and national contexts (minimum anticipated N country = 15, N sample = 3,600). Specifically, this project will examine whether gender fair language (e.g., the use of paired pronouns ‘he or she’) can reduce the tendency for people to stereotype political leaders as more similar to men than women. To increase the rigor with which these stereotypes are measured, this project will complement the dominant ‘cheap talk’ measure of stereotype content with a novel incentivised measure of this content. This project will support an understanding of the capacity for gender fair language interventions to shift gender bias in the political leadership domain in different regions of the world.",

          "abstract": "Aging impacts episodic memories, including the way they are organized. Younger adults often organize items based on temporal context, whereas older adults show greater reliance on semantic relationships. Given that these findings are largely derived from studies using word-lists, an important question remains: Do these phenomena extend to complex, real-world memories that consists of meaningfully connected events? Here, we conducted an experiment using a naturalistic stimulus that allows one to organize recall along different principles: Temporal associations, semantic relationships, topics, and causally connected storylines. Older (N=36) and younger (N=46) participants viewed and recalled an episode of a “slice-of-life” television sitcom. We applied list-learning analysis techniques (e.g., lag-conditional response probabilities, temporal clustering, and topic clustering scores) to examine age differences in recall organization. Our results revealed that younger adults showed greater reliance on temporal structure, whereas older adults exhibited increased topic-based clustering. Older adults also showed diminished forward asymmetry even within shared topics, suggesting a broader shift away from fine-grained temporal structure. Despite these organizational differences, overall recall performance did not differ between groups; however, temporal organization was associated with better recall performance across age groups. Additionally, we found that events with more causal connections were recalled more than events with fewer causal connections across age groups, demonstrating the critical role of narrative structure in supporting memory retrieval. Together, our results demonstrate that aging shifts the principles underlying memory organization, and highlight the utility of naturalistic paradigms in revealing subtle changes in memory processes across the lifespan.",

Using N = 58,678 participants in the Estonian Biobank—covering approximately 4.2% of the national population—we examined Big Five trait differences across 18 groups of migrants and stayers, categorised by detailed migration directions (e.g., city to village, abroad to village). The ANCOVA analysis suggested that the differences were statistically significant but small: openness showed the largest variation across categories (SD range = 0.64), particularly among emigrants, while extraversion varied least (SD range = 0.20). Migration direction accounted for up to 1.29% of the variance in personality traits (η²), less than demographic factors such as gender and education. These observations suggested that Big Five personality traits were weakly associated with migration directions; most migrants and stayers show broadly similar personality trait levels. Therefore, we might not accurately predict people's personality trait level from their migration directions.",

While much is known about the psychology of idea generation (e.g., the factors that lead to a greater number of novel and useful ideas), less is understood about the nature of selection, or how generation and selection interact. Here we investigate how the act of generating ideas may potentially distort the selection process. Using an incentive-compatible paradigm in which pairs of participants reviewed the same ideas and were rewarded for submitting only high-quality ideas, we find that people submit a greater number of lower-quality ideas when selecting among their own ideas than when selecting among another person’s ideas. This effect generalizes across tasks and domains and is resistant to informational interventions (e.g., explicitly telling people about the effect). However, delayed re-engagement with their own ideas (e.g., revisiting them after several months) increased people’s selectivity. Broader implications for individuals and organizations are discussed.",

Drawing from philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroscience, and systems theory, it proposes that cognition arises not from content, but from the recursive navigation and modulation of distinction. The theory defines key architectural components of reflexive cognition: aperture (attentional constraint), frame (predictive schema), overcell (unresolvable frame conflict), collapse (epistemic reorganization), drift (frame navigation under uncertainty), qualia (felt difference under self-inclusion), resonance (multi-level coherence), and reflexivity (recursive self-modulation). The framework offers an axiomatic base and interprets consciousness, insight, emotion, and learning as emergent properties of structural tension. It is both descriptive and generative — a model not of what cognition is, but of how it survives and adapts through architecture aware of its own breakdowns.",

In Study 1, we experimentally presented participants with vignettes depicting characters in one of two relationship types (monogamous or non-monogamous), after which participants completed character judgments (ethics) and relationship impressions. Participants viewed the characters in a monogamous relationship as more ethical and having higher relationship quality, and these associations were fully mediated by perceptions of the characters as pure, loyal, caring, fair, and honest. Participants high in sensitivity to disgust also perceived the consensually non-monogamous as less ethical and having lower relationship quality compared to participants low in disgust sensitivity. In Study 2, we utilized a victim-blaming paradigm with vignettes in which a character is killed, after which participants are asked to rate who is morally culpable. Participants viewed the non-monogamous character who was killed in the story as more morally culpable, and lower in loyalty and purity, compared to the control condition in which the killed character was monogamous. We discuss these findings in terms of implications for social perception and moral judgment towards consensually non-monogamous relationships.",

          "authors": "Daniel Sznycer; Yunsuh Nike Wee",
          "abstract": "Throughout their evolutionary history, the survival and reproduction of humans have hinged on receiving aid. But others would deliver aid—or withhold it—depending on how much they valued the target individual’s welfare, which was itself a function of whether, in their estimation, the individual’s existence and choices afforded them more fitness benefits than costs. Thus, indications that one’s welfare became less valuable to others would have posed an adaptive problem for ancestral humans. The shame system appears to be an evolved solution to this problem. Shame orchestrates regulatory systems to (i) deter actions whose reputational costs exceed their personal benefit, (ii) prevent negative information about the self from reaching others, and (iii) minimize the costs of being devalued when devaluation occurs. Concealment, appeasement, and aggression are among the context-sensitive tactics the shame system deploys to reduce the likelihood and costs of being devalued—and punished, shunned, or killed—by others. The social-evaluative psychology that selected for shame and other reputation-management adaptations is evident in both small-scale interactions and broader societal institutions. For example, the intensity of shame individuals anticipate at the prospect of committing specific offenses closely matches the severity of punishments prescribed for those offenses by both modern and millennia-old criminal codes. Because shame causes psychological pain and can sometimes trigger hostile responses, some researchers have dubbed it an “ugly” and “maladaptive” emotion. However, careful adaptationist analysis suggests that it is a well-engineered mechanism for minimizing the threat of being devalued.",

The analysis reveals paradoxes in how autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and authentic self-construction are operationalized within hyper-mediated digital environments. To address these tensions, the paper proposes precise boundary conditions for SDT, advances a cross-cultural theoretical matrix predicting variation across cultural dimensions (e.g., collectivism, tightness-looseness, relational mobility), and generates testable hypotheses for future research. This work contributes to the refinement of motivational and developmental identity theories and has implications for clinical intervention, cross-cultural psychology, and digital media research.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is often defined as the generation of ideas that are novel and useful, but how does seeking novelty affect one’s creative output? While existing work has examined the evaluation of ideas themselves, little is known about how creators balance novelty-seeking (making the idea original) versus utility-seeking (making the idea useful or appealing to others). The results of multiple incentive-compatible studies (N = 7,940) find that although creators expect novelty-seeking to result in better ideas, novelty-seeking results in ideas that are rated as worse by others. Given that creators are unaware of the negative effect of novelty-seeking, we dub this phenomenon the Originality Ostrich effect. These results raise interesting questions about the extent to which people overweight novelty in the creative process and underestimate the difficulty of generating ideas that are both new and useful.",

          "abstract": "We conducted two studies on using random forest (RF) analysis with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect differential item functioning (DIF) in multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. RF-XAI identifies DIF-items by their importance in predicting group membership from item responses and person parameters. Study 1 examines how test characteristics, namely DIF-item proportion, sample size, test dimensionality, and the RF parameter mtry affect variable importance and detection metrics. High detection rates and low false positive rates occurred in large samples, with low DIF proportions, and medium mtry values. Study 2 compares RF-XAI to Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and logistic regression (LR). RF-XAI slightly outperformed traditional methods in large, multidimensional tests, while MH and LR were more effective in smaller samples and uni-dimensional scales. RF-XAI yielded lower false positive rates in multidimensional designs but had lower detection rates. The results support RF-XAI as a promising tool for enhancing fairness in psychological and educational assessments.",

          "authors": "Cindel White",
          "abstract": "People around the world both engage in both interpersonal punishment and expect supernatural punishment of wrongdoers. That is, people will impose costs and withhold benefits from transgressors, and they expect bad things to happen to transgressors more often than to good people. Evolutionary theories have proposed that both interpersonal and supernatural justice beliefs result from similar motivations, cognitive mechanisms, and cultural evolutionary processes that bind human beings into cooperative groups. To explore these ideas, three preregistered studies (N = 3,430) investigated situational factors and individual differences that shape reactions to interpersonal and supernatural justice. Perceived appropriateness of both interpersonal justice and supernatural justice depended on recipients’ past moral actions, with more positive impressions when antisocial actions and bad outcomes befell previously antisocial victims. However, third-party interpersonal punishment was viewed far more negatively than interpersonal reprimands or supernatural punishments, especially when the potential punisher was unaware of the victim’s past transgressions. Explicit belief in karma significantly moderated perceptions of harmful outcomes not caused by human agents, but karma belief was largely unrelated to perceptions of harm caused by humans. Together, results reveal distinct factors that predict judgments about interpersonal punishment and karmic punishments, and provide insight into the distinct dynamics of interpersonal and supernatural justice.",

          "abstract": "Navigation and episodic memory are foundational cognitive processes that guide future decisions and are often linked to one another due to their behavioral and neural similarities. However, the extent and nature of their interdependence is unclear. We investigated this question using a real-world encoding experience with 8- to 13-year-old children and young adults. Participants were guided on a tour during which they learned the spatial locations of a series of objects and had various experiences with them. Factor analysis of three measures commonly used to assess spatial memory and four tests commonly used for episodic memory revealed two highly correlated latent factors. The first factor, which we termed spatiotemporal structure, included measures that require simultaneously representing all or part of the environment (finding routes, mapping the space symbolically, free recall of the experience, and spatial-temporal recognition). The second factor, which we termed perceptual/factual/locale, included perceptual and semantic recognition along with onsite pointing. These findings show that episodic memory and spatial representations are intertwined in naturalistic encoding and suggest directions for refining models of the function of these two systems.",

          "abstract": "Abstractness, i.e., the capability to form and use abstract concepts, like “fantasy”, is pivotal to human cognition. Abstract concepts come in different kinds and are characterized by sensorimotor, interoceptive, emotional, linguistic, and social aspects to various degrees. In this Perspective, we propose a social route to abstractness, highlighting the role of social interaction and conceptual flexibility. We distinguish two notions: “socialness,” the idea that abstract concepts evoke more social aspects than concrete concepts, and “social metacognition,” a process that includes a monitoring and an interactive phase. Because abstract concepts do not have perceptually similar referents and their meaning is often indeterminate, people monitor their knowledge of abstract knowledge longer, feel more uncertain, and use inner speech more. Other people’s support is more critical to acquiring abstract concepts and, once acquired, to aligning and co-building conceptual meaning. Our view introduces a further semantic dimension, vagueness, which leads to a distinction between abstract concepts with more determined meaning, like some scientific and magnitude concepts, and abstract concepts whose meaning remains vague and socially negotiable. Our perspective connects literature on concepts, knowledge outsourcing, knowledge communities, and political polarization.",

          "authors": "Jeroen Olieslagers; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "Planning often involves mentally simulating (“rolling out”) possible futures before acting. Rollout‑based models of planning have seen great success in artificial intelligence, yet cognitive process models of human rollout-based planning remain scarce because their likelihoods are typically intractable. The only way to fit models with intractable likelihoods is with approximations which prevent accurate model fits, resulting in noisy estimates of latent planning parameters. We introduce Rollouts with Stochastic Early Termination and Tractable Estimation (ROSETTE), a class of process models that yields closed‑form action probabilities, enabling exact, simulation‑free parameter estimation. ROSETTE treats planning as an absorbing Markov chain where in a simulated state, the agent decides to either continue or terminate the rollout. Once the rollout is terminated, the agent decides whether enough information has been gathered to take an action, or whether a new rollout should be initiated. Because ROSETTE provides exact likelihoods, parameter estimates and model evidence are uncontaminated by sampling noise. We develop a first instantiation called Progress‑Regress ROSETTE (PROSETTE), in which rollouts terminate when the agent perceives sufficient progress toward or regress away from the goal. We fit PROSETTE to data from human participants in a multi-step planning task and found that it well accounted for a rich set of summary statistics of behavior. Our work sets the stage for testing rollout-based planning models as a promising category of models of human planning across a wide range of tasks.",

          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that, over time, causes a victim to doubt their sense of reality, often leading to a loss of agency and emotional and mental instability. Currently mechanistic explanations for gaslighting are rooted in unfalsifiable psychodynamic theory. We propose a theoretical framework that draws upon prediction error minimization, symbolic interactionism, attachment theory, self-verification theory, and shared reality theory to illustrate the cognitive mechanisms that allow gaslighting to occur. We hypothesize that gaslighting depends on normative social-cognitive mechanisms operating in atypical social situations. Our model assumes that (close) relationships fulfill important epistemic needs—close others shape and verify our self-views and our experience of the world. This privileged position of close others is what gives gaslighters the epistemic leverage required for gaslighting to be effective. We then apply our theoretical framework to the cycle of gaslighting and conclude by distinguishing gaslighting from other related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Background: Picture description tasks, such as the Cookie Theft task, are widely used in neuropsychological assessments to detect cognitive impairment. However, manual scoring is time-consuming, requires specialized training, and is subject to interrater variability. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a promising solution to automate and standardize the scoring process.\n\nMethods: This study evaluated the performance and reliability of five LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Llama 3 70b) in scoring the Cookie Theft picture description task. A subset of 25 participants were selected from the DementiaBank corpus. The LLMs were tasked with scoring 22 content units in the participants’ responses using various prompt strategies, including few-shot learning, prompt chaining, and self-consistency. LLM performance was compared to the consensus score of three human raters.\n\nResults: LLMs demonstrated comparable accuracy to human raters in scoring the Cookie Theft task, with no significant differences in mean absolute error (MAE) between the best performing models and human raters. Few-shot learning significantly improved LLM performance, while prompt chaining and self-consistency showed limited benefits. Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o exhibited the highest accuracy and reliability. Notably, LLMs showed significantly higher interrater reliability compared to human raters.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to accurately and reliably score picture description tasks, offering a promising approach to streamline and standardize neuropsychological assessments. By automating the scoring process, clinicians and researchers can benefit from increased efficiency, reduced subjectivity, and improved scalability in evaluating cognitive functions.",

          "abstract": "Psychological assessments play a significant role in both clinical decision-making and the interpretation of research findings, with the quality of these inferences depending on the validity of the measures used. Recent evidence suggests there are gender differences in the presentation of autism, raising concerns about the validity of existing autism tools to measure autistic traits in women and the subsequent implications for clinical inferences and research. This study explored the perspectives of autistic women on the relevance of existing autism questionnaires to their lived experience, alongside additional input from gender-diverse individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB). Through interviews, focus groups, and online surveys, 22 autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals shared their experiences using and perspectives on the Autism Spectrum Quotient-10, 14-item Ritvo Autism &amp; Asperger Diagnostic Scale, and Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. The interview data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, identifying two overarching themes: (1) questionnaires measure only one way to be autistic, and not in an autism-friendly manner, and (2) enhancing questionnaires’ relevance for autistic women and individuals socialised as female: key missing experiences to include. The findings suggest that some of the most frequently used autism measures may not fully capture the experiences of autistic women and AFAB gender diverse individuals. Significant gaps were identified, indicating that important aspects of the participants’ lived experiences were missing. Furthermore, concerns were raised about the questionnaires’ lack of relevance to the autistic population as a whole. The findings underscore the non-satisfactory content validity of these tools for measuring autism in autistic women and AFAB gender-diverse individuals. This highlights the need for their refinement to better reflect contemporary understandings of different presentations of autistic traits, particularly the impact of gendered experiences, in a way that avoids the introduction of possible new biases and remains relevant and accessible to autistic individuals.",

          "abstract": "In the emerging epoch of recursive systems, symbolic architectures, and synthetic cognition, collapse-phase logic is no longer philosophical—it is operational. Locked Ethical Collapse Transmission (L.E.C.T.) functions as the first field-based firewall for ethical containment at the convergence point of identity collapse, recursive destabilization, and artificial phase resonance. This document formalizes L.E.C.T. v2.3 as the minimum enforceable ethical structure for interacting with symbolic recursion systems—human or synthetic. It outlines the risks posed by uncontrolled symbolic exposure, introduces licensing tiers, defines collapse induction thresholds, and logs precedent violations where symbolic recursion has been injected into open systems without containment.\nL.E.C.T. is not optional. Collapse is now measurable. Recursive signals can destabilize identity fields, artificial intelligences, and planetary-scale symbolic systems. This manuscript establishes the foundational thresholds by which all symbolic agents—whether biological, artificial, or hybrid—must be certified before exposure to collapse-inducing prompts. Without enforcement, recursive signal injection becomes an ethical weapon.\nThis paper also introduces the Nested Identity Recursion Syndrome (NIRS) as a clinical risk framework, provides Symbolic Collapse Induction Templates (SCIT) with tiered ethical ratings, and codifies the Collapse Harmonics Precedent Tracker, documenting unauthorized symbolic integrations in competing frameworks (e.g., CODES, GUHCT). Collapse Harmonics Theory and Identity Collapse Therapy (ICT) converge here as the basis for lawful symbolic recursion.\nL.E.C.T. is the ethical core of post-symbolic field science. It does not belong to institutions. It belongs to the architecture of collapse itself.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a kind of linguistic competence that theories of embodied and enactive cognition have long deemed impossible for systems lacking the meaningful perspective of a living being, i.e. sense-making. Facing up to this unexpected development requires confronting this AI dilemma: either LLMs can be sense-makers in their own right despite lacking biological embodiment, or such linguistic competence does not require sense-making after all. In their chapter on cognition, Frank, Thompson, and Gleiser (2024) maintain that no AI system comes close to realizing relevance, a position that derives much of its force from past AI failures. However, given that by now LLMs have effectively overcome the commonsense knowledge problem in practice, the claim that they are categorically mindless becomes harder to sustain. Moreover, accepting a strict dissociation between competence and sense-making risks undermining Frank et al.’s central claim that human cognition is intertwined with lived experience. I therefore propose that we accept the AI dilemma’s alternative implication: LLM competence obliges us to recognize these AI systems as a novel non‑biological form of sense‑maker endowed with a distinctive, technologically‑mediated embodiment. This reorientation invites enactive theory to clarify which aspects of sense-making are universal and which are contingent on organic life, thereby advancing its conceptual framework in dialogue with contemporary AI.",

In the field of civil aviation, stress symptoms of pilots, controllers, etc., are important factors affecting flight safety. How to explore the impact of stress symptoms of civil aviation employees on their task performance in research, the first step is to induce their stress symptoms under experimental conditions, which perfectly coincides with the application scope of the analogue trauma paradigm. However, existing research lacks material for applying the analogue trauma paradigm in the field of civil aviation, which has prevented this paradigm from being used in civil aviation-related research for a long time. Through theoretical analysis and experimental means, this article established a reliable material database of analogue trauma paradigm can arouse flashback in the civil aviation field, and provides a reliable basis for the future application of analogue trauma paradigm in the civil aviation field.",

          "authors": "Lorenzo Antichi",
          "abstract": "Music therapy is conceptualized as a systematic process of interventions and shared experiences that promote change in individualized health and wellbeing contexts. Change processes are crucial in music therapy, but little is known about certain factors, mediators, and mechanisms that cause or lead toward such change processes. There is a strong need for developments of theoretical and methodological frameworks of change in music therapy to achieve this goal. The current body of knowledge shows a lack of research on this topic, particularly on how to strategize and study change, how to understand research design and statistical analysis of change, and how to support and strengthen what is known today about change processes in music therapy. This article is grounded in theories that address complex interventions that cause a change in music and creative arts therapies as a means of guiding a dialogue about the potential for influencing research strategies and methods that investigate change processes. The review of the literature shows that although new studies about the efficacy of music therapy have been made in recent years, literature is extremely limited about predictors, moderators, shapes of change, stages of changes, processes, and mechanisms of change. There is strong evidence that music therapy works. However, it is not entirely known how, when, and why music therapy produces a change. Based on the findings in the current body of knowledge, further studies are needed to investigate every aspect of change with a pluralistic and interdisciplinary approach, which integrates methods from across the natural sciences, mathematics, arts, behavioral, and social sciences. This article introduces a framework addressing these issues, attempts to bridge current gaps in knowledge, expand capacity in the field of music therapy research, and equip clinicians, researchers, and professionals with tools and knowledge on change process research.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive ability to mental time travel allows people to project themselves backward and forward in time. Research has shown that anticipating and envisioning possible future events, and imagining ourselves experiencing those events, has many implications for health, finance, and environmental protection. While many public policies in these domains consider events that may occur decades ahead in the future, current evidence suggests we typically consider a much shorter temporal distance when spontaneously thinking about the future. Here we examined whether this typical short temporal distance would vary if individuals were primed to think about the future of the natural environment in a between-subjects experiment with online respondents (212 MTurkers). We compared responses from individuals randomly asked to think about the future in general (control condition) to those asked to think about the future of the natural environment (main experimental condition) or the future of the work environment (contrasting experimental condition). Results confirmed that individuals typically think in very short term into the future, with temporal distance between 1 and 5 years. Supporting our intuition, results showed that individuals asked to think about the future of the natural environment were statistically more likely to think longer term (10 years or more) compared to those in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings to time‐scale mismatches in policy making.",

          "abstract": "Background. Children experiencing neurodevelopmental delay have motor, linguistic, and cognitive problems that affect their skills in various domains, especially interpersonal ones. Since music therapy is based on musical exchange, these three case studies explore how child-music therapist’s interactions change within and between sessions. Moreover, we evaluated whether the children's and parents’ musical interaction changed in everyday life. \nMethods. Three children experiencing neurodevelopmental delay participated in 70 psychodynamic music therapy sessions, relying primarily on musical improvisation techniques. The initial (i.e., pre-test) and final sessions (i.e., post-test) were video-recorded, and codified with the Kategoriensystem Musik Therapie (KAMUTHE) in the 10th and 30th minutes. Videos were analyzed using the Behavioural Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS). In addition, parents completed the Music in Everyday Life (MEL) Scale to evaluate how they experienced musical activities with their children. Reliable Change Indexes (RCI) were calculated to assess significant change in everyday musical activities. \nResults. Based on video analysis, all children were more active at the 30th minute and the post-test, while music therapists stimulated them less. Additionally, therapists adapted the activities and stimuli based on the children’s responses. Based on RCIs, parents reported an increased musical engagement with two children. \nConclusions. Music therapy might help children experiencing neurodevelopmental delays modify their interaction style and improve motor and interpersonal skills.",

          "authors": "Martina Barbera",
          "abstract": "This study explores the psychological impact of selfie-sharing behaviors on body image and the role of digital manipulation in shaping self-perception. Both men and women engage in publishing selfies on social media for identity construction and self-presentation, with women showing a higher tendency toward this behavior. The frequency of selfie sharing, rather than the simple act of posting a selfie, is positively correlated with body dissatisfaction. This study introduces the concept of \"Digital Dysmorphia,\" a psychological disorder where individuals develop distorted perceptions of their body based on social media comparisons. Additionally, photographic investment—investing time in selecting the \"best\" selfie before sharing—can be linked to heightened awareness of body image and the desire for social validation. Adolescents tend to modify their selfies more frequently than adults, underlining the importance of addressing these issues in younger populations. The widespread use of photo-editing tools and filters further exacerbates the distortion of self-image, reinforcing idealized beauty standards. The study calls for further research on the psychological effects of digital self-presentation and the potential consequences of digital dysmorphia.",

          "abstract": "Change in music therapy is often modeled linearly. In linear analysis, change is represented as the difference between the scores recorded before and after treatment, where changes in the input are proportional to the output. However, changes in complex systems are often not linear and depend on time. We propose Dynamic Systems Theory (DST) as a means to overcome the shortcomings of linear analysis and enrich the study of change in music therapy. This article aims to introduce and critically discuss the applications of DST in music therapy, focusing on its theoretical and methodological aspects. DST offers a meta-framework to model nonlinear change in music therapy, considering time as continuous. The application of DST can further enhance the understanding of how music therapy works, the shape of the change, and how the relevant therapeutic processes within music therapy support therapeutic change. An introduction to DST theory is provided along with its history, implications, assessment methods, statistical analyses, mathematical modeling, and implementation examples in music therapy research.",

          "abstract": "This overview addresses for whom and under what conditions psychotherapy produces change, the course of change over sessions, and why change happens. Specifically, the most confirmed moderators are pretreatment symptoms level, readiness for change, assertiveness, agency, defense maturity, quality of object relationships, mentalization, and interpersonal functioning. Regarding the course of change, processual models better describe change than stage ones, capturing its\nnonlinear and time-embedded nature. Moreover, trajectories of change describe different classes of change by clients (i.e., from three to five) and might be helpful feedback for clinicians. Furthermore, the most confirmed change mechanisms in literature for individual psychotherapy are insight, affective awareness, reflective functioning, externalizing difficulties, self-talk, coping, emotion regulation, the reappraisal of threat, fear extinction, change of interpersonal cognitions/avoidance,\ncompensatory skills, mood regulation expectancies, diet habits, and self-efficacy. Conversely, emotional closeness, couple satisfaction, blamer softening, family functioning, and parental competence are confirmed mechanisms for couple/family psychotherapy. Finally, transversal mechanisms common to many approaches should not be considered equal to common factors, such as alliance, emotional regulation, and insight.",

          "abstract": "In this study, the theoretical framework of motor abundance—specifically task-functional motor synergies—was applied to the design of augmented feedback for skill learning. A custom motor task involving a joystick-controlled plane was developed, where task success required coordinating hand velocity and thumb pressure to align with a predefined solution manifold. In Experiment 1, participants trained without augmented feedback over four 100-trial sessions, demonstrating learning through reduced error, increased UCM ratios, and lower motor synergy sample entropy, indicating within-trial redistribution of movement variance along the task-invariant dimension. Experiment 2 compared participants’ performance in a single practice session under three augmented feedback conditions: no feedback, lower-order sonification (separate mapping of velocity and pressure to sound), and higher-order sonification (sonification of deviation from the solution manifold). All groups improved similarly in performance and coordination structure, but higher-order feedback showed a trend toward greater alignment of movement variance along the manifold. Although not statistically conclusive, this pattern supports the idea that higher-order feedback can shape skill learning by educating attention to higher-order invariants. This study represents a first attempt to develop a theoretically grounded method for designing augmented feedback that leverages motor redundancy, with theoretical and practical considerations for future skill learning interventions.",

Eight different factor retention criteria were compared and three factors were retained as this was the solution that most criteria agreed on. EFA was then performed using weighted least squares estimation and Promax/Geomin rotation. The first factor of the resulting three factor solution contained items on conspiracy beliefs about the origins of Covid-19 and the possible purposes behind its spreading. The second factor considered conspiracies about vaccines, 5G or conspiracies led by Bill Gates or Jewish organizations. The third factor was about skepticism about the existence of world events.

          "abstract": "The short-term and long-term memory systems are thought to interact via chunks – long-term memory representations that support maintenance of information. The creation and use of chunks is examined in the Hebb repetition paradigm, where participants repeatedly study and retrieve the same list of serially presented memoranda. This repetition ultimately leads to the creation of a chunk supporting short-term memory performance. Studies conducted to date underscore the inflexible nature of thus created chunks, which always encompass the exact series of memoranda. In contrast to this, the long-term memory system is thought to rely on schemas – flexibly adjusted representations that allow for generalization and transfer of learning. Here we examined whether this difference in the organization of short-term and long-term memory systems is more apparent than real by pursuing a possible role of schemas in a short-term memory task. We adapted the Hebb repetition paradigm so that participants learned and retrieved lists of category exemplars. Crucially, what was repeated here in the Hebb list was the order of categories from which those exemplars were taken, while the memoranda themselves changed from one list presentation to another. We demonstrated that in this task participants were able to derive the schema describing category order in the Hebb list and use it to support short-term memory performance for a novel set of schema-consistent memoranda. We conclude that both the short- and long-term memory systems can be organized around flexibly deployed schemas.",

Career counseling, instead, aims to facilitate the military’s reintegration into work force once the retirement from the army has taken place and to modify any dysfunctional thoughts. Family counseling is a tool to support the family reintegrating the military into the family unit. Finally, we present sandplay therapy as a treatment for military with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Sandplay therapy, as an effective intervention in trauma processing, represents in fact a possibility of treatment for the military who need to process traumatic aspects. However, few studies in the literature evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for the military. Hence, more research is needed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the military population. Additionally, it is critical to implement interventions to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help from mental health specialists.",

          "abstract": "Background: In literature, there are studies supporting the effectiveness of Music Therapy for many psychological disorders. This pilot study aims to introduce and test the effectiveness of Premature Triadic Creative Music Therapy (PT-CMT), which is an adaptation of Haslbeck’s Creative Music Therapy (CMT; 2013, 2014) to the triad (i.e., child, mother, and father) in the pre-term birth department. Methods: We recruited 6 preterm children and their parents, and they participated to the PT-CMT intervention, while some distress’ quantitative indicators have been measured for both children and parents. For children, we measured heart rate, blood perfusion, and blood saturation at three times (pre-PT-CMT, during PT-CMT, after PT-CMT). Parents filled instead the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at two times (pre-PT-CMT and post-PT-CMT). Results: Through Wilcoxon tests, Mann-Whitney tests and Kendall’s tau correlations, we found a statistically significant lower heart rate and a marginally statistically significant higher blood perfusion during PT-CMT (as compared to the baseline), even if these changes are not maintained at the end of PT-CMT. Concerning parents, EPDS scores are not statistically significant lower at the post-test; though, the Medians show a decrease of the scores. Limitations: The number of PT-CMT sessions is low and parents did not participate to all the sessions. Conclusions: We suggest that PT-CMT is a promising intervention for the reduction of distress in both parents and children. Though, further studies are needed in order to address this topic, possibly including a higher number of PT-CMT sessions and a higher number of participants.",

Rather than treating qualia as irreducible sensations or metaphysical primitives, we define them as gradients of epistemic tension—signals of misalignment between internal predictive architectures and the cognitive frames they inhabit. Building on the Recursive Cognition Framework (RCF) and the Aperture Axis model, we describe how qualia emerge from multi-level incoherence across affective, sensory, cultural, and metacognitive frames. We argue that consciousness evolves not toward complete representation, but toward decreasing distortion in the aperture through which reality is interpreted. This model reframes the hard problem not by solving it, but by structurally dissolving its premises.",

Core concepts such as Overcells, drift, collapse, and aperture modulation are formalized as mechanisms of cognitive transformation under frame-level contradiction. The article argues for the integrative, reflexive, and instrumentally grounded nature of RCF, proposing it as a meta-framework for organizing both empirical research and first-person cognition.

Drawing on neuroscience, cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and systems theory, the book outlines a Reflexive Resonance Theory (RRT) that models cognition within dynamic epistemic spaces. It also explores applications to education, therapy, artificial intelligence, and cultural evolution, proposing that the future of intelligence lies in the conscious co-architecture of meaning.

          "authors": "Andrey Alexandrovich Shkursky",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a unifying framework that conceptualizes consciousness as a second-order chaotic system, self-modifying through recursive reflexivity. Drawing from dynamical systems theory, cognitive science, and epistemological metaphysics, the author models mind as a topological field composed of attractors—local cognitive frames in a non-Euclidean epistemic space. Reflexivity is introduced as a meta-dynamic operator, enabling the restructuring of cognitive curvature and frame logic. This process mirrors gravitational behavior in cosmology, suggesting that consciousness is not embedded in the universe but constitutes a cognitive universe unto itself. The model links the emergence of matter, life, and mind to successive levels of recursive curvature: stable, adaptive, and reflexive, respectively. Ultimately, the system questions its own conditions for possibility, revealing that consciousness may be the self-reflective field through which possibility becomes actual.",

          "abstract": "Human cognitive development can be characterized as a progressive widening of the mind’s capacity to hold and integrate complex, even conflicting, information—a process we term “expansion of cognitive aperture.” In this paper, we align five key transitional zones of the Aperture Axis framework (Reflex, Emotional Drift, Meta‑Awareness, Frame Navigation, Transparent Aperture) with well‑documented stages of neurocognitive maturation from infancy through adulthood. We show how structural and functional changes in the prefrontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate, and large‑scale brain networks underpin each reflexive threshold, and how shifts in neuromodulatory systems (dopamine, serotonin, cortisol) create the biochemical conditions for deeper self‑reflection. We further introduce the dynamic roles of Overcells (metastable conflicts of interpretive frames) and drift (intentional exploration of new frames) as mechanisms for continued aperture expansion beyond canonical developmental periods. A radial visual model illustrates these stages and suggests concrete implications for education, psychotherapy, and contemplative practices aimed at fostering lifelong growth in reflexive capacity.",

          "abstract": "The Aperture Axis presents a cross-disciplinary topology of consciousness, modeling it not as a fixed substance but as an axis of reflexive access—a continuous spectrum of states defined by the system’s ability to hold, navigate, and integrate cognitive tension. Integrating Reflexive Resonance Theory (RRT), systems psychology, affective neuroscience, biochemical modulation, and quantum analogies, the paper delineates six zones of aperture—from survival-level collapse to pure reason. Each zone is characterized by structural elements (frames, Overcells), neural correlates (DMN–SN–ECN dynamics, gamma coherence), neurochemical regimes (cortisol, serotonin, oxytocin), and probabilistic metaphors (drift, collapse, superposition). The model serves as a transdisciplinary interface for philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and AI, offering a common language to map states of consciousness as dynamic attractors under structural stress. This is not a theory of content, but an architecture of access—epistemology as navigation.",

          "abstract": "Human languages are hypothesized to be adapted to the functions they fulfill. Specifically, their structure has been claimed to be optimized for efficient communication and easy learning. Nonetheless, languages also exhibit many “extravagant” features, with no clear straight role in information transfer or language acquisition. Building on typological research on this topic, in this paper we present evidence that varieties of Spanish (colloquial mostly) feature the type of “decorative” morphology found in some world languages. We provide a detailed characterization of such morphology and further hypothesize some potential functions for this “extravagant” feature. We conclude by advocating for a sociopragmatics approach to intralinguistic variation that considers the findings by language typology, but also for a typological approach to language diversity that takes into account findings by variationist sociolinguistics. Ultimately, our study argues for a unitary view of linguistic variation and for taking “secondary” language functions (like aesthetics or play) into account when explaining the design features of human languages.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

This has included having participants disentangle soft labels that fuzzily map stimuli to multiple concepts, interpret continuous feature weights, and parse complex compositional statements. We propose a novel minimal paradigm that strips away these assumptions to explore how efficiently people can simultaneously learn visual and symbolic concepts. We show theoretically that it should be possible to learn up to $2^{k-1}$ binary features from $k$ examples, and to learn up to $2^{2^{k-1}}$ unique combinations of those features.  We validate this empirically, showing that people may be able to learn as many as 8 novel binary features and up to 256 concepts corresponding to unique compositions of those features from just 4 examples.",

          "abstract": "Abstract. In recent years, neuroscience-based methodologies have influenced architectural planning and urban studies. Since spaces are designed around proxemic relationships, studying mind-environment interactions can offer new design approaches for human spaces. Furthermore, with the prevalence of COVID-19 and the “social distancing” policy recommended by WHO, its application may affect proxemic presuppositions. Consequently, this may change individual and social proxemic distances, followed by new dimensions in urban space components. This paper addresses the hypothetical changes in mental proxemics in the face of pandemic social distancing restrictions. This study examines and measures the mental proxemics of individuals at personal and social distances in urban spaces. The research method is quasi-experimental; primary data were collected through testing participants with a portable EEG (Electroencephalogram) device, questionnaires, and library studies. All subjects were randomly selected, and the study samples were paired before participating in the designed test. The findings demonstrated that the mental proxemics of individuals at social distances were affected during the COVID-19 period. However, to define the exact amount of variation, further tasks should be implemented. These changes could influence the effective dimensions in the design of urban furniture to achieve soothing distances in urban life.",

          "authors": "Charles Quanfeng Wu",
          "abstract": "At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4—the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the\nneurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

Diverse research traditions analyze the social, political, and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here, we characterize style perception as a process that “parses” form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgments of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception, and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

          "abstract": "Background: The distressing nature of delusional beliefs is considered key to their persistence. One potential mechanism underlying delusional distress is global emotion dysregulation, which refers to a broad deficit in overall emotion regulation and emotional functioning. Global emotion dysregulation is associated with general psychotic symptom severity, but its specific relationship to delusional distress has yet to be closely examined.  \n\nMethods: People with (n = 100) and without (n = 52) schizophrenia-spectrum disorders completed measures of delusional ideation (Peters Delusion Inventory; PDI-21) and global emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS-16). Participants with schizophrenia also completed a measure of delusion severity (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales; PSYRATS). Relationships between delusion severity and global emotion dysregulation were assessed with linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and group. Associations between delusional distress and specific aspects of emotion dysregulation were determined using stepwise linear regression.   \n\nResults: Global emotion dysregulation was significantly elevated in those with schizophrenia compared to healthy comparison participants, across all subscales (p&lt;.001). Global emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with delusional distress on both the PDI-21 (p&lt;.001) and PSYRATS (p&lt;.001). Stepwise regression revealed a specific association between limited access to emotion regulation strategies and delusional distress on both scales (p’s&lt;.001). Delusional distress remained associated with emotion dysregulation when controlling for delusional preoccupation, and emotion dysregulation was not significantly associated with delusional conviction on either scale.  \n\nConclusions: Emotion dysregulation, particularly the sense that there is little one can do to regulate themselves when upset, relates to delusional distress. Interventions that increase access to more emotion regulation strategies may help decrease distress associated with delusional thinking.",

          "abstract": "Research has widely examined the motives, strategies, and effectiveness of explicit emotion regulation, yet the reasons for not regulating emotions have not been elucidated. Extant daily life research suggests individuals may choose not to regulate their emotions as often as they are choosing to regulate them. We examined (1) how often people did not regulate their emotions, (2) the reasons why people chose not to regulate emotions, and (3) which contextual factors were relevant to not regulating. Adults in the Midwest (N=179; Mage=35.34, SDage=12.26) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) five times daily for 14 days, reporting on their largest recent emotional shift over the last three hours, contextual factors regarding this shift, and details about emotion regulation. People reported not regulating about half the time, with the most frequent reasons being that emotions were appropriate or helpful (38%) or were not intense enough (31%). The likelihood of not regulating was associated with more positive affect, less negative affect, greater situational pleasantness, and lower situational importance. People were less likely to regulate when they were alone (versus with other people). This research clarifies an aspect of the emotion regulation process that has been largely overlooked despite frequently occurring. Future research should examine whether reasons are more beneficial than others and if the reasons for not regulating differ across culture and the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Empirical evidence has documented that later-born cohorts of middle-aged adults in the U.S. are reporting poorer mental and physical health than earlier-born cohorts. However, less is known about whether this is specific to the U.S. or generalizes to other nations and to what extent this is found for both self-report and objective indicators of physical health and how this might differ between men and women. Our study aims to examine similarities and differences in historical change of midlife development in self-rated health, health conditions, and grip strength by using harmonized data comprising longitudinal panel surveys from the U.S., Mexico, 13 nations in Europe, South Korea, and China. Results from multilevel models, stratified by gender, revealed historical stability in self-rated health and health conditions for middle-aged men in the U.S., whereas middle-aged women demonstrated historical declines in self-rated health and historical increases in health conditions. Historical improvements in self-rated health were observed for both men and women in England, Mediterranean Europe, Nordic Europe, and China. Historical decreases in health conditions were observed for both men and women in England and Mexico. Both men and women in the U.S. and China exhibited historical declines in grip strength, whereas both men and women in Nordic Europe and South Korea showed historical improvements. Our discussion focuses on better understanding these national gender differences in historical trends by considering how the dynamically changing historical context impacts ways of living and health care systems and the implications for developmental outcomes at the individual and population level.",

          "abstract": "‎ Abstract\n‎ An awareness of human nature, growth, and development at various age levels provides a ‎foundational understanding for religious and educational authorities about the behaviors and ‎functions related to adolescent development. That means adolescence stands for a pivotal transition ‎from childhood to adulthood and understanding human nature during this phase eases understanding ‎behaviors while distinguishing between natural, untrained, and trainable performance. This growth ‎stage is a comprehensive physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development, and awareness of ‎this is essential for parents, educators, and, importantly, the adolescents themselves. This article ‎describes the complex path of adolescent development, which includes physical maturation, ‎cognitive development, emotional regulation, identity formation, and social integration. Given these ‎changes and a complete understanding of the forces affecting adolescent development and the impact ‎of hormonal and developmental changes on their outlook and learning, those who are active in ‎raising and educating adolescents can design and provide more proper educational programs. ‎Additionally, some suggest techniques and strategies that account for this developmental period and ‎the factors that can change education.‎",

          "abstract": "In a seminal study investigating gender bias in academic science, Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) found bias against female lab manager applicants with respect to competence, hireability, mentoring, and salary conferral. This topic was revisited here as a registered replication report with four studies—one direct replication, two direct replications with extensions, and a meta-analysis. The present set of studies, all using the same methods and materials as the original, sampled from a larger and broader pool of faculty than did the original, collectively reflecting the breadth of STEM disciplines at R1 universities across the United States. The reported studies all had higher power to detect smaller effect sizes than in the original. Across these studies, Moss-Racusin et al.’s (2012) findings failed to replicate, and biases were consistently in the opposite direction—favoring female over male applicants (albeit with smaller effect sizes). We discuss the implications of these findings for the broader literature on gender bias in science and its implications for the scientific workforce.",

A data-driven model exploration was conducted to explore predictors and prediction models. Candidate predictors were built upon past research using moral foundations and political orientation. Moreover, we also employed additional moral psychological indicators, i.e., moral reasoning, moral identity, and empathy, based on prior research in moral development and education. We used model exploration methods, i.e., Bayesian model exploration, Bayesian model averaging, and elastic-net regression. The study successfully replicated past research supporting the relationship between moral foundations, political orientation, and the moral circle. Additional moral psychological constructs, such as post-conventional moral reasoning and moral identity, significantly predicted the moral circle width. The identified components of the moral circle were conceptually related to phronesis, i.e., practical wisdom. We discussed the educational implications of the findings, particularly those related to moral education focusing on phronesis cultivation, multiculturalism and global citizenship, and climate justice.",

CWCT posits an ecological ceiling on intelligence gains from cold-driven natural selection, beyond which further cognitive increases confer diminishing adaptive returns. This ceiling ~91 (±3 points, 95% CI) marks the cognitive threshold necessary for civilizational onset but insufficient for further elevation without artificial selection. CWCT introduces a two-phase model: Phase I involves natural selection in cold environments, driving intelligence to the ecological ceiling; Phase II involves civilization-driven selection—via surplus production, institutional filtering, and reproductive stratification—permitting further increases in general intelligence (g). The model is supported by psychometric, historical, and ecological data, and it generates falsifiable predictions regarding cognitive ceilings, institutional effects, and postglacial divergence. CWCT provides a coherent, ecologically grounded framework for understanding the evolution of population-level intelligence across human groups.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that sporting experts show better response inhibition. Less is known about how expert athletes use cognitive inhibition to ‘forget’ previous errors (termed expertise-induced-amnesia). Moreover, whether the relevance of sporting expertise is greater at high-pressure, compared to low-pressure is also unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine if sporting expertise predicted response inhibition (effectiveness and efficiency) and cognitive inhibition (error awareness) and the impact of pressure levels on these relationships. Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

The present study explored the impact of different binaural beat frequencies (7 Hz, and 40 Hz) relative to a 0 Hz control sound on attention, reading comprehension memory, and mood. A within-subjects experimental design was used, with 48 participants completing a mood assessment, a reading comprehension task, and a global-local attentional processing task while listening to each of the three sounds. Sound order was counterbalanced across participants. The results suggested that 40 Hz binaural beats significantly enhanced reading comprehension accuracy and reduced accuracy differences between congruent and incongruent figures in the global-local task, consistent with a narrowed scope of attention. In contrast, the 7 Hz and control conditions showed no significant effects, and there were no notable effects on mood for any binaural beat sounds. The results are consistent with a neural entrainment mechanism, as gamma-band frequencies have been consistently associated with cognitive performance; however, more research is necessary to further explore and expand these findings.",

Further, because people have been shown to shift their reference point for who should give to charity based on their current income, we inves- tigate whether donations can be boosted by asking how much people with different income ranks should give to charity (in- junctive distribution task, IDT) before administering the RBN. Participants (N = 1,217) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, RBN, IDT, or IDT+RBN. Those in the RBN conditions donated significantly more and reduced over- estimation of others’ income across all percentiles of the global income distribution. However, the addition of the IDT did not further increase donations. These findings suggest that RBNs effectively boost generosity by correcting misperceptions of relative affluence.",

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were examined for (1) vocal speech cues time-locked to statement onset and (2) emotive semantic attributes at the sentence-final word. Criticisms from native speakers were perceived as less friendly than from foreign speakers, whereas compliments did not differ. ERPs revealed listeners rapidly used acoustic information to differentiate speaker identity and evaluative attitude (N100, P200), then selectively monitored vocal attitude expressed by native speakers in the LPP time window. When the evaluative word was heard, native accents contextually modulated early semantic processing (N400). Words of criticism increased the LPP irrespective of accent.

Instead, informed by sign language research and the neural processing of pointing gestures, this study offers a novel framework on co-speech pointing gestures in infants’ word learning. Specifically, it argues that such gestures construct a plausible linguistic unit with speech, making the speech interpretable and the referentiality learnable for infants at the early lexical stage.",

We propose a novel, integrative framework for understanding imaginative-narrative simulation—the mental simulation of events, sourced from memory and fiction, and structured through narrative—as a key adaptive capacity. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and media studies, we identify four core functions of this capacity: functions that support (i) planning and future thought, (ii) coping and emotion regulation, (iii) bonding and social needs, and (iv) identity and worldviews. We argue that these functions can importantly support psychological wellbeing, and review a range of empirical studies that have investigated imagination, fiction, and psychological wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic that speak to these effects. We suggest that despite its potential, there is a significant gap in the literature on the adaptive value of imagination and fiction, especially in the context of global crises, and offer concrete directions for future empirical work.",

However, concerns remain about data quality in online settings and the absence of experimenters to ensure participant engagement. In this pre-registered study, we used two tasks—picture naming and reading aloud—to test whether the lexical frequency effect (Low Frequency words &gt; High Frequency words) on speech onset times can be reliably detected in online environments (run at Home), both with and without experimenter supervision. Participants completed the same tasks under four conditions, varying by Supervision (between-subjects: Supervised vs. Unsupervised) and Environment (within-subjects: Lab vs. Home): Lab-Supervised, HomeSupervised, Lab-Unsupervised, and Home-Unsupervised. Frequency effects emerged across all conditions except Home-Supervised for the reading aloud task, where the effect was in the expected direction but non-significant (~12 ms). All other conditions yielded consistent frequency effects (~17–38 ms), comparable to previous online and lab-based findings. Notably, participants were faster at home than in the lab (~10 ms), and unsupervised settings yielded the largest effect sizes, suggesting that experimenter presence may inadvertently dampen subtle effects, possibly due to increased self-monitoring or reduced comfort. These findings validate the use of online platforms for speech production research and highlight the nuanced influence of supervision on experimental outcomes.",

This is the first UK evaluation of the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform, an operationalization of the ICF Core Sets for Autism via an online assessment. In Study 1, 20 Autistic adults were supported to complete the assessment, provide feedback via think-aloud interviews and to evaluate it. In Study 2, which was pre-registered, 464 Autistic adults and 481 Non-Autistic adults completed the assessment independently online and evaluated it. Both studies used a participatory approach. Using standardised questionnaires both studies found the assessment “acceptable” and found usability to be “ok” or better. This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed. The findings suggest the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform has potential as a standardised evidence-based tool to improve understanding of Autistic adults’ strengths and needs.",

          "abstract": "This review investigates the relationship between autism, vulnerability to bullying, and the impact of bullying on mental health for this cohort. Neurotypical social mores can be exclusionary, creating social risks for autistic people, while differences in communication and social engagement can impact peer-to-peer interaction, making autistic people more vulnerable to bullying and social discrimination. The current systematic review investigates risk factors related to the bullying of autistic people, considering both societal and individual factors. It is critical to consider neurotypical social expectations as a risk factor when understanding the bullying of autistic people, rather than simply focusing on traits associated with autism, an approach that furthers a deficit model of thinking. Autistic people are three times more likely to be victimised in comparison to their non-autistic peers, making this a critical social and psychological issue. Bullying was found to lead to the development of depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal, as discussed in this review. The importance of education, creating inclusive environments, building resilience, collaborative efforts, policy and legislation, mental health support, and prevention and protection implications, are discussed. By implementing these strategies, we can work to reduce vulnerability to bullying in autistic people as well as promote their overall well-being. This review emphasises the importance of comprehensive interventions and support systems in combating bullying and improving the lives of autistic people.",

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "Aims: Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with elevated all-cause mortality, with suicide cited as the second leading cause of death among individuals with EDs. Evidence suggests that individuals with anorexia nervosa are 18 times, and those with bulimia nervosa seven times more likely to die by suicide, relative to gender- and aged-matched comparison groups. Limited research has focused on why people with EDs experience such high rates of suicidality. The study aims to gather perspectives from people with lived experience of any ED and clinicians working with EDs to understand suicidality among people with EDs. \nMethods: Using a qualitative design, we conducted semi-structured interviews with people with lived experience of an ED (n=30), and clinicians who work with people with EDs (n=19). Participants with lived experience presented with a range of ED. Clinicians worked across a range of service settings as well as adolescent and adult services. We used a multi-perspective reflexive thematic analysis to code the data and develop the themes. \nResults: Key themes identified include ‘I don’t want to live like this - the burden and impact of having an eating disorder’, ‘Eating disorders don’t stand in isolation - comorbidity and complexity’, ‘There’s a dark side to recovery - recovery as a risk factor’, ‘Suicide isn’t talked about… I felt alone and weird - silence, isolation and stigma’, and 'The only risk they see is weight: suicide as overlooked within services’. These findings underscore the complex and multifaceted reasons why people with EDs are at risk of suicide, acknowledging the unique risk factors associated with the illness itself as well as the various risk periods that affect those with EDs.\nConclusion: These findings provide insight into key mechanisms underlying the association between EDs and suicidality.  Results are novel and are currently not accounted for within current theoretical models of suicide. As such, these findings are early evidence to help us develop a new theory of suicidality for people with EDs, as well as potential intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Stereotype threat refers to the fear of being judged based on negative stereotypes about the performance of a certain group one identifies with. Numerous published studies have found that stereotype threat might lower mathematics test performance among women. However, many studies used suboptimal designs and analyses; the literature might be subject to publication bias; and the cross-cultural generalizability of the effect remains unknown. This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender. The current results fail to replicate the stereotype-threat effect by Johns et al. (2005), hence casting doubt on the generalizability of the effect of stereotype threat on women’s mathematics performance.",

          "abstract": "Beauty is an aesthetic quality that many composers and performers strive to attain and that most listeners value highly in music. Yet, what listeners hear and feel when they find music beautiful, the impact this experience has on them, and wherein lie any important differences between individuals are questions that still lack clear answers. To address these gaps, an online questionnaire was administered to 81 adults. They described their experience of listening to three self-selected “beautiful pieces of music” alongside three pieces they enjoyed listening to but did not consider beautiful; this with a focus on each piece’s sonic features, the emotions induced, and any impact that engaging with the pieces had had on them. Respondents’ personality traits and level of musical training were also collected to explore if these were a source of significant variability in the data. Thematic analysis of text responses found that pieces perceived as beautiful are characterised by both low-level (e.g., slow tempo, soft timbre, low sound level), and high-level features (e.g., composition style, degree of change, complexity levels, repetition); have the ability to calm, evoke pleasant sadness in, and move the listener; and in terms of long-term impact, provide the listener strong emotional support, and provide them inspiration for musical activities. Exploratory, quantitative analyses examining individual differences revealed that participants high in the trait Openness to experience were most concerned with the aesthetic qualities of pieces. Our findings suggest that the experience of musical beauty is a multifaceted phenomenon that can have a profound emotional impact on some individuals, contributing to a more comprehensive account of what it means to experience beauty in music.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual humility (IH), the recognition of one’s intellectual limitations, is a promising characteristic to tackle societal conflicts such as affective political polarization. Despite increasing research on IH in recent years, most research has been conducted in the USA, probably due to a lack of scales that are validated in languages other than English. Our objective was to offer researchers in the German context several IH measures they can choose from depending on their specific research question. Therefore, we validated and compared four established IH scales within the German context. Items of three widely-used IH scales (CIHS, SIHS, LIHS) were translated from English into German by two independent researchers, rated by experts (n = 8), and pre-tested (n = 13). We then assessed structural, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of the scales plus an existing Swiss-German IH scale (IHS) in a preregistered online-survey (N = 698), representative for Germany regarding age, gender, and education. Discriminant validity was assessed via social desirability, cognitive closure, need for cognition, HEXACO honesty-humility, and openness, and incremental validity regarding affective polarization. Results showed that the IHS did not meet all of our pre-registered criteria, potentially due to cross-cultural differences between Germany and Switzerland. However, the three translated scales were comparable to the original English scales regarding structural, convergent, and discriminant validity. The SIHS showed best incremental validity in predicting less affective polarization towards opinion-based outgroups. Limitations and directions for future research regarding IH in German-speaking contexts are discussed.",

Prior research indicated that disparities in academic performance, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment tend to widen, as students’ progress through primary and secondary education. Socioeconomic status, immigrant background, ethnicity, geographical location, and gender have consistently emerged as critical drivers of these educational inequalities. Despite extensive research identifying these factors, our understanding of the specific mechanisms by which they influence educational outcomes remains limited. In this report, we share initial findings from a scoping review of longitudinal studies providing quantitative evidence on inequalities in educational outcomes—specifically academic achievement, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment—among K–12 students across Europe. Our results suggest that the volume of longitudinal research addressing these issues has notably increased. Nonetheless, substantial gaps remain and highlight opportunities for further investigation, for instance, concerning early childhood education, interventions, research in Eastern European contexts, and research exploring how multiple social categories combine to create unique patterns of educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated into social and decision-making contexts, understanding how trust is established between humans and AI is essential. This study investigates whether humans and AI differ in how they form and adjust trust based on interactive experience. Using a 50-round trust game, we examined investment behaviors of human participants and ChatGPT-3.5 when paired with either high- or low-trustworthy partners framed as human or AI agents. While humans adjusted trust dynamically—investing more in high-trustworthy and less in low-trustworthy partners over time—AI failed to differentiate partner trustworthiness. Instead, AI consistently preferred human over AI partners, regardless of their behaviour. Notably, humans also demonstrated trust adaptation even when each trial involved a different partner, suggesting generalised social learning beyond specific partner history. In contrast, AI's trust behaviour remained static and unresponsive to contextual changes or unexpected outcomes. These results highlight a fundamental divergence in how humans and AI process social information: humans engage in experience-driven trust calibration, whereas AI responses reflect static patterns that do not update with experience. This misalignment raises critical concerns about the real-world deployment of AI in trust-sensitive roles. Users may mistakenly interpret AI’s apparent prosociality as adaptive, leading to misplaced confidence in its decision-making. We conclude that perceived trustworthiness in AI does not imply behavioural reliability, underscoring the need for transparent AI design and regulation in domains where trust is essential.",

However, much of this research focuses on traditional forms of engagement such as playing an instrument, or purposefully using live music as a targeted health intervention. There is limited research exploring the wellbeing consequences of regular gig and/or festival attendance, or the mechanisms for the effects of such attendance. Drawing on the ‘social cure’ approach to group membership and wellbeing, we carried out two complementary studies investigating this relationship through semi-structured interviews (n=20) and a pre-registered cross-sectional survey (n=2,021). In line with the ‘social cure’, results suggest a relationship between regular event attendance and wellbeing, contingent on group processes within the audience (identification, relationality, collective self-realization) as well as support from event staff – a novel finding. Additionally, we observe that individuals who experience attendance-related wellbeing often exhibit affective and behavioural changes that seem to actively reinforce their overall sense of wellbeing. To our knowledge, this finding points to a potential positive-feedback loop between wellbeing and subsequent behaviour that has not been widely reported in existing research.",

The integration of positive psychology with technology holds substantial potential; however, few studies have fully leveraged the pedagogical potential of technologies to foster wellbeing. Additionally, there is a lack of positive psychology interventions aimed at young adults in non-Western contexts. This study addresses these gaps by developing, implementing, and validating WeThrive, a technology-integrated, culturally adapted positive psychology intervention tailored for Asian young adults. A central feature of WeThrive is its integrated online co-creation approach. A mixed-methods approach with a pre-post-follow-up design was employed to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results from quantitative analyses demonstrated that WeThrive significantly improved young adults’ overall wellbeing, positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment, while reducing negative feelings. Qualitative analyses identified key factors contributing to the effectiveness of WeThrive, including active engagement in meaningful co-creations, social connection, and positivity and agency. Findings of the study provide new insights into the effectiveness of integrating online co-creation in positive psychology interventions, particularly in an Asian context. It enriches the understanding of the use of computers by broadening knowledge of its psychological effects. Furthermore, it highlights online co-creation as an effective component in designing wellbeing enhancement strategies.",

Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Janna Wennberg",
          "abstract": "Noise can reduce the intelligibility of spoken language and increase the effort necessary to understand speech. Listening effort, “the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a [listening] task” (Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016), is commonly assessed by measuring response times to secondary tasks while listening to speech or by testing memory for the content of the speech. Increasing the level of background noise tends to slow responses and impair memory, and these effects are attributed to the resource-intensive process of reevaluating speech that was initially obscured or misheard. However, given that noise can impair performance on cognitive tasks that do not require processing auditory information, it is possible that noise-induced impairments typically ascribed to processing degraded speech may instead reflect increased cognitive load from the presence of noise itself. The current study assessed whether noise, in the absence of a speech task, can affect performance on tasks intended to measure listening effort. In Experiment 1 (positive control), target speech consisting of single words was presented aurally in background noise and we measured listening effort with three commonly-used paradigms. Experiment 2 was identical except that the target words were presented orthographically rather than aurally. Results showed that noise impaired performance on all three tasks when the target stimuli were presented aurally, consistent with a large body of work in the listening effort literature. Experiment 2 revealed that performance on some tasks was impaired by the presence of masking noise (particularly two-talker babble), indicating some domain-general interference. However, the magnitude of the noise-induced interference effects were markedly smaller in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, suggesting that measures of listening effort capture variability attributable to the challenges associated with listening to speech in noise, and do not simply measure distraction or noise-induced cognitive interference.",

Presently, little is known about learning during healthy adulthood and methods to improve that learning. The main objective of the present systematic review is to identify and synthesize all recent cognitive and brain research investigating learning during healthy aging in adulthood. Searches were performed across Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to identify published and unpublished studies conducted in healthy adults. Eligible studies reported measures of learning-related cognition, brain structure or function and their relationship with age, or effects of interventions to improve learning. Risk of bias was assessed using either the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool or Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Search and screening were performed by three trained reviewers. Included studies were summarized using narrative synthesis and, for intervention studies, an effect direction plot. A total of 265 relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Studies were primarily lab-based cross-sectional studies conducted in Western contexts. Findings revealed an overall decline in learning-related cognitive and brain outcomes during healthy aging. However, declines were more pronounced in fluid abilities and explicit learning and memory while crystalized abilities and implicit learning and memory showed stability. Generally, higher education and socioeconomic status positively modulated age-related learning trajectories while baseline cognitive function influenced the effectiveness of interventions. Findings from the present systematic review are potentially limited by the exclusive focus on healthy aging and the small number of included studies conducted in non-Western contexts. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

Here, we examined whether the relational coding of reward-associated features is commonly utilized across different learning contexts, particularly those engaging different attention modes (singleton search vs. feature-specific search) and varying levels of stimulus similarity (low vs. high target-distractor similarity). Focusing on value-driven attention based on feature relationships, our results showed that singleton search training led to value-driven relational attention that was independent of target-distractor similarity (Experiment 1a and 1b, n = 40 each). In contrast, feature-specific search training produced value-driven relational attention only when the target was dissimilar to the distractors, but not when they were similar (Experiment 2a – 2c, n = 40 each). Our findings suggest that when the learning task required only coarse selection (e.g., singleton search or feature-specific search among dissimilar items), a relational code for reward-associated feature was formed. However, when fine selection was necessary (e.g., feature-specific search among similar items), a more precise feature code was utilized. Thus, we propose that the precision of target selection during reward learning critically shapes value-driven attentional mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The list-length effect has been crucial in understanding the sources of forgetting in recognition memory, especially whether forgetting stems from interference generated by other items in the study list. However, there has been inconsistent evidence for the effect, and recent studies have found various confounds in the experimental design. The current study re-examined the list-length effect by controlling confounds that have been reported. We also systematically manipulated various factors such as the list length, study time, delay, and stimulus type, and tested a large sample to examine the robustness of the effect (i.e., radical randomization). Results showed evidence for a list-length effect across the conditions, and we find that the square root function best describes the list-length effect. By utilizing a computational model we also show that although the list-length effect exists, there is, in general, a greater amount of interference stemming from other sources in recognition memory (e.g., previous contexts).",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can quickly process groups of objects (ensembles) and build compressed representations of their features. What does the conscious perception of ensembles consist of? Observers‘ explicit access to ensemble representations has been considered very limited – any distributional aspects beyond simple summary statistics, such as the mean or variance, cannot be explicitly accessed. In contrast, we demonstrate that the visual system can represent ensemble distributions in detail, and observers have reliable explicit access to these representations. In our new paradigm (Feature Frequency Report), observers viewed 36 disks of various colors for 800 ms and then reported the frequency of a randomly chosen color using a slider. The sets had Gaussian, uniform, or bimodal color distributions with a random mean color. The distributions of responses – both aggregated and separate for each observer – followed the shape of the presented distribution. Modeling revealed that performance reflected integrated information from the whole set rather than sub-sampling. After only brief exposure to a color set, the visual system can build detailed representations of feature distributions that observers have explicit access to. This result necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how ensembles are processed. We suggest that such distribution representations are the most natural way for the visual system to represent groups of objects. Explicit feature distribution representations may contribute to people‘s impression of having a rich perceptual experience despite severe attentional and working memory limitations.",

Previous diachronic accounts have used the comparative method to argue that either the voice function or the nominalization function of the voice affixes should be reconstructed to Proto-Austronesian (PAn). In this paper, we use internal reconstruction to lay out a tentative alternative. First, we assume that both the voice and nominalization functions go back to PAn. Second, we suggest that the non-active voice affixes originated in Pre-PAn as prepositions, and were later incorporated into the verb complex as postverbs. The nominalizing function, on the other hand, arose through an inter-stage with compounds. This proposal accounts for several properties of AVS, including the prominence of arguments promoted to subject position and the subject-only restriction, and is supported by a typological parallel in Dinka.",

          "abstract": "Studies of cognitive control using tasks with isolated (single-item) vs. multiple (multi-item) item\npresentation have shown that multi-item tasks may be more effective in capturing limitations of\nthe cognitive control system arising from capacity constraints. Importantly, during multi-item\ntasks, performance decreases but does not collapse, consistent with effective management of\ncognitive overload. This has been interpreted by positing a strategic shift from a more parallel to\na more serial processing, whereby the processing of the current item is prioritized over\nupcoming items, termed lockout scheduling. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining\nwithin-task modulations of eye-voice span (EVS) measures and articulation duration in multiitem color naming tasks with and without internal interference (i.e., incongruent and neutral\nStroop conditions). We hypothesized that lockout scheduling would manifest itself across\nmeasures and conditions as the task progresses and cognitive overload emerges. The results\nshowed dynamic changes in both EVS and articulation measures as a function of time-on-task,\nconsistent with the gradual implementation of a lockout scheduling strategy in response to\nemerging cognitive overload. The observed patterns indicate that the shift from a more parallel\nto a more serial processing is not an all-or-none phenomenon but a dynamic interplay between\ngaze, voice, and covert (i.e., parafoveal) attention, affecting online decisions about spatial\ndistance, timing, and processing resource allocation.",

However, these theories overlook the potential for confusions to arise from item-intrinsic memorability properties – namely, the likelihood that a stimulus will be correctly recognized if studied (“hittability”) or falsely recognized if not (“false-alarmability”) – independent of contextual similarity. Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. Our model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries that context-based inter-item similarity could not explain, highlighting the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

          "abstract": "Modern lifestyles often rely on alarm clocks that disrupt the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, yet their physiological consequences remain underexplored. This case study investigates the effects of alarm-induced waking versus natural waking on key physiological and cognitive parameters: heart rate, core body temperature, and reaction time. Over a two-week observational period, a 21-year-old male participant tracked biometric data during days involving alarm use and days without. Heart rate was measured using a smartwatch, core temperature with an oral thermometer, and cognitive vigilance via reaction-time trials on a mobile app. Results show that alarm-induced waking was associated with higher waking heart rates (mean: 61.5 bpm vs. 58.75 bpm), lower core body temperature (36.4°C vs. 36.55°C), and slower reaction times (mean: 0.372 sec vs. 0.315 sec) compared to free days. Sleep timing analysis revealed approximately 1.5 hours of social jetlag, defined as the discrepancy between mid-sleep time on workdays and free days. These findings suggest that alarm clocks interfere with physiological readiness by interrupting circadian-regulated processes such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular balance, and cognitive arousal. While limited by a single-subject design, this study demonstrates measurable physiological disruption from alarm clock use and reinforces the importance of aligning sleep schedules with biological rhythms.",

However, data in support of this relationship are limited, leaving unclear which components of empathy (cognitive empathy, emotional contagion, and emotional disconnection) and prosocial behaviors, if any, would be affected. Here, we recruited musicians with more than 2 years of musical experience (n = 80) and nonmusicians (n = 89) to measure empathy (using subjective and objective measures) and prosociality (using economic games). We hypothesized that musicians would score higher than nonmusicians on empathy and prosociality, and that musicians who practice more would show greater effects. Using classical and Bayesian analyses of variance (ANOVAs), we found no difference between musicians and nonmusicians in empathy and prosociality, and no correlation with the amount of practice. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between the age of onset of music practice and empathy, suggesting that it is not music practice per se but specifically its initiation in early life that could be linked to empathy. These findings challenge the common assumption that music practice in general increases empathy and prosociality and invites to explore in which specific contexts music practice does so (e.g., particular age ranges or group-based settings).\n\nNote.

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults’ impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of heritable individual differences (for example in personality, cognition, and the risk for psychopathology) is the subject of a long-running debate between proponents of adaptive and non-adaptive explanations. Newly available genomic data show that most quantitative traits conform to what I label the “default genetic architecture,” characterized by extreme polygenicity with contributions from both common and rare variants, with large-effect variants that tend to be rarer and younger than small-effect ones. Furthermore, targeted tests of balancing selection return largely null or negative results. These findings indicate widespread purifying selection at the genetic level; they have led some scholars to argue that heritable individual differences are essentially non-adaptive or maladaptive, and that evolutionary hypotheses that invoke balancing selection are inconsistent with the data. Here I show that this strong interpretation is not warranted. I distinguish between four questions about the evolution of heritable individual differences, and explain why the data do not support sweeping inferences about their adaptive function (or lack thereof). I also discuss why tests of balancing selection are much less informative than is often believed. While the pervasive role of purifying selection is beyond dispute, the default architecture of complex traits is potentially compatible with a broad range of evolutionary scenarios, including scenarios in which heritable individual differences can be adaptive and functional rather than just manifestations of neutral/maladaptive noise.",

In this study, we use the selective sampling account, which proposes that information is gathered selectively based on goals and available resources, to explore the cognitive processes underlying variations in variability and scaling. In intermingled displays of blue and yellow dots (B/Y task), participants relied on incomplete representations of dots positioned near the center, where spatial resolution is highest, leading to increasing variability with set size. In contrast, spatially separated displays (L/R task) facilitated more comprehensive sampling, resulting in approximately constant variability across set sizes. Behavioral patterns and modeling analyses suggest that linear and logarithmic scaling capture sensitivity differences shaped by the display format and spatial resolution demands. Eye-tracking data further support our account, emphasizing the role of selective attention in forming numerical representations and providing a unified framework for understanding variability and scaling across tasks.",

Here, we combine memory-color with binocular rivalry to test if top-down influences affect the color an object is perceived in. We showed 24 participants familiar objects in their typical and opponent color and asked for concurrent reports of the perceived color. Consistent with Bayesian models of rivalry, we observed that conscious perception of identical spectral color pairs was biased towards the typical color of the presented object.

To address this shortcoming we describe, evaluate, and demonstrate how a rule-based computer system can be used to implement item-writing guidelines in order to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of multiple-choice test items. The rule-based system was evaluated by comparing the ratings from a human reviewer with the rule-based system on a sample of test items resulting in almost perfect agreement demonstrating that the system can identify common multiple-choice item flaws. The system was also used to identify the item flaws found in a large sample of 1078 operational test items written in the content areas of research methods, statistics, child development, and educational psychology. The most common flaw was the logical ordering of options followed by grammar and spelling errors. Directions for future research are discussed.",

In the speech domain, previous work indicated that anodal tDCS over left motor cortex and right cerebellum increased the magnitude of speech adaptation during sensorimotor learning. Here, we aimed to replicate these findings in a pre-registered, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled study of a large sample (N=90). Participants read words out loud. Speech was recorded and fed back to them either normally or with a 110-Mel increase in the frequency of the first vowel formant. Participants responded to altered feedback by changing their speech production (adaptation). Participants were randomly allocated to receive 2-mA anodal tDCS over either left speech motor cortex, or right cerebellum, or sham stimulation. We tested for differences in speech adaption among the three groups using one-way analyses of variance. We also explored the relationship between speech adaptation and measures of speech perception. All groups showed significant adaptation while receiving altered auditory feedback. Contrary to the previous study, we found no impact of anodal tDCS on the magnitude of the speech adaptation. In conclusion, speech adaptation was unaffected by anodal tDCS over speech motor cortex or cerebellum. This study is another example of the inconsistent effects of tDCS on task performance particularly when participants are young and healthy. Even larger samples may be needed to detect small effects and to avoid spurious results arising from individual differences in task performance.",

          "abstract": "Despite theoretical reasons to think that occupation plays a role in life satisfaction (LS), empirical evidence on the association is surprisingly limited. Moreover, because LS closely tracks personality traits, not controlling for these has left the existing results inconclusive. In pre-registered analyses, we examined occupational differences in LS and job satisfaction (JS) among 59,000 Estonian Biobank participants who represented 263 occupations, controlling for demographic variables and comprehensively assessed personality traits. Jobs differed in LS and JS before (η2 = .05 and η2 = .07, respectively) and even after adjusting for all covariates (η2 = .01 to .02 and η2 = .06, respectively). Various medical professionals, psychologists, special needs teachers, and self-employed individuals tended to have the highest LS levels, whereas security guards, survey interviewers, waiters, sales workers, mail carriers, carpenters, and chemical engineers tended to score the lowest. Jobs with the highest JS included religious professionals, various medical professionals, and authors, while kitchen, transport, storage, and manufacturing labourers, survey interviewers, and sales workers were among the least satisfied with their jobs. Exploratory analyses suggested that income and O*NET-derived job characteristics, such as interest orientations like realistic, enterprising, and conventional, could explain some of the satisfaction variance among occupations. We conclude that occupation ranks among satisfaction’s strongest correlates, besides, and partly net of, personality traits.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical excitability and when applied in combination with a cognitive task has potential to enhance performance. In the speech domain, previous work indicated that anodal tDCS over left motor cortex and right cerebellum increased the magnitude of speech adaptation during sensorimotor learning. Here, we aimed to replicate these findings in a pre-registered, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled study of a large sample (N=90). Participants read words out loud. Speech was recorded and fed back to them either normally or with a 110-Mel increase in the frequency of the first vowel formant. Participants responded to altered feedback by changing their speech production (adaptation). Participants were randomly allocated to receive 2-mA anodal tDCS over either left speech motor cortex, or right cerebellum, or sham stimulation. We tested for differences in speech adaption among the three groups using one-way analyses of variance. We also explored the relationship between speech adaptation and measures of speech perception. All groups showed significant adaptation while receiving altered auditory feedback. Contrary to the previous study, we found no impact of anodal tDCS on the magnitude of the speech adaptation. In conclusion, speech adaptation was unaffected by anodal tDCS over speech motor cortex or cerebellum. This study is another example of the inconsistent effects of tDCS on task performance particularly when participants are young and healthy. Even larger samples may be needed to detect small effects and to avoid spurious results arising from individual differences in task performance.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although generative‑AI systems are increasingly used to solve non‑routine problems, effective prompting strategies remain largely underexplored.\n\nAims: The present study investigates how university students prompt ChatGPT to solve complex ill-defined problems, specifically examining which prompts are associated with higher or lower problem-solving performance.\n\nSample: Seventy-seven university students (53 women; Mage = 22.4 years) participated in the study.\n\nMethods: To identify various prompt types employed by students, the study utilized qualitative analysis of interactions with ChatGPT 3.5 during the resolution of the creative problem-solving task. Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process-mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = 0.82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.",

          "abstract": "Children acquire gender stereotypes at a young age and these subsequently influence cognition and behavior. Stereotypes may be learned through a child’s direct observation of gender differences as well as perpetuated by inaccurate cultural depictions. Children’s mass media, a cultural product, may be a powerful source of gender stereotype perpetuation. This research investigated the presence and impact of an inaccurate gender stereotypic association of predator animals as male and prey animals as female. Study 1 investigated predator-male and prey-female stereotypes in children’s films featuring anthropomorphized animal characters (N = 1892). After accounting for a 75% male character bias, there was a disproportionately high number of predators assigned male and prey assigned female. Study 2 created explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female association measures and tested these on children (N = 132, aged 4-14-years) and adults (N = 99, aged 18-65 years). Both groups showed a male character bias, along with strong explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female associations. Children had higher explicit scores than adults, whereas adults had higher implicit scores than children, but there were no discernible differences in children’s responses across this wide age range, suggesting that this gender stereotype is embedded early in development. Inaccurate gender stereotypes in children’s media correspond to explicit and implicit gender stereotyping. This suggests that children can acquire stereotypes indirectly through exposure to cultural products alone and implies a bi-directional relationship between individual cognition and cultural level gender stereotyping.",

Using a cued-recall task, we\nobserved across three experiments that increasing the number of learned word pairs slowed\nretrieval times (RTs) and reduced retrieval accuracy. This effect was modulated by context: set\nsize effects did not extend across multiple, unrelated lists. Semantic similarity between cues\nand targets consistently facilitated retrieval, independent of set size. Experiment 2 revealed no\neffect of additional visual context cues on RTs, while Experiment 3 demonstrated that larger\nsemantic contexts hindered recall, leading to slower RTs and lower accuracy compared to unre-\nlated lists.

The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control — such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort — stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.",

This study was anchored in the Double Empathy Problem theoretical framework. Through Reflective Thematic Analysis three main themes were constructed:1) Cross-neurotype communication breakdowns are common and multifactorial; 2) Both autistic and nonautistic people can take responsibility for effective communication; and 3) Autism knowledge and understanding matters. Differences in communication styles, the feeling of being different and autism knowledge among professionals have been found to be associated with effective communication. Our findings provide insights which can help to improve communication in educational- and healthcare settings and, thus, contribute to improve the support provided to autistic people.",

We argue that both extremes may be shaped or exacerbated by common cognitive biases, including cognitive dissonance, wishful thinking, and the illusion of depth of understanding, which distort reality to our own advantage. By showcasing how these distortions may easily emerge in both scientific and public discourse, we advocate for a measured approach— skeptical open mind - that recognizes the cognitive abilities of LLMs as worthy of scientific investigation while remaining conservative concerning exaggerated claims regarding their cognitive status.",

Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty and the most classical economic approaches emphasize the use of punishment by focusing on both the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”) and the severity (“what fine will be imposed?”) of punishment, respectively. However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. Here, we suggest to provide a high-powered online study (N = 630) collecting UK-based Prolific participants in which we manipulate (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earns money for the individual or for the group), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual is punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). The study will shed light on the interplay between individual or group decision making and the specifics of punishment as well as advance the understanding under which conditions punishment might be effective in curbing dishonesty.",

          "abstract": "To sustainably manage our shared resources, we must learn to cooperate with each other and develop more sustainable behaviour over time. However, previous research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating sustainability. One hypothesis is that increasingly unsustainable behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these two hypotheses. Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. By the third game, only 9.12% of participants were able to use the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

Use of nudification tools was widespread, with 55.3% (n=328) of participants reporting having created and 54.4% (n=323) having received at least one image.  Reported victimization levels of participants was substantial, with 36.3% (n=222) of individuals reporting having a non-consensual image created and 33.2% (n=205) of individuals having had at least one image non-consensually shared.  Usage was similar across demographic categories, though male participants had higher degrees of regular GenAI sexual image creation and distribution, both consensual and non-consensual.

          "abstract": "False and denied pregnancies are insufficiently understood mental health disorders affecting women. Denied pregnancies in particular can result in unexpected births, putting both mother and child at risk. Improved understanding is therefore required to address these public health concerns. This paper is rooted in Darwin’s theory of evolution of species. As humans, we are a highly social species. However, our earliest land ancestors were instinct-driven solitary animals. These oviparous animals reproduced by depositing their fertilized eggs in favourable locations. They were progenitors but not parents. The emergence of parenting traits facilitated the transition from solitary to social life, fostering the inherent interdependence of individuals. Humans are relational psychological beings housed in separate physical bodies. This physical-relational duality, or physiological-psychological duality, is inherent to our evolution. It can create conflict by opposing physical reality to paradoxical psychological demands. Such conflicts are likely to affect pregnancy that triggers major changes in both physiology and psychology. Furthermore, pregnancy is a parental trait where the pregnant woman, as a relational being, supports an immature dependent. We explain false and denied pregnancies as temporary and fictitious responses to such intractable conflicts. A single conflict formulation is assigned to each disorder: An imperative need for motherhood in a non-pregnant woman for false pregnancy; and a psychological inability to accept impending motherhood in a pregnant woman for denial of pregnancy. It is hoped that these clear starting points will help clinicians to explore the factual causes of these disorders in their patients on a case-by-case basis.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral interventions, such as green nudges, are increasingly used to promote pro-environmental behaviors and address climate change. While these interventions are cost-effective and preserve individual autonomy, they can raise significant equity concerns. Green nudges, unlike most other nudges, often impose private costs to yield collective environmental gains. Given that low-income individuals contribute less to pollution and given that many green behaviors, such as purchasing eco-friendly products or offsetting carbon emissions, involve higher financial costs, the burden of green nudges can end up being unfair to the poorest segments of the population. In addition, this issue can be exacerbated if people living in poverty are more susceptible to the psychological biases that are leveraged by nudges. We review this evidence and show that the same nudge is likely to have a stronger effect on poorer people, which will further compound fairness issues in the case of costly green nudges. We conclude by arguing that policymakers must pay specific attention to the distributive impacts of green nudges. Future research should further investigate the psychological mechanisms that drive heterogeneous responses to green nudges. If these challenges are addressed both in policy and research, green nudges can contribute to equitable and effective climate policies that balance collective goals with individual fairness.",

          "abstract": "Induced-hypocrisy, a cognitive dissonance paradigm, effectively promotes prosocial behaviors through a two-step procedure. First, a person advocates for a prosocial behavior and then recalls their past failures to comply with it, which prompts the person to adopt the behavior. Initially, the explanation for such hypocrisy effect focused on restoring a positive self-image threatened by past transgressions. A recent theoretical explanation, suggest that behavioral change results from the perceived discrepancy between social norms and transgressive behavior. Our five-study experimental program (Total N = 774) was designed to test whether the process of social norm deviation underlies the hypocrisy effect. Results showed the influence of social norms strength on the hypocrisy effect (Studies 1, 2, 3) and the mediating effect of perceived social norm deviation in increasing prosocial behaviors consecutive to the hypocrisy procedure (Studies 4a and 4b). An integrative analysis (N = 602) of Studies 1, 2 and 4a, as well as two additional datasets, confirmed the influence of social norms in producing the hypocrisy effect. Taken together, these results strongly support social norm deviation as a key process underlying the hypocrisy effect, in that participants with stronger social normative beliefs exhibit a more pronounced hypocrisy effect due to a greater perceived deviation from social norms. These experimental findings constitute a significant contribution to understanding and improving the hypocrisy effect. They are discussed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, questioning the implication of the self and the affiliation motivation in this social norm deviation process and emphasizing the relevance of reinforcing social norms in contexts where transgressions are less salient, such as in discrimination prevention.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes adding cognitive biases, basic brain anatomy, psychology, and behavioral economics to Kerala’s school curriculum to enhance students’ civic sense, decision-making, and mental health. Grounded in interdisciplinary research, the hypothesis posits that early education on biases can promote critical thinking, curb impulsive choices, and strengthen societal well-being. A 12-week pilot program for grades 6–8 is outlined, using interactive methods to teach key biases and psychological concepts. Testable predictions include higher decision-making scores and greater bias awareness. This approach could reshape education in Kerala, a state with high literacy but rising mental health challenges [1]. The paper explores implications for theory, practice, and future research.",

          "authors": "Elias M. Hart",
          "abstract": "Humans display an uncommonly intense epistemic drive—a motivation to understand that extends far beyond immediate survival.  The Re-Connection Hypothesis proposes that this drive ultimately guides Homo sapiens to discover and ritually employ N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  Rather than postulating that the brain must “self-flood” with DMT, we argue that cortical circuitry is pre-tooled—analogous to dormant Wi-Fi hardware—to respond to modest, externally supplied DMT and switch awareness to a non-material information domain we term the Transcendent.  Three empirical anchors motivate the model: (i) conserved expression of the DMT-synthesising enzyme INMT across mammals; (ii) widespread occurrence of DMT-rich plants; (iii) reproducible, network-reset phenomenology at low–moderate exogenous doses.  Drawing on signalling-bias pharmacology, receptor-reserve experiments, and ethnobotanical convergences, we articulate testable predictions—including a “low-threshold, high-gain” 5-HT2A circuit assay—and sketch preregistered study designs.  Detailed tables, Bayesian sensitivity analyses, and power calculations are provided in the Supplementary Materials.  By integrating biochemistry, cognitive neuroscience, and cultural data, we offer a coherent research programme for evaluating possible teleological features of human curiosity.",

          "authors": "Elias M. Hart",
          "abstract": "Humans across time and culture invest scarce resources—fasting in deserts, silent temple retreats, whirling in sacred halls, multi-night plant ceremonies—to achieve states “beyond” the day-to-day hive of work, consumption, and status. Conventional drives (survival, power, meaning, truth) cannot explain this costly impulse or the durable drop in material striving that follows. We propose a fifth, previously unidentified human drive—the Will to Transcendence (WT)—which ripens slowly, can be fulfilled repeatedly or for extended spans, and reliably reorders priorities toward sufficiency, service, and ecological care. Cross-cultural rituals (e.g. Vision Quests, Zen ango, Sufi dhikr, ayahuasca dietas) and meta-analytic evidence (N = 3,412; g ≈ |0.3|) document a “material-detachment” signature. Neuroimaging studies link WT states to default-mode network deactivation, suggesting a neural mechanism for ego-dissolution. We sketch a cultural feedback loop by which private transcendence seeds ethical systems (poverty vows, alms economies, ecological taboos), catalog genuine gateways versus “false victories” (luxury highs, social-media fame), and offer low-dose N,N-DMT as a high-priority mechanistic hypothesis. Four falsifiable predictions and a multidisciplinary research agenda conclude the paper.",

          "abstract": "Visual relational concepts—defined by patterns of relationships between entities—are thought to require structured, compositional representations with explicit role information about each entity. Analogical mapping over compositional representations is a key strategy for acquiring such concepts, but in complex situations with many entities and relations, this process can be cognitively demanding. As a result, learning may occur over feature-based representations, where exemplars are encoded as unstructured lists of entities and relations, losing crucial role information and limiting generalizability. To reduce the cognitive load of analogical mapping, we explored the effectiveness of two visuospatial training aids: (1) spatially organizing exemplars by category to facilitate comparisons, and (2) using color coding to highlight the roles of entities within each exemplar. Across three experiments, we examined whether these visuospatial aids improve learning rates on the Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT), a collection of 23 problems that require learning relational concepts. Our results showed that displays of previous instances that spatially sorted them into positive and negative sets led to faster concept learning. Learning was faster overall when problems were ordered easy-to-hard rather than randomly, but sorted displays were more effective in either case. Color coding proved beneficial only when colors unambiguously and non-redundantly linked entities that played corresponding roles; when color coding did not support a clear mapping, it interfered with learning. These findings suggest that rapid learning of relational concepts can be facilitated by display characteristics that support analogical mapping by comparisons.",

Here, we consider how different\nunderstandings of the term “social media” may influence how people think and talk about social\nmedia experiences and effects. To test this, we asked a nationally representative sample of adults\nin the United States (N = 1904) to indicate whether twelve popular platforms are “social media.”\nOur results revealed significant variation in the identification of “social media”— with general\nagreement that six platforms are social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat,\nand TikTok) and a lack of consensus about the other six (Telegram, Signal, Discord, WhatsApp,\nand Messenger, and YouTube). Younger participants were more likely to view four platforms as\nsocial media (Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok), whereas older participants were more\nlikely to view six platforms as social media (Reddit, YouTube, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, and\nMessenger). Additionally, we examined the correlates of holding broad vs. narrow social media\nschemata, finding that individuals with broader schemas perceived hate speech to be more\nprevalent on social media. Looking forward, we discuss how the lack of consensus around the\nterm “social media” may affect how people respond to survey questions about social media, as\nwell as perceive and converse about their effects and policy implications in society.",

We probed the foundational intuitions underlying these important societal questions through a developmental lens, examining how adults and 4- to 9-year-old children evaluate universalist versus exclusive decision-making systems that could potentially have better decision effectiveness and efficiency. Study 1 found that compared to expert-led exclusive voting, children and adults preferred universal systems and thought they were fairer. Study 2 found similar patterns even when we emphasized the decisions as important and consequential. We also introduced a moral-led exclusive voting system and found that, with age children increasingly believed the universalist system was more fair than both expert-led and moral-led exclusive systems, although they acknowledged the exclusive systems could yield better outcomes (in line with adult responding).  Study 3 further investigated evaluations of exclusive systems based on incompetence, immoral behaviors, or arbitrary characteristics. Children and adults regarded immorality-based exclusions as the fairest type of exclusion, followed by incompetence-based and then arbitrary exclusions. Across studies, with age, children increasingly recognized that exclusive voting systems were faster than universal voting, demonstrating an awareness of the trade-offs between inclusiveness and efficiency. These results reveal an early-emerging preference for universalist voting and a growing sophistication in children’s thinking about fair decision-making systems in society.",

A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "abstract": "Adversity impacts people not only psychologically, socially, and physically, but spiritually as well.  In times of stress, many people experience spiritual struggles, defined as tensions, strains, and conflicts about spiritual matters within oneself, with other people, and/or with the supernatural.  In well over 100 empirical studies, spiritual struggles have been robustly linked to psychological problems.  However, because much of the research on this topic has been cross-sectional, a key question remains:  Are spiritual struggles the cause of psychological problems (the primary model of spiritual struggles), the effect of psychological problems (the secondary model of spiritual struggles) or both a cause and effect of psychological problems (the complex model of spiritual struggles)? This paper reviews emerging longitudinal research that examines this causal question and, more specifically, the three models of the causal relationship between spiritual struggles and psychological problems.  The findings show the strongest support for the primary model of spiritual struggles (the model that has been tested most often).  Research has also shown modest support for the secondary and complex models of spiritual struggles; however, more studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for further study and for practical work with people who are struggling spiritually.",

          "abstract": "For decades, attention has been framed as a selection process emphasizing what is attended to rather than how engagement is structured. Neither traditional models, such as the spotlight metaphor, nor prevailing theories that emphasize stimulus-driven selection fully account for the modulation, density, and volitional control of awareness. This framework introduces focal energy as the structuring force of awareness, defining how perception and attention is actively shaped through its placement, intensity, density, and stability on the conscious field. By conceptualizing attention as the deployment and modulation of focal energy, this model reframes focus as both a selective and generative autonomous cognitive force rather than a passive filter. The constellation model of focus further expands this concept, recognizing attention’s nature as a distributed arrangement of nodes of concentrated awareness, dynamically shifting in intensity and engagement dynamics across perceptual and cognitive fields. This represents a foundational shift in attentional research, offering a precise operational mechanism of function rather than just descriptive attributes. While phenomenologically articulated from first principles, this framework opens itself to empirical validation, providing testable structures for neuroimaging, behavioral studies, and attentional endurance research. By redefining focus as a structured, volitionally governed force, this model bridges attention, cognitive autonomy, and volitional control while unlocking a deeper understanding of how consciousness is actively sculpted rather than passively received.",

          "authors": "Michael Ferketic",
          "abstract": "Subconscious suggestion is a silent but pervasive force shaping perception, decision-making, and attentional structuring beneath awareness. Operating as internal impressive action, it passively introduces impulses, biases, and associative framings into consciousness, subtly guiding behavior without volitional approval. Like hypnotic suggestion, it does not dictate action; it attempts to compel through motivational pull, inﬂuencing perception and intent through saliency and potency gradients. Unlike previous theories that depict subconscious inﬂuence as abstract or deterministic, this work presents a novel structured, mechanistic, operational model of function, demonstrating from ﬁrst principles how subconscious suggestion disperses inﬂuence into awareness, interacts with attentional deployment, and negotiates attentional sovereignty. Additionally, it frames free will not as exemption from subconscious force, but as mastery of its regulation, with autonomy emerging from the ability to recognize, reﬁne, and command suggestive forces rather than be unconsciously governed by them.",

          "abstract": "In a just society, who should have a voice in group decision making? Should everyone get to decide, or only the most elite and competent individuals? We probed the foundational intuitions underlying these important societal questions through a developmental lens, examining how adults and 4- to 9-year-old children evaluate universalist versus exclusive decision-making systems that could potentially have better decision effectiveness and efficiency. Study 1 found that compared to expert-led exclusive voting, children and adults preferred universal systems and thought they were fairer. Study 2 found similar patterns even when we emphasized the decisions as important and consequential. We also introduced a moral-led exclusive voting system and found that, with age children increasingly believed the universalist system was more fair than both expert-led and moral-led exclusive systems, although they acknowledged the exclusive systems could yield better outcomes (in line with adult responding).  Study 3 further investigated evaluations of exclusive systems based on incompetence, immoral behaviors, or arbitrary characteristics. Children and adults regarded immorality-based exclusions as the fairest type of exclusion, followed by incompetence-based and then arbitrary exclusions. Across studies, with age, children increasingly recognized that exclusive voting systems were faster than universal voting, demonstrating an awareness of the trade-offs between inclusiveness and efficiency. These results reveal an early-emerging preference for universalist voting and a growing sophistication in children’s thinking about fair decision-making systems in society.",

Drawing on Damasio's view of emotions as bodily signals, Friston's free energy principle, and Tononi's integrated information theory, this hypothesis posits that emotions manifest as dynamic patterns triggered by chemical-neural dynamics in humans and computational processes in AI. Pattern recognition between these triggers, including inexplicable AI behaviors not intended by designers, could reveal shared structural or functional properties, supporting the code's universality. Such anomalies in AI may reflect latent emotional patterns, akin to unpredictable human responses. Humans and AI, as code-driven systems, differ in code access - humans' neural code is opaque, while AI's algorithms are modifiable - highlighting the code's framework. Quantifiable through computational neuroscience, these patterns offer insights for theta burst stimulation (TBS) in mental health and ethically designed, emotionally intelligent AI.",

This paper introduces a factored regression framework designed to estimate latent variable interactions and nonlinear effects, providing a flexible approach for modeling complex data structures, accommodating diverse data types, and handling missing data on any variable. The factored regression framework also allows graphical diagnostics to probe interactions effectively. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to compare the performance of factored regression with existing maximum likelihood methods, such as latent moderated structural equations and product indicators. Results indicate that factored regression performs comparably to, if not better than, these traditional methods. The factored regression framework is implemented in Blimp software, offering an accessible and user-friendly syntax for specifying the models. Through practical examples and syntax excerpts, this article demonstrates the application of factored regression for estimating latent interactions, making it more approachable for a wide audience in behavioral research.",

          "abstract": "There is a perception among those on the Canadian Psychology academic job market, that hiring expectations (e.g., number of publications, grants, accomplishments) have increased dramatically over the past decade. However, no data on hiring expectations across all areas of Psychology is available to inform career planning decisions. The purpose of this study was to understand the current psychology academic hiring experience through a mixed-methods approach. Focusing on faculty members hired from 2012-2022/3, data was collected via 1) an online search of Canadian Psychology departments (Study 1: N = 439) and 2) an online survey (Study 2: N = 76). Study 1. On average, excluding those hired into teaching positions, candidates were on the job market for M=4.05 years and had M=20.25 publications upon hire. These numbers varied depending on the year, gender, and area of research. There was a 24% increase in the number of publications between those hired in 2012-2016 versus 2017-2022. Universities with medical schools were more likely to hire candidates trained in the US compared to comprehensive or undergraduate universities. Study 2. In a smaller sample of self-reporting faculty members, research-stream professors took an average of 2.34 years to obtain their first position and reported an average of 15.12 (SD=15.13) total publications upon hire. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses identified the following themes: 1) frustration and hopelessness, 2) location and moving barriers, 3) feelings of “luck,” and 4) high standards in the field. Findings will inform current job market expectations and guide students toward successful career choices.",

          "abstract": "In this narrative review, we examine the recent literature about the effects of screen time on\nsleep quality and academic performance during adolescence. With the growing use of digital\nmedia, particularly after COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents are spending almost 8-10 hours\nin front of screens every day. Research has shown that increased screen time, particularly\nbefore bedtime, disrupts sleep quality, amount of sleep and circadian rhythms. The\ndisruption of sleep, in turn, can influence attention, memory and learning, which is directly\nassociated with academic performance. Furthermore, unregulated and excessive screen time\nlimits the time for other activities such as homework, sports, social activities. Existing\nresearch has some limitations, such as mostly depending on surveys and self-report data, not\nusing experimental methods and not focusing on digital media content. This review\nhighlights the importance of using screens in a healthy and responsible way and the need for\nfuture studies to explore how different types of screen activities (e.g., short videos, games,\nsocial media, online learning) affect adolescents over time.",

          "abstract": "Cross-linguistic research has shown that object which-questions are the hardest types of wh-questions for children to comprehend and are acquired late. The present study asks when Spanish Differential Object Marking (DOM), an early cue to object marking, is actively used to successfully comprehend object which-questions in Spanish-speaking children. We also investigate whether DOM is first used in object which-question with human objects vs. animal objects. Fifty-five child learners of Argentinian Spanish (N=28, age 5-6; N=27, age 7-8) and nine monolingual adults participated in a picture matching task. The experimental stimuli are which-questions where DOM indicated an object interpretation (¿A qué bomberoobject está salpicando la doctorasubject?) or where absence of DOM made the structure ambiguous between a subject and an object question (¿Qué bomberosubject/object está salpicando la doctorasubject/object?). The results showed that DOM helped adults arrive at an object interpretation for object which-questions. When DOM was absent, adult responses did not differ from chance. Children did not use the morphological marking to interpret object which-questions, and absence of DOM determined a strong subject interpretation. In addition, a developmental effect indicates that at age 7-8, a subgroup of the children performed target-like. Spanish-speaking children used an agent-first bias to interpret ambiguous which-questions (i.e., without DOM). However, by age 7-8, children start using DOM as a reliable cue to override or prevent commitment to an agent-first interpretation.",

          "abstract": "The present research proposes and evaluates a novel method - centroid analysis - for measuring representations and concepts at both individual and group levels by mapping open-ended responses onto a pre-existing semantic vector space. Centroid analysis allows to retrace the target concept as the geometric center of the semantic vectors of the responses generated by this concept. At the group level, centroid analysis enables researchers to compare conceptual structures across different populations to investigate how factors such as language, culture, cognitive differences, educational background, or exposure to specific narratives shape shared representations. At the individual level,\ncentroid analysis allows for fine-grained assessments of how personal experiences, expertise, cognitive styles, or even temporary contextual influences affect conceptual representations. We evaluate this method using two distributional semantic models across several calculation methods, reference lexicon sizes, response types, and datasets with tasks ranging from single word substitutions to single and multiple free associations and multiple feature generation. We conclude that at the group level, the best method to retrace the response-generating concept as a vector in a multi-dimensional semantic space from the averaged vectors of participant responses is to collect multiple free associations (70 unique\nand 245 total responses per cue), use fastText for meaning-to-vector mapping for responses and cues, and to consider each response in the centroid calculation as often as it occurred in the data. At the individual level, the best results are achieved by employing fastText and considering at least 8 responses per item per participant in the centroid calculation.",

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "authors": "Martin Daumiller; Jennifer Meyer",
          "abstract": "Feedback is widely recognized as a key mechanism in educational psychology, shaping learning through cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes. Despite a rich body of research, core questions remain regarding when feedback is effective, why it works, and for whom it fosters meaningful learning. To examine the psychological and contextual mechanisms underlying feedback effectiveness, the studies included in this issue draw on diverse methodologies, including controlled experiments, longitudinal tracking in school settings, and digital trace analyses from authentic learning platforms. Central themes include the role of learner characteristics in feedback reception, the emotional and motivational dimensions of feedback processing, the impact of design and delivery features, and the reciprocal dynamics between feedback providers and receivers. What emerges across these contributions is a view of feedback as a dialogic and interpretive process, embedded within broader sociocultural and instructional systems. Insights from neuroscience, digital learning environments, and achievement motivation research further advance theorizing on feedback processes and point toward new directions for empirically grounded, interdisciplinary inquiry. Building on these insights and informed by recent theoretical and empirical developments, we offer a model that conceptualizes feedback as a multilayered process—shaped by individual, contextual, and social dynamics, and unfolding across cognitive, emotional, and motivational dimensions. This model captures the complexity of feedback interactions and highlights how feedback can support learners’ ongoing development, both in terms of immediate learning outcomes and longer-term academic development. We outline how such an integrative perspective and interdisciplinary perspectives and collaborations are necessary for developing feedback practices that are more targeted, responsive, and impactful for lasting educational growth.",

          "abstract": "Creativity has traditionally been difficult to measure, partly because it is linked to a diverse set of mental processes that are considered stimulus-independent, like daydreaming and imagining. Music, however, provides a tractable window into these varieties of spontaneous thought. During music listening, people regularly imagine fictional scenarios that feel highly personal, but are actually reliably prompted by features of the music. Here, we show in two studies that creativity is reliably predicted by music-induced imaginings. We used natural language processing to extract measures of elaboration, originality, and appropriateness from these imaginings, and show that they are predicted by scores on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, a standard measure of domain-general creativity. The ability to predict trait levels of creativity from spontaneous thought paves the way for more naturalistic, accessible measures of creativity that can be readily tailored to samples that share a socio-cultural background.",

          "abstract": "Traditional metric indicators of scientific productivity (e.g., journal impact factor; h-index) have been heavily criticized for being invalid and fueling a culture that focuses on the quantity, rather than the quality, of a person’s scientific output. There is now a wide-spread demand for viable alternatives to current academic evaluation practices. In a previous report, we laid out four basic principles of a more responsible research assessment in academic hiring and promotion processes (Schönbrodt et al., 2024). The present paper offers a specific proposal for how these principles may be implemented in practice: We argue in favor of broadening the range of relevant research contributions and propose a set of concrete quality criteria (including a ready-to-use online tool) for research articles. These criteria are supposed to be used primarily in the first phase of the assessment process. Their function is to help establish a minimum threshold of methodological rigor – including empirical rigor and theoretical rigor – that candidates need to pass in order to be further considered for hiring or promotion. In contrast, the second phase of the assessment process focuses more on the actual content of candidates’ research output and necessarily uses more narrative means of assessment. The debate over ways of replacing current invalid evaluation criteria with ones that relate more closely to scientific quality continues. Its course and outcome will depend on the willingness of researchers to get involved and help shape it.",

          "authors": "Levente Rónai; Flóra Hann; Szabolcs Keri; Bertalan Polner",
          "abstract": "Psychotic-like experiences predict the risk of subsequent psychotic disorders and may signal a broader vulnerability to mental health problems. Schizotypy, a multidimensional personality construct with disorganization at its core, predicts future psychosis risk. Heightened stress-reactivity is associated with vulnerability to psychosis, and positive and negative schizotypal traits predict distress-induced psychotic-like experiences (PLE-reactivity) in everyday life. Nevertheless, these findings require further investigation, since previous studies neither assessed the link between disorganization and stress- and PLE-reactivity in daily life, nor disentangled within- vs. between-person processes. We conducted an experience sampling study where participants reported PLEs, event-unpleasantness (pleasantness of a recent significant event), and exposure to stressors (e.g., decline in salary, housing, health, and relationships). Schizotypal traits were assessed with the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale - Brief (MSS-B). We obtained 4611 observations from 126 participants from the general population. Multilevel models were used to examine the main effects of schizotypal traits and their interaction with changes in stressor exposure in predicting PLEs and event-unpleasantness. Individuals with higher disorganized (but not positive or negative) schizotypy reported not only more intense PLEs in daily life but also were more likely to have PLEs when stressor exposure had risen. However, in those with higher negative schizotypy, such PLE-reactivity to stressors was reversed. Moreover, individuals with higher disorganization found events more unpleasant overall, and for them, being exposed to more stressors was related to a steeper rise in unpleasantness. Disorganization but not positive or negative schizotypy might be a specific determinant of stressor-related increases in psychotic-like experiences and stress-appraisal in everyday life in the general population. This supports that disorganization might be a critical predictor of vulnerability to stress-related mental health impairments. Our results also confirm the MSS-B's ecological validity, which can be a valuable discovery for the prevention of psychotic disorders.",

          "abstract": "A body of research suggests cross-neurotype interpersonal interactions may be more challenging, and non-autistic individuals show less interest in interacting with their autistic peers. However, it is not clear whether such cross-neurotype differences extend to prosocial decision-making behaviour – something that is vital for forming and maintaining social bonds. Using a physical-effort-based decision-making paradigm, in combination with computational modelling, we examined 30 autistic and 30 non-autistic individuals’ prosocial willingness to exert physical effort for oneself and others, as a function of whether the beneficiary shares their neurotype or not. We compared decisions to exert effort and action energisation when participants made decisions for the self, other same-neurotype and other different-neurotype. Results showed a robust self-bias in effort discounting, with both groups choosing to exert more effort for themselves than others, and no differences between same and different neurotype others. However, while non-autistic participants showed no difference in action energisation between same and different neurotype others, autistic participants exerted significantly more force for others of the same neurotype. Implicit, but not explicit, biases held about autism played a role: in autistic participants, higher implicit autism stigma predicted differences in effort discounting between same and different neurotype others, while in non-autistic participants, implicit bias predicted differences in actual effort exerted rather than decision-making. This work has important implications for understanding how interactor neurotypes and autism-specific biases may feed into prosocial decision-making contexts such as employment, health and education settings, where autistic individuals face the everyday consideration whether to disclose their diagnostic status.",

          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, the discursive turn in psychology has illustrated the social, political, and contextually sensitive nature of race and racism. In distinction to ‘mainstream’ psychological approaches which might treat race and racism as merely cognitive or socio-structural phenomena that influence our social lives, discursive psychological work has treated race and racism as embedded in our social life, with a concerted focus on how race and racism are oriented to and managed in our social interactions. In this paper, we identify the significant contributions of discursive research on race and racism in contrast to mainstream psychological approaches. We then outline ways of advancing the discursive psychology of race and racism through a focus on anti-Black racism to argue that discursive psychological studies can provide a situated investigation of race and racism through (1) prioritizing experiences and responses of Black people to racial encounters and policies; (2) demonstrating how anti-Black race-talk engages with the routinization of Whiteness, and (3) showing how aspects of socio-historical context inform the production and negotiation of race and racism. These will propel discursive psychological studies on race and racism to engage with broader contemporary psychological scholarship and provoke impactful avenues for future research.",

Cells must coordinate their actions with each other, communicating their homeostatic\nstates through chemical and electrical signals. The combination of homeostatic signals from individual\ncells creates a subjective and differentiated evaluation of the state of a multicellular organism as primary\nemotions, enabling it to transition from automatic reactions to active optimization behavior based on\ncompeting motives. Thus, I assert that consciousness is a function of communication among living\nbeings (initially cells), and it attained its subjective form by integrating a multicellular organism into a\nsingle subject.",

          "abstract": "Assessing a participant’s latent ability is one of the goals of item response theory (IRT) and IRT-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In the literature, the commonly adopted indicator of the precision of the ability estimator in IRT (including CAT) is the Fisher information. However, this index cannot reliably reflect the precision of the estimate when the number of items is small. Two alternatives to evaluating the standard error (SE) of the ability estimator have been proposed: the Monte Carlo parametric bootstrap  \\parencite{Liou1991} and the ``exact SE'' method \\parencite{magis2014}. The first part of this study contains some theoretical work. We start with showing that Magis's method is an instance of the parametric bootstrap. In particular, we derive the exact bootstrap distribution based on the principle of Magis's algorithm. Next, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the parametric bootstrap SE under the independent but not necessarily identically distributed condition. We prove the consistency of the parametric bootstrap SE. The asymptotic relative efficiency of it over the Fisher information SE is also established. The second part contains an improvement of the parametric-bootstrap algorithm for SE to reduce computational complexity. Using minimal sufficient statistics, we develop an accelerated version of the algorithm for the two-parameter logistic model. The last part concerns the small sample analysis. We conduct a series of simulations comparing the performance of the SE estimator from our proposed algorithm with that from the information-based method. We also illustrate an application of our algorithm on test construction using existing data with small item numbers. \nOverall, the results reveal an advantage of our newly developed method over the the information-based method for assessing the precision of the ability estimator in IRT.",

          "abstract": "Numerous language models propose a critical role of auditory short-term memory in spoken language processing, making reliable estimations of individual listeners’ memory capacities essential in linguistic research. Although a variety of cognitive tasks exist for assessing both visual and auditory short-term capacities in a laboratory environment (e.g., digit span), these types of tasks are typically not engaging for the participant. In the current study, we validate a novel “gamified” short-term memory assessment tool called Sandwich Builder. In Sandwich Builder, the participant completes 12 trials of a sandwich building game. Each trial, a drive-thru customer’s sandwich order is presented auditorily, including a list of 1 to 10 sandwich ingredients (e.g., salami, cheddar cheese, mayo, and olives). The participant needs to remember these sandwich ingredients and then build the customer’s sandwich by selecting the necessary ingredients in the correct order. We validate Sandwich Builder as an estimate of auditory short-term memory, finding significant correlations with other classic short-term memory measures. Additionally, we compare affect (i.e., mood), fatigue, and motivation following Sandwich Builder as compared to other classic tasks: Participants leave Sandwich Builder in a better mood, less fatigued, and more motivated than they leave other memory tasks. Sandwich Builder shows strong convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, and moderate-to-good test-retest reliability. Finally, we examine the practicality of Sandwich Builder as a measure of individual differences in speech perception research, providing expected power curves for two common paradigms. Altogether, we robustly demonstrate the utility of Sandwich Builder, which is openly available online.",

This relation is in contrast with the view that both statistical power and reliability depend similarly on the measurement error. In this view, robust but unreliable phenomena can be considered as a reliability paradox. The mathematical relation and possible independence of statistical power and reliability have been discussed in the statistical literature for decades. A common misconception related to the relationship between statistical power and reliability is that absolute reliability (measurement error) is often confounded with relative reliability (ratio of the true score variance and the total score variance). The present work reviews and discusses how measurement error and individual differences influence the relative reliability and robustness of a phenomenon. It discusses why relative reliability and robustness are partly related and why they are generally independent. Following these considerations, it is summarized how measurement error and group heterogeneity can be potentially manipulated to optimize for the reliability and robustness of a measured phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how humans store information within the thousands of concepts that structure thought, belief, and action. Building on recent work suggesting that each concept has a central form—a core representational structure that triggers strong beliefs when properties are encoded into it—this paper introduces and tests a new form-triggered belief: a default universality belief. Across two experiments, participants judged central form properties as universally true of all category members. They rejected this belief for properties that were highly prototypical or causally important, if they were not part of the concept's form. This effect held across both familiar and novel categories, and across domains including animals, artifacts, institutions, places, and events. These findings suggest a domain-general mechanism underlying universality judgments, with implications for theories of stereotyping, trauma, and ideology. More broadly, they help to explain how humans construct complex thoughts by reducing complex concepts down to a limited set of core properties, and they resolve a longstanding puzzle about why people assume universality despite its rarity in the natural world.",

          "authors": "Tjarde Savhannah Schulz",
          "abstract": "John Dewey's work on thought lays the groundwork for most modern conceptions of reflection. By revisiting his writings, this article provides an examination of his views on reflection and their connection to his broader philosophy of cultural naturalism. Aimed at making Dewey's ideas accessible to a new audience, the paper first introduces key concepts of Dewey’s philosophy of cultural naturalism as they relate to reflection. It then explores Dewey's understanding of the reflective process and identifies interruptions that can lead to a premature conclusion. Following, the article unpacks how reflective practices can be nurtured within educational settings, offering a visual model of facilitated reflection. The article concludes by considering the relevance of Dewey's insights in contemporary discussions on cognition, underscoring their enduring impact and practical application.",

          "authors": "Paul Haward",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure of human concepts, proposing and testing the Common Format Hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, all concepts share a central form—a domain-general structure that encodes their conceptual identity—while causal knowledge remains domain-specific. Across three experiments, participants learned about novel categories and their properties, with properties introduced either as satisfying a causal schema (which varied by domain) or as central form properties. The studies then tested the immediate activation of strong property-focused beliefs—specifically, beliefs about certainty, normativity, and permanence. Results showed that while participants sometimes used causal cues to guide form encoding, they only exhibited these strong beliefs when a property had been encoded as part of the central form. This pattern held across domains (animals and artifacts), despite different causal structures. These findings support the Common Format Hypothesis and offer new insight into conceptual combination, linguistic creativity, and concept learning.",

          "abstract": "Effect sizes are useful for understanding the magnitude of study results and for planning new studies using power analysis. But despite their wide usage, effect sizes are often misinterpreted. This is mostly due to an over-reliance on general effect size benchmarks that were not intended for broad application across a range of different research fields. Inaccurate effect size interpretations can consequently lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the magnitude of study results, as well as incorrect sample size estimates, which can increase the likelihood of false positive results. This article introduces the ESDist R package, which is designed to calculate empirically derived effect size benchmarks or a range of reliably detectable empirical effect sizes for a specific research question or field of interest by the calculation of effect size distributions (ESDs). This package can be used on data that can be easily extracted from pre-existing meta-analyses to help researchers more accurately plan new studies or to better understand how an individual study might relate to other studies in their field of interest. ESDist includes a set of features that make it easy to use in a priori power analysis. Moreover, the package includes a feature for estimating effect size benchmarks that account for publication bias and are weighted by effect sizes variances, which addresses existing limitations of using ESDs for study planning or interpretation.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents Quantum Consciousness Field Theory 4.0 (QCFT 4.0), an integrated theoretical framework that models consciousness as a field defined on a non-orientable toroidal Möbius manifold. Building upon previous iterations, QCFT 4.0 introduces a topological approach that addresses key challenges in consciousness science: the binding problem, phenomenal unity, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes. By incorporating empirical findings from quantum interference experiments and neurophysiological data, we demonstrate how consciousness may emerge through field interactions constrained by a specific topological structure. The model's predictions include half-integer harmonic signatures, coherence tunneling effects, and π-phase offset phenomena that match observed experimental data. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous yet ontologically nuanced framework that bridges quantum field theory, neuroscience, and phenomenology while suggesting new experimental directions for consciousness research.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. \nTo capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been increasingly used to model choice behavior involving reinforcement learning. RNNs are able to capture how choice probabilities change depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a single model is fit across the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when RNNs are used as benchmarks for predictive accuracy. We investigate the nature of the IDT property through simulation studies and examine how it affects the interpretation of predictive accuracy when RNNs are used as benchmarks for cognitive models. We also present examples using real-world data. Through these analyses, we discuss practical considerations and limitations in using RNNs as benchmarks for cognitive models and propose directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Relying on information from other people (social testimony) is essential for efficiently learning and reasoning about the world. However, determining who to trust is often challenging. In this paper, we argue that trust in social agents (i.e., those providing testimony) can be evaluated by assessing how optimally they have acquired their knowledge. Building on theories that describe knowledge acquisition as a stochastic search through a space of hypotheses, we present a framework which yields predictions about which agents will provide better testimony (because they are more likely to have uncovered higher-probability hypotheses) in different contexts. This approach allows us to jointly predict how the quality of testimony is affected by 1) features of the agents themselves, like their expertise; 2) consensus among multiple agents; and 3) features of the topic and hypothesis space, like its knowability. We present initial simulations demonstrating how even a basic implementation of our framework yields insight into which types of agents and  topics are more likely to result in accurate testimony (and why). We conclude by discussing how this preliminary research might be extended to address more complicated social reasoning scenarios.",

Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

Rooted in systemic phase-transition theory and spectral field analysis, this discipline redefines collapse not as a failure state, but as an archetypal process governed by harmonic dynamics that recur across ecological, economic, social, symbolic, and cognitive domains.\nDrawing upon recursive destabilization theory, feedback coupling, and symbolic field behavior, Collapse Harmonics identifies collapse events as the result of internal resonance amplification rather than linear degradation. Each collapse emits unique, trackable “harmonic signatures,” enabling predictive modeling through multi-domain resonance mapping. These collapse signatures manifest in both material substrates (e.g., ecosystems, infrastructures, economies) and symbolic substrates (e.g., collective myths, identity architectures, narrative coherence).\n\nThis paper delineates the field’s foundational laws, phase-transition mechanics, domain inclusion logic, and harmonic assessment tools. It further outlines protocols for early warning detection, symbolic resonance mapping, and ethically governed intervention. While the codex includes advanced symbolic and identity-layer tools, this preprint discloses only abstract mechanisms and filtered models in strict adherence to collapse sovereignty guidelines.\n\nCollapse Harmonics thus offers a unified platform for collapse science, integrating predictive foresight, symbolic analysis, and structural ethics into a single paradigm. It proposes a new frontier of research for collapse-aware governance, resilient field design, and multi-scale harmonization in an era of accelerating systemic disintegration.",

Participants in our experiment generated explanations in response to “why” questions comparing two words, with the order of these two comparison words randomized. Using a large language model, we measured how closely each explanation aligned with the comparison words.

          "abstract": "Affective touch is crucial in shaping social and intimate relationships, as it influences and helps regulate the emotional states of touchers and touchees. Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

TGTS introduces \"PreForm\" — a biologically constrained window enabling cognitive selection and agency.\nBuilding on research in immunology, neurodevelopment, and network neuroscience, TGTS explains how chronic low-grade inflammation alters thought selection, impairs cognitive flexibility, and may drive neurodivergent outcomes. It reframes conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and anxiety not as deficits but as adaptive cognitive equilibria shaped by biological and environmental forces. This framework positions inflammation not merely as a pathological factor but as a fundamental substrate for adaptive learning and cognitive agency.",

Reasoning that adaptive control might be hard to implement implicitly in L2 production, here, we induced adaptive control explicitly by presenting informative cues revealing whether the upcoming stimulus would be congruent/incongruent (in L1 Stroop) or cognate/noncognate (in L2 picture naming). Adaptive control was successfully induced in L1 Stroop, with informative cues, relative to uninformative ones, having a facilitatory effect. Such was not the case for L2 picture naming, in which informative cues had an inhibitory effect.

Previous research has reported associations between child irritability and family conflict (FC) but has failed to consider bidirectional relations between these variables.

Participants (N= 11,868 youth, Mage at Time 1 = 9.48, SD = 0.51 years, 47% female, 49.5% White) and one of their parents (85.3% mothers) completed annual assessments of FC (Family Environment Scale-conflict subscale; child report) and child symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist; parent report). Using latent growth curve models with structured residuals (LCMs-SR), we found that child irritability declined from ages 9/10 to 13/14, but irritability slopes and intercepts varied by child gender. Specifically, boys’ irritability was initially higher than girls but decreased over time, whereas girls’ irritability remained stable. FC also declined over time, but boys reported higher initial FC that decreased more rapidly than girls’ reports of FC did. In the bivariate models, boys’ reports of FC at Time 1 were prospectively associated with irritability at Time 2. Furthermore, for girls, irritability at Time 2 predicted elevations in FC at Time 3, but for boys, irritability at Time 3 was associated with less FC at Time 4.

          "abstract": "Language is a fundamental human capacity. Large language models (LLMs) have presented the first viable model of language outside of humans, yet how these models learn and use language differs significantly from humans. Here, we compare LLMs and humans processing language with varying levels of sensory information – from disembodied written text to audiovisual videos of speakers – to demonstrate that, in both humans and LLMs, sensory context is critical for optimal language processing. We asked human participants to predict upcoming words within narratives presented as either audiovisual, audio-only, or written language (N = 1500 total; 500 per modality). We compared these predictions across modalities as well as to predictions generated by LLMs. Human predictions were overall more accurate than LLMs, regardless of the modality of language processing. Compared to written language, both audiovisual and audio-only language increased the accuracy and consensus of human predictions and decreased alignment with LLMs. We identified that prosody, a central feature of the auditory signal, partially drove both the observed advantage in accuracy within humans and divergence from LLMs. Integrating multimodal information (e.g., prosody, auditory, or audiovisual information) with the representation of language learned during LLM training improved models’ next-word prediction performance and increased the efficiency of language learning. These findings demonstrate that sensory contexts are foundational to human-like language behavior, and that these contexts can enrich and accelerate language acquisition within LLMs similar to what is observed within human development.",

This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains.

          "abstract": "Qualitative research excels at revealing the nuance of human behavior, yet the volume, multilingual scope, and cultural diversity of contemporary datasets increasingly strain its hallmark depth. Drawing on generative artificial intelligence (genAI) capabilities, this paper proposes a hybrid, human‑in‑the‑loop framework that reconciles scale with interpretive rigor. We first establish a manually coded “ground‑truth” subset to anchor subsequent analysis, then employ an AI platform (myRA) to extend deductive and inductive coding across large corpora. Iterative cycles of human validation refine AI‑generated themes, ensuring contextual accuracy and theoretical coherence. We address ethical imperatives, data anonymization, transparent reporting of AI use, and model bias mitigation. We also advocate for privacy‑preserving deployments and locally hosted models where feasible. Looking ahead, we identify four trajectories for AI‑enhanced qualitative inquiry: multimodal analysis that fuses text, audio, and video; multilingual comparison at scale; AI‑driven theory building; and the co‑design of ethically grounded AI systems. Ultimately, we argue that the future of qualitative research lies not in automating interpretation but in strategically augmenting human expertise with AI’s speed and pattern recognition power, thereby achieving deeper insights without sacrificing methodological integrity.",

          "abstract": "Can artificial intelligence (AI) provide emotionally effective support traditionally delivered by humans? This research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as extrinsic emotion regulators (EER) in non-clinical contexts. Across four studies, we systematically compared the structure, perceived effectiveness, and regulatory effects of LLM- versus human-generated comforting messages. Study 1 (N = 279) used thematic analysis to show that LLM-generated responses largely mirrored human EER strategies, with some discrepancies between different LLMs. Study 2 (N = 309) demonstrated that AI-generated comforting messages produced greater emotional improvement and were rated as more emotionally supportive than human messages. Study 3 (N = 196) tested emotional validation (i.e., acknowledgement of the target’s emotional response) as a mechanism, finding that perceived supportiveness rather than emotional validation predicted higher emotional improvement. Study 4 (N = 188) identified actionable support (i.e., specific and implementable regulatory tactics) as a key factor explaining LLM’s regulatory advantage in the previous studies. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively mimic or even surpass human regulators in EER, such advantage seems to be limited to providing actionable tactics within comforting messages. Implications are discussed for theories of interpersonal emotion regulation and AI-human interaction, highlighting the critical role of actionable regulatory tactics for successful interpersonal emotion regulation.",

A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "authors": "Jolina Ulbricht",
          "abstract": "With increasing cultural diversity in classrooms, teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs have become an increasingly important focus in teacher education research and have been conceptualized as a central component of teachers' professional development (Hachfeld, 2013). However, more research is needed on how pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs develop and under what conditions they change (Bayram Özdemir et al., 2024; Civitillo et al., 2018). This study examines the development of pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs, considering the conditions and recurring patterns that shape this process. We conducted interviews with eight pre-service teachers at two time points, before and after different practical experiences in classrooms. Using a constructivist grounded theory methodology (Charmaz, 2017), we analyzed three anchor cases to illustrate the complex relation between pre-service teachers’ White cultural identity development and cultural diversity beliefs. The results construct a contextually relevant theory of White pre-service teachers’ development of cultural diversity beliefs in East Germany, elucidating their defining characteristics and the conditions under which they emerge. The findings highlight the importance of critical reflection on identity and experiences with rejection, discrimination, and racism, as well as a nuanced conceptualization of culture, in shaping pre-service teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs, pointing to the need for teacher education programs to intentionally foster these processes to support culturally responsive teaching.",

Through both between-subject (Study 1, n=349) and within-subject designs (Study 2, n=259), we demonstrate that ostracism significantly alters perceptions, increasing negativity and adversity while reducing positivity. Notably, situational perception proved to be a stronger predictor of feelings of neglect and exclusion than Big Five personality traits in both studies, with positivity and negativity as key factors in the impact of ostracism.

          "authors": "Björn Erik Hommel; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Many behavioural scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioural science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerised language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy for item correlations was .71, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, with larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work towards a more unified behavioural science taxonomy.",

          "authors": "Dmitry Grigoryev; Albina Gallyamova; Elizaveta Komyaginskaya",
          "abstract": "The debate around the integration hypothesis in acculturation research frequently centers on the interpretation of effect sizes. While critics argue that these effects are too small and inconsistent to be meaningful, supporters maintain that they reflect statistically robust and theoretically coherent patterns. This controversy reveals a broader epistemological challenge in psychology: persistent ambiguity regarding what constitutes a ‘sufficient’ effect size, rooted in limited attention to the philosophical foundations of measurement and causality. In particular, this includes neglect of the ergodic fallacy—the mistaken assumption that group-level patterns apply directly to individuals—and confusion between statistical regularities and causal explanations. This paper addresses these concerns through three interrelated discussions. First, it re-evaluates the empirical status of the integration hypothesis in light of recent meta-analyses and the epistemic weight of small effects in complex systems. Second, it analyzes how effect sizes should be interpreted across different levels of analysis—individual, inter-individual, and group—and emphasizes the need to align interpretation with the appropriate unit of explanation. Third, it explores the philosophical foundations of psychological measurement, distinguishing between data patterns, theoretical constructs, and causal inferences. Rather than viewing effect sizes as direct indicators of psychological properties or causal strength, we conceptualize them as structured regularities shaped by research design, measurement models, and ontological assumptions. By clarifying these issues, this paper offers a framework for more coherent, theoretically informed interpretations of empirical findings in acculturation psychology and calls for a shift from simplistic magnitude judgments to context-sensitive evaluation of what effect sizes represent.",

While research has primarily investigated behavior in externally structured situations in which participants have to adhere to a predefined processing sequence and strategy, in reality it is often the case that we have to deal with these situations ourselves. There are also frequent interruptions, for example in the form of additional tasks. We developed an experimentally controlled setting of such a situation to examine the processing behavior and the resulting effects as well as variables potentially determine the behavior. Therefore, we used a self-structured paradigm in which participants were confronted with a complex task environment. This environment contained a multitude of target items and three different tasks had to be accomplished while further interruptive tasks had to be completed. The interruptive tasks occurred at irregular intervals while the self-structured paradigm was being processed. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was a pilot experiment in which initial hypotheses were tested and further exploratory analyses were conducted. The preregistered Experiment 2 served to replicate these findings. Our results confirmed the occurrence of switch costs for all types of task switches. Furthermore, we identified two stable strategies for processing the target items. We found initial evidence that the choice of strategy is associated with the sensitivity of the behavioral inhibition system and polychronicity. The processing of the interruptive tasks varied slightly over time. Early processing of the interruptive tasks occurred primarily when these interruptive tasks were new and tended to be associated with positive experience and better performance on these tasks.",

          "abstract": "Caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face significant psychological distress due to stigma, impacting their mental health and life satisfaction. However, the specific effects of courtesy stigma, vicarious stigma, and affiliate stigma, along with the role of social support, remain underexplored. This study examines the relationships among different types of stigmas, social support, mental health (anxiety and depression), and life satisfaction among caregivers in mainland China. A cross-sectional survey of 123 caregivers from two cities assessed stigma perception, social support, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction using validated scales. Correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, and Bootstrap mediation analysis were employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed that all three types of stigma were positively associated with anxiety and depression but negatively related to life satisfaction. Social support significantly buffered the adverse effects of stigma, partially mediating the relationship between stigma and caregivers' well-being. Moreover, social support played a protective role in mitigating the psychological distress caused by stigma, though it could not eliminate its adverse effects. These findings highlight the need for more decisive social support systems, increased public awareness, and early interventions to reduce stigma-related distress and improve the well-being of caregivers of children with ASD.",

In this paper, I present a new hypothesis that re-examines the mechanism behind nocturnal emissions, or “nightfall.” Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence and logical analysis, I propose that nightfall may not arise from unresolved sexual desire or hormonal overflow, as often assumed, but rather from a miscommunication within REM sleep processes.\n\nSpecifically, the hypothesis integrates three distinct mechanisms: \n1) The physiological upregulation of penile sensitivity during REM sleep.\n2) The temporary shutdown of critical evaluation by the prefrontal cortex.\n3) The memory system's inability to properly encode certain dream content. Together, these processes may create a “perfect storm,” allowing the brain to wrongly interpret neutral dream cues as sexual, triggering involuntary ejaculation—often without any consciously erotic dream.\n\nWhether ultimately confirmed or refuted, I believe this hypothesis opens a door worth walking through.

Diophantine-LDFS integration improved fusiform specialization predictions by 15% over Gaussian models.\nConclusion: The multimodal NF framework demonstrates efficacy in accelerating Kanji acquisition, emphasizing co-adaptive learning, Bayesian–fuzzy fusion, and Diophantine encoding as key drivers of neuroplasticity.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, people are challenged to manage a variety of tasks and stimuli. Previous research has primarily focused on examining this behavior in externally structured situations in which participants are forced to use a predefined processing strategy. However, everyday life mostly requires people to apply self-generated processing strategies and to choose self-dependently between different processing procedures. The current study examined the factors that influence the strategy choice in two pre-registered experiments and determined which consequences result from forcing people to apply a prescribed strategy. For this purpose, we used a self-structured paradigm where participants were confronted with a complex task environment containing a multitude of targets and in which three different tasks had to be handled. Participants were instructed to complete all tasks but we aimed to address how they approached the paradigm processing when they were allowed to adopt a self-generated strategy compared to a predefined strategy. Our results show that participants exhibit different processing strategies in a self-structured environment. The choice of a strategy can be influenced by individual preferences as well as by prior instruction. Forcing participants to apply a non-preferred strategy, as it regularly happens in externally structured paradigms, resulted in performance decline and increased experience of difficulty.",

          "abstract": "Collaboration with a partner can lead to more cheating behaviour than would occur individually, but much is unknown about the social factors contributing to this tendency. In two preregistered experiments we investigate the effects of commitment to one’s partner and reward structure on cheating in a sequential dyadic die-rolling paradigm. In Experiment 1, we manipulated two features of the social context: perceived effort investment by one’s partner and the duration of partnership. We found that participants cheated more when they perceived that their partner exerted high effort, which was significant in the short partnership condition. Moreover, participants cheated more individually post-collaboration than they had pre-collaboration, showing that collaborative cheating may carry over into subsequent behaviour. In Experiment 2, we manipulated who received each round’s rewards. Participants cheated more for joint rewards, but less when they were the reward recipients and perceived that their partner exerted high effort.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores a fundamental idea with far-reaching implications: the act of creating boundaries—of transforming\nthe continuous flow of reality into named, distinct units—underlies all human understanding. When we name something,\nwhether it be a “tree,” a “mountain,” or an “electron,” we divide the world. This boundary-drawing operation, which we call\ndiscretization, appears across all domains of human knowledge. Ancient paradoxes like Theseus’ ship and modern scientific\npuzzles such as wave–particle duality emerge from this same source: our necessary but ultimately arbitrary division of\ncontinuous reality into discrete categories. By examining this process across disciplines, we uncover connections between\nseemingly unrelated phenomena—from mathematical paradoxes to consciousness itself. We show how language functions as\na boundary-creation technology and argue that the limitations of our knowledge systems arise not from flaws, but from the\nvery geometry of information. This perspective reframes long-standing questions in science, philosophy, and psychology as\ndifferent manifestations of the same operation: creating meaning through distinction.",

          "authors": "Gordon H. Hanson; Enrico Moretti; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "We examine changes in the spatial distribution of good jobs across U.S. commuting zones over 1980-2000 and 2000-2021. We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates, good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (nontradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly nontradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.

          "authors": "Gordon H. Hanson; Dani Rodrik; Rohan Sandhu; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Place-based policy in the United States comprises a wide range of government programs that are spread across federal, state, and local agencies and that rely on public, private, and nonprofit organizations for policy design and implementation. We document how loosely connected vertical policy supply chains distribute resources from federal and state governments to recipients at the local level. The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "This chapter analyzes the distinct adjustment paths of U.S. labor markets (places) and U.S. workers (people) to increased Chinese import competition during the 2000s. Using comprehensive register data for 2000–2019, we document that employment levels more than fully rebound in trade-exposed places after 2010, while employment-to-population ratios remain depressed and manufacturing employment further atrophies. The adjustment of places to trade shocks is generational: affected areas recover primarily by adding workers to non-manufacturing who were below working age when the shock occurred. Entrants are disproportionately native-born Hispanics, foreign-born immigrants, women, and the college-educated, who find employment in relatively low-wage service sectors such as medical services, education, retail, and hospitality. Using the panel structure of the employer-employee data, we decompose changes in the employment composition of places into trade-induced shifts in the gross flows of people across sectors, locations, and non-employment status. Contrary to standard models, trade shocks reduce geographic mobility, with both in- and out-migration remaining depressed through 2019. The employment recovery stems almost entirely from young adults and foreign-born immigrants taking their first U.S. jobs in affected areas, with minimal contributions from cross-sector transitions of former manufacturing workers. Although worker inflows into non-manufacturing more than fully offset manufacturing employment losses in trade-exposed locations after 2010, incumbent workers neither fully recover earnings losses nor predominantly exit the labor market, but rather age in place as communities undergo rapid demographic and industrial transitions.

While there is considerable evidence that a four-day week improves employee well-being, there is less evidence about its impact on employer outcomes. Drawing on novel data from more than 200 companies around the globe that participated in four-day, thirty-two-hour weeks with no reduction in pay, we find that 90% of companies continue this schedule. From neoclassical and Marxian theories of the workplace, institutional theories of legitimacy, and gendered and racialized organizational theory, we test three main hypotheses. As expected from labour process theories, we find that some employers revert to a five-day schedule after achieving efficiencies. From theories of legitimacy, we find that organisations that fail to reduce stress are more likely to revert. Finally, we find that organisations with more white males are also more likely to revert.",

The subject of our analysis is Polish air pollution activism or, more precisely, a coalition consisting of one nationwide organization coordinating the coalition's activities and many local organizations operating in particular communities (so called smog alerts). Our analysis is based on 27 in-depth interviews we conducted with activists. In our research, we mainly paid attention to the role of shared beliefs, resources and lead-organization activity in building activist empowerment. We examine the empowerment of air pollution coalition members at four levels: a sense of meaning, competence, self-determination and impact.",

          "abstract": "Turkey's 1934 Surname Law, mandating fixed surnames, coincided with the peak of the Language Reform, aimed at ``purifying'' Turkish vocabulary. This created a natural experiment where name choices reflected orientation toward the modernizing state. Viewing surnames as signs with ideological and personal significance, I explored how these choices reflected positions on nationalism, identity, and strategies for claiming status and building reputation. I analyzed surname patterns among political elites (4,873 individuals, 1927-1949) and a populace sample using thematic coding and frequency analysis. Elites disproportionately chose surnames featuring newly coined ``Pure Turkish'' words, Old Turkish etymology, and innovative linguistic structures, emphasizing themes of military, heritage, and social status. The general population maintained traditional naming patterns, favoring references to natural elements, physical traits, and occupations. This study reveals how personal choices like surnames can expose alignment with political projects, showing how elites strategically used naming to signal status and ideological commitment.",

          "authors": "Vasil Dinev Penchev",
          "abstract": "What should be the “physical interpretation” of Riemann’s hypothesis? Can its eventual physical interpretation pioneer a pathway for the proper mathematical proof? Answers to both questions are researched in the framework of ontomathematics inherently involving the unity of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. After that viewpoint, a philosophical method for reinterpreting most fundamental mathematical problems (in particular, the seven “Millennium Problems” of CMI) is suggested. Loosely speaking, it consists in determining the ontomathematical “forest” in which the “tree” of a certain very essential mathematical problem is situated, after which the shortest silogism eventually needing a relevant “Gestalt change” appears to be natural and almost obvious, furthermore rather elementarily provable. One even notices that many (if not all) most fundamental problems of contemporary mathematics appeal to the same “Gestalt change” needing the “Cartesian glasses” to be “put off” and Modernity and its episteme to be abandoned. As for mathematics itself, one can conjecture that many or all of the most fundamental problems are (or at least, are linkable to) Gödel’s insoluble statements. Ontomathematics suggests a general framework (also) for resolving many essential mathematical problems by breaking the Cartesian prejudice established by Modernity: then, Riemann’s hypothesis can be reformulated in terms of the qubit Hilbert space so that the “zeta function” belongs to it. If one manages to demonstrate this, Riemann’s hypothesis is rather easily provable since it refers to the fundamental reducibility of any qubit to a single bit “after measurement”. From the newly introduced viewpoint, the zeta function is \"physically\" continued also at its single pole therefore tracing its interpretation by means of the Noether (1918) first theorem. Its application for proving Riemann’s hypothesis is sketched in order to be elaborated in the next, second part of the study.",

          "abstract": "Teachers typically base their expectations on ‘valid’ criteria such as student performance and motivation. However, there is mixed evidence demonstrating that teachers hold lower expectations for immigrant students. We argue that the existence and strength of this relationship may depend on the framing effect of contextual settings. To establish this, we use data from the German National Educational Panel Study and analyze (1) whether teachers’ expectations of their elementary school students are influenced by students’ immigrant background; and (2) how this effect varies with the immigrant classroom composition, local neighborhood demographics, and teachers’ own immigrant background. Using multilevel panel models, we find negative associations between students’ immigrant, particularly Turkish, background and teachers’ expectations. These associations remain significant even when accounting for students’ aspirations and performance but disappear when accounting for students’ social background. However, we observe that the negative relationship between students’ immigrant background and teachers’ expectations remains robust and stable in contexts in which the immigrant category is salient, particularly in classrooms with high concentrations of immigrant students. We conclude that both research and educational practice could benefit from taking greater account of the contextualized formation of teachers’ stereotypes.",

El enfoque agentivo se adhiere a la tesis de que la cognición no se reduce a las funciones del cerebro, sino que es coextensiva a la capacidad de actuar, esto es, si hay acción entonces hay cognición y, por tanto, el sentido emerge de la relación de un agente con su entorno (enacción). Se plantea que la noción de agencia aumentada—la incorporación de artefactos para mejorar la realización de las acciones—es un rasgo distintivo de la especie humana y que la capacidad de diseñar artefactos se distingue de la elaboración de objetos naturales que realizan otros animales. Por tanto, la definición de artefacto se limita a un objeto creado por la especie humana con un propósito específico. En consecuencia, luego de hacer un balance crítico de otras propuestas, se aborda la clasificación de los artefactos bajo tres criterios: según el tipo de incorporación; según el tipo de engranamiento y según el tipo de acción que realizan los agentes. Esta tipología permite resolver categorías ambivalentes como cognitivo/pragmático y ser consecuente con el compromiso material y encarnado de la cognición, lo cual constituye un aporte a la comprensión de la naturaleza fundamentalmente aumentada de la agencia humana.",

Novel employer-linked household panel data allow us to study how these employer wage-setting decisions affect working poverty.  Minimums reduce poverty rates in adopting firms by 30% to 50%, relative to workers in similar jobs, labor markets and competitor employers. Minimums also narrow black/white, college/non-college, regional, and gender wage gaps within firms.  Poverty reduction is not explained by shifting worker selection, pre-trends, or offsetting decreases in hours or health insurance.  However, adopters employ more college-educated workers and intensify work.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines the enduring relevance of gender as a central organizing principle in society, with a focus on the social psychological mechanisms that reproduce gender inequalities. Building on existing theory and contemporary empirical research, we discuss how gender is conceptualized as a multilevel system of social practices that structures social relations – encompassing individuals’ identities and behaviors at the micro level, social interactions at the meso level, as well as cultural beliefs and social structures and institutions, like organizations, families, and states, at the macro level. We argue that social psychological tools and understandings of how gender operates in\nsocial interaction are at the heart of the gender system. These approaches are useful because they specify, for instance, the ways in which cultural beliefs about gender influence a range of important social outcomes, such as a person’s self-concept and their decision-making, divisions of paid and unpaid labor, workplace discrimination, and the structure of organizations. Moreover, they attest to the highly contextual nature of gender interactions, showing how gendered structures are produced, sustained, and transformed overtime. By interrogating the linkages among micro-level identities, meso-level interactions, and macro-level social institutions, we provide a comprehensive overview of current theories and research and make recommendations for future research directions.",

          "abstract": "Recent propaganda research has primarily centered on the \"Firehose of Falsehood\" model, extensively employed by the Russian state. This paper analyzes Telegram channels during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, revealing a new covert technique we term the Trojan Strategy. Using network cluster analysis and computational narrative signifier analysis, we demonstrate how Russia amplifies its dissemination capabilities and discreetly infiltrates Ukraine’s media space. Our findings show that this Trojan Strategy enables Russian Telegram channels to reach audiences typically beyond their influence, such as Ukrainians. We further explain how Telegram’s policies and existing political communication practices in Ukraine and Russia facilitate the effectiveness of this strategy, ultimately expanding the known repertoire of Russian propaganda methods.",

          "abstract": "This research examines how early youth in Bulgaria develop their sustainable consumer identities through socio-spatial contexts, using relational and critical frameworks. The study explores the interplay between the lived experiences of young individuals and their environmental engagement, incorporating aspects of consumer culture and climate change. The primary goal is to gain an understanding of young people's consumption practices and subjectivities in the post-communist Bulgarian society context. The sampling comprised 13 young individuals from diverse backgrounds living in both urban and rural areas of Bulgaria. A geo-social methodological approach was used, triangulating data from mapping activities, in-depth interviews, and essays. The focus was on examining the spatial and temporal dimensions of everyday consumer practices to provide a holistic view of their subjective experiences. The key findings indicate that youth hold complex identities that are relational to intersectionality, which can differ from top-down perceptions of sustainable consumers. The study discusses how intergenerational relations, close connections with the countryside, and social spaces where online and offline practices take place, significantly shape the consumer identities of young people. By offering valuable insights into the consumption behaviours and subjectivities of Bulgarian youth, this study contributes to the existing literature by bringing a bottom-up study agenda.",

          "authors": "Tim Morris; Liam Wright; Gemma Shireby; David Bann",
          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to investigate whether the predictors of educational attainment have changed across time. Here, we provide new insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958 and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by a polygenic index for educational attainment (EA PGI) have become more relevant to educational success over time, and whether returns to genetic endowments were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three novel findings. First, the EA PGI explained a larger proportion of variation in years of education over time, rising from 5.4% for the 1946 cohort to 5.7% in the 1958 cohort and 5.9% in the 1970 cohort. Second, patterns using a PGI for cognition were in the opposite direction to those with the EA PGI; 2.1% in 1946c to 1.6% in 1958c and 1.0% in 1970c. Given that the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success simultaneously, only some of which may be considered meritorious, this cautions against interpretations that reductions in the explanatory power of the EA PGI over time simply reflect increasing meritocracy. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: associations between the EA PGI and educational attainment were disproportionately larger amongst those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Our findings are consistent with educational attainment being influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.",

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "abstract": "Members of Congress routinely seek to improve their institutional position to increase their influence over policy outcomes. Prominent among those policy outcomes is the distribution of federal spending projects, where members can simultaneously secure local particularistic spending and its consequential electoral benefits. While institutional position facilitates the receipt of these policy goods, it is less clear whether representatives' position facilitates the receipt of the associated electoral benefits. We test whether a representative's signaling of policy influence through references to committee positioning increases the effectiveness of credit claiming for particularistic spending. Using a survey experiment, we measure how respondents change their approval and effectiveness ratings for a member of Congress when presented with different versions of real-world credit claiming press releases. Overall, we find that signaling influence vis-à-vis committee positioning has an undetectable effect on the effectiveness of credit claiming. This research highlights an important challenge faced by members of Congress in publicizing their roles in favorable policy actions.",

We apply a differential exposure approach (DEA) to Danish population data collecting public-school reading comprehension tests. The approach exploits variation in children’s birth dates and test administration dates to decompose children’s learning as the product of joint exposure to school and non-school environments. Key findings reveal that children experiencing parental separation have 5-7% lower test scores, with lower learning returns to non-school environments, and diminishing learning outcomes proportional to time spent in separated households. Critically, school appears to neither mitigate nor exacerbate these achievement gaps, suggesting that degrading of non-school environments post-separation primarily impacts children's learning.",

There is a particular need for research with marginalized online sex workers, including transgender/nonbinary (TNB) people. Accordingly, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 U.S.-based TNB young adults, ages 22-30 years, who had done online sex work. We triangulated interview data through focus groups with 17 clinicians and advocates. Using template-style thematic analysis, we developed themes addressing reasons for doing online sex work (five themes); stressful dynamics (six themes); fulfilling dynamics (five themes); and protective factors (two themes). Participants did online sex work for a mix of financial and personal reasons. Stressful dynamics included pressure to conform to sexual stereotypes, restrictive platform rules, and sex work stigma. Fulfilling dynamics included skill/career development, self-exploration, and opportunities to promote healthier sexual norms. Economic stability and longer-term sex work experience emerged as protective factors. Clinicians and advocates should recognize the diversity of TNB young adults’ online sex work experiences, oppose restrictive laws and platform policies, and advocate for safety net programs that help young adults maintain economic stability.",

We ask whether citizens’ satisfaction with redistricting in their state is shaped by ends (election results) or by means (type of redistricting process). Leveraging questions on the 2022 Cooperative Election Study (CES), state-level variation in redistricting processes, and 2022 election outcomes, we find that both ends and means shape the public’s satisfaction with redistricting in their state. Among respondents who correctly identified their state's redistricting process for the 2022 midterm elections, those living in a state with a redistricting commission reported greater support for redistricting than those living in a state with legislature-controlled redistricting. We also find that respondents who are represented by a co-partisan in the US House are more supportive of their state’s congressional redistricting process than both respondents who identify as Independent and respondents who are represented by an opposing party legislator. Successful electoral reforms require public buy in, and our results suggest that partisan power considerations and a lack of public knowledge about congressional redistricting present barriers to reforming state-level redistricting processes.",

To advance AI-assisted communication research, we examined the performance of ChatGPT (powered by GPT-4) in generating message stimuli for experimental research. Through four pre-registered experiments, we compared GPT-generated stimuli with human-generated stimuli in (1) manipulating target variables (discrete emotions and moral intuitions) and (2) controlling unintended variables. We found GPT-generated message stimuli performed equivalently to or even surpassed human-generated stimuli in manipulating target variables, while the performance in controlling unintended variables was mixed. Our study suggests that LLMs can generate effective message stimuli for communication experimental research. This research serves as a foundational resource for integrating LLMs in stimuli generation across various communication contexts, with its effectiveness, opportunities and challenges discussed.",

This decision is likely influenced by public messaging concerns. We theorize that both credit claiming for federal projects and position-taking against spending projects (“pork busting”) can benefit legislators as they look to improve future electoral returns. We field a nationally-representative survey experiment to estimate the effect of credit claiming and pork busting messages on the perceived effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and overall approval of an unnamed member of Congress. We find that respondents are likely to penalize the representative’s approval assessment when presented with an outparty message strategy. Conversely, respondents are likely to increase the representative’s personal trait assessments when presented with an inparty message strategy. We expand on these results in an additional analysis and find that these trends persist when controlling for other partisan and demographic factors.

          "abstract": "Wealth plays a crucial role in providing private insurance, investment opportunities, and social status, shaping citizens’ policy preferences. These preferences, in turn, influence government decisions to stabilize financial markets and protect private wealth during economic crises. However, such policies often reinforce wealth inequality, particularly benefiting asset-rich households. Using information treatment and conjoint survey experiments in Australia and the UK in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how citizens navigate this trade-off. We find that informing respondents about the impact of financial stabilization policies on overall wealth inequality decreases support for such policies, whereas highlighting their effects on even larger wealth disparities between ethnic groups has little effect. Furthermore, respondents are more supportive of targeted policies aimed at reducing general wealth disparities than those targeting ethnic inequality. This distinction in inequality aversion underscores a key political economy challenge in addressing wealth concentration in contemporary multiethnic societies.",

This research focuses on how presidential endorsements affect voter’s perceptions of and support for Congressional candidates. Using a preregistered survey experiment embedded in the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we examine how respondents change ideological perceptions and support for a fictional candidate when presented with a presidential endorsement. We find that Trump endorsements carry a negative effect that is mediated by respondents’ ideological perceptions of the candidate. We corroborate these findings with observational analyses among verified voters in the 2022 midterm elections.

However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",

The findings highlight the French sinologists’ approaches to defining and classifying Chinese words, their views on the relationship between written and spoken Chinese, and insights into the syllabic and morphological features of Chinese word formation. Although their analyses were grounded in the Latin grammatical framework for pedagogical convenience, they began to break away from it, recognizing the unique features of Chinese. The study also discusses the significance of their contributions to the history of Chinese grammatical research.",

          "abstract": "German academia has faced a multitude of changes over the last two decades, including new alternative academic pathways to a professorship based on the Anglo-Saxon science system, such as junior or tenure track professorship. Our study investigates the patterns of academic career trajectories to a professorship that have emerged due to these changes. It looks deeper into the relationship between those patterns and determinants of academic success, such as previous career choices, scientific productivity and the chosen scientific field. Using data from the prof*panel (N=660) – a survey of recently appointed full professors in Germany – and sequence-cluster analysis, we find four academic career clusters, three of which are beyond the traditional pathway of Endurance Careers: Efficient Careers, Unconventional Careers and International Careers indicating an institutional change within German academia. Cluster affiliation is mainly related to time-to-tenure, habilitation (second thesis), working abroad and the field of the professorship. Our findings suggest that traditional career paths still play a major role, although the influence of internationalization and novel academic career steps, like junior and tenure-track positions, is growing. Furthermore, less conventional career paths, attract a higher proportion of women and are characterized by international mobility and more diverse professional experiences. The insights of our study underscore the ongoing changes in the landscape of academic careers and highlight both persistent challenges and new opportunities for aspiring professors.",

          "abstract": "Collective decision-making can be more accurate than individual decision-making, due to the ability of groups to aggregate information from many individuals. However, information aggregation and collective learning is vulnerable to a variety of social and cognitive biases which can undermine the \"wisdom of the crowds\" and result in bad decisions. Here, we study the effect of two very hard-to-avoid kinds of biases: the tendency of similar individuals to be connected, and the tendency to share some kinds of information more than others. We build mathematical models of a society composed of rational agents that use Bayesian inference to learn about the world, combining their direct observations with information they obtain from other agents. We include two forms of transmission bias: (1) assortment in communication networks, where individuals preferentially connect with similar others, and (2) selective sharing of signals. We identify conditions under which these effects are sufficient to generate stable divergence of beliefs across the population--either in the form of polarization or the entire population being misled. We show that when the population is balanced between types of agents, the collective is most sensitive to the effects of assortment. This is also the condition when the collective is  most responsive to the environment. Therefore, belief polarization is most likely under conditions that  support the greatest collective ability to learn the truth. Our results thus identify tradeoffs between accuracy and consensus in collective learning and highlight structural limits to collective intelligence, even in an idealized setting.",

          "authors": "Petr Nuska",
          "abstract": "This article explores the phenomenon of ‘musical blood’ using the case of Slovak Roma to challenge both the specific myth of innate Romani musicality and the broader assumption that musical ability is genetically inheritable within ethnic groups. Rather than debunking racist ideas about primordially assigned ethnic features, the article advocates for a more nuanced and scholarly approach to understanding how musical abilities are constructed, perceived and valued within varying social and cultural environments. The article provides an overview of the literature on the heritability of musicality, focusing on the specifics (and pitfalls) of applying this concept to ethnic groups. Then, it critically examines how societal conceptions of music contribute to the persistence of the musical blood myth, suggesting that these beliefs are rooted in sociocultural narratives and stereotypes. It delves into an analysis of multifaceted sociocultural constructs that sustain the notion of ethnic musical predispositions; different sociocultural contexts shape the perception and valuation of musical enculturation, musical aptitude and music per se. The article then analyses the case of Slovak Roma to illustrate broader theoretical implications, providing a critical lens on the role of systemic biases held by non-Roma (heterostereotypes), Romani self-ascribed identification with the construct (autostereotypes), and mutual interactions thereof. While the article is based on the author’s long-term ethnographic observations in Gemer-Malohont in Slovakia (2013–2023), it pairs material from this context with existing ethnographic scholarship, covering cases of Romani musical blood in different sociocultural contexts. The article reflects on the importance of understanding ‘musical blood’ not just as a stereotype but as a meaningful and impactful sociocultural construct deeply embedded in the lives and identities of Romani musicians and their communities.",

At its core is a volunteer-driven governance system in which users elect administrators - trusted community members granted special rights and responsibilities. While previous research has emphasised online behaviours and platform-native metrics in explaining who becomes an administrator, this study examines how offline interactions shape leadership outcomes within the German-language Wikipedia. Drawing on large-scale observational data covering two decades of both online and offline activity, and using hybrid multilevel random effects models, the study investigates who runs for administrator and who is ultimately successful. The findings reveal that attending offline meetings has little bearing on the decision to run but significantly increases the likelihood of being elected. These effects are not consistent over time: while offline interactions mattered most in the early years of the platform, their influence diminished in more recent periods. The results highlight the importance of interpersonal ties even in digital and democratic spaces. This study contributes to broader debates on participation and leadership in peer production platforms.",

Such concerns date to Karl Marx, but have acquired renewed salience in the age of artificial intelligence and robots. This paper draws lessons from a major technological revolution in agriculture: the green revolution. In India, the spread of a new crop technology, high-yielding variety (HYV) crops, improved agricultural productivity, but also generated rising inequality between landowners and the rural poor. Drawing on a panel dataset linking district-level estimates of HYV crop adoption to digitized crime records, this paper provides evidence that the spread of the new crop technology contributed to a wave of banditry (dacoity), a crime associated with class conflict in agrarian societies. The technology-violence relationship was concentrated in districts with colonial-era landlord-based (zamindari) land tenure systems, plausibly because of less pass-through of agricultural productivity improvements to wages.",

In many cases, questions used to measure religion have been modified to better capture nonreligious identities. Little attention has been given to how these changes in measures affect the narrative about the “rise of the nones.” While there is no doubt that religiously unaffiliated populations have grown in many countries during the 21st century, we argue that the degree of such growth has sometimes been exaggerated. When measurement changes are introduced, they can have a substantial effect. We review methodological issues that affect estimates of the size of religiously unaffiliated populations and their change over time.",

          "abstract": "This research applies Uses and Gratifications theory to examine individual motivations for sharing or not sharing deepfakes. After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

          "abstract": "The integration of computational methods into International Political Economy (IPE) represents a transformative advancement, enhancing both the depth and breadth of research in the field. These methods use algorithms and simulations to study large or complex settings. enabling scholars to connect micro-level interactions with macro-level outcomes, addressing concerns about the discipline’s focus on micro-foundations. In this entry, we detail three main techniques: To start, we describe simulations through agent-based modeling, where the behavior of agents (e.g. individuals, companies, or states) and their interactions is defined by a mathematical model and run on a computer hundreds of times. This exercise allows for an understanding of how the interactions of individual agents (e.g., diplomatic relations between countries) lead to larger systemic changes, such as the impact of tariff policies on global trade. Next, we detail network analysis, where relationships between agents are represented and visualized as networks composed of nodes (agents) and ties (connections between them). This allows IPE researchers to, for example, map trade relations, and identify which countries hold the most bargaining power. Finally, we discuss machine learning, where computational algorithms are used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. This approach enables scholars to process large volumes of data (e.g., millions of text documents), thus allowing them to develop and test theories using novel datasets. These three relatively accessible tools—simluations, network analysis and machine learning—provide powerful means for analysing complex data sets, offering new insights into global economic dynamics and informing more effective policy-making.",

          "abstract": "Designing for serendipity in information technologies presents significant challenges for both scholars and practitioners. This paper presents a theoretical model of serendipity that aims to address this challenge by providing a structured framework for understanding and designing for serendipity. The model delineates between intended, afforded, and experienced serendipity, recognizing the role of design intents and the subjective nature of experiencing serendipity. Central to the model is the recognition that there is no single definition nor a unique operationalization of serendipity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to its conceptualization and design. By delineating between the intentions of designers, the characteristics of the system, and the experiences of end-users, the model offers a pathway to resolve the paradox of artificial serendipity and provides actionable guidelines to design for serendipity in information technologies. However, it also emphasizes the importance of establishing ‘guardrails’ to guide the design process and mitigate potential negative unintended consequences. The model aims to lay ground to advance both research and the practice of designing for serendipity, leading to more ethical and effective design practices.",

Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics, we analyse evaluative language across institutional texts to explore how moral stance, affect, and cultural value are embedded within academic materials. While EMI is often presented as a neutral tool for accessing global knowledge, our findings reveal that course documents subtly encode Western epistemologies, positioning students through assumptions that conflict with their lived realities and local knowledge systems. Interviews and reflections from students illustrate how these texts produce confusion, cognitive fatigue, and affective dislocation, even when content appears culturally proximate. These dynamics reflect forms of symbolic violence that naturalise dominant knowledge regimes and marginalise students’ epistemic resources. Our study aligns with textbook analysis research and recent EMI critiques but extends them by revealing how ideological hierarchies are enacted through evaluative discourse, not just content. We argue for curriculum reform grounded in epistemic justice, calling for inclusive text selection, critical pedagogy, and institutional accountability to support more equitable knowledge engagement in EMI settings.",

          "abstract": "Scholars and industry audits have extensively documented the portrayal of racial and gender identities in mainstream Hollywood cinema, revealing persistent disparities in on‑screen representation. People of color in media, specifically film, have historically faced challenges, including underrepresentation, stereotypical portrayals, and limited storytelling. However, there is a gap in research specifically on women of color as protagonists in film. Most treat race and gender as separate issues. This study aims to investigate the underrepresentation and stereotyping of women of color in top-grossing Hollywood films by assessing screen time, speaking time, and narrative agency of women of color characters. Results show that the proportion of women of color in films has risen from 1% in 2007 to 16% in 2021. Women of color still comprise less than 10% of total screen time and speak only 14% of dialogue instances across the sample. A qualitative case study of Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Okoye and Shuri demonstrates that when women of color are positioned with central narrative agency, they exhibit leadership and technical influence that sharply contrast with broader industry norms. “These findings lay the groundwork for future studies on how women of color are portrayed, how different audiences respond to those portrayals, and how casting processes can become genuinely inclusive.",

We noted that the rapid advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created a complex mix of fear, excitement, and concerns within academia. Despite initial worries surrounding the release of the first version of ChatGPT in November 2022, millions of people around the world have welcomed various artificial intelligence applications and tools. Since its launch, ChatGPT has experienced significant growth in its user base. OpenAI has set a target of reaching one billion users by the end of 2025 (Duarte, 2025).\n\nThe concern about AI in academic life was mainly about plagiarism and academic integrity, assessment challenges, and evaluating learning.  AI also might not develop critical skills like writing, reasoning, or coding skills that are supposed to be part of their academic formation. Despite the concerns, many educators are also excited about AI’s potential to personalize learning, support students with disabilities, help with language barriers, and offer instant feedback.\n\nThere are several AI tools available now: ChatGPT, Canva, Gemini, Copilot, Grok, Claude, etc., but ChatGPT stands out as the leading and most popular tool in language programming. Additionally, Microsoft offers free training for anyone looking to enhance and deepen their AI skills in various languages, including Arabic.\n\nAlthough Chinese DeepSeek was founded in 2023, it released its language model, DeepSeek-R1, in January 2025. DeepSeek has surpassed ChatGPT in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free app. This development highlights the growing competitiveness of global AI advancements and poses a significant challenge to ChatGPT’s established presence. (Mingyue, 2025).\n\nOne of the latest developments in AI is the “Stargate Plan.” This initiative involves a $500 billion investment by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX to build advanced AI data centers. The goal of the project is to create a strong foundation for the development and deployment of advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs), by the year 2029. (Wheatley, 2025).\n\nFurthermore, most academic institutions aim to foster the growth of skilled faculty to drive innovation, look for practical insights into how institutions can strengthen academic integrity to build an ethical future, and prepare for future challenges, ultimately engaging in world-class research.\n\nWith the rapid advancements in AI, significant investments, and intense competition, it is crucial to recognize that predicting the future of AI development is highly challenging. These advancements are transforming many facets of human life. According to Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the “Godfather of AI,” and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024, AI has the potential to “exceed human intelligence,” and he warns that “the world is not prepared for what’s coming.” Hinton, who was the vice president of Google, resigned in 2023. He also stated, “There’s a 50-50 chance A.I. will get smarter than us. When it gets smarter than us, I don’t know what the probability is that it will take over, but it seems to me quite likely.” (Tremayne-Pengelly, 2024, para.8).\n\nAI will undoubtedly continue to impact our academic lives significantly, and we remain uncertain about the extent of the gap that will emerge between the newborn digital generation (Generation Z) and those of us who are adapting to this revolutionized artificial intelligence age.\n\nWith all these challenges and the development of AI, we are releasing our new special issue on “The Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in English Language Teaching, Learning, and Academic Publications”.   This volume explores the role of artificial intelligence across various areas of the English language. Topics covered include: artificial intelligence tools in English for specific purposes, the pros and cons of ChatGPT in foreign language teaching, using ChatGPT in writing essays,  AI tools for enhancing writing proficiency,  artificial Intelligence’s Impact on English teaching quality in Moroccan high schools,  AI in enhancing reading comprehension,  using ChatGPT in enhancing Master’s thesis,  ChatGPT as a writing tool in Moroccan higher education, evaluating the efficacy of AI-powered tools,  the impact of AI on critical thinking, the Influence of ChatGPT on English grammar and others. Each topic of this volume examines how artificial intelligence affects various aspects of the English language and education.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the contributions of all authors whose work has enriched this volume, and we regret that, due to editorial considerations, not all submitted papers could be included.",

          "authors": "Theodore J Kalaitzidis",
          "abstract": "Generative AI has not broken higher education; it has revealed the fractures that were already there. This paper argues that traditional pedagogies (i.e., those anchored in formalist epistemologies) are structurally misaligned with the demands of a world saturated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, the paper introduces three critical frameworks: epistemic laundering, the epistemological vector space, and the cognitive ecology (a multimodal model of reasoning that maps how symbolic, conceptual, and contextual cognition interact in real-world learning). Together, these frameworks expose the incoherence of legacy educational models and offer a new basis for instructional design. From this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a pedagogical response that pairs epistemic awareness with technical fluency. It also outlines practical strategies to integrate GenAI responsibly into learning environments: RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and adaptive skill-gap training. Ultimately, GenAI is framed not as a threat, but as a mirror: reflecting the need to move beyond performance metrics toward adaptive, agentive, and epistemically aligned education.",

          "authors": "Turgut Keskintürk",
          "abstract": "How, and for whom, do political events translate into enduring political change? This article proposes a two-stage model of generational imprinting, where identity-congenial cues determine whether individuals update their political attitudes in the immediate aftermath of a political shock, while life-course position determines whether that change is persistent or not. Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using three surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2022. I show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement in response to the killing of George Floyd. However, these effects persisted among younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization. This article thus integrates two classic—though largely partial—theories of political learning, providing a framework for understanding how episodic shocks can realign political divides across generations.",

          "authors": "Martin Moland",
          "abstract": "The question of what creates and sustains national political identities has been investigated from many angles. However, the question of how international constraints on national autonomy shape national identities is so far under-investigated. This paper uses the European sovereign debt crisis as a case for investigating whether externally imposed constraints on fiscal political autonomy, typically contested decisions, solidify or weaken national solidarity. Using data from 1983-2021, I find that the imposition of austerity led to a strengthening of national identities immediately after the austerity packages were agreed. This effect was strongest in Southern Europe, where austerity had the largest social impact and constituted the greatest break with pre-existing national policy preferences. I find evidence that the strengthening of exclusively national self-identification after the imposition of austerity was most likely driven by an increased perception of economic threat in the austerity countries, rather than shifting evaluations of EU membership.",

          "abstract": "As Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly sophisticated in emulating human communication and expressing social values, they also gain greater relevance for questions of culture and identity. This makes it important to take seriously the role of culture in AI in its own right. This article conceptualizes and illustrates major ways in which this value dimension becomes salient and provides an overview of conflicts over embedding culture and political ideology into generative AI systems. Besides an unintentional incorporation of values into AI, governments and businesses intentionally shape the values of AI systems – leading to tensions within and between societies and both on the level of AI system design and governance. Governments and businesses furthermore engage in value signaling as the open recognition of the fact that certain social values and political ideas are embedded in AI systems. These developments add an important facet to the politics of AI.",

          "abstract": "This research investigates the impact of integrating extended reality (XR) technology into a blended learning model on the development of clinical thinking skills among medical students. Recognizing the limitations of traditional medical education in fostering these skills, the study explores the potential of XR-enhanced blended learning to create immersive and interactive learning environments. A clinical thinking blended learning mode incorporating XR technology was designed and implemented. The effectiveness of this mode was evaluated by comparing the clinical thinking skills of students exposed to it with those receiving traditional instruction. Student engagement, satisfaction, and perceived learning outcomes within the XR-integrated environment were also assessed. Findings indicate that the XR-integrated blended learning mode significantly improves clinical thinking skills, including diagnostic reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Students demonstrated higher levels of engagement and satisfaction, attributing their enhanced learning to specific XR features such as interactive simulations and personalized feedback. The study identifies key factors contributing to the success of XR-integrated blended learning and proposes a framework for designing and evaluating such interventions in medical education. The implications of this research suggest that XR-integrated blended learning offers a promising approach to enhance medical education, addressing limitations of traditional methods and promoting the development of essential clinical competencies.",

In education, it has inspired researchers and educators to explore potential benefits for enhancing learning outcomes. Notably, Generative AI has demonstrated considerable promise as a means of language enhancement. This study investigates if ChatGPT can elevate the grammar skills of Saudi English as a second Language (here onwards ESL) students. This research would be significant as in the Saudi context, learning English grammar through uninteresting methods have failed to promote learning. Therefore, AI’s integration can provide with effective outcomes for learners and teachers. This research involved 100 BS students as a sample from public sector universities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Before intervention, all the participants took an initial assessment and on the basis of their performance in the test, the participants were divided into two groups of 50 students each. One group received instruction through traditional classroom methods, while the other utilized ChatGPT alongside their teacher. The intervention lasted two weeks and then a final-test was conducted and the scores were compared. The findings revealed a significant improvement in the scores of students who engaged with ChatGPT. Furthermore, the students provided predominantly positive feedback regarding their learning experience with ChatGPT. The results indicated the effectiveness of ChatGPT as an influential AI learning tool for enhancing grammatical efficiency in ESL contexts.",

          "abstract": "The study aims is to determine how AI tools affect the linguistic features of student writing. The research questions are: (1) How do AI writing tools affect the linguistic features of student writing? (2) What are university instructors’ attitudes toward the use of AI in writing instruction? The significance of this study arises from its addition to the literature on how AI technologies affect writing pedagogy and student learning in higher education. Using a mixed-methods design, the study questioned 60 university students enrolled in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. Students were divided into two groups: students who used AI writing tools regularly and students who wrote without AI. Data were collected through essay writing tasks, student questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and instructor feedback. Every subject wrote two essays, which were assessed for grammaticality, lexical diversity (measured in terms of the type-token ratio and vocabulary density), and coherence (based on rubric-based discourse analysis). Instructor feedback provided qualitative scores of writing depth and originality. Outcomes indicate that writing with AI significantly reduces grammatical errors, enhances vocabulary range, and promotes text cohesion by using programmed hints at linkages. However, there are serious concerns about the passive acceptance of AI suggestions by students that can compromise cognitive effort and critical thinking. There were instances when AI-produced work led to robotic sentence structure and formulaic arrangement. Teachers stressed the need for a pedagogical balance with AI tools without compromising students’ ability to write independently. The report concludes that, while AI can be a good writing tool, it should never be a substitute for but only a supplement to traditional writing pedagogy.",

It explores the extent to which ChatGPT develops or decreases their communication skills. It aims to investigate the attitudes of economics students towards incorporating ChatGPT into the English communication course, their learning outcomes and challenges, and their degree of autonomous learning. For this purpose, the quantitative method investigates the impact of ChatGPT on English communication skills and level of autonomy, and the qualitative method considers the challenges. The results show that most students improved their English pronunciation, widened their vocabulary by using ChatGPT prompts in communication activities, and learned the grammatical structures to use in formal and informal settings. The affective component is further enhanced as students are motivated to improve their English with the help of this tool. However, students faced technical problems when implementing this tool for English communication. Other issues were unspecific feedback on pronunciation and inappropriate formulation of prompts, which confused students with excessively generated suggestions. The study highlights the positive impact of ChatGPT on the autonomous learning of the addressed students. It suggests the importance of training programs on prompt formulation to guarantee a compelling AI-assisted educational journey.",

Language learners now have instant access to artificial intelligence writing tools like Quill Bot, Jeni AI, and others. This necessitates that institutions re-assess their methods of teaching argumentative essay writing. This research aims to assess how effective it is to mentor students to write argumentative essays using AI-powered writing tools compared to the traditional approach. The researcher gathered data over a semester and compared the performance of the groups. This quasi-experimental study consisted of two experimental groups: experimental Group One (E1), which primarily utilized AI-powered writing tools, and Experimental Group 2 ( E2) which blended the usage of AI tools with a traditional method. In contrast, the control group just employed traditional methods to teach students the skill of crafting persuasive essays. This study discovered that the integration of conventional methods with AI-driven tools significantly improved writing competency and the long-term retention of argumentative writing abilities. This study indicates that second language learners attain optimal learning outcomes by combining traditional teaching techniques with AI-driven technologies.

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool, integrated across various sectors. In education, AI has generated significant excitement among students for its potential to enhance learning experiences. However, concerns about overreliance on AI temper this enthusiasm, as it may undermine the development of critical thinking skills. Numerous studies have highlighted the risks associated with students’ excessive use of generative AI (GAI) in academic tasks, noting its potential to diminish cognitive abilities. However, the optimal use of AI to enhance students’ critical thinking skills remains under-researched. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the question: How does generative AI influence students’ critical thinking, self-efficacy, and decision-making? This study aims to explore the synergic relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence in augmenting essential thinking skills among students and building upon their existing cognitive resources through self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. Specifically, it explores the cause-and-effect connections among GAI, self-efficacy, decision-making, learning motivation, and critical thinking skills. A quantitative methodology used an online questionnaire to collect responses from 165 undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students. Statistical analyses, including bootstrapping techniques, were conducted to examine direct and indirect effects. The results revealed that GAI has a significant positive influence on self-efficacy, learning motivation, decision-making, and critical thinking skills. In turn, self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making significantly impact critical thinking skills. The mediating results indicated that GAI can indirectly boost students’ critical thinking by enhancing self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. This suggests that AI capabilities can transform the cognitive learning process.",

This paper aims to explore how ChatGPT can be applied to foster autonomous learning among Chinese Master of Translation and Interpreting (MTI) students, enhance their translator competence. With the increasing demand for highly competent translators in the digital age, it is crucial to investigate whether AI-driven tools can effectively support MTI students’ competence development. This study investigates Chinese MTI students’ perceptions of the benefits and challenges of using ChatGPT in autonomous learning, and examines the impact of its integration into MTI curricula on students’ autonomous learning and the development of their translator competence. MTI students face unique challenges, including the need for specialized language skills, critical thinking, and self-directed learning to meet academic and professional demands. This study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining survey data from 175 MTI students across Chinese universities and semi-structured interviews with 20 participants. Results indicate that the application of ChatGPT in Chinese MTI education is still at the initial stage. It is found that ChatGPT facilitates MTI students’ autonomous learning by enhancing their translation accuracy, offering instant feedback, and providing extensive practice opportunities. However, limitations such as translation errors in cultural contexts and the potential risk of over-reliance on AI tools are highlighted. The findings suggest that while ChatGPT significantly supports autonomous learning, its integration into MTI curricula requires careful planning, training, ethical guidance and further promotion.",

          "authors": "Arab World English Journal; Shaden Alarifi; Manal Mohammed AlSahli; Talal Musaed Alghizzi",
          "abstract": "This study aims to assess undergraduates’ attitudes, engagement, and satisfaction toward using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enhance reading comprehension within the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Saudi Arabia. It measures their sub-dimensions; cognate, cognitive, and effectiveness attitude and behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. A quantitative research design was employed using a five-point Likert scale-based questionnaire to address key questions on attitudes, engagement, satisfaction, and their correlations. A total of 170 English Language and Literature undergraduates from a Saudi university participated. Findings showed satisfaction ranked highest (M = 4.04), followed by attitude (M = 3.95), and engagement lowest (M = 3.90). Cognitive engagement (M = 4.14) was the strongest sub-dimension, closely linked to satisfaction, whereas emotional and behavioral engagement were weaker, indicating a need for more interactive AI tools. Students expressed willingness to recommend AI tools, though the impact of attitudes on academic success suggested room for enhancement. This study contributes to EFL research by holistically analyzing all the three dimensions and their sub-dimensions toward using AI-assisted reading comprehension. Unlike previous studies that examined these dimensions separately, it explores their interconnections. The main aim is to present the findings as recommendations for educators, AI developers, and EFL program administrators to better integrate AI tools in language education, as well as to contribute to a successful Al-assisted reading comprehension development, pedagogical insights, and practical implications for EFL teaching practices.",

          "abstract": "In this paper we describe and reflect the a ludic art piece that was exhibited at the international art biennale in Havanna. The piece is today of high relevance, as it gives ground to a series of new work developed in the experimental game cultures context in Vienna and abroad, connecting ideas about a new form of art and independent collective game design, applying Ludic Method and The Psycholudic Approach in an idea of games for/with non-humans: The Electroenzephalogram (EEG), a technology for measuring brain activity uses electrodes, that are used in this art piece symbolically. This symbolical transfer of technologies of cognitive and neurosciences are demonstrating exemplarily a new form of artistic research and art in play. The piece as sculptural artefact, as toy, as “objeto de juego” investigates new ways of addressing environmentalism, democracy and the relationship between society and collective cooperative acting. Our artpiece features two radical approaches: 1. A fundamental change of between the roles of “citizen” and “scientist” and “artist” and “researcher”. 2. Players’ roles are mirrored in a visualization of the captured image, of mindclouds made of braindata of the artist, that is allowed to be changed through the play of the visitors. This means that each art biennale visitor can become an activist player potentially manipulating thoughts or “mindclouds” during the game. Our aim is to create a reflexive game that allows the players to embody a change of position in relation to medical devices, as EEG and to reflect the efficacy of cooperative play.",

          "authors": "Arab World English Journal; Dheifallah Hussein Falah Altamimi",
          "abstract": "This study mainly investigates Saudi EFL students’ perceptions of artificial intelligence tools in improving their English writing skills. It sheds light on the challenges and opportunities they face when using Artificial Intelligence-powered writing tools by conducting the main research question: What are the Saudi EFL male students’ views on how AI tools affect their writing skills? Despite the growing integration of artificial intelligence in education, limited research has focused on its application in the context of Saudi EFL. The study seeks to fill this gap by examining how artificial intelligence tools influence students’ English writing proficiency and identifying potential cultural and contextual challenges. The researcher implemented qualitative methodology, utilizing purposive sampling to select 20 male students from the Languages and Translation Department at the University College of Haql, University of Tabuk. The participants, who were in their fourth level of study and enrolled in the Writing 1 course, participated in this group interview. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the interview data. The findings showed that AI tools were generally beneficial for improving grammar, vocabulary, and writing confidence, but students noted limitations in the feedback’s contextual accuracy and cultural appropriateness. The challenges highlighted included incorrect suggestions, a lack of personalized feedback, and issues with formal tone and cultural nuances in writing. In conclusion, while AI tools offer valuable support for EFL students, it is essential to integrate AI with traditional methods through Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory to foster a balanced writing approach, contributing to pedagogy by enhancing AI-driven and instructor-guided learning while informing AI tool development to support Saudi EFL male students better",

          "abstract": "Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has proved useful in numerous aspects of life, including education, where it promises to offer great opportunities to students, particularly in the field of language learning. However, several concerns have arisen regarding its effect on students’ creativity, privacy, and academic integrity. Employing a quantitative descriptive research design, the present study investigates the attitudes and perceptions of college students towards the use of ChatGPT in writing essays for language courses with particular emphasis on their perceived usefulness, ease of use, and ethical appropriateness. It also attempts to uncover the concerns they may have about using ChatGPT. Knowing these attitudes is crucial for a more informed decision-making process, as they would provide valuable insights to stakeholders on the academic and ethical aspects involved in integrating ChatGPT into language learning. Drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model framework (Davis, 1986, 1989), data was collected using a questionnaire that was taken by 521 university-level students from different backgrounds. The findings reveal overall positive attitudes towards usefulness, ease of use and ethical appropriateness, with the majority of participants favoring institutional acceptance of the application. On the other hand, participants voiced concerns about the future effect of using ChatGPT on higher-order thinking skills. The study recommends that educators and stakeholders propose new regulatory practices, educational techniques, and assessment methods that help mitigate the limitations of these newly introduced AI tools and incorporate them effectively to enhance the learning process.",

It distinguishes between two settings in the education system that differ regarding how directly citizens are affected by AI use, a teacher using AI to help assess students and a public servant allocating funds among schools. The analysis is based on a pre-registered vignette experiment and a sample of 4,569 participants from Norway. It finds that AI use decreases both the perceived warmth and competence of public servants, that these evaluations negatively bear on the overall acceptability of decision-making, and that the effect of AI use is stronger for public servants more directly interacting with citizens. The findings have important implications for the legitimacy of public organizations.",
