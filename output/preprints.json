          "title": "How Does Television Seriality Reshape Spectator Hypothesis Formation? The Primacy of the Mesoscopic Level in Serial Engagement",
          "authors": "Roberto Balestri",
          "abstract": "Television seriality demands sustained cognitive engagement, as viewers form hypotheses to navigate complex narratives. This article argues that beyond moment-to-moment (micro) and ultimate-outcome (macro) predictions, medium-term “mesoscopic hypotheses” dominate spectator activity. These concern the unfolding, intersection, and temporary resolution of plotlines and character arcs. We propose a three-level (micro–meso–macro) model of engagement, showing through series like Grey’s Anatomy, Breaking Bad, and Game of Thrones how viewers focus on the “middle game.” Genres shape distinct hypothesis patterns, while fan speculation amplifies mesoscopic focus. This framework clarifies how serial narratives sustain pleasure and interest without definitive closure.",

          "title": "Creative Labour and Artificial Intelligence: A Typology of Asymmetrical Relations",
          "authors": "Claudio Celis Bueno; Bertran Salvator I Mata",
          "abstract": "We believe that the benefits and harms of AI in the content and conditions of creative labour are not evenly distributed across the cultural industries and between cultural workers. In light of this, this article proposes a conceptual typology that allows for a more granular and nuanced analysis of the asymmetrical impact of AI in creative labour. To do so, this article develops a threefold conceptualization of contractual relations, forms of automation, and workflows. Regarding contractual relations, we differentiate between formal, informal, and platform-mediated creative labour. In forms of automation, we identify four dominant uses: automation as replacement, automation as augmentation, human-extended automation, and control. Finally, we define three types of workflows: artisanal, industrial, and informational. This typology is guided by the concept of distributed agency. As such, we attempt to overcome the dichotomic opposition between agency and control that characterises much of the research that examines the relationship between digital technologies and creative labour. Instead, we acknowledge that agency is distributed between practices, artifacts and social structures, and that this distribution is not evenly negotiated. Furthermore, the proposed conceptual typology can be operationalized for empirical research and we hope it will prove useful to better capture the conditions under which AI is shaping creative labour under late capitalism.",

          "title": "Generative AI and creative practices: four critical keywords between the artworld and the creative industries",
          "authors": "Pei-Sze Chow; Claudio Celis Bueno; Gabriel Pereira",
          "abstract": "This essay reflects on divergences and overlaps across two approaches — the industrial and the artistic — in current debates about generative AI and creative practices. We articulate some key differences between the two through the semantic variances in four keywords: technology, creativity, skill, and authorship. These keywords continue to be essential vocabulary in present interdisciplinary investigations into the impact of generative AI on creativity and creative work. In the artistic field, characterised by the notion of “the artworld”, creative practices hold relative autonomy from economic considerations. From the industrial perspective, the “creative industries” occupy a position between the artworld and the economic world — that is, creative practices are simultaneously subject to artistic considerations and the market logic of  cultural production. We argue that by foregrounding the specificities in how the two approaches differ and by tracing shifts in the meanings of particular words used in the communication and critique of the uses and effects of generative AI on the production of creative media, we move towards a more nuanced perspective that is sensitive to disciplinary, institutional, and conceptual disparities.",

          "authors": "Anna Butters; Melanie Benson Marshall; Stephen Pinfield; Tom Stafford; Alexander Bondarenko; Barbara Neubauer; Robert Nuske; Pierre Schwidlinski; Hanna Denecke",
          "abstract": "Background\nPeer review-based funding evaluation systems are under increasing pressure. To help alleviate this, innovative approaches like Distributed Peer Review (DPR) – where applicants review proposals for the same funding call – are being explored. The Volkswagen Foundation trialled DPR alongside conventional panel review for an interdisciplinary call. Evaluation of this trial provides insights into the dynamics of (distributed) peer review. \n\nMethods\nAll proposals (N=140) underwent both DPR and panel review. In DPR, applicants (N= 323) reviewed four or five proposals, providing an overall score, scores for each funding criteria, and a comment. Proposals were ranked using a trimmed mean score. Expectation and feedback surveys were administered. Panel review involved shortlisting by VWS staff, panellist review (N=8), and a final panel discussion. Semi-structured interviews with applicants, panellists, and VWS staff (N=20) explored perceptions and experiences of DPR, using thematic analysis. Quantitative analysis of review data and surveys utilised bootstrapping to assess decision stability and mixed effects models for consistency between reviewers. Qualitative and quantitative results were integrated in a convergent parallel design.  \n\nResults\nDPR recommended ten proposals for funding, while the panel recommended eleven; three overlapped. Funding criteria strongly predicted overall score; ‘Originality’ was given most weight by both sets of reviewers. Stability of DPR funding decisions was modest; across 500 bootstrapped samples a mean of 5.49 out of ten previously funded proposals would still be funded. This may be explained by high inter-reviewer variability: more variance was attributable to between-reviewer differences (20.04%) than between-proposal differences (8.87%). Advantages of DPR included increased efficiency, faster decision times, detailed feedback to applicants, and democratisation of funding evaluation. Noted disadvantages were burden on applicants, absence of discussion, and perceived lack of reviewer expertise. Funders implementing DPR must consider the high initial effort, potential for ‘gaming’, and reduced direct influence.  \n\nConclusions\nThis trial demonstrates feasibility of DPR for an interdisciplinary funding programme. Implementing a DPR process requires funders to accept trade-offs, but can offer valuable benefits, including shortening time to funding decision. Building on established peer review principles, it has the potential to contribute to the democratisation of funding evaluation.",

          "title": "Preregistration Works: Increased Reporting Quality, Internal Validity, and Protocol Adherence in Animal Studies",
          "authors": "Julia Marie, Léa Menon; Celine Heinl; Timothy M. Errington",
          "abstract": "Background: Transparency is essential for reliable research but is often compromised, contributing to irreproducibility. Preregistration can improve transparency, limit selective reporting, and prevent post hoc hypothesis changes. Despite the clear benefits of preregistration in multiple fields, its effect on reporting  and quality  in experimental animal studies has not been studied.\n\nMethods: We collected preregistered protocols from Preclinicaltrials.eu and Animalstudyregistry.org, along with their corresponding manuscripts and matched it with control papers to evaluate reporting quality (ARRIVE essential 10), internal validity (SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool) and deviations between protocols and manuscripts. \n\nResults: Preregistered papers (n=22) scored higher on reporting quality than controls (mean=0.794 vs 0.637 author-matched (n=13) and 0.593 journal-matched (n=20); p&lt;0.001). They also displayed lower risk of bias, particularly for selection, performance, and detection biases. Consistency between preregistered protocols and manuscripts represented 47.6% of the answers, with highest consistency for primary outcomes, study type, and hypotheses. Frequent inconsistencies, 28.2% of the answers, also occurred, especially regarding secondary outcome reporting, bias-reduction measures, and animal numbers. \n\nConclusions: Preregistration stimulates high quality reporting, internal validity and consistent reporting in animal research. However, reporting across the board could be improved and undisclosed deviations to protocols remain common. Enhancing protocol templates with more detailed structure may improve reporting practices. Next steps would be to validate these findings, optimise preregistration formats, and guide journal policies supporting transparent reporting.",

          "abstract": "This multi-interest holder consensus effort highlights the essential influence and responsibility of Research-Performing Organizations (RPOs) in shaping the quality, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research. Despite the use of metrics to assess transparency and openness by academic journals and funders, most RPOs do not yet have  metrics/indicators or monitoring that address deep-rooted shortcomings in research practice and assessment. These shortcomings manifest as restricted access to research outputs, poor availability of underlying data and materials, infrequent reproducibility checks and direct replications, and ongoing incidents of research misconduct all contributing to erosion of public trust in research. Such issues are exacerbated by institutional incentive structures that reward the number of publications and journal prestige, while neglecting research credibility, societal relevance, and transparent communication. To respond comprehensively to these challenges, our working group reached consensus on six core practices for RPOs to monitor: data, code, and material sharing; open access publishing; prospective study registration; reporting transparency; disclosures of interest and funding; and verification efforts.\nCollectively, these six practices offer a pragmatic and flexible framework that RPOs can tailor to their local context. The paper provides an implementation guide for these practices and calls for renewed leadership by RPOs in realigning research(er) assessment and incentives to reward quality, transparency, and trustworthiness in research, closing persistent gaps, and reinforcing science’s credibility and utility for society.",

          "title": "Results from Randomized Controlled Trials are Highly Sensitive to Data Preprocessing Decisions: A Multiverse Analysis of 97 Outcomes",
          "authors": "Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri; Joshua Gilbert",
          "abstract": "The sensitivity of statistical results to data preprocessing decisions is well known, but the influence of preprocessing on empirical data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less well quantified. We examine preprocessing sensitivity across 97 outcomes drawn from behavioral RCTs in the Item Response Warehouse. For each outcome, we apply a 4 × 3 × 3 grid of defensible preprocessing decisions (outlier handling, missing-data handling, and outcome transformation) and estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in a fixed ANCOVA-style linear model. Across outcomes, the median within-outcome standard deviation (SD) of the ATE across pipelines is 0.045 and the median range is 0.116 (SD min–max: 0.005–0.355; range min–max: 0.013–0.787). Because one transformation option is standardization (an affine rescaling), we distinguish transformation-driven variation that is mechanical (unit changes) from non-mechanical variation due to nonlinear re-expression (shifted log transformation). In coefficient-scale decompositions, the transformation factor explains most of the dispersion in reported ATE magnitudes (median η²_transform = 0.811), but scale-free robustness analyses show a different pattern: decomposing variability in the treatment t-statistic (invariant to affine rescaling) reveals that outlier handling dominates changes in statistical evidence (median η²_outlier = 0.570) while the transformation component is small (median η²_transform = 0.014). A within-pipeline standardized effect-size decomposition (computed after all preprocessing steps, including the log branch) yields a similar pattern (median η²_outlier = 0.599; median η²_transform = 0.020). A linear-only, fixed-denominator effect-size analysis confirms that once unit changes are removed, remaining variability is driven primarily by outlier handling (median η²_outlier = 0.858), with missing-data handling contributing in some outcomes (median η²_missing = 0.094). These results imply that preprocessing decisions should be treated as an explicit component of the analytic model and routinely reported and stress-tested via multiverse-style sensitivity analyses.",

          "authors": "Jan Pavlík; Nikol Kvardová; Petr Palíšek",
          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. A pilot analysis of a secondary dataset (N = 959) evaluated using Dynamic Fit Indices (DFI) indicated a suboptimal fit for the original structure (χ²(76) = 569.253, CFI = .903, RMSEA = .083, SRMR = .065) and a lack of scalar invariance. Subsequently, data for the main study were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated unsatisfactory fit of the original model (χ²(76) = 292.76, CFI = .930, RMSEA = .072, SRMR = .054, BIC = 18321). However, a modified model excluding Item 2 (related to clothing choices) satisfied the dynamic fit criteria (χ²(64) = 210.40, CFI = .948, RMSEA = .065, SRMR = .053, BIC = 16825). These results support SOBBS’ two-factor structure (i.e., body self-monitoring and body as a representation of the Self). The modified SOBBS (13 items) demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. In contrast to the pilot study, measurement invariance of the modified model in the main study was supported at the level of the scalar model (i.e., with constrained factor loadings and intercepts), allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The results provide evidence supporting the construct validity and reliability of the modified Czech version of the SOBBS. The scale may serve as a useful tool for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

          "authors": "Mikel Jimenez; Christian Andrade; José Antonio Hinojosa; Pedro R. Montoro; Antonio Prieto",
          "abstract": "One of the central debates in experimental psychology concerns the extent to which information outside conscious awareness can influence behavior. This study aims to assess whether two novel approaches to unconscious perception, a regression-based Bayesian generative model and Sensitivity vs. Awareness curves derived from General Recognition Theory (GRT), produce convergent results when examining the visual processing of briefly presented masked stimuli. While both investigate “unconscious processing,” they differ not only in how they define “unconscious” (chance-level discrimination vs. absence of subjective awareness) and “processing” (priming vs. detection), but also in their underlying mathematical frameworks. To investigate this, we examined the grouping of local elements into global shapes using two prime-mask stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA): a shorter baseline SOA of 40 ms (Experiment 1) and a longer SOA of 67 ms (Experiment 2). Both methods provided evidence for the unconscious processing of the primes’ global shape in Experiment 2. However, while GRT analyses also supported unconscious processing at the shorter 40 ms SOA, the Bayesian generative models produced strong evidence against it. We show that discrepancies between the regression-based and GRT-based approaches may arise not only from their operational definitions, but also their underlying mathematical frameworks and validity. Preliminary SvA simulations indicate limited robustness of the GRT-based model, warranting caution prior to further validation. More broadly, while both approaches offer refined tools for studying unconscious perception, persistent methodological challenges remain, underscoring the need for clearer definitions of unconscious processing, converging measures of awareness, and more thorough analyses of method validity.",

          "abstract": "People typically cry in the presence of their romantic partners, yet the social functions of this behavior within couples remain unknown.

The CRRQ was developed and validated across three studies in Polish and UK samples (N = 849). In the Preliminary Study, individuals described real-life situations in which people might cry in the presence of their partners. Based on their answers, we created an initial item pool. Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of the pool, revealing that the CRRQ comprises five factors, each representing a different type of crying: relationship discomfort, relationship comfort, other-oriented concern, emotion regulation, and manipulation. The results also supported the scale’s reliability and validity. Study 2 provided further evidence for the five-dimensional structure of the CRRQ and its good psychometric properties. Overall, the results indicate that the CRRQ is a reliable and valid measure of five distinct types of crying in romantic relationships.",

          "authors": "Nicolás Sánchez-Fuenzalida; Chris Jungerius; Stephen M Fleming; Simon van Gaal; Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort",
          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is determining whether observers have a conscious experience of a stimulus. However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods struggle to disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim and absent stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a reproduction task together with a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we quantitively decomposed reproduction responses into a perceptual continuous contrast component and a non-perceptual “hurdle” component. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in the reproduction hurdle, whereas attentional cues selectively shifted the continuous contrast component, consistent with changes in conscious experience. Critically, comparing conditions with and without intermixed detection trials revealed that the presence of a detection task contaminates reproduction reports with non-perceptual criterion effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results that rely on detection judgements, even when combined with subjective measures like reproduction, especially given the central role that detection tasks play in consciousness research.",

          "authors": "Bojan Evkoski; Srebrenka Letina; Petra Kralj Novak",
          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "authors": "Zixuan Jia; Suzanne Purdy; Patrick E. Savage",
          "abstract": "Cross-cultural research led by Ozaki et al. (2024) has revealed that songs exhibit higher pitch, lower tempo, and more stable pitches than speech. However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

          "abstract": "The extent to which biased decision-making is adaptive is one of the longest-debated questions in cognitive science. We investigate whether people adaptively select decision strategies following an optimal bias-variance trade-off: decision strategies that integrate (imperfect) estimates of many uncertain attributes may be unbiased but suffer from high variance, so simpler (biased) decision strategies can be more accurate when uncertainty is high. Using a new multi-attribute choice task, in which we manipulate uncertainty by varying the reliability of the estimates of different attributes across conditions, we provide an empirical demonstration that people indeed adaptively shift their decision strategies in response to environmental uncertainty: participants were more likely to use single-attribute decision-making under high uncertainty and to integrate all attributes under low uncertainty. These findings provide evidence that the bias-variance trade-off is a key principle shaping human strategy selection.",

          "abstract": "Human adults show a number bias in magnitude perception, weighting numerical information more heavily than continuous magnitudes like area. However, developmental research suggests this bias is not innate: young children show an area bias that reverses to a number bias only later in development. What drives this shift? Here, we use deep neural networks to test whether learning to count is sufficient to create number-biased representations. We trained ResNeXt-50 networks on a counting task (predicting the number of dots in an image) and measured representational biases using linear decoding of number versus cumulative area from network features. Untrained networks showed a robust area bias, with area more decodable than number, reflecting an architectural prior that does not privilege discrete quantity. Networks trained on ImageNet classification retained this area bias, indicating that generic visual experience is insufficient to create number-biased representations. Self-supervised models trained on naturalistic visual input showed no bias in either direction. Critically, networks trained on counting showed a dramatic reversal: number became far more decodable than area, producing a strong number bias. This bias reversed immediately after only one epoch of training. Principal component analysis revealed that counting training completely reorganized representational geometry: numerosity became the dominant axis of variation (r² = 0.95) while area was fully suppressed (r² = 0.00). These findings provide a computational proof-of-concept that learning to count can transform magnitude representations, offering a mechanistic account of how symbolic number acquisition may drive the development of number-biased cognition.",

          "authors": "Ivan Hernandez; Amal Chekili",
          "abstract": "The focal article “I-O Psychology and Labor: Benign Neglect, Antipathy and Missed Opportunities” by Lefkowitz and colleagues (2026) argues that I-O psychologists should consider working more closely with organized labor. The authors offer many reasons to support this consideration. In this article, we highlight an additional reason, which is that organized labor can play an important role in preventing the collapse of human employment to automation, in highly vulnerable industries. We explicitly model the influence of organized labor on variables of AI integration, human employment, and collective bargaining strength using a system dynamics approach. From this analysis and the assumptions we make, we agree with Lefkowitz et al.’s proposed greater collaboration with labor. We find that labor unions can prevent labor displacement in the face of AI advances, but only before a tipping point occurs (highlighting the need for I-O facilitation). In contrast to Lefkowitz et al.’s suggestions, that I-O psychologists should support reskilling, we find that reskilling merely delays the onset of labor displacement. Unless AI or other external forces create more jobs than AI displaces, eventually those reskilled jobs will eventually be fully displaced as well. Therefore, we argue that there is a time pressure for I-O psychologists to collaborate with labor unions to create contractual anti-automation clauses, and the pushing for automation hastens reaching the point of no return before alternative accommodations (e.g., Universal Basic Income, Revenue sharing) can be secured.",

          "abstract": "Many real-world decisions involve small probabilities of irrecoverable loss, where failure eliminates the possibility of making future decisions. Such decisions under extinction risk differ fundamentally from standard risky choice. We study how people allocate resources to reduce extinction risks. Participants play 100 trials with variable extinction risks of 2.5%, 5%, and 10%. If a participant draws the extinction outcome, they lose all accumulated bonus payment and are precluded from further earnings. Participants can reduce extinction risk by investing earnings: for every £0.02 invested, the extinction risk in the current trial is halved. We use dynamic programming to derive the optimal investment decision for each choice and compare it with participants' investments. Our results show that participants overinvest in reducing small risks, underinvest in reducing larger risks, and fail to adjust their investment appropriately across trials, leading them to go extinct at a higher rate compared to the optimal strategy.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is often a stressful developmental period, and adolescents are more vulnerable to lasting effects of heightened stress than children or adults. Spending time outside and in nature is a promising strategy for reducing stress. Yet, when stressed, adolescents are prone to withdraw from health-promoting behaviors, like engaging in outdoor activity. It is unknown how these phenomena are in tension during adolescence. To address this question, we used random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) to examine the reciprocal effects of changes in outdoor activity and stress among young adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study across 7 waves from May 2020–May 2021, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of heightened and continued stress. We find that stress and outdoor activity fluctuated over the year, exhibiting relative stability early on, but peaking and dipping (respectively) during December 2020. We demonstrate that youth who reported lower stress tended to engage in outdoor activity more frequently. Furthermore, we find that when an adolescent experienced increased stress in fall 2020, they subsequently engaged in outdoor activity less frequently in winter 2020-2021. These dynamics did not differ according to the perceived safety of an adolescent’s neighborhood or whether they returned to in-person schooling. These findings align with past research suggesting stress in adolescence can lead to withdrawal and avoidance, as well as declines in physical activity. We discuss the importance of reducing barriers to outdoor activity during periods of heightened stress, and the need to examine such processes at varying time scales.",

Recognizing these limitations, this study explores the use of commercially available generative large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc., to assess personality traits from open-ended qualitative narratives. Across two distinct samples and methodologies (spontaneous streams of thought and daily video diaries) we used generative LLMs to score Big-Five personality traits, achieving convergence with self-report measures comparable to or exceeding established benchmarks (e.g., self-other agreement, ecological momentary assessment, bespoke machine-learning models). LLM-generated trait scores also demonstrated predictive validity regarding daily behaviors and mental health outcomes. This LLM-based approach achieved quantitative rigor based on qualitative data and is easily accessible without specialized training. Importantly, our findings also reaffirm the ubiquity of personality expression, in that it is carried in the stream our thoughts and is woven into the fabric of our daily lives. These results encourage broader adoption of generative LLMs for psychological assessment, and—given the new generation of tools—stress the value of idiographic narratives as reliable sources of psychological insight.",

Measurement invariance is crucial for cross-cultural research, yet identifying specific sources of non-invariance in multidimensional constructs remains methodologically challenging.

We tested for non-invariance across countries and person characteristics (age, gender) using spike-and-slab priors. Critically, we simultaneously modeled measurement non-invariance and impact on the full latent structure, including factor correlations—a first for multidimensional (6-factor) models.\nResults. The six-factor structure was largely invariant across groups. Age moderated item intercepts (5/12 items), residual variances (6/12 items), and factor correlations.

Embodiment, on the other hand, argues that the body plays an important role in processes that have classically been characterized as mental. We argue that decision making is facilitated by reducing the amount of mental computation (less-is-more) through the exploitation of the constant stream of rich sensorimotor information (embodiment), a concept we call LIME. LIME argues that, via embodiment, computation is ‘constrained’ by and ‘off-loaded’ into the body. Constraining involves the body reducing the input or generated options before they enter into mental computation. Off-loading involves the body or the environment performing the computation. LIME underlies cognition generally, but is most accessibly demonstrated in sport phenomena, and we use this domain to sketch out the breadth of this concept in four case studies. LIME connects first principles of cognition to real life phenomena, providing a mechanics to ecological rationality and naturalistic behavior.",

Study 1 results show that players interpret 17 factors—spanning physical health, grief and domestic disruptions, work/school pressures, social relationships, and other leisure—as influencing their gaming and wellbeing. In Study 2, within-person models of logged Xbox playtime and wellbeing scores provided initial evidence that at least three factors—social strain, work-related stress, and lethargic illnesses—systematically relate to both gaming and wellbeing.

These results remain robust when controlling for populist attitudes and multiple political, psychological, and demographic variables. The link between authoritarianism and conspiracism appears to constitute a durable and generalizable psychological disposition. This may help explain why conspiratorial narratives and authoritarian politics so often co-occur, with important implications for democratic resilience in an era of rising institutional distrust, anti-scientific attitudes, misinformation, and post-truth politics.",

          "abstract": "Sibilant fricatives have historically been considered fundamentally static speech sounds, characterized by clear articulatory and acoustic steady states. Recent work has called this idea into question, though, reporting differences in the articulatory and/or acoustic dynamics of sibilants across different sibilant sounds, languages, social groups, and phonological contexts. These results suggest that dynamics may be learned aspects of the production of sibilants, analagously as in vowels (including many monophthongs). However, previous studies differ methodologically in important ways, which may mean that at least part of the observed variation is driven by extraneous variables. A typological study where a consistent set of controls allows for direct comparison across a large number of languages and speakers is thus needed. In this paper, we examine the acoustic dynamics of /s/, the most common sibilant cross-linguistically, across 32 languages and more than 4,600 speakers using large read speech corpora. We find qualitative differences in the patterns of cross-linguistic and inter-speaker variation: whereas languages exhibit considerable variation in dynamics---particularly in the timing of the maximum of spectral center of gravity trajectories---most of the variation between speakers is instead in the overall height of the trajectory (i.e., in statics). We interpret this as evidence that sibilant dynamics are indeed learned, and discuss potential sources of the observed cross-linguistic differences.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically, these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates---off by many hours---with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these two issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on this same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the consequences of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

To understand how humans adaptively initiate planning, we developed a task where humans can learn to delay planning at certain timepoints when all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two pre-registered studies, we show that humans adaptively delay planning, and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. Our model demonstrates how strategies to delay planning are not learned from experienced outcomes, but rather, from searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can adaptively delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

This study builds on the small but growing body of work addressing this gap by using a modified Delphi methodology to reach consensus among autistic women and academics/clinicians on the most relevant items from five measures of autistic traits: Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-50), Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ), Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI), Girls Questionnaire for Autism Spectrum Condition (GQ-ASC), and Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale-14 (RAADS-14), and to evaluate each measure’s suitability for autistic women in their current form.\n\nThirty-three autistic women and thirty-three academics/clinicians participated in the study. Each participant was asked to rate the relevance of individual items to the experiences of autistic women and to indicate whether each measure comprehensively captured experiences relevant to this group. Agreement on relevance was calculated separately for each group using the item-level content validity index (I-CVI) and the modified kappa statistic (k*), with scale-level content validity indices (S-CVI/Ave) derived for each measure.\n\nThe findings showed broad consistency in relevance evaluations between the two groups. The RAADS-14 was rated as the most relevant measure for assessing autistic traits in women, followed by the CATI, while the remaining questionnaires were associated with lower perceived relevance. However, none fully captured experiences relevant to autistic women, indicating construct underrepresentation that warrants further investigation. Items assessing masking were identified as valuable for inclusion to enhance the relevance of autism measures for women. In contrast, items related to attention to detail and imagination appeared less useful for assessing autism more broadly or for capturing subtler presentations of autistic traits, or may not be suitably phrased for autistic women. The most relevant items identified across the five measures can be considered valid across clinical, academic, and lived-experience contexts, providing a foundation for refining existing scales to better capture the experiences of individuals with subtler presentations of autistic traits.",

In recent years, studies investigated the cognitive mechanisms of VPT not only of other humans but also of artificial agents, such as robots. Thus far, researchers have primarily investigated interference tasks with regard to artificial agents (i.e., how the perspective of an agent interferes with one’s own perspective). In the present study, we investigated a task where VPT has a facilitatory effect (i.e., taking the perspective of an agent results in a performance boost) across four experiments, in which we varied the type of the avatar: a human (Exp. 1), a humanoid robot with a human-like head (Exp. 2), a humanoid robot with a camera-like head (Exp. 3), and a camera (Exp. 4). We found significant VPT effects for the human and robot avatar but failed to do so for the robot with a camera-like head and the camera. These findings suggest that participants adopted the perspective of avatars that are either human or resemble a human-like appearance. However, this is not the case for avatars which deviate from a human-appearance or which imply a social presence.",

High prevalence rates are concerning because statistical literacy is integral to academic success, employability, and informed citizenship. Clarifying the nature of statistics anxiety is central to understanding it, yet it remains unclear whether statistics anxiety is genuinely distinct from mathematics anxiety or simply another manifestation of the same construct.\n\nAims: We examined the degree of overlap (jangle fallacy) between the Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS) and the Revised Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (R-MARS).\n\nSamples: Two cohorts of UK undergraduate psychology students participated: Study 1 (n = 489) and Study 2 (n = 245).\n\nMethods: Each study combined a cross-sectional survey with a between-participants experiment. Surveys included the STARS, R-MARS, parallel forms to control for scale content, and measures of trait and state anxiety. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to complete either a statistics or mathematics multiple-choice test, with state anxiety measured before and after.\n\nResults:\nResults pointed to overlap across all analyses and samples. Scales were highly correlated, items did not separate into distinct domains, individuals rarely reported one without the other, and state anxiety increased similarly across test types.\n\nConclusions:\nFindings show that statistics anxiety, as measured by the STARS, is not distinct from mathematics anxiety, as measured by the R-MARS. Recognising statistics anxiety as part of the broader mathematics anxiety construct can streamline measurement, clarify theory, and support more effective interventions for reducing quantitative anxieties in education.",

          "abstract": "Human behavior shows consistent individual variation. We like different cuisines, watch different movies, and choose different careers. Personality psychologists ask people to describe their own or others' personalities, while cognitive psychometricians use behavioral tasks to measure individual differences in cognition. Our approach complements these methods by examining whether these differences extend to the most fundamental mental representations of everyday objects. To study this question, we use an odd-one-out task in which 779 U.S.-based participants are shown images of naturalistic objects. We observe that accounting for individual differences even in this basic task leads to better models of human choices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these differences can be reliably measured and related to age and gender in 199 English-speaking participants. These results enhance our understanding of individual differences in mental representations and pave the way for personalized models of the world in social science and AI using realistic datasets.",

          "abstract": "Reduced visual attention to social stimuli in autism is often attributed to diminished social reward sensitivity. However, most evidence comes from research using positive content (e.g. smiling faces), making it unclear whether reduced social attention generalises to negative social scenes. If group differences persist when social stimuli are negative, this would challenge purely reward-based explanations. We tested whether autistic adults show reduced preferential attention to negative social stimuli. \nAutistic (n=30) and non-autistic (n=51) adults completed a preferential looking task in which negative social and non-social images were presented side-by-side while eye movements were recorded. Social images depicted humans in negative contexts (e.g., conflict), and non-social images depicted negative scenes without people (e.g., natural disasters, pollution). Each pair was shown intact and phase-scrambled (rendering social content unidentifiable). Social preference was defined as the proportion of gaze time on the social image. Mixed-effects models tested effects of Group, Stimulus Type (intact vs scrambled), and their interaction. Time-series examined how social preference evolved over time. \nNon-autistic adults allocated greater viewing time to intact negative social images than autistic adults, but groups did not differ for scrambled images, indicating effects depended on social content rather than low-level visual features. Time-series analysis showed group differences emerged late in viewing: both groups showed early bias towards social content that declined, but only non-autistic participants showed later increases in social preference. Autistic adults allocate less attention to negative social content, extending evidence for reduced preference beyond positive scenes and challenging explanations based solely on social reward sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "Back in 1961, Donald Hebb established a classic paradigm for studying repetition learning: He asked participants to remember several memory sets for an immediate serial recall task and repeated one set multiple times throughout the experiment. Participants’ ability to recall the repeated set improved gradually with repetitions, thereby demonstrating repetition learning. Explaining this effect has concerned researchers for decades, as it provides key insights into how we form durable memory representations through repeated exposure. In this review, we revisit the dominant views on the mechanisms underlying repetition learning, thereby challenging two central assumptions: The assumption that repetition learning is gradual, and the assumption that it is implicit. We show how these views have emerged from flawed analytical approaches, summarize recent evidence strongly contradicting these claims, and present a re-analysis of previously published data to illustrate how correcting implausible analytical assumptions leads to different theoretical conclusions. We propose an updated theoretical framework of the cognitive mechanisms underlying repetition learning in which we integrate elements from previous models of the Hebb repetition effect with established models of episodic memory, thereby joining two branches of the memory literature.",

          "abstract": "The present research reports the development and psychometric evaluation of the Measure of Emotional Episodes with Music (MEEM), a modular instrument designed to capture situational emotional experiences involving music. Guided by theory and extensive content-validity procedures, we assessed, refined, and confirmed a set of constructs and items intended to elucidate how music functions within emotional episodes. MEEM comprises five distinct scales, each representing a construct that is operationalised through two to three sub-constructs and measured through 6-9 items. Across two experiments, confirmatory factor analyses provided strong support for the proposed sub-construct structures within each scale, demonstrating good model fit and clear differentiation among sub-constructs. During the development, the labelling of several sub-constructs was refined to reflect empirical evidence indicating that the best-performing items captured more specific facets of the broader constructs. Initial evidence for construct validity was indicated by systematic associations between MEEM scales and two complementary types of emotion ratings. Together, these results support the internal structure and validity of the instrument. MEEM is explicitly designed to assess emotional states—understood as dynamic, situation-bound processes grounded in functional contexts—rather than stable trait-like tendencies. This distinguishes it from existing instruments that primarily assess habitual music use but are applied as proxies for state experiences. Moreover, MEEM is the first instrument that explicitly operationalises the situational and contextual dimensions of emotional experiences with music. A key strength of MEEM lies in its modular and adaptable design. The full instrument or selected scales can be administered depending on the research or applied context, enabling targeted assessment of music-related emotional processes. MEEM thus provides a flexible, theory-driven framework for advancing empirical research on emotional episodes with music and offers a foundation for future validation and cross-contextual applications.",

          "abstract": "Voice hearing has been linked to an externalising bias, i.e. the tendency to misattribute internally generated experiences to external sources. In signal detection terms, this manifests as a more liberal response criterion (greater willingness to report detecting signals). While cultural factors shape voice-hearing experiences, whether religious affiliation influences this perceptual bias remains unclear. We tested whether dialogic and positive inner speech - patterns relevant to prayer and religious cognition - moderate differences in response criterion between Christians (*N* = 27) and non-religious individuals (*N* = 49). Bayesian mixed-effects models found no main effect of religious group, suggesting Christian affiliation alone does not increase externalising bias. However, dialogic inner speech showed a decisive interaction: among Christians, more frequent dialogic inner speech predicted more liberal responding; consistent with religious frameworks that normalise conversation with a divine presence, rich internal dialogue may be more readily attributed to an external source; no such effect was found among non-religious participants. Positive inner speech showed moderate interactions: Christians with more positive inner speech responded more conservatively, consistent with positive inner speech serving self-regulatory functions that promote monitoring of internal experiences; non-religious participants showed more conservative responding only for positive stimuli. These findings suggest externalising bias emerges from interactions between cognitive style and cultural framework rather than religious affiliation alone.",

We improve on previous research by testing both NLMs and human participants in the same experimental set-up and directly comparing their results, and doing this cross-linguistically in both English and Dutch. Our results show that the NLMs can successfully model the wh-island constraint in English but not in Dutch, opposing the arguments in favor of learning from input alone.",

Prior research has yielded mixed results regarding compensatory behavior: In some instances, guilt prompted individuals to redirect resources away from unrelated others (observed in the Netherlands) or from themselves (observed in Romania and Japan) to compensate the victim. This study aimed to address these inconsistencies through two preregistered replication experiments, examining the role of relational mobility as a potential moderating factor across different cultural contexts. Contrary to initial findings, our results from Experiment 1 in Japan (n = 254), Experiment 2 in Japan and the Netherlands (n = 263 and 300, respectively), and an exploratory statistical modeling revealed a consistent pattern where guilt led to compensation directed at the victim, sacrificing own resources, irrespective of the country or levels of perceived relational mobility.",

          "abstract": "The influence of space-number associations on action parameters has been widely reported. Yet, some recent studies claim that space-number associations are only the consequence of lateralized actions. However, little is known about the actual influence of action on number representations, and how this influence interacts with the influence of space. Hence, our goal was first to further examine the influence of action on number representations, and second to characterize the nature of this influence by manipulating both action direction and magnitude. To this end, we used a saccade task followed by a random number generation task (Experiment 1). We show that saccade amplitude shapes number representations, but that this influence depends on saccade direction as it is found for rightward saccades only. Moreover, the influence of target spatial position on the numbers generated vanishes when no action is executed (Experiment 2).  In our view, these results demonstrate the critical role of action in space-number associations. We suggest that the influence of space on number representations is only observed through lateralized actions. These findings shed new light on conflicting results in the literature about the influences of space and action, and provide important insights into the mechanisms behind space-number associations.",

However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

Leveraging a quota-matched longitudinal dataset of US respondents (N=26,423) collected across six waves (April’20 to January’23), we observe a major shift in partisans’ trust in the presidency after the 2020 US presidential election: Democrats gained and Republicans lost trust in the presidency. Time-lagged analyses show these changes “spill over” to trust in a wide range of other institutions not directly affected by the transition, reshaping the trust landscape for up to a year. Those who gained trust in the presidency (Democrats) later expressed elevated trust in public institutions, scientists, and the media, while those who lost trust (Republicans) expressed lower trust in these institutions, reflecting positive spillover. Republicans also showed negative spillover: reduced trust in the presidency was partially offset by increased trust in the police and personal networks. A proposed network model explains both positive and negative spillover patterns. Our findings suggest that political events can trigger wide-ranging trust cascades. Therefore, restoring trust in key institutions may bolster trust more broadly to other related institutions, mitigating the destabilizing effects of political perturbations.",

          "authors": "Jaeyeol Hyun",
          "abstract": "Background: Subjective time is commonly modeled as the output of an internal clock or accumulator. However, empirical phenomena such as Weber-like timing, affect-dependent distortions (e.g., depression, flow, crisis), and the dissolution of time during attentional shifts suggest that temporal experience may not arise from a dedicated pacemaker, but from intrinsic neural dynamics governing internal state updates.\nObjectives: We propose a minimal stochastic dynamical framework in which subjective time emerges from the interaction between metabolic throughput and self-referential attention. The goal is to unify classical psychophysical regularities and affect-dependent temporal distortions within a single, clock-free generative mechanism.\nMethods: We formulate a low-dimensional stochastic differential equation describing metabolic throughput \nM\n(\nt\n)\nM(t), self-referential attention \nA\nself\n(\nt\n)\nA \nself\n​\t\n (t), and an arousal-dependent sampling resolution \nR\n(\nM\n)\nR(M). These variables jointly determine a bounded internal self-update velocity \nv\n(\nt\n)\nv(t), which is nonlinearly transformed into an instantaneous subjective-time rate \nd\nτ\nself\n/\nd\nt\n=\nf\n(\nv\n)\ndτ \nself\n​\t\n /dt=f(v). Model behavior was analyzed through phase-space geometry, interval-timing simulations, robustness tests across alternative nonlinearities and saturation functions, and noise generalization. Parameters were constrained by biological plausibility; no behavioral data were fitted.\nResults: Subjective time emerges as a structural property of metabolic–attentional coupling. Interval-timing simulations exhibited Weber-like scaling (log–log slope ≈ 0.9) and approximately constant coefficients of variation when slow across-trial gain variability was present, consistent with requirements for scalar timing under continuous-time integration. Distinct affective regimes (depression-like, normal, flow-like, and crisis-like) occupied separable regions of the \n(\nM\n,\nA\nself\n)\n(M,A \nself\n​\t\n ) state space and showed characteristic distributional signatures in \nv\nv and \nd\nτ\nself\n/\nd\nt\ndτ \nself\n​\t\n /dt. Crisis-like regimes produced sustained temporal dilation, depression-like regimes produced compression, and flow-like regimes showed elevated but stable accumulation. These qualitative patterns were robust across broad families of nonlinear mappings and noise models.\nConclusions: A minimal metabolic–attentional stochastic dynamical system is sufficient to generate subjective time and its distortions without invoking an internal clock. The results suggest that subjective time reflects the rate of self-update in a metabolically constrained attentional system. This framework provides a structurally grounded basis for integrating psychophysics, computational neuroscience, and affective phenomenology, and offers testable predictions for future empirical and clinical work.",

These designs involve the comparison of a single outcome measurement (denoted as YT) from a single treated case obtained at one point in time vs.  , where     is a group-based estimate of what YT would have been had no treatment been applied (i.e., an estimate of the unobserved counterfactual parameter YCF). The subscript on YT denotes the treatment condition and the hat on    denotes an estimate of the true counterfactual value YCF. The contrast (YT -YCF) defines the treatment effect and (YT -  ) is the general notation used to denote an estimate of the treatment effect. The proposed designs may consist of four phases: (1) nc+1 participants are randomly selected from the population of interest, (2) one subject is randomly selected from the sample of nc+1 participants, (3) the properties of the selected subject are evaluated relative to the properties of the group of nc participants (when available data allow), and (4) re-randomization is carried out to identify an alternative participant to be treated if diagnostics from the third phase suggest it. There are three variants of the proposed designs; the first variant is the least satisfactory, and it omits the third and fourth design phases listed above. The three variants differ with respect to the data required, the counterfactual estimator, the method of statistical analysis, statistical power, and credibility of results.\n\n\nKey Words: statistical inference, small-N design, scientific method, randomized experiment",

This article asserts that attention need not refer to one mechanism, but rather comprises a solution class to the cognitive system's most fundamental problem: how to maximize performance objectives, given inherent biological and environmental constraints. With this perspective, separate solutions may be implemented simultaneously across multiple functional domains, such as perception, decision-making, and learning. Here, a taxonomy of attentional solutions was extracted through focused review of findings from model-based cognitive neuroscience, a field predicated on mathematical formalization and simultaneous consideration of behavioral performance (i.e. objectives) and process-level neurophysiological markers (i.e. biologically-constrained resources). The goal of this review is thus to reify attention while embracing its plurality, offering a framework whereby attentional solutions can be proposed, evaluated, and falsified in the context of system-level objectives and constraints.",

          "abstract": "Medical providers make more errors under cognitive load, often viewed as arising from suboptimal decision-making. This interpretation relies on frameworks that ignore cognitive costs. Here, we offer a fundamentally different perspective that reveals an underlying structure to medical errors: bias (systematic deviations) and noise (variability) are inevitable consequences of optimal decision-making under cognitive resource constraints. We analyze orders placed by emergency department providers and find that cognitive load increases bias and noise, consistent with the optimal allocation of resources. Because providers near-optimally adjust to cognitive demands, this argues that guidelines that increase cognitive resources are necessary to reduce errors. Consistent with this perspective, bias and noise are minimized when multiple providers contribute to patient care. These findings have implications for optimizing medical care.",

          "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) marked its centennial in 2024 and remains a major workhorse in clinical, basic, and applied research alike. This is partially attributable to EEG’s accessibility and cost-efficiency as well as the fact that EEG non-invasively measures the electric fields of the brain. Innovations in EEG over the past century have largely been either in terms of improving data acquisition or data analysis. On the one hand, the hardware for EEG recording allows for more electrodes from more efficient electronics and well as more user-friendly hardware. On the other hand, advancements in signal processing allow researchers to use EEG to provide both temporal and spatial information about brain (dys)function. However, that EEG is so widespread also makes the method susceptible to practices that may hinder scientific advancement by adding confusion rather than clarity in the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of EEG data. This chapter offers readers an accessible overview of these considerations as well as a guide to these analyses that provide reference-independent measurements of response strength and response topography and therefore circumvent statistical and interpretational caveats of canonical ERP analysis methods. The analyses overviewed here can, in most instances, be extended to the analysis of spontaneous EEG, as well as spectrally-deconvolved signals both when recorded at the scalp and intracranially in humans and animal models alike. The versatility and accessibility of EEG, in combination with advances in signal processing, allow for this ‘old dog’ of human neuroscience to still deliver new tricks and innovations.",

We provide a brief illustrative example of the outcome-wide approach by estimating the association of Wave 1 sense of mastery with a wide range of Wave 2 outcomes.

In Experiment 1 (magnitude classification; N=60), SNARC effects emerged in both Chinese (L1) and English (L2), with no reliable L1-L2 difference. In Experiment 2 (parity judgement; N=52), SNARC was not reliably observed in either language, highlighting task sensitivity. MARC effects were weak and did not differ between languages in either experiment. Individual-difference analyses revealed that earlier L2 acquisition was associated with stronger L2 SNARC, though this did not moderate L1-L2 contrasts.

          "abstract": "Introduction. Global increases in armed conflict, forced displacement, pandemics, and economic instability have contributed to rising levels of psychological distress worldwide, placing large segments of the population at increased risk of developing mental health conditions. This burden is particularly pronounced in humanitarian and low-resource settings, where access to specialist mental health services is limited. Scalable, low-intensity, evidence-based psychological interventions are therefore urgently needed. In response, the World Health Organization has developed transdiagnostic programmes, including Self-Help Plus (SH+) and Doing What Matters in Times of Stress (DWMS). Although these interventions are increasingly implemented across humanitarian and public health contexts, evidence for their effectiveness and implementation has not yet been systematically synthesised.\nMethods and analysis. This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration standards and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of SH+ or DWMS, alongside qualitative and mixed-methods studies examining their implementation among stressor-exposed individuals of any age. Outcomes will include symptoms of depression and anxiety, general distress, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Moreover, we will examine effects on well-being, psychosocial functioning, adverse events, and implementation outcomes (eg, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity). We will search Cochrane CENTRAL, APA PsycNet, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, and Scopus, supplemented by hand-searching preprint repositories and citation tracking. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and a customized appraisal tool for studies on implementation. Quantitative data will be synthesised using random-effects multilevel meta-analyses, with meta-regression models applied to examine moderators. Bayesian meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate as sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings. Certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE approach.\nEthics and dissemination. Ethical approval is not required. Findings will be disseminated through an open-access peer-reviewed publication, a plain-language summary, and the Open Science Framework, where all materials will be made publicly available.\nPROSPERO registration number.

          "abstract": "Recent interdisciplinary advances have transformed the study of the evolution of music. Rather than treating music as a cultural artifact, current research targets musicality — the biological capacity enabling humans to perceive, produce, and enjoy structured sound. Evidence from observations of infants, cross-cultural studies, and neuroscience shows that humans possess innate predispositions for rhythm, pitch, and temporal expectation that arise independently of training. Comparative studies have revealed that components of musicality have distinct evolutionary histories: primate research supports gradual development of rhythmic and audiomotor integration, while convergent traits in vocal-learning species highlight shared biological constraints. Neuropsychological and developmental findings have further shown that musicality is not reducible to language, drawing instead on perceptual, motor, and affective systems that likely predate speech. Collectively, these insights establish musicality as a fundamental cognitive capacity and provide a robust framework for investigating how its components evolved, how they function across species, and why music is central to human life.",

However, it remains unclear whether this questionnaire measures the same construct across adolescent sex and ethnicity. The present study investigated the measurement invariance (MI) and convergent validity of the SMFQ across sex and ethnicity in a sample of adolescents from a United Kingdom (UK) cohort study. Data was obtained from the sixth sweep (aged 14, n = 8814) in the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). Results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SMFQ had a unidimensional factor structure. This model demonstrated MI at configural, metric, and scalar levels across sex and ethnicity. The SMFQ scores were significantly positively related to internalising symptoms, and negatively related to self-esteem and happiness. The findings provide support for the MI of the SMFQ across sex and major ethnic groups in the UK and for its convergent validity, supporting its use as a promising screening tool for depression symptoms in mid-adolescence.",

          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) refers to the perception that one's actions are influential and that one assumes responsibility for their consequences. In coordinated joint actions, a sense of joint agency emerges, with interaction and cooperation being crucial for enhancing SoA. Prior research indicates that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is integral to monitoring social contexts of SoA, while the left angular gyrus (lAG) focuses on individual aspects of agency. This study examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on SoA and judgment of performance (JoP) in eighteen healthy young participants using a three-way crossover design that included inhibitory neurostimulation of the rTPJ, excitatory stimulation of the lAG, and a sham intervention on the Vertex. Participants completed musical tasks involving rhythmic coordination before and after neurostimulation, with self-reported scores for SoA and JoP collected via Likert scales, alongside performance metrics (action time error and number of errors) evaluated through software. While rTMS did not yield significant effects on SoA, JoP, or performance overall, notable correlations between these variables suggest that neurostimulation may influence the interrelations among them. These findings highlight the complexities of how neurostimulation impacts perceived agency and performance, warranting further exploration into their interconnected dynamics.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, right temporoparietal junction, left angular gyrus, sense of joint agency, musical rhythmic coordination, joint action",

          "abstract": "How long-term changes in parent personality are associated with long-term changes in child temperament is a fundamental yet largely unaddressed question about child development. Several developmental processes (including socialization, modeling, and evocation) suggest that parent personality might have transactional and thus co-developmental associations with child temperament. The present study used data from a longitudinal study of 674 Mexican-origin families to investigate the extent to which changes in parent Big Five personality traits co-develop with changes in child temperament from age 10 to 16. Using second-order bivariate growth curve models, we found that mother (but not father) personality co-develops with child temperament for most conceptually related pairs of personality and temperament traits; for example, when mothers increased in conscientiousness, their child tended to increase in effortful control. However, these results largely held only for parent reports of child temperament (or a composite of parent- and child self-reports), and not when using only child self-reports of temperament. Child nativity status moderated some of the co-developmental associations, where families with children born in Mexico (as opposed to being born in the U.S.) tended to exhibit stronger mother-child co-development. We discuss these findings and what they mean for the study of child development.",

Relative to a read-only condition, pretesting yielded statistically significant performance improvements on subsequent cued recall (Cohen’s d = 0.18–0.40) and, in most cases, multiple-choice tests (d = 0.25–0.67), regardless of whether test formats were separately presented or intermixed. Participants also reported preferring pretesting over reading for learning second-language vocabulary, especially for word-image learning.

Seven distinct profiles of digital media use were identified through latent profile analysis: High Social Media Users, Social Media Lurkers, Video Game Players, and Low Digital Media Users—profiles that align with previous research—and three novel profiles: Science-Oriented Users, Creative Users, and Aggression-Oriented Users. Discriminant analysis revealed that personality traits significantly predicted profile membership. A combination of high Openness and Extraversion primarily distinguished Creative Users from Aggression-Oriented Users, Video Game Players, and Low Digital Media Users. High Neuroticism combined with low Conscientiousness best differentiated Aggression-Oriented Users from Science-Oriented Users. Finally, a function primarily defined by low Agreeableness predicted membership in the Aggression-Oriented Users profile versus the Social Media Lurkers profile.

Guided by a self-regulation perspective on pro-environmental behavior, we test whether grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, strengthens the link from intention to behavior in the environmental domain. Study 1 surveyed Chinese high school students (N = 682). Regression showed a stronger intention-behavior link among those high in grit but a weaker link among those low in grit. Study 2 analyzed large-scale Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data from 15-year-olds worldwide (N = 372,170) and confirmed the same moderating effect. Study 3 tracked Chinese undergraduates (N = 1,286) across three academic years. A random-intercept cross-lagged panel (RI-CLPM) model indicated that grit’s moderating effect resides mainly at the stable between-person level rather than within-person change, which suggests that dispositional grit promotes durable intention to behavior consistency for pro-environmental action. Across studies, these findings refine self-regulation accounts of pro-environmental action by identifying grit as a distinct trait-based moderator and by clarifying the level at which moderation operates. Practically, narrowing the intention–behavior gap may require targeted structural supports for individuals lower in grit, alongside longer-term capacity building approaches that foster sustained commitment to ecological goals.",

          "abstract": "Discourse analysis has long played a central role in the assessment and treatment of neurogenic communication disorders, particularly in aphasia. Canonical tasks like the Cookie Theft picture description and Cinderella narrative retell have shaped decades of research by offering replicable, analyzable, and linguistically rich language samples. However, as the field expands to encompass broader populations, more nuanced clinical goals, and new analytic technologies, the limitations of default task use have become increasingly apparent. This Viewpoint argues that the future of discourse assessment depends on moving from tradition-based task selection to intentional, theory-driven, and empirically validated approaches. I examine what foundational tasks revealed about language breakdown, why they succeeded within their original scope, and where they now fall short. I propose a shift toward adaptive discourse ecosystems—frameworks that align task, population, and metric with clinical or research purpose—while integrating psychometric rigor, participatory design, and thoughtful use of technological tools such as natural language processing and perceptual ratings. Only by building on the strengths of the past with clarity, creativity, and scientific discipline can we ensure that discourse assessment continues to reflect the complexity, diversity, and functional relevance of communication in the real world.",

Text messages have proven effective for promoting physical activity, but little is known about how message content can engage motivational mechanisms.\nPurpose: This study aimed to examine how generative artificial intelligence prompts could be engineered to create messages that engage physical activity urges.\nMethods: Study 1 involved iterative prompt development and expert evaluations of messages, varying by physical activity context (preparation vs. execution), benefit (short-term vs. long-term), experience (past vs. future), and behavioral target (move more vs. sit less). Study 2 involved a web-based factorial experiment to assess how these factors affected urges among middle-aged and older adults.\nResults: In Study 1, ratings of confidence that text messages (nMessages=16) would evoke urges were moderate yet heterogenous across the experts (nExperts=15). Themes including physical activity cues and affective appeal emerged as key factors. In Study 2, 640 adults (aged 40–85 years, M = 57; 52% female) rated 80 messages. Men reported stronger urges than women, and participants with higher baseline urges reported higher urges after reading the messages. Age moderated two effects: older adults responded more favorably to execution vs. preparation prompts, and the advantage of past over future experiences diminished with age. Two significant three-way interactions showed that execution-based prompts outperformed preparation prompts, except when prompts targeted (1) long-term future benefits and (2) future physical activity experiences.\nConclusions: This study identified how specific prompt features can evoke physical activity urges in middle-aged and older adults, supporting development of personalized interventions.",

          "abstract": "Patient–clinician interactions are central to diagnosis and treatment in mental health care. They involve inferential processes grounded in patients’ reports of symptoms and clinicians’ interpretations of signs. These processes are liable to microdynamic looping effects that drive diagnostic belief formation. In facing the hermeneutic challenge of reaching a shared ascription of the patient’s condition, such looping effects can lead to misalignment and give rise to epistemic injustice if a credibility deficit exists between the patient and the clinician. In this paper, we use the active inference framework to develop a computational model of looping microdynamics that captures how patients and clinicians reciprocally interpret symptoms, attribute causes, and negotiate diagnostic categories over time. We present a simulation study showing how specific interactional patterns can amplify or mitigate credibility deficits, depending in part on clinicians’ attributional attitudes toward patients’ self-interpretations. Our results suggest that, in contexts of diagnostic disagreement, positive disconfirmation—offering an alternative explanatory framing rather than simply negating the patient’s perspective—may reduce the risk of epistemic injustice. Overall, the model highlights how looping microdynamics structure mutual belief formation in clinical encounters and how attention to these dynamics can support more epistemically responsible clinical communication.",

          "authors": "Lauren S Aulet",
          "abstract": "Human adults show a number bias in magnitude perception, weighting numerical information more heavily than continuous magnitudes like area. However, developmental research suggests this bias is not innate: young children show an area bias that reverses to a number bias only later in development. What drives this shift? Here, we use deep neural networks to test whether learning to count is sufficient to create number-biased representations. We trained ResNeXt-50 networks on a counting task (predicting the number of dots in an image) and measured representational biases using linear decoding of number versus cumulative area from network features. Untrained networks showed a robust area bias, with area more decodable than number, reflecting an architectural prior that does not privilege discrete quantity. Networks trained on ImageNet classification retained this area bias, indicating that generic visual experience is insufficient to create number-biased representations. Self-supervised models trained on naturalistic visual input showed no bias in either direction. Critically, networks trained on counting showed a dramatic reversal: number became far more decodable than area, producing a strong number bias. This bias reversed immediately after only one epoch of training. Principal component analysis revealed that counting training completely reorganized representational geometry: numerosity became the dominant axis of variation (r² = 0.95) while area was fully suppressed (r² = 0.00). These findings provide a computational proof-of-concept that learning to count can transform magnitude representations, offering a mechanistic account of how symbolic number acquisition may drive the development of number-biased cognition.",

Drawing on the theory of affordances—hierarchical, multi‑scalar, and dynamically adaptable actionable possibilities relative to actor capabilities—we argue that inequities arise not only from unequal access to resources or decision‑making processes but from mismatches between people’s capabilities and the environments in which energy practices unfold. We show how affordance inequalities shape energy insecurity, clean technology adoption, labor transitions, and procedural participation, and how these inequalities propagate across nested socio‑technical scales. We then outline how just transitions can be advanced through affordance restructuring—reshaping homes, infrastructures, institutions, and regional economies to support meaningful low‑carbon action for all communities. Ecological Energy Justice provides researchers with new tools for mapping the relational dynamics of energy systems and offers policymakers a mechanism‑based approach for aligning decarbonization with social equity, climate resilience, and democratic participation.",

          "authors": "Dean D'Souza; Sarah Josephine Rajendra; Leher Singh",
          "abstract": "Perceptual narrowing of speech in infancy is often characterized as a maturational process driven by domain-specific experience with language. However, relatively little is known about the role of domain-general attentional mechanisms in this process. In the present study, we examined whether variability in infants’ everyday social environments is associated with attentional disengagement and whether disengagement, in turn, relates to perceptual narrowing. Seventy-nine bilingual infants aged 9–11 months completed a visual attentional disengagement task and an auditory discrimination task assessing sensitivity to a non-native Hindi dental–retroflex phonemic contrast. Infants’ social diversity was quantified as the proportion of lifetime exposure to caregivers of other racial backgrounds. Results revealed that infants who disengaged attention more efficiently showed greater discrimination of the non-native phonemic contrast. Greater exposure to racially diverse social partners predicted more efficient attentional disengagement but was not directly associated with phoneme discrimination. Mediation analyses indicated that social diversity was indirectly related to non-native discrimination via attentional disengagement. Together, these findings support a developmental cascade in which variability in infants’ social environments is associated with adaptations in domain-general attention that, in turn, relate to perceptual sensitivity. The results highlight attentional disengagement as a potential mechanism linking environmental diversity and perceptual specialization and underscore the importance of considering infants’ everyday social ecologies in theories of early learning.",

As it differs from other specific phobias in clinical presentation, etiological and maintaining mechanisms, and treatment, we propose that emetophobia might be considered as an own diagnostic entity in future versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases.",

Across 728 empirical articles comprising over 200 million participants, we examined geographic distribution of studies, demographic reporting about participants, modes of data collection, sample-size justification, and inferential restraint. Metascientific practices improved markedly over time, particularly with regards to sampling decisions (sample size; sample size justification) as did expressions of inferential restraint. However, there was limited progress in geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural diversification of testing sites and participants. In each demographic measure, there was also substantial under-reporting throughout the window of analysis. Together, these findings indicate challenges in participant and geographic specification of samples and achieving globally representative samples alongside encouraging advances in sample size, justification, and inferential restraint.",

          "authors": "Andrew Gordon; Simon Jones",
          "abstract": "Longitudinal research on crowdsourced platforms faces substantial attrition, yet there remains little experimental evidence to guide design decisions. We conducted an experiment (N = 1,798) on Prolific, orthogonally manipulating payment rate (£6, £9, or £9/hour plus completion bonus) and session interval (1, 2, or 4 weeks) across five sessions. We also measured habitual tendencies using the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS) and recorded participants’ prior platform experience. Session interval strongly predicted retention: participants in the one-week condition were 1.6x as likely to complete all sessions as those in the four-week condition (80% vs. 50%). Payment rate, by contrast, had no significant effect on retention or response speed. At the individual level, prior platform experience was the strongest predictor of retention, with more experienced participants significantly more likely to complete all sessions. The two COHS subscales showed divergent effects: routine modestly predicted higher retention, whereas automaticity predicted lower retention, challenging the assumption that habit functions as a unitary construct. These findings suggest that researchers designing longitudinal studies on crowdsourced platforms may benefit more from shorter inter-session intervals than from incremental increases in compensation, and that individual differences in habitual tendencies shape attrition in ways that may affect sample composition over time.",

          "authors": "Kee Bear Rivers; Pizza Ka Yee CHOW",
          "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has traditionally been conceptualised using the Medical Model (MM), with screening tools such as the Autism Quotient (AQ) relying on binary categorisation. More recently, the Neurodiversity Model (NDM) conceptualises autism as natural neurological variation, framing autistic traits as dimensional and comparable to the Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN). However, it remains unclear how these two models shape the interpretation of ASD, and how the expression of autistic traits may differ by gender and relate to OCEAN traits. This study recruited 1,430 adults (mean age = 25) who completed an online survey including the AQ and the Goldberg-50 IPIP to assess autistic and personality traits, respectively. AQ scores were operationalised both as a binary variable (AQ &lt; 29 = non-autistic; AQ ≥ 29 = autistic), consistent with the MM, and as a continuous variable (AQ range 0–50), consistent with the NDM. Mediation (path) analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between AQ and OCEAN, and whether AQ mediated the relationships between gender and OCEAN. Results under both models indicated that AQ directly influenced OCEAN expression and served as a significant mediator between gender and OCEAN. Non-binary participants had a higher likelihood of belonging to the ASD group or reported higher ASD traits, which were associated with increased OEAN and decreased C. Together, the statistical differences between the MM and NDM were nuanced, suggesting that adopting the NDM is both viable and beneficial. These findings support a more inclusive, dimensional approach to understanding how autistic traits manifest across the population.",

          "abstract": "Research on voluntary task switching examines factors that influence individuals’ willingness to switch between tasks. Prior work shows that task switching behavior is affected by internal performance-related costs and external factors, such as perceptual disruptions. The present study tested whether such effects extend to the motor domain. Therefore, we developed a voluntary task-switching paradigm in which participants indicated task choices using a joystick and a double-registration procedure, separating task choice and execution. In two preregistered experiments conducted in 2022 and 2023 (N = 41 and N = 74), we applied brief motor perturbations during the task choice phase. Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, incongruent perturbations produced a small but reliable decrease in task switch rates in both experiments; however, no effects were observed for congruent or neutral perturbations. Additionally, we observed task switch costs in both experiments and a task repetition bias in the second experiment. Exploratory analyses of continuous joystick movements provided evidence for substantial preplanning of task choices. These findings demonstrate that motor perturbations can bias voluntary task choice, supporting embodied cognition accounts of decision-making, and highlight task choice preplanning as an important methodological consideration for future research.",

          "abstract": "In psychology and neuroscience, computational models representing competing hypotheses are often fitted to behavioural data and compared to evaluate their plausibility. In a recent article, Piray proposed a general framework for estimating the statistical power of such model comparisons, focusing on random-effects Bayesian model selection, and suggested that many previous studies may be insufficiently powered. Piray further noted that a large number of studies rely on fixed-effects Bayesian model selection, assuming that the same model applies to all participants, and argued that this practice can lead to extremely high false-positive rates. These conclusions raise concerns about the validity of findings based on computational model selection. In this commentary, however, we argue that Piray’s analyses depart from realistic model-selection scenarios. In particular, his power analysis involves assumptions that are, in different respects, overly pessimistic or overly optimistic, potentially biasing power estimates and similar issues may arise in the simulations used to evaluate fixed-effects Bayesian model selection.",

          "authors": "Laurence Cobbaert",
          "abstract": "Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely described as an evidence-based psychological treatment, including within eating disorder (ED) care. However, evidence claims are only valid within the boundaries of the populations, outcome measures, and service contexts represented in the underlying trials. This paper argues that CBT is not universally evidence-based and that extending its evidentiary status to neurodivergent people and Indigenous, First Nations, and Māori communities is not currently justified. Drawing on decolonial and neurodiversity scholarship and lived experience-led literature, the paper shows how research designs prioritising internal validity have contributed to an evidence base that functions as a methodological echo chamber, reproducing findings drawn predominantly from white, Western, largely neurotypical samples. As a result, CBT trials often lack external validity for communities whose experiences of distress are shaped by sensory processing differences, executive functioning difficulties, systemic discrimination, food insecurity, and the colonial legacy of trauma, erasure, and dispossession. In ED care, these limitations are amplified by diagnostic frameworks and outcome measures that privilege weight-centric approaches and neuronormative and Eurocentric cognitive models while overlooking sensory, somatic, cultural, and socio-political drivers of illness. Evidence from autistic and Indigenous participants documents mis-attunement and iatrogenic harm within standard CBT-based pathways for EDs. The paper concludes that universal claims about CBT are not supported by the current evidence base and are better understood as population-specific evidence claims grounded in co-designed trials, culturally valid measurement, and implementation research demonstrating safety, relevance, and benefit for diverse communities.",

          "authors": "Joshua K. Hartshorne; Jesse Snedeker",
          "abstract": "Theories of language acquisition generally fall into one of two camps. On one side, there are domain-general constructivist theories which argue that children break into language with little more than a capacity to learn, an interest in others, and some knowledge of the world. On the other side, there are domain-specific nativist theories which propose that children come equipped with rich innate knowledge of syntax, semantics, and principles constraining the mapping between them. In this paper, we sketch out an alternative: a theory that roots language acquisition in rich, abstract conceptual structures (akin to the semantic structures of linguistic theories) but posits that syntax arises from domain-general learning abilities and the belief that the communicative signals of others convey thoughts which are structured like our own. On this hypothesis, both the learning abilities that drive syntax acquisition and the conceptual structures themselves are available to prelinguistic infants and evolved prior to the emergence of external language. The critical evolutionary step was the insight that motivates children to link conceptual structures to patterned external signals. We describe how this theory builds on empirical insights from language acquisition, developmental psychology, linguistic typology, computational linguistics, and learning theories. Finally, we attempt to translate between Conceptual Nativism and other theoretical perspectives, delineating where the theories differ in their core commitments from where they differ solely in their framing, terminology and emphasis.",

Here, we examine how smile conceptualization and dynamics impact the categorization of reward, affiliative, and dominance smiles based on the Simulation of Smiles Model. In Study 1 (n = 192), Polish participants read definitions of smiles formulated in either morphological or socio-functional terms. Next, they viewed dynamic or static expressions of these smiles and rated the extent to which each expression portrayed a reward, affiliative, and dominance smile. As predicted and consistent with previous studies, affiliative smiles were categorized more accurately when presented in dynamic than in static form. However, contrary to our expectations, the categorization was more accurate when smiles were defined in morphological than socio-functional terms. Studies 2 (n = 196) and 3 (n = 265) replicated the advantage of morphological over socio-functional conceptualizations in UK-based samples but did not unambiguously support the role of dynamics in smile categorization. Together, our findings suggest that the impact of expression dynamics on smile categorization may be more complex than previously assumed and point to the role of smile conceptualization in this process.\n\nKeywords: smile, facial expression, emotion categorization, facial dynamics, positive emotion",

          "abstract": "This paper integrates psychological and philosophical theory and research to explain what it would take to measure a person’s general morality (i.e., their overall moral goodness). Conceptually, to measure general morality, there must be general moral facts about people’s overall morality; the measure must correctly identify and weigh those facts; and the measure must apply clearly and consistently across people, groups, and time. We argue that it would be difficult to operationalize morality in a way that satisfies these requirements. Self-report, informant report, behavioral, and biological measurement approaches also have substantial methodological limitations. These conceptual and methodological challenges limit the validity of measures of general morality more than they do for most other psychological traits. This exercise also yields general lessons about the challenges that also confront the design of narrower, less ambitious morality measures (e.g., of specific moral virtues). Some—but not all—of these challenges can be mitigated when the measurement aims are more modest. It is therefore important to be transparent and intellectually humble about what we can and cannot conclude based on various moral assessments. Finally, we outline recommendations and future directions for psychological and philosophical inquiry into the development and use of morality measures.",

Predictive processing theory offers a promising framework for understanding autism through internal cognitive processes, but comprehensive tools assessing these characteristics and their associated daily challenges have been lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate the Introspective Predictive Processing Inventory (IPPI), a self-report measure assessing predictive processing characteristics and their subjective consequences in everyday life. Through community-led, participatory research, we developed a 65-item pilot version and employed a five-stage validation approach across three samples (N = 790). We used network-based item optimization, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance testing, and convergent validity assessment. Network optimization reduced the scale to 18 items while maintaining excellent reliability and improved discriminative power. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a stable two-factor structure: \"Prediction Integration and Interpretation\" and \"Prediction Error Sensitivity and Stability Needs\". The IPPI demonstrated exceptional discriminative validity (AUC &gt; 0.97), strong convergent validity with established measures, measurement invariance across groups, and independence from general cognitive abilities. The IPPI provides a validated tool for assessing internal predictive processing experiences and their daily consequences, advancing autism research that bridges predictive processing theory with lived experiences.",

          "abstract": "Individual values are often treated as sacrosanct in applied psychology and education, grounded in a legitimate concern for autonomy, difference, and contextual nuance. Yet without normative criteria, such approaches risk endorsing all values equally, including those that are maladaptive, self-defeating, or socially harmful. This paper introduces the Cultivating Individual Virtues in Context (CIVIC) model, a theoretically novel and practically grounded framework for evaluating behavioural patterns without collapsing into relativism. Synthesising insights from behaviour therapy, moral philosophy, and differential psychology, the model proposes that virtues are not fixed traits but enacted regularities that integrate three irreducible contexts: biological constraints, environmental conditions, and social consequences. Patterns that harmonise all three domains are considered virtuous, not merely functional, and constitute the behavioural substance of flourishing. The CIVIC model offers a pluralistic yet normatively serious account of virtue and flourishing, enabling practitioners to support lives that are individually coherent, contextually attuned, and ethically sustainable.",

However, no prior work has examined whether these interventions specifically reduce the impact of unproven or false accusations against politicians, which is a major vector by which disinformation can influence voting behavior in democracies. Here we demonstrate, through 11 studies, that interventions designed to increase awareness of manipulative messaging, such as the use of emotionally-charged language, can reduce the impact of derogatory accusations on impressions of novel mock political candidates. Individuals who viewed video or gamified inoculations showed a reduced impact of accusations on subjective ratings for all candidates about whom accusations of misconduct were made, relative to those who did not receive the inoculation. These effects were strongest when the truth status was ambiguous, but there is also some beneficial impact even when an accusation is clearly refuted, i.e., a reduction in Continued Influence Effects. Overall, these findings indicate that inoculation interventions that train citizens to be aware of manipulative techniques can effectively reduce the impact of unproven derogatory accusations against politicians.",

We also find that moralization of AI in the headlines increased sharply after January 2022 until December 2022.

Most participants did not oppose AI; however, among those who did oppose AI-generated art, AI companionship, and legal AI, most indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial—suggesting resistance stems from moral rather than pragmatic concerns. Structural equation modeling revealed that attitudes toward AI were best explained by a single latent factor, supporting the idea that AI moralization is domain-general rather than application-specific. Qualitative analyses uncovered the most common arguments people invoke to justify their stance and revealed how opponents and supporters differ in their reasoning. Together, these findings suggest that AI aversion is primarily moral in nature, implying that shifting public attitudes may require addressing moral concerns rather than relying solely on pragmatic arguments.",

          "authors": "Dalainey H. Drakes; Emmanuelle Rochon; Allison Ouimet",
          "abstract": "Purpose:  \nIntolerance of uncertainty (IU) is associated with poorer emotional wellbeing and worse \nprognosis of chronic physical health and pain conditions (CHPCs). Our current understanding of \nIU in CHPCs is siloed within the literatures on specific CHPCs. However, IU is consistently \nidentified as a risk factor for anxiety and depressive disorders. In this exploratory study, we used \na mixed methods design to better understand the role of IU and anxiety in people’s (n = 139) \nlived experiences of their CHPCs and how they respond to uncertainty across health and \neveryday contexts.  \n\nPrimary Results:  \nHigher acceptance of illness and perceived social support were related to lower IU and anxiety \namong people with CHPCs. Higher IU and anxiety were also related to lower scores on many \ndomains of quality of life. Our reflexive thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes: 1) \ndistressing ambiguous contexts are not limited to health scenarios and require management in \ndiverse ways; 2) interference of CHPCs affects multiple domains of life beyond physical health; \n3) navigating uncertainty for a chronic period changes coping abilities and identity development; \nand 4) responsivity to uncertainty is a multifaceted cognitive-behavioural and emotional\nphysiological response that hinders or promotes coping.  \n\nConclusions:  \nIU significantly impacts the lives of those with CHPCs and holds potential as a transdiagnostic \ntarget for early prevention and intervention. By tailoring therapeutic approaches to acknowledge \nthe importance of health-related cues while increasing tolerance of uncertainty, people with \nCHPCs will likely experience improved prognosis, wellbeing, and fulfillment.  \n\nKeywords: intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, chronic health, chronic pain, transdiagnostic, \ncontext, mixed-methods",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, we examined the roles for curiosity in creativity. Study 1 used a qualitative case study of artist Rebecca Kamen, analyzing her presentations with open and thematic coding. Findings revealed three modes of curiosity: Busybody - broad, socially oriented exploration; Hunter - focused, in-depth investigation; and Dancer - integrative, imaginative synthesis. Kamen’s creative process was iterative, with curiosity cycling across these modes, highlighting the temporal, relational, and environmentally embedded nature of curiosity-in-action. Study 2 extended these insights to a population-level, trait-focused investigation using a United States sample of 504 adults. Trait curiosity was measured with the Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale-Revised, including overt and covert social curiosity, and creativity was assessed via the Revised Creativity Domain Questionnaire and the Biographical Inventory of Creative Behaviors. Regression analyses indicated that Thrill Seeking and Overt Social Curiosity were the strongest predictors of creativity. Together, these studies suggest that curiosity supports creativity both through situational, exploratory practices and broader dispositional tendencies. Socially oriented curiosity emerged as a particularly potent driver, linking interpersonal engagement with creativity. By integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence, this work highlights curiosity as a multifaceted, socially embedded phenomenon, advancing understanding of the processes and dispositions that fuel creative thought and innovation.",

          "abstract": "Self-regulatory flexibility refers to the context-dependent use of self-regulatory strategies to manage conflicts in self-control. Theoretical models of regulatory flexibility from neighboring fields, such as emotion regulation and coping, have been adapted to the self-control context. In addition, recent self-control models have incorporated notions of flexibility. This chapter reviews these models and the relevant empirical findings on the role of regulatory flexibility in the domain of self-control. In addition, we discuss polyregulation as a potential instance of regulatory flexibility. Empirical research suggests that different aspects of flexibility may contribute to self-control success in daily life. However, many open questions remain concerning the prevalence, adaptiveness, and importance of flexible regulation compared to other predictors of regulatory success. The chapter concludes with recommendations for future research.",

Drawing upon psychological research in dehumanisation, moral disengagement, and affective diffusion, it shows how fear, disgust, and urgency are mobilised to deem coercive practices publicly tolerable. Historical comparison with early Nazi governance is used, not to claim equivalence of outcome, but to expose shared psychological trajectories: threat construction, symbolic authority, and bureaucratic normalisation of harm. The concept of authoritarian drift captures how democratic systems recalibrate moral boundaries through language and spectacle rather than overt force. The danger identified here is not repetition, but continuity in the emotion machinery of exclusion.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how young people construct and manage their identities on Instagram, with particular attention to patterns of self-presentation over time. Drawing on a qualitative content analysis of Instagram profiles belonging to high school and university students in Serbia (N = 53), the study explores the extent to which visual content reflects continuity or discontinuity in identity construction. Contrary to initial expectations, the analysis reveals a relatively limited diversity of posted content, with notable uniformity and repetition across profiles. Content related to subcultural, political, religious, national, or sexual identities was largely absent or marginal. A particularly striking finding concerns the temporal structure of profiles: a substantial number of profiles contained no posts at all, while many others included only a small number of posts. On average, respondents published their first Instagram posts around the age of 18, and posts originating from earlier life stages—such as childhood or early adolescence—were extremely rare. These findings suggest that young users may actively curate their digital self-presentations by deleting earlier content or creating new profiles at key life transitions, particularly around the attainment of legal adulthood. Rather than serving as continuous visual archives of personal development, Instagram profiles appear to function as selectively constructed representations aligned with current identity positions. The paper situates these findings within the broader context of the historical rise of Instagram and ongoing debates on digital self-presentation. The analysis highlights types of content that are notably absent from participants’ Instagram profiles, despite their clear relevance to the participants’ social lives, including political events, nightlife, hobbies, education, religion, and significant life events. Although it is unlikely that participants are not involved in these activities or do not experience such events, they are rarely represented in the analyzed content, suggesting a selective mode of self-presentation rather than a lack of engagement. Instagram thus appears not to be perceived by participants as a digital space for displaying the full scope of their social lives, a conclusion further supported by irregular posting patterns and extended pauses in content sharing.

          "abstract": "Individuals with anxiety-related disorders (AD) often sacrifice positive outcomes in order to avoid or neutralize threats. Mixed findings to date suggest that individual differences in threat-related behavior patterns may vary based on specific parameters of the behavior being measured. Repetitive threat-neutralization behaviors, such as repeated checking or reassurance-seeking, are a prominent feature of many AD but remain sparsely studied. In this preliminary study, we employed a novel fear conditioning paradigm to assess repetitive threat-neutralization behavior in adults (n=35) with and without AD. The paradigm included a threat cue (CS+) paired with shock, safety cues (CS-) never paired with shock, and safe stimuli varying in similarity to the CS+, followed by an extinction phase with no shocks. Participants were instructed that they could repeatedly tap a button to reduce risk of shock, while also reducing accumulation of reward points. Those with greater self-reported anxiety sensitivity showed greater threat expectancy and more threat-neutralization behavior to the CS+ while under true threat, and during extinction in the absence of threat. Those with versus without AD showed more threat expectancy and threat-neutralization during extinction only. We discuss clinical implications and future directions for assessment of threat-neutralization behaviors.",

          "abstract": "When AI systems summarize and relay information, they inevitably transform it. But how? We introduce an experimental paradigm based on the telephone game to study what happens when AI talks to AI. Across five studies tracking content through AI transmission chains, we find three consistent patterns. The first is convergence, where texts differing in certainty, emotional intensity, and perspectival balance collapse toward a shared default of moderate confidence, muted affect, and analytical structure. The second is selective survival, where narrative anchors persist while the texture of evidence, hedges, quotes, and attributions is stripped away. The third is competitive filtering, where strong arguments survive while weaker but valid considerations disappear when multiple viewpoints coexist. In downstream experiments, human participants rated AI-transmitted content as more credible and polished. Importantly, however, humans also showed degraded factual recall, reduced perception of balance, and diminished emotional resonance. We show that the properties that make AI-mediated content appear authoritative may systematically erode the cognitive and affective diversity on which informed judgment depends.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural experiments, whether conducted in the laboratory or in the wild, often involve altering the context for the organisms. Such constraints may include environmental changes or manipulation by experimenters. These disturbances can induce stress, potentially affecting the physiology and behaviour of the animals and thus compromising the initial conditions of the experiment. When stress is directly related to the study subject, it can act as a confounding variable. This study aimed to investigate the impact of introducing an acclimation period, i.e., a delay between handling and the commencement of a task, on animal behaviour, specifically in woodlice. By incorporating this delay, we hypothesised that the animals would return to a baseline psychophysiological state, thereby reducing the stress effects of pre-experimental manipulations. We set up a simple task in which woodlice had to cross a corridor and we manipulated the delay between handling and the task itself. Contrary to our main hypothesis, our findings indicate that acclimation did not significantly affect the speed of woodlice. However, exploratory analyses revealed that a longer pre-experimental delay reduced the likelihood of U-turns in the corridor. Additionally, in trials without U-turns, woodlice spent more time in the experimental apparatus when the acclimation period was longer. These preliminary results only partially support previous research linking stress and exploration in woodlice. Further studies are necessary to confirm these effects and better characterise the relationship between acclimation and subsequent behaviour in scientific experiments.",

However, efforts to observe SIF have sometimes failed, leading some to question the robustness of the effect. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of SIF within the Think/No-Think paradigm including several key methodological variants to the original design. Across 500 effects from 120 studies, we observed a consistent aggregate SIF effect (d ≈ 0.20 – 0.40) measured using either same probe (SIF ≈ 6%), independent probe (SIF ≈ 5-6%) or recognition (SIF ≈ 2-4%) tests. Notably, there was considerable methodological variability, and prediction intervals revealed substantial heterogeneity. Moderator analyses undertaken to explain this variability found SIF to be credibly larger when using (a) relatively more repetitions during the Think/No-Think phase within same probe data; (b) thought substitution instructions within same probe data (with the opposite observed for independent probe data); and, (c) autobiographical memories (or future worries) as opposed to words or images. Results provide compelling evidence of the SIF effect but also suggest areas for future expansion.",

          "abstract": "Several proto-symbolic cognitive capacities have been documented in mammals and birds, at least to some degree. But one capacity, routinely reported in humans and called associative symmetry – being able to reverse an association learned in a forward manner, has largely resisted demonstration in non-human animals. It is thus generally considered to represent a building block for human symbolic cognition and mark a cognitive discontinuity with nonhumans. Yet, recently revealed methodological approximations in human data weaken such claim. Here, we tested 165 human adults in three experiments, in order to 1) provide a much-needed replication establishing symmetry, 2) and 3) assess its robustness with new tests. We obtained positive results, but showed that minor changes to the standard, well-established protocol produce major disruptions of evidence in favor of symmetry. This study suggests a prominent role of task-related inductive biases and underscores the benefit of minimal verbal instrutions to participants. Our results downplay associative symmetry as a defining feature of human cognition and question the reality of an interspecific cognitive gap.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peritraumatic reactions during sexual assault are central to societal rape stereotypes and may play a role for post-trauma mental health. Nevertheless, existing research is limited. In this cross-sectional study, we explored a broad spectrum of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral peritraumatic reactions and investigated their associations with assault characteristics, sexual assault history, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression/anxiety.\nMethods: Recent sexual assault victims (N=425, 96% female, M = 26.20 years old) completed a 23-item peritraumatic reactions questionnaire developed in collaboration with lived-experience experts. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed to identify latent peritraumatic reaction factors. Associations between factor scores, various assault characteristics, history of sexual assault, and current symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression/anxiety were assessed with t-tests, ANOVA, correlations and linear regressions.\nResults: EFA revealed six factors: Dissociation &amp; freeze, Cognitive strategies &amp; thought processes, Active defense behavior, Negative emotions, Perceived life threat, and Reactive surrender. Feelings of helplessness and nonactive behavioral responses, captured by the Dissociation &amp; freeze and the Reactive surrender factors, were much more pronounced than active resistance. Perpetrator strategies involving threats and physical violence were related to higher levels of most peritraumatic reactions, apart from Dissociation &amp; freeze. A closer victim-perpetrator relationship was associated with lower Perceived life threat, whereas a history of sexual assault was associated with higher levels of Reactive surrender. All factors except Cognitive strategies &amp; thought processes and Active defense behavior were positively correlated with post-traumatic stress and depression/anxiety symptoms, even when controlling for assault characteristics and sexual assault history.\nConclusions: These findings highlight the heterogeneity of peritraumatic responses and challenge rape stereotypes of the actively resisting victim by identifying reactive surrender as a common survival strategy. The robust associations between diverse peritraumatic reactions and post-trauma mental health propose these acute responses as vital clinical indicators for post-trauma adjustment.",

Although the growing use of the experience sampling method (ESM) has made it more feasible to examine such theories, methodological challenges limit the inferences that can be drawn about temporal personality dynamics. This paper describes the rationale, procedure, and first half of the dataset of the Personality and Contextualized Experiences (PACE) Study, a large, multi-site ESM study that currently comprises 1,126 undergraduates (78,101 observations) across Canada, Germany, and the United States. Of these, 421 participants completed the entire study (baseline survey, ≥ 100 ESM surveys, and follow-up survey). The PACE Study aims to advance the study of temporal personality dynamics by combining a large sample with several methodological features targeting key design and measurement aspects for accurately capturing and interpreting these dynamics. The features encompass an experimental comparison of two sampling designs, retrospective assessments of missed states, and a personalized assessment of situational information. The study further includes a newly developed global self-report questionnaire intended to capture aspects of people’s dynamic patterns of states without requiring ESM data.",

We examined gender, age, and cultural differences in both components across 67 countries using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and Uz’s tightness–looseness indices. We fit linear mixed-effects models with individuals nested within countries. Women scored higher than men on internalization and symbolization, and age showed small, positive within-country associations with both components of moral identity. Symbolization was higher in countries characterized by greater power distance, stronger collectivism (lower individualism), and greater masculinity – but only among younger participants. Symbolization was also higher in culturally tighter contexts, but only when tightness–looseness was indexed using a combination index. Internalization was higher in countries with lower power distance, stronger collectivism (lower individualism), and lower uncertainty avoidance. Its association with tightness–looseness depended on operationalization: internalization was higher in culturally tighter countries on the domain-general and combination indices, but lower in tighter countries on the domain-specific index. Overall, these findings provide a cross-national portrait of the self-importance of moral identity, revealing robust demographic gradients and component-specific cultural patterns in how people value moral traits privately and in social self-presentation.",

Partners exhibited substantial similarity in all attitude dimensions. However, there was only little support that similarity predicted relationship satisfaction. Finally, romantic partners did not converge in their attitudes over time, indicating that couple similarity reflected initial assortment rather than convergence.

However, loneliness in autism is often framed as a consequence of social isolation, reduced social motivation, or individual social difficulty. This paper argues that these framings—while consistent with general loneliness models—overlook a central feature of autistic loneliness: it frequently occurs amid ongoing social participation. Drawing on belonging theory, neurodiversity scholarship, epistemic justice, minority stress, and broader loneliness frameworks, this conceptual analysis introduces the Presence Without Belonging (PWB) framework. PWB distinguishes social presence from belonging and identifies three conditions required for belonging: recognition (being understood and taken seriously as a social subject), access (participation without extraordinary communicative, sensory, or temporal effort), and sustainability (participation that can be maintained over time without disproportionate cumulative cost). When one or more conditions is absent, participation may persist without belonging, producing loneliness despite contact. By reframing loneliness as a relational and structural outcome rather than an individual deficit, this analysis provides a foundation for more precise measurement, more accurate clinical formulation, and more responsible approaches to inclusion.",

          "abstract": "Moral decision-making can be understood along a continuum of integrative demands, reflecting the need to coordinate personal values with socially normative constraints. This review advances a temporally resolved framework of moral decision that maps increasing cognitive integrative demands onto a structured temporal cascade across three large-scale brain networks. The salience network supports rapid detection of morally relevant cues and early attentional orienting. The central executive network mediates mid-stage arbitration through conflict monitoring, and rule-outcome comparison. The default mode network contributes to later stages by retrieving autobiographical information and internalized norms for reflective, value-based evaluation. This cascade is indexed by temporally distinct electrophysiological signatures. Early affective-salience processing is reflected in rapid ERP modulations (P200, P260) and low-frequency oscillatory (delta, theta) synchronization. The transition to executive arbitration is marked by N200 activity and increases in midfrontal theta power, indexing conflict monitoring and control engagement. Later evaluative processes which track the retrieval of self-relevant information are captured by P300-like/LPP components and sustained oscillatory dynamics (alpha suppression and beta synchronization), reflecting motivational prioritization and the integration of affective and cognitive signals across the decision epoch. Drawing on neuro-imagery and neurostimulation studies, the cascade framework may help to understand how developmental change, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders differentially affect salience, control, and evaluative stages of moral appraisal. More broadly, the model offers a temporally grounded basis for neuroethical analyses of how neural markers of moral decision-making are interpreted in clinical and forensic contexts.",

The performance of children and adolescents with ADHD were compared with those of age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) peers previously tested and included in a normative database (N=50). \nThe CAT revealed a selective profile. Voluntary attention orienting seemed preserved in patients with ADHD, and involuntary capture of attention was not increased relative to TD peers. However, patients with ADHD presented difficulties in sustained attention reflected by enhanced reaction time variability, as well as increased phasic arousal responses to unexpected stimuli. Beyond attentional measures, patients with ADHD also expressed more impulsive and hyperactive response patterns during task performance.\nTaken together, these results suggest that, in this sample, ADHD-related attention deficits are better characterized as a combination of sustained attention instability and arousal dysregulation than as impairments in the balance between voluntary and involuntary attention. By mapping multiple attentional processes onto dissociable behavioral measures within one task, this work provides an initial proof of concept that the CAT is particularly valuable for evaluating the ADHD population.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on Emotion Regulation (ER) has often focused on the social factors that influence the use of regulation strategies and has shown that ER has a strong social component. The present study adopts an individual differences approach and aims to investigate how two rarely-explored dispositions that relate to social behavior, rejection sensitivity and advice seeking, influence ER, while controlling for the effect of other variables, including personality traits. To this end, 96 individuals completed an online questionnaire that assessed their scores on the two dispositions and on the Five Factor Model traits, as well as the perceived use and effectiveness of 14 strategies. Hierarchical regression results showed that the two dispositions were differentially associated with the use and effectiveness of specific strategies, beyond other variables. Specifically, rejection sensitivity was negatively related to the use of Putting-into-perspective (p = .02) and to the effectiveness of Catastrophizing (p = .03), while advice seeking was inversely associated with the endorsement of Suppression (p = .001) and positively with the success of Other-blame (p = .008). Thus, our study suggests that these constructs are important when examining individual differences in ER and provides valuable insight into the understanding of regulation patterns.",

          "abstract": "Habits are central to daily life and some compulsive disorders, but reliably measuring\nthem in the lab is challenging. For the first time, across two experiments, we directly\ncompared two key experimental paradigms for studying lab-developed habits in\nhumans, the classic Outcome Devaluation task and a newer Response Remapping\ntask, by systematically manipulating time constraints for responses. In the outcome\ndevaluation task, longer preparation time led to more habitual actions,\ncounterintuitively, possibly due to response withholding biases that initially masked\nhabitual tendencies. In contrast, the response remapping task showed the expected\npattern – habits dominated under more response time pressure (200–500 ms) and\nweakened when more time was available. Overall, the response remapping task\nelicited stronger habit tendencies than the outcome devaluation task, suggesting that\neach paradigm engages distinct cognitive processes –response inhibition versus\nautomatic action selection– one requiring people to inhibit a learned response, and\nthe other relying on fast, automatic actions. Our findings reveal that habit expression\nis highly sensitive to task structure and underlying mechanisms. This direct\ncomparison underscores the consideration of distinct cognitive and motivational\nfactors driving habitual responses and highlights that habits reflect multiple\ndissociable mechanisms rather than a uniform phenomenon.",

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) constitute a highly scalable, low-barrier approach for early intervention. In this study, a micro-randomized trial was conducted to investigate the proximal (short-term) and distal (longer-term) effects of different EMIs based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).\nMethods: 72 participants at increased risk for developing mental disorders comprised the sample (67.6% female). They completed a 16-day intervention phase during which they received four pre-ecological momentary assessments (pre-EMA) at semi-random moments each day assessing proximal outcomes negative (NA) and positive affect (PA). Each day, two randomly-selected pre-EMAs were immediately followed by an EMI. Thirty minutes following each pre-EMA, NA and PA were assessed again. Before and after the intervention phase, distal outcomes symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were assessed.\nResults: Multilevel models showed proximal improvements in PA following EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT. NA decreased following positive psychology; ACT specifically improved NA during moments of higher NA at pre-EMA. The CBT-based EMI neither improved NA nor PA. Distal improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety and well-being were observed.\nDiscussion: This study provides support for the beneficial immediate effects of EMIs based on positive psychology and ACT on affect; symptoms of psychopathology and well-being improved on a distal level. Future research should further investigate the benefits of different EMIs in crucial moments (e.g., high momentary NA) to develop adequate just-in-time support.",

          "abstract": "Measures of dynamic constructs in everyday life, captured in intensive longitudinal data (ILD), may function differently across clustering dimensions, leading to measurement noninvariance. Cross-classified factor analysis (CCFA) has been used to test invariance across people and time, but additional dimensions remain largely unexplored. Situational characteristics–both perceived and objective aspects–may affect responses, making them an informative clustering dimension beyond time for measurement invariance investigations in ILD. Using ILD from 225 participants with up to 50 observations each, we applied the CCFA approach to test the measurement invariance of vigor across people and time and, newly, to examine situational characteristics as an alternative clustering dimension. Profiles of perceived situations for clustering observations were derived via latent profile analysis, complemented by more objective situational aspects: location, accompanying people, and main activity. For the vigor items, the measurement parameters varied substantially across participants, indicating noninvariance. While invariance held across time and objective situational properties, measurement parameters varied markedly across perceived situations. These findings highlight the need to move beyond time as a clustering dimension and, crucially, consider people’s situation perception when evaluating measurement invariance in ILD. The proposed CCFA usage can be copied to incorporate further clustering dimensions in future research.",

          "abstract": "The rise of digital fitness platforms like Strava has revolutionized the world of endurance sports by fostering social comparison and self-surveillance among athletes. This research delves into the psychological impact of such social comparisons on Strava users, exploring how the platform influences sport behavior, motivation, and mental well-being. It was hypothesized that adult endurance athletes with a strong social comparison orientation and low self-compassion would be negatively affected by Strava use. Additionally, it was assumed that women and younger users would be particularly susceptible to its effects. Furthermore, it was theorized that different sport motivations would shape the impact of Strava use. To address these questions, a mixed-methods approach was employed, combining a quantitative online survey and qualitative interviews. The online survey collected data from a diverse group of Strava users (N = 114), examining their social comparison tendencies and the resulting psychological effects. In addition, four in-depth interviews were conducted with long-time and new Strava users to gain insights into individual experiences and the nuanced effects of the platform. The results revealed that while Strava can boost motivation and foster a sense of community, it also poses significant risks, particularly for individuals prone to negative social comparisons and low self-compassion, particularly women. Contrary to the assumption that younger users would be more affected, the study found that health motives and social recognition as sport motives played a crucial role in amplifying the negative effects of Strava usage. Findings delineate a mechanistic pathway linking platform‑enabled comparison processes to motivation and mental health in endurance sport. Interventions that foster self‑compassion and recalibrate comparison‑prone motives may help maximize benefits while mitigating harms of social fitness platforms.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving social threats, especially expressions of anger, increases the speed of both action selection and execution. However, it remains unclear how individuals balance speed with achieving desirable outcomes, such as threat avoidance, under these conditions. To investigate this trade-off between decision’s speed and accuracy, we examined the kinematics of finger-reaching movements using a \"go-before-you-know\" paradigm. Participants chose between two empty outer chairs in a waiting room. Two central chairs were occupied by either two individuals with neutral expressions or one neutral individual and one threatening individual. The threatening individual expressed anger or fear at one of four intensity levels. The results showed that social threats generally invigorated action decision, as high-threat trials elicited faster movements with more direct trajectories compared to neutral trials. However, when participants chose to avoid angry individuals, the most frequent response, movements initially followed more central and slower trajectories until the decision was made, compared to when they approached angry individuals. These findings suggest that while social threats generally invigorate action selection and execution, the accumulation of evidence for the decision can be temporarily prolonged to enhance the likelihood of a favorable outcome, such as threat avoidance. We propose integrating these results with recent models of action decisions under perceived urgency to advance understanding of threat-related decision-making.",

Enhancing self-efficacy via\nvivid recall of personal memories is a promising approach. This study tested an autobiographical self-\nefficacy training as an intervention for STBs by examining its effects on STB precursors, namely\nperceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, in a healthy sample. Methods. Participants (n =\n105, 72% female) were randomized to a self-efficacy memory recall, a neutral memory recall, or a no\ntraining group. Participants completed an interpersonal stress task designed to elicit perceived\nburdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, assessed via ecological momentary assessments six times\nduring the task, alongside heart rate variability (HRV) recordings. Linear mixed models evaluated training\neffects. Results. Training did not significantly affect task-specific perceived burdensomeness (no training\nvs. self-efficacy: b = −0.01, 95% CI [−0.28, 0.26]; neutral vs. self-efficacy: b = 0.09, 95% CI [−0.18, 0.36]) or\nthwarted belongingness (no training vs. self-efficacy: b = 0.21, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.48]; neutral vs. self-\nefficacy: b = 0.22, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.48]), though the neutral group showed a greater increase in desire to\ndrop out (b = 0.33, 95% CI [0.02, 0.63]).

          "abstract": "Background: The integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into mental health care represents a pressing scientific and ethical challenge. A critical global shortage of clinicians leaves the absolute majority of the world's population without access to mental health services, creating an urgent imperative for scalable, evidence-based solutions. While Single-Session Interventions (SSIs) offer a scalable modality, their deployment is constrained by the \"human factor\"-specifically, the critical shortage of trained professionals and community gatekeepers. However, a critical bottleneck remains while theoretical dissemination is feasible, the mass acquisition of clinical skills is impossible to scale, as high-fidelity training relies entirely on scarce human supervision. In this study, we propose a model for scalable professional training aimed at improving mental health outcomes at scale and resolving implementation barriers through a multi-Agent architecture. Specifically, we constructed and evaluated agents for Single-Session Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT-SSI) to demonstrate the \"Scale on Scale\" paradigm.\nMethod: Employing a mixed-methods design, this study developed and evaluated a novel AI-powered simulator for IPT-SSI. The system utilizes a Multi-Agent architecture (Trainee-Patient-Supervisor) where trainees engaged with a virtual patient to conduct a single-session intervention, receiving real-time and post-session clinical supervision. The system facilitates simultaneous mass practice, allowing unlimited numbers of practitioners to acquire complex skills concurrently within a safe, controlled environment. MHPs (N=72) completed a blended training program comprising a brief didactic unit and an experiential, supervised AI simulation.\nResults: Quantitative analysis demonstrated robust and statistically significant pre–post gains across key domains: IPT-SSI knowledge self-efficacy, attitudes toward intervention efficacy, and willingness to deliver the intervention. Conversely, changes in reported apprehension regarding delivery did not reach statistical significance. Qualitative evaluation confirmed that the system functioned as a high-fidelity clinical gymnasium, providing a safe space for deliberate practice. The machine’s contribution to human skill formation was perceived as high, successfully balancing rigorous adherence to the evidence-base with supportive, real-time scaffolding.\nConclusions: The findings validate the \"Scale on Scale\" paradigm, demonstrating that a Multi-Agent System can construct a complex, holistic pedagogical environment capable of facilitating simultaneous mass practice. By applying this architecture to IPT-SSI, the study illustrates a method for scaling evidence-based interventions without compromising fidelity. Ultimately, this approach may transform GAI from a theoretical promise into a systemic enabler, enhancing human capabilities to deliver safe, high-fidelity care in resource-constrained settings.",

We present an automated pipeline grounded in a multi-layer neuropsychological digital-twin framework that unifies task administration, automatic scoring, extended data analysis, computational modeling, and readable reporting. Specifically, the pipeline provides (I) administration of standard neuropsychological tasks of executive functions and metacognition, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the metacognitive WCST (meta-WCST), and an original developmental version (Dev-meta-WCST), (II) fully automated scoring of classical indices and trial-by-trial trends, (III) computational modeling of individual traits and dynamics, (IV) generation of readable individual multi-layer neuropsychological digital twins and group-level reports composed of aggregated data, trial-by-trial dynamics, temporal data, and model-based profiles. We illustrate the pipeline functionalities (task-specific automation, sensitivity to individual profiles, lifespan robustness, and model-based interpretability) using four representative single cases: two adults performing the WCST and meta-WCST and two children, with typical development and ADHD, performing the Dev-meta-WCST.

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322 university students; Mage = 20.70, SD = 1.62; 50% female), we evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while in Study 2 (N = 451 university students; Mage = 19.88, SD = 1.64; 52% female), we examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found associations between value congruence and friendship interest for conservation, openness, and self-transcendence values, but not for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

A convergent mixed-methods design will be employed to integrate quantitative psychological assessments, physiological indicators of ANS regulation, and qualitative accounts of lived emotional experiences. Quantitative measures will assess perceived parenting style, borderline personality traits, emotion dysregulation, stress, and anxiety. Physiological functioning will be indexed through heart rate variability (HRV) as a marker of autonomic flexibility and regulatory capacity. Semi-structured interviews will further explore participants’ subjective experiences of parental emotional environments, coping strategies, and interpersonal patterns.\n\nData collection has not yet commenced. This protocol describes the theoretical framework, methodological procedures, and planned analytical approach for a future empirical phase.

Dyads completed a previously validated experimental task designed to elicit HR fluctuations while jointly attending to emotionally evocative, 5-minute audiovisual stimuli.

Second, we found high correspondence between the two systems in quantifying dyadic HR synchrony using multiple analytical approaches.

Evidence is emerging that AI feedback might elicit distinct psychological reactions differing from those elicited by hu-man feedback. However, the mechanisms behind empirically found differences are not yet well understood. The present study adds to this by examining perceptions of investment and judgment associated with social aspects of feedback in addition to feedback usefulness and actionability. We report experimental findings using a fake label paradigm, where the same feedback message is labeled as either coming from an AI system or a human instructor, in a sample of 282 US col-lege students on Prolific. We test the effects of provider labels on feedback perceptions and be-havior (revision engagement). Results show that students perceive the same feedback message differently: students report higher investment perceptions, personal relevance, actionability, and usefulness of the feedback when it is labeled as coming from a human instructor. We did not find significant differences in judgment perceptions and behavioral engagement regarding the feed-back and revision task. Further analyses indicated that investment perceptions, but not covariates such as AI competence perceptions, explain the differences between feedback conditions regard-ing usefulness and actionability. For theory, this implies that perceived investment might be one key relational appraisal through which provider labels (human vs. AI) shape perceived useful-ness and actionability, even with identical feedback content.

This case series comprises 17 consecutive patients previously diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia based on clinical and neurophysiological evaluations, all of whom underwent psychological and psychometric evaluations.\nResults: Two-thirds of patients met criteria for complex post-traumatic stress disorder. \nConclusions: This case series suggests that some cases of pathological hypersomnolence might be associated with traumatic disorders. Hypersomnolence may represent a response to traumatic memories, particularly in patients with complex traumatic histories, such as childhood abuse. The small sample size (n=17) limits the generalizability of the findings. This observation should be interpreted with caution, requires confirmation in a larger sample, but opens a potentially relevant line of research in the understanding of hypersomnias.",

Drawing on ideas from control theory, we propose that the critical feature of SEB skills is flexibility. We use this distinction to distinguish it from related constructs such as abilities and personality traits. We discuss the implications of our perspective for the study and measurement of SEB skills.",

          "abstract": "When speakers refer to objects in the world, they frequently overinform. Contrary to classical theories in linguistics, we hypothesise that overinformativeness is an efficient means of facilitating listener comprehension: speakers use redundancy to provide their listeners with search-efficient perceptual information. In Experiment One (N = 72), we operationalise search efficiency as the ease or difficulty of perceptual discrimination. We borrow methods from psychophysics to manipulate discriminability across attributes (material, colour) and across sensory modalities (audition, vision). We show that across both attributes and modalities, speakers overinform more often when the redundant information helps the listener perceptually discriminate the referent, thus aiding listener-search. Contrary to our expectations, we also find that speakers disproportionately overinform with colour information (relative to material). In Experiment Two (N = 97), we investigate the disproportionate use of colour directly, addressing explanations that appeal to colour’s perceptual salience by 1) dampening colour’s perceptual distinctiveness, and 2) controlling linguistic complexity both in terms of language production and retrieval effort. Contrary to widespread explanations, these factors cannot explain the disproportionate use of colour: colour is privileged in reference.",

          "authors": "Tabea Springstein; Rohit Batra; Emorie D Beck",
          "abstract": "People vary in how their emotional experiences change over time, so dynamical systems theory has been suggested to understand daily emotion regulation processes. However, it is not clear whether dynamic changes in emotions over time, such as return to a person-specific affective baseline, reflect successful engagement in goal-directed emotion regulation or simply automatic fluctuations of a self-regulating system. In two experience sampling studies (5x/day for 21 days) with total N=450 young adult participants, we use person-specific change-as-outcome models, implemented through continuous-time modeling, to investigate dynamic changes in emotions while considering momentary goals to up or downregulate positive and negative affect. We show that people differ from each other in their attractor location (i.e., affective baseline) and their attractor strength (i.e., how quickly they return to their affective baseline) when not accounting for goals. We also show that people vary in whether their emotion systems respond to emotion regulation goals, highlighting that for about 65% of people, their emotions do not change based on their regulation goals. However, we show that individual differences in well-being and regulation strategy use are related to differences in simple and goal-directed changes in emotions. This highlights that emotion regulation success indicated by motivated changes in daily emotions is rare, but individual differences in these motivated changes in addition to simple emotion dynamics provide relevant insight into people’s emotional lives. This work highlights the importance of differentiating goal-independent fluctuations of dynamic affective systems from conscious emotion regulation in daily life.",

          "abstract": "Introductory statistics courses and conventional methods in behavioral and cognitive science are typically restricted to Euclidean space without explicitly stating this, leaving many researchers unaware of how to handle data with circular or periodic properties (e.g., time of day or orientation on a screen). This tutorial provides an accessible yet rigorous introduction, designed to bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical application. After an overview of common applications, we discuss different ways of representing circular data mathematically and fundamental principles for working with them. We explain angular and vector representations and operations, including key considerations for implementing them in computer code. We then survey methods for visualizing circular data, including linear and polar plots and presentation of summary statistics. Next, we discuss circular measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape: how they relate to their Euclidean counterparts, and why they differ. Finally, we turn to more advanced topics of the kind needed to construct models of circular data. We introduce the most common circular distribution families, including circular analogs of the Gaussian distribution and their properties, as well as flexible distribution families that can describe skewed and heavy-tailed data. The tutorial takes a method-oriented approach, not tied to specific software, but highlighting factors relevant to experimental design, data analysis, and statistical modeling. A consistent theme is the need to rigorously account for the inherent periodicity of circular data. We also provide a consistent notation for circular statistics and parameters, addressing the lack of established conventions in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background: Dance is regarded as a multimodal experience which integrates movement, music, cognitive, and social engagement, potentially providing a non-pharmacological care approach for persons with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD). While numerous studies have investigated the benefits of dance for motor outcomes, less is known about the influence on cognitive and non-motor symptoms.\nObjective: To explore the scope, characteristics, and influence of dance-based interventions for PD, while examining how often cognitive and non-motor symptoms were analyzed relative to motor outcomes.\nMethods: Guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological framework for scoping reviews, a search was carried out across three databases to identify relevant literature, followed by title, abstract, and full text screening by three independent reviewers. Data were extracted on study and intervention characteristics, outcome domains, and reported effects. \nResults: Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. The most used interventions were tango and Dance for Parkinson’s Disease (DfPD) programs, typically delivered in community settings, twice weekly, for approximately 60 minutes per individual session. In contrast to motor symptoms, which were assessed most frequently (89%), non-motor and cognitive symptoms were assessed in 76% and 47% of studies, respectively. Motor outcomes demonstrated the most consistent improvements (84%), followed by non-motor improvements (53%) and cognitive gains (32%). Collectively, non-motor and cognitive outcomes were increasingly assessed within the last decade and demonstrated variable findings. \nConclusion: Although cognitive and non-motor symptoms have a well-documented impact on quality of life in PD, these domains have received less attention than motor outcomes within the dance-based literature. Measures of cognitive and non-motor outcomes, alongside longer-term interventions with larger samples, should be incorporated in future protocols for a better understanding of the multidimensional impact of dance in PD.",

          "abstract": "Background: Physical activity (PA) is essential for healthy development, yet less than a quarter of U.S. youth meet the recommended PA levels. Physical literacy (PL) has emerged as a holistic framework to support sustained PA through the integration of motivation, confidence, physical competence, and knowledge and understanding; however, the field remains limited by measurement challenges and insufficient attention to the social climate in which PA is experienced. Objective: To address this gap, the present study proposes and empirically tests social climate as a fifth core domain of PL and examines PL as a dynamic, interconnected system using psychological network analysis. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 771 youth (ages 9–14) enrolled in 24 afterschool programs serving underserved communities in the southeastern United States (2018–2024). Validated questionnaires assessed knowledge and understanding, motivation, confidence, and social climate, while physical competence was operationalized as objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA; daily and afterschool) using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Results: Domain-level networks revealed that all five domains were positively interconnected, with a particularly salient Social Climate–Knowledge–Motivation feedback loop. At the scale level, regulatory motivation of PA affect (PAR) showed the highest node strength, followed by social support from friends and autonomous self-regulation (TSRQA). Bridge analyses identified TSRQA, need for relatedness, and perceived PA ability as key connectors linking social, motivational, and cognitive processes. Conclusions: Findings provide empirical support for social climate as a core PL domain and highlight the integrated roles of motivational regulation (PAR), intrinsic enjoyment (PAII), and applied PA knowledge reflected in autonomous self-regulation (TSRQA) as strategic targets for PA interventions aimed at strengthening PL and promoting sustained youth PA engagement.",

          "abstract": "AI companies often anthropomorphize their products with the aim of increasing user engagement and trust. What downstream consequences result from such anthropomorphism?  One possibility is a deflection of perceived responsibility from the AI’s creators to the AI itself. Across two studies, we tested this hypothesis. In Study 1 (N = 309), participants interacted with an LLM chatbot that varied in anthropomorphic language (high or low) and completed behavioral and self-reported measures of trust. Anthropomorphism increased trust across all measures, with the LLM’s degree of emotional attunement fully mediating the relationship between anthropomorphism and behavioral trust. In Study 2 (N = 430), participants read six descriptions of an AI home assistant that performed a range of positive and negative actions. The assistant varied in anthropomorphism (high, low, or none). Participants provided ratings of responsibility to multiple actors, including the creators. The data revealed, first, that anthropomorphism increased blame directed toward the AI entity itself. Second, we found strong evidence for responsibility displacement: participants who attributed more responsibility to AI attributed less to the company that created it (r = -0.68). Together, these findings reveal perverse incentives in AI design: anthropomorphism simultaneously increases user trust while deflecting accountability from developers. These dynamics create a responsibility gap with significant implications for AI governance and institutional accountability.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) is highly capacity limited, and attention acts as a filter to ensure that goal-relevant information is encoded. While this filtering process has been well characterized under static fixation, eye movements are frequent during natural vision. Not only have eye movements been shown to disrupt perceptual processes, but the VWM filter itself has been shown to be susceptible to distraction-induced disruptions. Do eye movements similarly disrupt control over the attentional filter regulating access to VWM? Across three experiments, we tested whether the VWM filter persists across saccades or is temporarily disrupted. In a continuous report paradigm, participants remembered the colors of target-matching shapes while ignoring nontargets. Experiment 1 (no-saccade) confirmed robust filtering: performance decreased with increasing memory set size, indicating successful exclusion of nontargets. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants executed saccades before the onset of the memory display, which appeared after either a short (50 ms) or long (400 ms) post-saccade delay. Attentional filtering was ineffective immediately after a saccade but recovered by the longer delay, demonstrating a temporally-specific disruption of the VWM filter. Together, the results indicate that saccades interrupt the filter that governs VWM encoding and that attentional control must be re-established post-saccade. These findings extend the Filter Disruption Theory, showing that in addition to distraction, eye movements themselves induce a momentary loss of attentional control over VWM encoding, with implications for how visual cognition remains stable across gaze shifts.",

The current study examines the relationship between language patterns and social identity among NFL sports fans on Reddit. Drawing data from 32 team-specific subreddits, a comprehensive dataset of approximately 4 million social interactions was analyzed using automated psychological text analysis methods. Findings revealed that on game days, fans consistently employed more collective pronouns, exemplified by the frequent use of \"we,\" underscoring their affiliation with their respective teams. Counter to predictions, the increased use of we-words was higher among those whose teams lost than won, even though losing was associated with drops in positive emotions following the loss. Emotion words on the day following defeat reflected the emotional impact of unfavorable outcomes on fan discourse. These results align with social identity theories, highlighting the role of group membership in shaping linguistic expressions and providing empirical evidence for how sports fans navigate their identities through language on social media platforms. By anchoring the investigation in psychological theories of identity, this study advances our understanding of the interplay between social identity and language use, offering valuable insights into the emotional responses and communication behaviors of sports enthusiasts in the digital age.",

However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

          "abstract": "Background. Despite increasing availability of digital mental health interventions, most adolescents with mental health needs do not access effective care. Digital, self-guided single-session interventions (SSIs) offer a scalable, low-burden option, yet little is known about how youth engage with dissemination strategies designed to promote their uptake. Dissemination efforts are often ad hoc and insufficiently grounded in behavioral theory, limiting their effectiveness. This study applied the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model to examine factors shaping adolescents’ engagement with dissemination strategies for digitally delivered SSIs.\n\nMethods. Using a formative qualitative design, semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with adolescents with mental health needs. The interview guide, informed by the COM-B model, explored youths’ anticipated responses to encountering SSI-related information online and in community settings. Nineteen participants completed a demographic survey (mean age = 15.63 years; range = 13-19). Data were transcribed by a third party and analyzed using a structured codebook, with multiple coders contributing to iterative analysis.\n\nResults. Youth engagement with SSI dissemination was shaped by interrelated capability, opportunity, and motivational processes at the point of exposure. Limited awareness of SSIs and difficulty distinguishing them from other digital mental health services inhibited interpretation of SSI messaging. Opportunity-related barriers included limited time, inconsistent internet access, and reliance on social media-only dissemination, while trusted physical contexts and endorsements from peers or authority figures facilitated engagement. Motivational determinants included privacy concerns, anticipated enrollment burden, and affective reactions to mental health–related and algorithmically targeted advertisements, which often prompted disengagement.\n\nConclusions. Dissemination should be conceptualized as a modifiable behavioral process rather than a passive delivery mechanism. Theory-driven dissemination strategies that reduce cognitive and procedural friction, expand access across trusted contexts, and address both reflective and affective motivational processes may improve youth engagement with scalable digital mental health interventions.",

Here, we triangulated across two family-based designs, the Norwegian Mother Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the Early Growth and Development Study (EGDS) from the United States, both of which have comparable measures and allow for direction-of-causation analysis and control for shared genetics. Analyses were pre-registered.\n\nWe found converging evidence across both studies for both genetic and environmental transmission in the relationship between parenting behaviours and child aggressive behaviour, with the association between positive parenting and lower child aggression being driven primarily by shared genetics. In MoBa, 47% of the association between inconsistent parenting and child aggression was explained by shared genetics. We found significant child-to-parent effects in both the MoBa and the EGDS samples. This work shows the strength of triangulation, allowing us to describe a pattern of intergenerational association that is not dependent on a specific sample or study design.",

          "abstract": "Extended Reality is increasingly used in education, particularly for complex domains such as neuroanatomy. While prior studies have emphasized XR's potential to enhance engagement and learning, few have empirically examined the cognitive and motivational mechanisms underlying these effects. This study introduces the Integrative Model of Cognitive Load and Motivation in XR learning (IMCLM-XR), a conceptual model linking cognitive load theory and curiosity-driven learning models to understand how XR influences learning outcomes. A total of 282 medical students were randomly assigned to a traditional video-based condition, an AR-guided drawing condition, or an interactive VR lesson. Using Bayesian structural equation modeling, results showed that both AR and VR significantly reduced extraneous cognitive load and increased intrinsic motivation, though the latter did not directly predict learning performance. Agency, enhanced in VR, was associated with greater intrinsic motivation and reduced extraneous load. Crucially, extraneous load had a strong negative effect on perceived learning progress, which in turn predicted intrinsic motivation, revealing a key mediating pathway. These findings highlight how unnecessary cognitive demands not only impair learning performance but also disrupt learners' perceptions of progress, undermining intrinsic motivation.

          "abstract": "Social adaptation requires humans to respond to others’ nonverbal emotional cues by selecting and executing adaptive motor responses. In this chapter, we provide a general overview of how visual perception of others’ emotional expressions, particularly threatening faces and bodies, promotes rapid processing and elaboration of multiple opportunities for action, at different levels of complexity. Notably, we will highlight how subcortical and cortical neural pathways interact to flexibly orchestrate our social behavior in response to threatening expressions, ranging from simple stimulus-driven reactions to more elaborated goal-directed actions. We will review recent findings from research on humans and other animals and discuss clinical implications, as well as future challenges and perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Although many digital health interventions (DHIs) for HIV prevention have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and, to a lesser extent, efficacy, few have achieved widespread dissemination beyond research settings. Reimagining existing multisession DHIs as single-session interventions (SSIs) offers a promising strategy to enhance scalability, given growing evidence that SSIs can effectively bridge treatment and prevention gaps. This study applied the Intervention Mapping (IM) framework, combined with single-session design principles, to adapt Keep It Up! (KIU!), a CDC-designated best-evidence HIV prevention program originally delivered across six months into a single-session format. Using a modified IM approach, we convened an expert and community advisory board (n = 13) to guide the study; across six steps, we prioritized key behavioral outcomes, identified corresponding objectives, and retained KIU!’s core theoretical determinants. The resulting program, Keep It Brief!, comprises three components: a universal HIV module, a tailored PrEP module reflecting users’ PrEP experience, and a relationship module adapted for participants who are single, monogamous, or in open/polyamorous relationships. Usability testing with 15 end users indicated high acceptability, engagement, and usability, supported by qualitative and quantitative feedback. Despite substantial changes from the original intervention, the modified IM approach proved practical in retaining essential mechanisms within a single-session format. We propose that adaptations of multisession interventions should not be evaluated on whether they outperform the original program, but by their ability to reach individuals or settings where multisession formats are infeasible, while producing meaningful change in core mechanisms. We also outline key challenges and recommendations for adapting multisession DHIs into single-session formats.",

          "abstract": "Past research suggests that smartphone use negatively impacts psychological well-being, but it has often overlooked the role of different smartphone use purposes. In two studies, we investigated how specific types of smartphone use – active and passive social use, news consumption, entertainment, and practical use – relate to psychological well-being. In Study 1, participants (N = 572) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing self-reported smartphone use and psychological well-being indicators. Multiple regression analyses revealed that passive social smartphone use was linked to lower psychological well-being, while the remaining use purposes were not significantly associated with well-being. In Study 2, participants (N = 496) took part in a 10-day daily diary study, reporting their smartphone use and psychological well-being at the end of the day. Multi-level analyses showed that, at a between-person level, active social use was associated with higher positive affect and stress, while passive social use was linked to worse scores on all indicators of psychological well-being. In contrast, news consumption was associated with better scores on all psychological well-being outcomes. Entertainment was linked to lower positive affect and higher negative affect. Lastly, practical use was linked to higher negative affect and higher stress. At a within-person level, analyses showed that increases in active social use and practical use were linked to higher stress. Collectively, findings from the two studies highlight the nuanced effects of smartphone use on psychological well-being, underscoring the need for a more granular approach to understanding smartphone use and well-being.",

Using a naturalistic movie-watching paradigm, we integrated behavioral, cardiac, and fMRI measures in children (6–14 years) and adults (18–30 years), alongside independent ratings of experienced valence and arousal. Across age groups, positive and negative emotional content elicited coordinated changes in subjective experience, heart rate, and corticolimbic activity, including engagement of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Despite these shared patterns, marked developmental differences emerged. Children reported more positive affect, showed larger heart-rate deceleration, and exhibited stronger recruitment of thalamic and lateral prefrontal regions, consistent with more sensory-driven and effortful regulatory processing. Adults, in contrast, showed greater activation in hippocampal and posterior midline regions, suggesting increased reliance on memory-based and self-referential appraisal. During negative emotional content specifically, children preferentially engaged medial prefrontal regions, whereas adults showed enhanced lateral prefrontal recruitment, indicating a developmental shift from reactive to more deliberate emotion regulation. Importantly, models integrating behavioral, cardiac, and neural indices explained substantially more variance in internalizing symptoms than any single modality alone, highlighting the value of multimodal approaches for understanding developmental pathways to mental well-being.",

          "authors": "Julia M. Rohrer; Gregor Kachel; Richard McElreath",
          "abstract": "The city of Leipzig in Germany conducts large-scale school surveys of adolescents in secondary education schools. Following the regular surveys in 2010 and 2015, the 2020 survey had to be rescheduled to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this latest survey wave, the gender gap in general life satisfaction has significantly grown. While in 2010 and 2015 girls were somewhat less satisfied than boys (0.26 to 0.33 SD), in 2023 this gender gap had doubled (with girls 0.57 SD less satisfied). Why? Here, we probe various explanations, aiming to provide a template for researchers who are asking reverse causal questions (“What caused this?”). First, we find that the widening of the gender gap is much more pronounced among students with a migration background. This could plausibly be explained by a shift in the composition of the underlying population, with a strong increase of Syrian students, and a relative decrease of Vietnamese ones. Second, among students without a migration background, part of the increasing gender gap could potentially be attributed to survey mode: In 2023, for the first time, the survey was conducted on tablets—and unexpectedly, girls (but not boys) reported significantly lower satisfaction when surveyed on tablet rather than on paper. Third, beyond these two patterns, we still find significantly widening gender gaps in satisfaction with leisure time activities and relationships to friends. Thus, there may be a substantive increase in the gender gap in satisfaction in those two domains that is not readily attributable to changes in population and survey mode.",

          "abstract": "According to the attractiveness halo effect, global person perceptions are biased by physical attractiveness: More attractive people are ascribed positive attributes like competence, prosociality, and health, with cross-cultural variation in such perceptions. However, extant cross-cultural studies mostly considered cross-cultural differences only in either observers or targets. This preregistered study explored cross-cultural nuances in the attractiveness halo effect for Brazilian and German target men and women, as perceived by Brazilian and German observers. Facial photos of 583 targets were judged separately for attractiveness, prosociality, health, intelligence, social competence, familiarity, and physical and social dominance by 554 Brazilian and 326 German observers. Ratings between Brazilian and German observers for the same target group and attribute were strongly positively correlated, except for familiarity for German male targets. Attractiveness halo effects were overall strong (stronger for health, social competence, and familiarity compared to social dominance, prosociality, and intelligence) and mostly consistent for Brazilian and German targets and observers, with few exceptions. Only for physical dominance, associations were mixed by target gender and nationality. This study supports a putative universality of attractiveness halo effects and also contributes to a deeper understanding of subtle variations in the halo effects of men’s and women’s attractiveness in more individualistic versus more collectivistic cultures.",

          "authors": "Natascha Steiger; Olivier Desmedt; Pauline Billaux; Pierre Maurage; Mateo Leganes-Fonteneau",
          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Alcohol hangover is the most frequently reported adverse consequence of excessive drinking and is an important predictor of future alcohol use. Yet, despite hangover being centrally related to negative physical sensations, commonly used measurement tools focus on cognitive characteristics and fail to represent its interoceptive features. Bodily mapping allows to visualize and quantify subjective bodily sensations to efficiently measure alcohol-related bodily experiences (e.g., craving, intoxication). We present the first use of bodily mapping in a naturalistic study design to understand how subjective hangover sensations shape individual differences in interoceptive phenomenology and drinking patterns in young heavy drinkers.\n\nMethods: Heavy episodic drinkers (N = 34) completed a baseline assessment and at least three follow-up sessions during acute hangover episodes. Real-time data were collected using a smartphone-adapted emBODY tool, which generates topographical maps of bodily activation and deactivation. These body maps quantified the extent and intensity of bodily sensations related to hangover. Participants also reported prior-night subjective intoxication and current hangover severity. Linear mixed models and correlational analyses were used to assess within-subject associations with session-level variables and between-subject associations with individual drinking profiles. All analyses were pre-registered. \n\nResults: Topographical analyses revealed consistent patterns of bodily activation in the head, chest and abdomen and deactivation in the lower limbs during hangover episodes. Intensity, but not extent, of bodily sensations was significantly associated with hangover severity, independently of subjective intoxication of the previous night. Participants with high (vs. low) trait-level drinking scores reported more intense bodily sensations of hangover and more frequent hangovers, as well as stronger associations between sensation intensity and hangover severity. This association was also stronger as age increased.\n\nConclusions: Bodily mapping captured meaningful interoceptive patterns linked to subjective hangover severity and individual drinking behavior. These findings suggest that bodily sensations are a strong component of hangover experiences and may be heightened in individuals at greater risk for problematic use, offering new insight into the somatic processes that underlie vulnerability to alcohol misuse. Our results offer a proof of concept establishing the usefulness and feasibility of body mapping in naturalistic designs. They also underscore its potential as a scalable and intuitive tool to investigate embodied processes in addiction research, where interoceptive dimensions remain underexplored.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric conceptualizations of psychopathology have gained popularity. Most prominent approaches are the common factor (CF) and the symptom network models. A known problem in theory development through empirical findings is the statistical indistinguishability of CF and symptom network models in cross-sectional data. However, the extent of this problem and its implications have not been inspected formally for longitudinal studies. In this study, we sought to clarify the distinguishability between CF and symptom network models in longitudinal designs. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for indistinguishability in covariance for commonly applied vector autoregressive symptom network models and CF models and suggest a procedure for assessing whether a CF model can be refuted based on an estimated symptom network model. We give easy-to-implement R -functions for conducting the comparison. Numerical and empirical examples show that potential indistinguishability is relevant when interpreting the published literature. Overall, this study promotes comparative analysis of symptom network and CF models.",

          "abstract": "Frequently experiencing stress has been linked to detrimental life outcomes such as health problems and reduced quality of life. Interventions that can reduce different aspects of stress are thus of critical practical relevance. Neuroticism is one of the strongest risk factors for stress and recent research has shown that neuroticism can be changed through targeted interventions. Building on these findings, we examined whether a digital neuroticism intervention can reduce stressor occurrence, stressor perception, and stress levels in the general public (N = 461). Combining experience sampling, daily diary, weekly, and monthly assessments, we examined how changes in different aspects of stress unfolded across the intervention period, whether effects differed between treatment groups targeting different levels of neuroticism, and how changes in stress and neuroticism were related to each other. We found significant changes in different aspects of stress across the intervention period, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the first weeks of the intervention. Moreover, intervention groups differed in their effects, providing initial evidence that intervention strategies targeting the state level of neuroticism are most successful to reduce stress. Finally, we found reciprocal transactions between stress and neuroticism across the intervention period, indicating that decreases in both constructs may reinforce each other over time, with robustness checks especially favoring the stress to neuroticism pathway. Taken together, the present study provides evidence for the practical utility of neuroticism interventions and initial insights into the mechanisms of stress and neuroticism change, helping to clarify their theorized relation.",

This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns. We present data from four samples (total n &gt; 950) with a MANOVA design, mirroring the study on which this original claim was based. Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]). These findings challenge the notion of birth order as a significant predictor for romantic jealousy and suggest that research on romantic relationships may yield greater insight by focussing on other individual difference variables than birth order.",

Risk, protective, and contextual factors contributing to the mental health of religious minorities were also mapped from included studies and inform the development of a conceptual framework.\n\nConclusions\nOur systematic review highlights the limited scope and quality of studies examining religious disparities in mental health.

Yet, they remain underutilized in social psychological measurement due to their statistical distributions and sensitivity to varied survey contexts. In a preregistered 2×2 experiment (N = 268 Czech students), we examined the robustness of reaction time modeling (RTM), combining a shifted-lognormal RT component with a graded response model for Likert data, across two common methodological variations: administration mode (online vs. laboratory) and item visualization (single- vs. multiple-item format). Equivalence testing showed that latent trait estimates (θₚ) were practically invariant across all conditions, indicating that RTM is resilient to survey design and platform differences. Complementary eye-tracking and heart rate data revealed that multiple-item formats reduced perceptual and physiological demands, while single-item presentations elicited more intensive visual and pre-decisional processing. These findings demonstrate that RTM provides robust, psychologically meaningful estimates of both latent traits and underlying cognitive processes, supporting flexible survey implementation across contexts. The study also introduces open-source software and modeling tools, lowering barriers for researchers to incorporate reaction time modeling in both laboratory and online environments.",

Method: Existing theoretical models and empirical evidence were examined to propose a comprehensive conceptual framework for conducting studies on feedback in psychotherapy. Results: The proposed framework outlines the main components of the feedback process: routine outcome monitoring system features that may facilitate some ways of use and not others, therapists’ and clients’ engagement with feedback, interpretation of the feedback information, therapists’ cognitive and emotional response to feedback, the therapeutic interventions influenced by feedback, activation of psychological change mechanisms, and treatment outcomes. It also specifies potential therapist-, client-, treatment-, and institution-related factors and summarizes variables that have already received some empirical support or have been theorized to play important roles in the feedback process.

          "abstract": "Simulation studies play a central role in methodological research by providing evidence about the empirical performance of statistical methods. At the same time, they involve substantial researcher degrees of freedom in the choice of data-generating mechanisms, methods, performance measures, and reporting decisions, which can undermine the credibility of their results. Preregistration has been proposed as a tool to increase transparency and reduce such flexibility, yet its role in simulation studies remains contested. In this paper, we discuss why researchers should or should not preregister their simulation studies, elaborating on the theoretical and pragmatic benefits as well as disadvantages of preregistration. Drawing on philosophical accounts, we argue that preregistration primarily reduces epistemic uncertainty about which simulation conditions were considered and why, which enables honest evaluation of whether results support the conclusions drawn. We argue that the resulting benefits depend critically on the aims of a study and its position within the methodological research cycle. Late-phase studies that investigate mature methods tend to benefit more, while early-phase studies investigating newly proposed methods generally benefit less from preregistration. We further discuss practical challenges specific to simulation studies, including the timing of preregistration, the role of preliminary simulations, and safeguards against post hoc registration. Finally, we outline concrete guidance on how to preregister simulation studies and discuss Registered Reports as a particularly promising format. Overall, we argue for a nuanced, purpose-driven use of preregistration that supports rather than hinders methodological progress.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia commonly exhibit debilitating negative symptoms, including avolition and anhedonia, which represent a significant barrier to engagement in goal-directed behaviours, including physical exercise. They are less physically active than the general population, yet physical exercise is known to improve their symptoms. This narrative review investigates the bidirectional relationship between negative symptoms and physical activity. We propose that negative symptoms hinder engagement in physical activity by altering the cost-benefit analysis of exercise. This is exacerbated by deficits in anticipatory pleasure and reward learning, underpinned by dysfunctions within dopaminergic and glutamatergic circuitry which are critical for motivated behavior. We hypothesise that physical exercise can rewire these deficits through enhanced dopamine transmission, modulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, and reduced inflammation. Furthermore, grounded in learning theories and adopting a cognitive-behavioural perspective, this review establishes a theoretical foundation for developing targeted interventions designed to enhance physical activity engagement in this population. We highlight that it is critical to ensure that physical activity is experienced as less effortful and more pleasurable than expected. By generating positive prediction errors (when the experience of exercise is less effortful or more pleasurable than anticipated) exercise helps individuals re-associate it with positive outcomes. Cognitive changes coupled with the biological effects of physical exercise on reward neural pathways are likely to have a synergistic effect, promoting a virtuous cycle of sustained engagement and symptom improvement.",

          "authors": "Silvy Collin; Heja Yakut",
          "abstract": "The distinction between episodic and semantic memory has long been central to theories of autobiographical recall, yet accumulating evidence suggests that this boundary is empirically less clear-cut. Autobiographical remembering is increasingly understood as a constructive process in which episodic and semantic components are dynamically integrated rather than retrieved in isolation. In this review, we adopt the theoretical stance that the relative weighting of episodic and semantic information during recall is flexibly modulated by multiple factors, including age, task demands, temporal distance, emotional salience, and communicative goals. We synthesize findings demonstrating how these factors bias recall toward more episodic or more semantic representations and examine how they interact with one another and with situational context. By outlining these modulating influences, the review aims to better understand the mechanics of the episodic-semantic continuum during autobiographical recall and to clarify implications for how autobiographical memory is studied and interpreted across contexts.",

          "authors": "Melanie Viola Partsch; David Goretzko",
          "abstract": "Evaluating and, if necessary, revising factor-analytic latent measurement models is a challenging task. By now, researchers can select from a toolbox of traditional and novel methods to evaluate global and local model fit. However, this toolbox lacks a method to evaluate model fit at an intermediate level facilitating a thoughtful revision process. In this study, we fill this gap with a machine learning (ML) approach to model fit evaluation. Specifically, we introduce an ML pipeline to classify the type and severity of misspecifications in multi-factorial measurement models. To build this pipeline, we trained three ML models that predict a) if the measurement model is correctly specified or if a latent factor, cross-loadings, factor correlations, or residual correlations have been neglected, b) if any, how many cross-loadings have been neglected, and c) if any, how many residual correlations have been neglected. All three ML models performed well overall, with performance drops mainly resulting from misclassifications by ± 1 cross-loading and ± 1–2 residual correlations, respectively. Consequently, the feedback of the ML pipeline must not be implemented in an exact manner. Instead, it points the user to the most likely source of misfit and indicates if the measurement model is not, mildly, moderately, or severely misspecified. This information provides helpful guidance in deciding if and how to revise the measurement model, the measurement instrument, or its underlying theory. We provide an open-access R implementation of the ML pipeline, discuss how to use it within a multi-method approach, and make recommendations on how to use its feedback for the next revision steps.",

Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services, where users’ choices are shaped by both self-selection and algorithmically personalized recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT using a novel in situ approach and investigated whether variations in self- vs. algorithmically personalized music choices would moderate MMT’s pro-posed relationships between mood and music use. In a preregistered, two-week study, we combined experience sampling surveys with logged music streaming and audio feature metadata obtained via the Spotify API, utilizing 6,864 surveys from 144 listeners. Results largely indicated no support for MMT’s predictions. In addition, higher algorithmic personalization did not reinforce or distort MMT-related patterns.

One important component of the standard undergraduate programme are assignments, where skill development can be assessed and constructive feedback offered to enable students to continue to build upon their skills. In this case study, we submitted the assignments from a three-year Psychology undergraduate programme to ChatGPT using three levels of prompting – basic, intermediate, and advanced – to answer the question, can Gen-AI obtain a psychology bachelor's degree? Responses were reviewed by researchers experienced in assessment marking and deemed as pass or fail. We report on the finding that Gen-AI was capable of successfully passing almost all assessment types. Of 40 individual assessments, 36 were of passing quality. We discuss the implications of this susceptibility, where Gen-AI can be used positively as a learning tool but is simultaneously dangerous when it generates incorrect, but convincing, information. The positive marking approach enables incorrect values or basic formatting to be condoned reducing the desire or need for students to make significant effort to alter the Gen-AI content to evade detection. We recommend that traditional written assessments, where not invigilated, should be adapted either in terms of assignment or marking criteria to adapt to the aforementioned challenges.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models offer powerful means for testing competing theoretical frameworks. A central challenge is determining which model best explains observed data, balancing goodness-of-fit with parsimony. Several fruitful approaches to model comparison have been used in the areas of cognitive and mathematical psychology, but the most popular in practice remain Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) that penalize model complexity as measured by the number of free parameters. Here, we revisit these conventional approaches to model selection on a sample case of the prototype and exemplar models of categorization. We highlight the limitations of parameter count-based complexity measures, showing that they may fail to capture a model’s true flexibility. We then introduce a Monte Carlo permutation testing approach as an alternative that has a rich tradition in many areas, but its use for model selection is still trailing that of AIC/BIC. We demonstrate that permutation testing offers at least three advantages: more robust comparison of models to chance, more robust comparison between models with equal or differing numbers of parameters, and quantification of uncertainty in model selection. After demonstrating how permutation testing offers a more nuanced and principled framework for evaluating cognitive models, we conclude with practical considerations for implementing permutation-based model selection in cognitive modeling research.",

This study investigated developmentally sensitive differentiation in maternal MST during dyadic interactions across two siblings aged 2.5 to 8 years. Using a within-family design, mothers were observed engaging separately with each child using a wordless picture book, allowing for direct comparison of maternal talk across siblings. Mothers demonstrated less verbosity, proportionally fewer perception terms and proportionally more cognition terms during interactions with older compared to younger siblings. Moreover, maternal adjustment in cognition term use across siblings was associated with developmental differences in theory of mind understanding, but not age, language, or IQ, suggesting maternal linguistic sensitivity to each child’s unique social-cognitive capabilities. This study highlights how maternal MST is dynamically shaped by the real-time needs and capacities of each child in the family system.",

          "abstract": "Children’s exposure to Mental state language (MSL) has implications for their social, emotional and cognitive developmental outcomes. Although parental MSL is found to vary as a function of child gender, gender differences in children’s MSL exposure are yet to be considered in the early childhood education and care (ECEC) context. This study examined whether changes in the gender composition of child-groups was associated with educators’ use of MSL during centre-scheduled playtime within toddler classrooms. We analysed educators’ MSL content types (perception, desires, emotion, cognition) across 182 interactional episodes with 13 educators. Results indicated that educators used more perception terms when the proportion of boys increased, and more desire terms when the proportion of girls increased. No significant associations were found for emotion, cognition, or overall MSL. Considering the developmental trajectory and functionality of children’s exposure to MSL content subtypes, these findings suggest that educators systematically change their language so that girls receive developmentally more advanced MSL content than boys at the same age. Given the established role of MSL in children’s social-emotional and cognitive outcomes, these findings have implications for ECEC policy and educator training. Addressing gender-related variation in children’s MSL exposure may help ensure equitable opportunity for language-mediated development in early childhood settings. \n\nKeywords: mental state language, early childhood education and care, toddlers, gender, socialisation",

          "abstract": "Children are adept statistical learners, capable of parsing streams of structured input into meaningful units, but the cognitive processes they engage during learning may differ from those of adults. To date, however, it is unclear how learners of different ages predict upcoming experience when navigating environments with complex structure, as well as how changes in predictive learning mechanisms influence structured knowledge acquisition. To address this question, we tested 106 children, adolescents, and adults, ages 8 - 22 years, on a predictive learning task, in which they experienced sequences of stimuli with a higher-order temporal structure. After an initial learning phase, participants’ explicit knowledge of the relations between stimuli was probed via two additional task measures. We used a recently introduced computational model to characterize participants’ response times during learning, and found that all participants relied on simple, recency-based prediction, anticipating that they would encounter stimuli they recently encountered in the past. With increasing age, however, participants demonstrated greater evidence of additionally relying on a more sophisticated learning mechanism, which captured a predictive representation of the conditional relations between stimuli. Though predictive learning changed with age, we found only weak evidence that these changes related to the acquisition of explicit knowledge of the environment. Our results suggest that the learning mechanisms through which people parse continuous streams of experience change with age, influencing their predictions about upcoming events.",

All assessments were performed on LLMs without human interaction. Our results revealed concrete strengths and shortcomings of LLMs to engage in teaming behaviours. LLMs performed well on tasks usually executed in action phases of teamwork, where a team engages in specific work tasks such as monitoring and coordination to meet team goals. In contrast, LLMs lacked the abstract reasoning and planning required to meet transition phases of teamwork. These phases are critical for self-reflection of past performance and planning for upcoming tasks in teamwork. Finally, LLMs displayed unique performance during interpersonal aspects of teamwork, predominately applying an integrating motivational style but failing to acknowledge negative emotional states of teammates. These findings reveal how contemporary LLMs may contribute to contemporary human-AI teams as team members and highlight the utility of experimental psychology in elucidating behaviours of non-embodied agents.",

Latent profile analysis was conducted in a representative community sample (N=1,200) using three apathy dimensions assessed by the Apathy Motivation Index (behavioral, social, emotional). Identified profiles were compared on social and occupational functioning, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), depression, and anhedonia, with additional analyses adjusting for affective symptoms. Demographic predictors of profile membership were examined using exploratory logistic regression. \nA two-profile solution provided the best fit, reflecting differences in overall apathy severity rather than qualitatively distinct subtypes. The elevated apathy profile (17.2% of the sample) showed significantly higher levels of PLEs (p&lt;.001) and poorer functioning in activities, work-related skills, and social appropriateness (all ps&lt;.001). Interpersonal relationship functioning was higher in this profile (p&lt;.001). Most profile differences remained significant after controlling for depressive symptoms and anhedonia. Younger age was robustly associated with elevated apathy profile membership (OR=0.98, 95% CI [0.95, 0.98]).\nOverall, apathy in the general population appears best understood as a severity-based motivational vulnerability with domain-specific functional consequences and relevance for psychosis-spectrum traits.",

We examined what GPCs phonics programs teach and how those GPCs support a child’s ability to pronounce written words to understand how to create an optimized phonics program. We compared three phonics programs, Jolly Phonics, Letters and Sounds, and Read Write Inc., in terms of how well their GPCs enabled the decoding (pronunciation) of a naturalistic child vocabulary. Decodability was measured through an algorithm that simulates how many words can be decoded with each GPC taught. We quantified decodability in different ways to probe the potential impact of teaching GPCs that create ambiguity, either because the same letter(s) map to different phonemes, or because a more complex grapheme involving several letters subsumes letter(s) from simpler GPCs. Teaching more GPCs increases the number of words that can be decoded, although there are diminishing returns to teaching more rules given the cost in terms of instructional time. Moreover, teaching larger sets of GPCs can introduce GPCs that create ambiguity, which empirical studies show can negatively impact learning. We also use our algorithm to identify additional GPCs that could improve the potential effectiveness of existing programs. Our work provides targeted guidance pertaining to the factors that need to be considered in designing an optimized phonics program. It also offers an algorithm that can facilitate phonics program design and pinpoints empirical research needed to advance towards an optimized set of GPCs.",

Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

Cueing episodic future thinking (EFT) by tagging inter-temporal choice trials with hypothetical future events reliably increases future-oriented choices in younger adults, but its effects in older adults are unclear. In a sample of 100 adults across the lifespan, we found that EFT-cueing trials led to more future-oriented choices in younger adults, consistent with the extant literature, no choice differences in middle-aged adults, and fewer future-oriented choices in older adults. These findings suggest that EFT-cueing may not be an effective strategy to promote savings for all ages. Our design used common events for all subjects which allowed us to examine the relationship between events, finding that across age, cueing with rare, positive, and intense events led to more present-oriented choices, but may have limited our power compared to personally-relevant events.",

Prediction and prevention of suicidal ideation (SI) remain challenging, largely because traditional approaches have focused less on individual variability in its moment-to-moment fluctuations. To address this gap, we examined how group-level network models capture average dynamic associations over time, while person-specific networks reveal individual deviations in both contemporaneous and time-lagged relationships, clarifying how changes in cognitive or emotional states precede within-person changes and subsequent fluctuations in SI, particularly in relation to perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and hopelessness.\nMethods. Twenty-four psychiatric inpatients (75% female, mean age = 33.6, SD = 10.7) completed ecological momentary assessments (five prompts/day) for 28 days post-discharge, reporting passive and active SI, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and\nhopelessness. Data were analyzed using Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) to derive group- and individual-level networks.\nResults. Group-level GIMME networks showed contemporaneous and lagged connections between passive and active SI. Individual-level GIMME networks showed that for 30.4% of individuals, hopelessness mediated the link between interpersonal risk factors, passive, and active SI.\nConclusion. By identifying both shared and person-specific temporal pathways, these findings highlight the value of dynamic, idiographic assessment strategies for advancing precision psychiatry in suicide prevention.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their belief that speech can cause lasting psychological harm. We present the ten-item Words Can Harm Scale (WCHS) as a valid and reliable measure of this belief. Items assess attitudes about harmful speech (e.g., \"Vulnerable people should not be exposed to certain kinds of speech, as this might harm them\") and written words (e.g., \"I could be left emotionally scarred by something I read\"). In a representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = .92) and robust two-week test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. People with higher WCHS scores rated themselves as higher in intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. They were also more likely to support political correctness and endorse trigger warnings and safe spaces. People who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of words—a divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

          "abstract": "Feminization and safetyism are increasingly debated in public, but the underlying decision-making processes remain unexplained. This study examines orientation towards herds (normativity/safety) versus packs (hierarchical cooperation) using ipsative dilemmas (N = 351), integrating life history theory and feminist, social, and personality perspectives, differentiating by sex, personality, and milieu (wealth, education, politics, city size). Women showed stronger herd orientation than men, especially poor heterosexual female students; poor right-wing men showed strongest pack-orientation. Stability aspects (compassion, orderliness) predicted herds, while the Dark Tetrad traits predicted packs. Interactions between sex and milieu challenged ideological explanations with women’s herd tendency persisting across contexts and men’s pack orientation showing strategic flexibility. Life history theory best explained patterns: protection, safety, and normative decisions in women versus risk-taking in men to gain status. Micro-level sex differences may extend to institutional security trends, warranting replications to test macro-level effects.",

          "abstract": "Classic estimation of structural equation modeling (SEM) relies on explicit, closed-form derivatives and Newton-type optimizers like BFGS that use both gradient and curvature information. Although effective in many contexts, this approach can become unstable with small samples, model misspecification, or poor measurement quality. A more recent framework, computational-graph SEM (cgSEM), recasts SEM in a graph-based form with automatic differentiation and adaptive optimizers from deep learning, like Adam, that operate on gradients only. cgSEM’s original work showed that it could reproduce results from classic SEM. However, this equivalence was achieved by using Adam with strict, precision-based stopping rules, similar to those used in many classic SEM implementations, despite Adam being developed with stability-oriented optimization in mind. Thus, it remains unclear how cgSEM performs when Adam is used as intended. We compare classic SEM and cgSEM under maximum likelihood estimation, letting each implement its natural optimization strategy. In simulations, cgSEM showed higher admissible-solution rates and lower small-sample bias under challenging conditions, whereas classic SEM was consistently faster and showed lower large-sample bias with weak indicators. Ultimately, no single approach fits all; framework choice should be guided by the modeling context and which approach is more likely to yield usable results.",

          "abstract": "Does merely knowing that one will engage in conversation with an AI versus a real human differentially evoke anticipatory anxiety? Here we tested this question experimentally by asking participants to report their anticipatory anxiety and experiential expectations prior to engaging in each of two conversations: one with real humans and another with LLM-powered AI agents, with both held through the same real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech interface. Then, to evaluate how outcomes aligned with expectations, participants reported their actual experiences following each conversation. Results revealed significantly lower anxiety in anticipation of a conversation with AI partners compared to human partners, though this effect only emerged after initial novelty subsided. Strikingly, participants underestimated the hedonic favorability of AI conversations, ultimately liking them and feeling better after them than the human conversations in spite of relatively similar expectations. These findings support the notion that anxiety in anticipation of social interaction is substantially evoked by being perceived by another human, rather than the act of conversation itself. As social AI agents become pervasive across social domains, understanding the similarities and differences in the ways we relate to them will be important for maximizing the benefits they can provide and minimizing their potential for harm.",

          "abstract": "Scientific consensus messaging is among the most widely studied and cited approaches in climate change communication. Research consistently shows that scientific consensus messages (“97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening”) reduce misperceptions and enable climate change attitudes that reflect the scientific evidence. A concern, however, is that the effects of this and similar consensus messages may reflect memory and experimenter demand effects rather than genuine misperception correction. In this brief empirical note, we outline several theoretical arguments and reanalyze two large-scale secondary datasets from the United States (n = 6,301; van der Linden et al., 2019) and 27 countries (n = 7,000; Većkalov, Geiger et al., 2024), providing evidence that misperception correction following scientific consensus messages is unlikely to be driven by memory and experimenter demand effects alone. First, we show that consensus messaging reduces misperceptions compared to a control condition, even in the highly unlikely scenario that every post-test response at or near 97% reflects memory or experimenter demand effects. Second, we demonstrate that participants report being more persuaded by the scientific consensus message and update their personal beliefs slightly more when they indicate consensus estimates of 97% (vs. a different number) in the post-test. If the ‘97%’ responses were primarily driven by memory effects, we would expect the opposite pattern. Overall, scientific consensus messaging recalibrates scientific consensus perceptions and important attitudes, regardless of whether individuals report exactly 97% at post-test–reinforcing the importance of perceived scientific consensus as a ‘gateway’ belief to evidence-based climate change attitudes.",

          "authors": "Mike Hammes; Maleen Ritter; Timo Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "This study examines the relationships between mental toughness, sport satisfaction and job satisfaction, focusing on job satisfaction as the output-variable. We define mental toughness as a latent construct comprising grit and self-control, reflecting the psychological capacity to maintain goal pursuit and resilience across different life domains. Conservation of Resources Theory emphasizes that personal resources acquired in one domain, such as sport, can be transferred to another, such as work. Considering mental toughness as a personal resource, this framework suggests two competing mediational hypotheses: sports satisfaction transfers to job satisfaction through mental toughness (H1) or mental toughness promotes sport satisfaction, which in turn increases job satisfaction (H2). Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, self-reported data from N = 196 employed individuals were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Results supported hypothesis H1, showing a significant indirect effect (β = .20, p &lt; .01) of sport satisfaction on job satisfaction through mental toughness. In contrast, testing for hypothesis H2, we did not find an indirect effect between mental toughness and job satisfaction through sport satisfaction (β = .01, p = .85). The findings provide cross-sectional support for the resource-transfer mechanism proposed by COR, demonstrating how common variance of satisfaction in recreational sport and at work is statistically explained by mental toughness. Practically, the results highlight the value of promoting recreational sport participation first and mental training in organizations second to enhance employee satisfaction and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Music can be a powerful tool for evoking emotions and memories in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is commonly used in dementia care. Previous research suggests that memories evoked by music tend to vary depending on the experienced valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant) of the songs, show a reminiscence bump (RB) for events from mid-childhood/adolescence, and are linked to certain musical features, such as rhythm, in healthy older adults, but little is known about factors underlying music-evoked memories in AD. In the present study, we used a combination of behavioural ratings of emotional valence, familiarity, and autobiographical salience and musical features analyzed using music information retrieval (MIR) from 70 excerpts of traditional folk songs and popular music from 1950s to 1970s in healthy older adults (n = 40) and persons with mild (n = 29) and moderate/severe (n = 32) dementia to explore how emotional and memory experience of music, valence dependency of musical memories as well as the temporal gradient of the RB and predictive musical features of musical memories change from healthy ageing to advanced AD dementia. Compared to healthy older adults, we observed lower familiarity and autobiographical salience but comparable valence in the AD groups as well as increasingly linear relationship between valence and familiarity and autobiographical salience with advancing AD. Also the temporal gradient (RB) became steeper with advancing AD, peaking earlier in childhood. From musical features, less complex harmonicity predicted higher autobiographical salience and less strong pulse predicted higher familiarity across groups, but this latter relationship showed stronger valence dependency in AD. In conclusion, our findings provide novel insights on how factors associated with music-evoked memories change in the progression of AD, showing differential relationships from healthy ageing to advanced AD. The results can be beneficial in dementia care by helping in individualizing music interventions.",

          "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have lasting consequences for adult romantic relationships, yet dyadic studies of ACEs typically default to distinguishing couples by gender. We argue that this methodological convention may obscure theoretically meaningful trauma-related dynamics. In this study, we compared Actor–Partner Interdependence Models (APIMs) distinguished by gender versus ACE history using data from 202 Canadian couples (N = 404). Couples reported on ACEs, perceived partner responsiveness (PPR) and insensitivity, and sexual satisfaction. When distinguished by gender, models replicated prior literature, yielding strong actor effects for both men and women but small or inconsistent partner effects. By contrast, ACE-distinguished models showed that actor and partner associations localized to the ACE-exposed partner: higher PPR predicted greater sexual satisfaction for both themselves and their non-exposed partners, while greater insensitivity predicted lower satisfaction for both partners. No significant effects were observed for non-exposed partners. We argue that distinguishing dyads by ACE status broadens opportunities for inclusive research, tests of dyadic measurement assumptions, and theory-driven insights into how early adversity reverberates through intimate relationships.",

          "abstract": "Response time and other forms of process data are increasingly incorporated into psychometric models. A frequently overlooked challenge is that response time is often treated as exogenous, even though time use plausibly depends on latent ability. This paper investigates how causal relationships among ability, response time, and response accuracy can bias parameter estimation when conditioning directly on observed time or accuracy without modeling how time is generated. Using causal graphs, we show that when response time depends on latent ability, conditioning on response time can bias both item and person parameter estimates, while conditioning on accuracy can induce spurious associations between time and ability. Simulation results under an explicit data-generating process demonstrate that naive one-step estimation treating response time as exogenous yields systematic distortion in item parameter estimates. To address this problem, we propose a two-step estimation strategy that first estimates ability from response accuracy alone and then fits a time-augmented item response model conditional on these estimates. This approach substantially reduces estimation bias. An empirical analysis of TIMSS data provides evidence of endogeneity in response times and illustrates both the risks of naive conditioning and the value of diagnostic analyses based on structured patterns of time use.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thought is often considered an unconstrained, internally generated mode of thinking that is independent of the present perceptual environment, making it difficult to study empirically. However, recent accounts have raised the possibility that the generation and content of spontaneous thought can be shaped by even weak perceptual constraints. We leveraged this new perspective to develop a novel approach using music, a ubiquitous stimulus that permeates our everyday environments, as a window into the mechanisms supporting spontaneous thought content. Adults spanning four age groups listened to music from ten different genres and completed the open-ended task of writing descriptions of any thoughts that arose. By applying natural language processing analysis to the spontaneous thought descriptions, we found that thoughts sustained while hearing music from the same genre shared greater semantic similarity than those sustained while hearing music from different genres, and participants from the same age group experienced more similar thoughts than those from different age groups. Properties that varied naturally with genre, including the music’s auditory features, expressed emotions, and contextual associations, all contributed significantly to explaining the greater semantic similarity of thoughts within genres. These results demonstrate that spontaneous thought is jointly shaped by perceptual and experiential constraints, opening new avenues for understanding when and why particular thoughts come to mind, with implications for creativity and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making depends on where attention is allocated and what information is sampled. Although attention plays a critical role in choice, its investigation has largely been limited to overt eye movements, leaving the contribution of covert attention unclear. Here, we combine an attentional probe with value-based choice to directly measure how covert attention is allocated to peripheral options during decision-making. We identify two fundamental features of the attention-choice relationship. First, attention and value interact bidirectionally: option value biases the allocation of covert attention, while covert attention in turn alters value representations and choice. Second, covert and overt attention exert dissociable – and competing – influences on choice behaviour. By demonstrating that attentional influences on decision-making extend beyond eye gaze, our findings challenge current gaze-based accounts of choice, and motivate decision-making models that incorporate covert attentional mechanisms alongside overt attentional dynamics.",

This case series comprises 17 consecutive patients previously diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia based on clinical and neurophysiological evaluations, all of whom underwent psychological and psychometric evaluations.\nResults: Two-thirds of patients met criteria for complex post-traumatic stress disorder. \nConclusions: This case series suggests that some cases of pathological hypersomnolence might be associated with traumatic disorders. Hypersomnolence may represent a response to traumatic memories, particularly in patients with complex traumatic histories, such as childhood abuse. The small sample size (n=17) limits the generalizability of the findings.

In the task, participants make judgements about the\nsimilarity of predefined concepts of interest which are presented in triads.

Adding more concepts\nto a triads task design quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion of trials, which can make the\ntriads task inefficient.

We employed a triads task with\nconcepts from the topical domains of Open Science and digitization and examined how well\nsimilarity scores calculated from the complete triads task design and from reduced designs were\ncorrelated as a marker of correspondence. Reducing the underlying concept pool and thereby the\nnumber of trials in the triads task led to highly correlated similarity scores but is less efficient in\nreducing the number of trials than balanced incomplete block designs. Similarity scores from the\nbalanced incomplete block designs were highly correlated with those from the complete designs\nand higher compared to the correlations of similarity scores from split-half designs and the\ncomplete designs.

The experimental group viewed videos depicting risky driving behaviors and traffic accidents, whereas the control group viewed videos that were emotionally neutral. Perceived risk was assessed both pre- and post-intervention using a behavioral risk perception task that featured naturalistic driving scenarios. Participants in the experimental group showed a significant increase in perceived risk following the intervention, but no significant change was observed in the control group. Signal Detection Theory analyses indicated that these changes resulted from a modification in the decision threshold.

Perceived stress was assessed pre-post SPB and at no-exercise control times. Vagally-mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) as an indicator of stress-related physiology (cardiac vagal activity) was assessed before, during and after SPB or control times. Perception of SPB as natural was assessed after exercises.\nResults: Per protocol Generalized Estimating Equations showed SPB lowered perceived stress compared to control times. vmHRV was higher during and after SPB compared to before but did not significantly differ from control times. When participants perceived SPB as more natural, perceived stress reduction was greater.  \nConclusion: SPB may help to immediately reduce perceived stress and increase vmHRV in daily life. Finding ways to ensure that SPB feels natural seems important to increase effectiveness in future stress management interventions.",

          "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a technique for the monitoring of cardiac signals using simple consumer-grade cameras, such as webcams. Its cost-effectiveness and accessibility make it a promising tool for widespread application, particularly in remote and resource-limited research settings. Yet, it remains unclear whether rPPG can accurately capture the moment-to-moment fluctuations in heart rate (HR) required for robust HR variability (HRV) estimation. In this study, we collected a novel dataset of 77 participants who completed three behavioral tasks under controlled laboratory conditions, designed to mirror the recording setup typically encountered in home-based online experiments. We validated four rPPG pipeline configurations against the electrocardiogram (ECG) ground truth, using a comprehensive set of measures capturing both signal quality and cardiac variability. Moreover, using data from an emotion anticipation task, we assessed whether, in a typical experimental setting, analyses based on rPPG data yielded statistical results comparable to those obtained from ECG. Our results indicate that rPPG is a promising tool for detecting HR and HRV at the group level, particularly in high-powered studies. At the individual level, rPPG reliably captures average HR, but the accuracy of individual-level HRV estimates remain limited. The findings underscore rPPG’s potential as a low-cost, non-invasive research tool, while highlighting the importance of managing its limitations such as sensitivity to excessive movement and poor illumination through thoughtful study planning and execution.",

          "abstract": "Understanding abstract phenomena is a fundamental human need. Emerging evidence increasingly points to the multidimensionality of abstract knowledge representations, with theories emphasising the importance of both embodied and linguistic influences. In the present paper, we argue that the strength with which embodiment shapes the representation of abstract concepts is moderated by cultural beliefs about ontological meaning. Specifically, we predicted that self-identified spirituality—a belief system guided by experiential approach to understanding reality—contributes to greater sensorimotor grounding of abstract concepts. As hypothesised, across 4 studies (N = 729; in the US and UK), Western spiritual beliefs involved stronger sensorimotor associations for highly abstract compared to concrete concepts. Importantly, religious beliefs that conceptually overlap with spirituality did not contribute to these associations. Further, as spiritual beliefs often involve greater rejection of external forms of knowledge, we also explored whether sensorimotor grounding predicted science rejection. Yet, these results were inconclusive. Altogether, individual differences in belief systems guide the mental representation of abstract concepts, with spiritual individuals likely feeling the meaning of words through linking abstract thought with bodily experiences.",

Participants were 297 females (ages 8-14 at baseline) who were majority White and completed four visits spaced 2-3 years apart. Electroencephalography recorded the LPP while participants viewed neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant images. Multilevel modeling tested the impact of age, emotion condition, and electrode site, as well as links to internalizing symptoms. Results showed that emotion modulation of the LPP decreased with age at Oz and Pz but not Cz, most rapidly in late childhood and early adolescence. Age effects were strongest at Oz, while emotion effects were strongest at Pz at younger ages and both Pz and Cz at later ages. Higher internalizing symptoms were associated with a blunted LPP to pleasant images in childhood and early adolescence. Findings indicate the LPP declines rapidly through early adolescence before relative stabilization. Reduced occipital activity may reflect redistribution of emotion-attention networks toward greater frontal dominance during later adolescence.",

          "abstract": "Negative perceptions of scientists represent a pressing societal challenge thwarting public acceptance of evidence-based solutions to global crises and emergencies. Integrating work on intergroup similarity and psychological distance to science, we experimentally test whether highlighting similarities between scientists and perceivers promotes favourable perceptions and trust in scientists across three experiments (N = 1189). We predicted that matching (similarity) versus mismatching (dissimilarity) scientists’ socio-demographic profiles to those of participants would lead to more positive judgements and increased trust in scientists. We found support for these predictions when participants compared multiple scientist profiles (Studies 1 &amp; 3), but not when evaluating a single scientist profile (Study 2). Overall, the current findings suggest that highlighting similarities between scientists and the public represents a novel and beneficial way for promoting favourable perceptions of experts.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of the study was to examine the intrapersonal, everyday connections between the dimensions of aggression (internalizing and externalizing) that characterize individuals' everyday experiences. The study also aimed to assess the impact of internalizing aggression (anger and hostility) on externalizing aggression (physical aggression and verbal aggression) and vice versa.\nMethod: The study included 317 participants from Poland. Participants gave an average of 24.83 responses, resulting in a total of k = 7871 observations. Items from the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were used to measure the four dimensions of aggression. To examine the daily dynamics of aggression, we used dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM).\nResults: Externalizing aggression was found to be positively related to internalizing aggression at both the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. Our study also confirmed our hypothesis that an increase in internalizing aggression one day predicts higher levels of externalizing aggression the next day.\nConclusion: Our study provided unique insight into assessing the relationship between internalizing aggression (hostility and anger) and externalizing aggression (verbal aggression and physical aggression). Finally, the integration of our research with Wilkowski and Robinson's theory is pointed out.",

          "abstract": "Ruffalo argues that borderline personality disorder (BPD) meets Robins and Guze criteria for diagnostic validity and should be retained as a legitimate psychiatric diagnosis. This response challenges that conclusion, arguing that mid twentieth century biomedical validation models are inadequate for evaluating a construct that regulates identity, relationality, and social deviance. Although BPD may satisfy traditional validators, this does not establish epistemic soundness, ethical defensibility, or clinical legitimacy. Drawing on feminist, decolonial, neurodiversity, and lived experience-led scholarship, this analysis highlights diagnostic circularity, structural harm, and the exclusion of lived experience evidence. Validity without legitimacy is insufficient for mental health care.",

          "authors": "Chris Ludlow; Armita Zarnegar",
          "abstract": "Case formulation plays a central role in psychological therapy, yet its narrative form limits empirical analysis and digital integration. This paper develops a theoretical framework that treats formulation as a structured representation of causal cognition—a generative process linking clinical observations to explanatory hypotheses. Drawing on advances in large language models (LLMs) and graph-based methods, it outlines a conceptual workflow for converting clinical text into machine-readable causal graphs constrained by psychological ontologies. The paper is conceptual in nature and employs simple worked examples to demonstrate how LLMs can identify causal information within narrative formulations and convert it into structured graphs. Within this framework, deep-learning semantic-similarity methods and graph-comparison metrics such as the Jaccard index—implemented in R—serve as illustrative demonstrations of how researchers might begin exploring causal representations using accessible tools, with more advanced graph-learning techniques offering promising directions for future work. Given the stochastic nature of LLMs and the evolving character of clinical reasoning, the aim is not traditional reliability testing but the development of representational principles that approximate clinicians’ explanatory models. Future systems may implement this interactively, prompting clinicians to confirm whether their reasoning has been accurately represented diagrammatically, thereby maintaining alignment between human judgement and its computational depiction. The paper’s contribution is therefore conceptual rather than empirical, offering foundational representational principles and a roadmap for integrating LLMs, graph analytics, and visual interfaces to support clinical reasoning, digital formulation tools, and the development of computational theories of psychological formulation.",

          "abstract": "How does long-term memory (LTM) support working memory (WM) performance? Proposed mechanisms include boosting, where LTM enhances WM representations through additional activation, but does not reduce WM load; chunking, where WM holds references to LTM, reducing WM load; and offloading, where LTM substitutes active maintenance in WM. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA) during an alternative forced-choice WM task, in which some trials (varying in memory array set size) included a pre-learnt color-object binding. The CDA is a well-established neural correlate that indexes the amount of information actively stored in WM, allowing us to test between the three accounts by examining whether including pre-learnt bindings in a memory set of a given size reduced its amplitude compared to maintaining entirely new bindings.\nOverall, our findings supported the boosting account. Pre-learnt bindings improved performance for matching items in WM, but the benefit did not extend to newly encoded items, indicating no reduction in WM load. CDA amplitude increased with set size irrespective of whether the items were pre-learnt or new, reflecting active maintenance of all the to-be-remembered items. Overall, these results show that pre-learnt associations in LTM can boost WM performance without substituting for WM storage, providing evidence against offloading or chunking accounts in this context.",

This commentary argues that such framings are incomplete because they treat stigma as incidental and overlook the structural, epistemic, and iatrogenic harms associated with the BPD construct. Drawing on lived experience research, analyses of epistemic injustice, and evidence of harm arising from standard treatments such as dialectical behaviour therapy, I argue that BPD functions as a credibility-damaging and identity-eroding diagnosis rather than a neutral clinical descriptor. I further situate BPD within psychiatry’s historical regulation of gender and sexual nonconformity, highlighting its disproportionate impact on marginalised populations. Any meaningful discussion of CPTSD–BPD differentiation must therefore move beyond symptom overlap to address power, harm, and whose knowledge is permitted to shape psychiatric classification.",

In this study, we used resting-state fMRI in 148 university students to identify intrinsic network signatures associated with PEB and to test self-regulation as a mechanistic pathway. Whole-brain functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping showed that individual differences in PEB were associated with FCD in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region implicated in inhibitory control. Follow-up seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses further indicated that functional coupling between the IFG and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was associated with PEB. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that trait self-regulation accounted for a substantial portion of both brain–PEB associations. Together, these findings provide a resting-state network account of PEB and highlight self-regulation as a central pathway through which intrinsic brain organization relates to PEB.",

We provide a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how {rix} can be used to define, build, and share isolated, project-specific software environments that precisely capture R versions, package dependencies, system libraries, and integrated development environments. We further illustrate this workflow by reproducing a complete manuscript using Quarto and the {apaquarto} extension, showing how analyses, figures, and text can be regenerated in a single, executable pipeline. Together, these tools lower the technical barrier to robust, end-to-end reproducibility and offer a scalable solution for simulation studies and methodological research in psychology and related fields.",

Critically, the attitude-behavior gap manifested primarily at the attitude-intention stage rather than the intention-behavior stage. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that neuroticism strongly predicted inconsistent profile membership, whereas conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness predicted membership in higher-consistency profiles. These findings clarify where attitude-behavior gaps occur and demonstrate that personality traits systematically differentiate consistent versus inconsistent environmental engagement patterns.",

These alterations appear to be related to alcohol use patterns. This study aims to systematically review voxel-based morphometry studies to identify consistent patterns of gray matter and white matter alterations in patients with AUD compared to healthy control subject and explore their associations with alcohol consumption patterns. A systematic review of neuroimaging studies was conducted, analyzing gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) differences between healthy individuals and patients with AUD. Special attention was given to the relationship between alcohol consumption variables (e.g., duration, quantity, frequency) and GM and WM volumes. AUD patients showed significant GM alterations in the right cingulate (SDM-Z = -6.013), right insula (SDM-Z = -6.088) and left Heschl gyrus (SDM-Z = -5.254) compared to healthy control subject. WM alterations were found in the corpus callosum (SDM-Z = -3.537). Meta-regressions revealed dose-dependent associations: AUDIT scores (SDM-Z = -3.143), drinks/day (SDM-Z = -3.504), lifetime drinking (SDM-Z = 3.460), and years of dependence (SDM-Z = 3.063) were each negatively correlated with regional GM volume. Earlier age at first drink was associated with WM volume in the corpus callosum (SDM-Z = 3.229). Longer abstinence was correlated with larger WM volumes. This meta-analysis underscores the associations between alcohol consumption patterns and brain structure and provides evidence of dose-dependent associations between alcohol consumption and neuroanatomical differences.",

In Study 1 (n = 224), adolescents completed a battery of six laboratory EF tasks; task-based EF showed little evidence of reliable associations with PEB, with only a small and non-robust link for trail-making performance. In Study 2 (n = 465), adolescents completed validated self-report measures of everyday EF; all three EF components correlated with PEB, but only inhibition and cognitive flexibility uniquely predicted PEB when modeled simultaneously, and these effects remained after controlling for demographics and the Big Five personality traits. Overall, typical everyday EF (especially inhibition and cognitive flexibility), as indexed by self-report, showed stronger and unique associations with everyday PEB than did optimal EF performance on laboratory tasks. Reducing demands on inhibition and cognitive flexibility in everyday choice environments may help promote adolescent PEB.",

Unlike more traditional EEG-measures of attention, NET considers where attention is directed to by correlating the teacher’s voice with the EEG-decoded stimulus. EEG data were collected while participants (n = 30) watched a video lecture on neuromyths that included attention manipulations (e.g., distraction, enhancement). Participants also provided self-reported attention ratings and completed a performance test on its content.

          "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed a positive association between self-control (SC) and pro-environmental behaviors (PEB). However, most of these studies have relied primarily on cross-sectional designs, thus limiting knowledge regarding the dynamic relationship between SC and PEB over time. The present study addresses this gap by adopting a longitudinal approach. In Study 1, SC and PEB were measured across two waves among 221 Chinese high school students. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) revealed that SC predicted subsequent PEB. In Study 2, SC and PEB were measured across three waves among 1,286 Chinese university students. The CLPMs replicated the findings of Study 1, demonstrating rank-order cross-lagged effects of SC on PEB. More importantly, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) revealed that SC was positively associated with PEB at the between-person level, such that individuals with higher SC exhibited greater PEB. However, no cross-lagged effects emerged at the within-person level, suggesting that changes in an individual's SC do not directly alter their PEB. These findings indicate that while SC is a stable trait associated with individual differences in PEB, naturally occurring SC fluctuations may not drive short-term behavioral change, highlighting the potential value of exploring strategies that minimize reliance on SC capacity or resources and considering SC as a criterion for selecting individuals for key environmental roles.",

          "abstract": "Nonhuman animals are relational, sentient, and existential beings, who form bonds with conspecifics, respond to others, and engage in meaningful relations with humans. They possess capacities for suffering, learning, and affective responses. They live as situated and embodied, who are vulnerable, finite, and encounter threat, fear, and loss. These features position nonhuman animals differently from purely ecological or biological entities, while situating them in close proximity to human existence and the social world. Individuals, therefore, need to maintain relations with nonhuman animals. When humans become relationally disconnected from them, however, nonhuman animals are not recognized as subject of experience, and are instead reduced to objects of exclusion, domination, and exploitation. The alienation from nonhuman animals, in turn, results in possible relational disconnection from other domains, particularly the social world. \nThe present conceptual work challenges contemporary anthropocentric models of theoretical frameworks, focusing on the being-in-the-world model. It critically reviews theoretical conceptualizations of human existence in both existential philosophy and existential psychology. It integrates empirical works adapted from existential psychology research and social psychology studies. The human-animal relational world of existence, in turn, is brought into view to redefine the largely ignored animal existence conceptualization within psychology. Nonhuman animals, therefore, are conceptualized as relational others, and are proposed to be incorporated into the model of being-in-the-world. In doing so, the model offers a more comprehensive understanding of human existence, while recognizing nonhuman animals as subjects of experience, capable of suffering, cognition, and relation.",

          "abstract": "Traits are the currency of personality psychology and social cognition, helping us understand and represent both real and perceived differences between people and groups. Here, we advance our understanding of trait language by revealing new insights into the content, structure, and evolution of trait words using large language models (LLM) and human raters. Across four studies, we: (a) introduce one of the most comprehensive trait lists to-date (2,847 trait words); (b) establish normative human ratings of these traits (from N = 3,070 English speakers) along 24 dimensions from past literature; (c) detect a four-factor structure of Fitness, Agency, Communion, and Traditionalism (FACT) from these dimensions; and (d) reveal systematic differences in the coherence, valence, and historical evolution of these dimensions and factors. Specifically, we find that the FACT model covers 96% of trait words. Moreover, these four factors differ in their coherence (e.g., Communion is the most semantic coherent while Traditionalism the least), valence (e.g., Communion and Agency show more alignment between their semantic direction and valence than Traditionalism and Fitness; Communion has more negative words while Agency and Traditionalism more positive ones); and historical usage (e.g., Fitness and Communion are older than Traditionalism; Communion is converging in semantic space while Agency diverging). These findings showcase new LLM-based methods for discovering and analyzing trait words. We close by motivating a functional constructivist view in which trait concepts are tools for social evaluation, shaped by the recurrent social interaction problems they help solve, and organized accordingly in semantic structure and use.",

          "abstract": "Story reading is often accompanied with mental visualization of the described scenes and events. Recent findings indicate that individuals who report not experiencing any visual imagery (a condition called aphantasia), also report being less absorbed and engaged when reading stories. In the present study, we explored how aphantasics (n = 8) and controls (n = 20) read imagery-rich stories. We recorded eye movements while participants were reading two short stories and analyzed fixation patterns in relation to the stories’ imagery content. We observed that imagery content influenced gaze fixation similarly in both groups. More specifically, under perceptual imagery, which involves sensory-rich content, the influence was the strongest, resulting in longer fixation durations during reading of the relevant words and phrases. Despite the same fixation patterns on imagery content, aphantasics reported experiencing less immersion in the stories. Furthermore, we tentatively observed that in control subjects, longer fixation duration on perceptual imagery content was correlated with higher experienced mental imagery, whereas in aphantasic individuals, this relationship did not hold and was even reversed. While our sample size is limited, our results may align with the account that imagery under aphantasia may be nonconscious rather than nonexistent. Given that only reported subjective experiences differed under aphantasia, the condition may primarily impair introspective access to mental images.",

          "abstract": "Prior research points toward reward deficits as crucial to the link between social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. However, studies have not explored specific types of reward deficits or how social-environmental factors may impact them. The current study examined whether the indirect effects of three reward deficits (anhedonia, boredom, and loneliness) explained the connection between social anxiety and depression. Questionnaires were collected in a sample of college students (N = 523) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing examination of environmental stressors (i.e., remote learning and current friend network size) on reward deficits. Indirect effect models showed that anhedonia, boredom, and loneliness each uniquely partly explained the association between social anxiety and depression (accounting for 20%, 38%, and 14% of the association, respectively), with boredom accounting for the largest proportion. Further, exploratory analyses suggested anhedonia was associated with the social anxiety-depression link only among remote learners, while loneliness appeared to be only associated among students who had smaller friend networks. Findings highlight the importance of reward deficits in comorbid social anxiety-depression symptoms. This is the first study to report the strong role of boredom in this comorbidity, suggesting a new transdiagnostic treatment target. Social-environmental stressors, such as remote learning and contact with fewer friends, may exacerbate the connection between reward deficits and social anxiety-depression comorbidity and serve as areas for intervention.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). It is less commonly applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. This study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the methodological validity of back-projected decomposition, and critically, back-projection enabled reliable estimation of internal consistency for PCA-derived component measures at the single-trial level, with all component scores showing high or adequate reliability. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative by quantifying single-trial epochs relative to the averaged covariance structure, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability of trial-level component estimates in continuity with established ERP constructs.",

          "abstract": "Precision psychiatry aims to identify biomarkers and develop prediction models to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Despite extensive research, translating findings into clinically useful tools remains challenging. Here we argue that one key contributor to this translational gap is a pervasive misalignment between routine statistical analytic practices and the criteria for clinical utility. To address this, we introduce E2P (effect-to-prediction) Simulator, an interactive web tool for estimating the real-world predictive value and clinical utility of biomarkers and prediction models by accounting for real-world outcome base rates and measurement reliability – a procedure we term predictive utility analysis. Similar to how power analysis helps optimize research for statistical significance, predictive utility analysis can help optimize it for practical significance. The interactive nature of E2P Simulator makes this approach accessible to non-statistician researchers while also providing publication-ready figures to aid with transparency and standardization of reporting. We demonstrate its application in three key areas: diagnostic (depression, Alzheimer’s disease), treatment response (antidepressants), and risk (suicide attempts and psychosis onset) prediction, highlighting conditions under which we may expect clinically meaningful advances. While we focus on translational challenges in psychiatry, the framework and tools presented here address general statistical challenges and are broadly applicable across biomedical and behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Xiang, Dorst, and Gershman (2025) recently challenged previous research and theory regarding the gambler’s fallacy. They concluded that when sequences of events are truly random, the fallacy is observed for binary predictions but not probability judgments and that binary predictions cannot be reconstructed from probability judgments, in contrast to most theoretical accounts. This “disconnection” implies that new theories may be needed. However, a reanalysis of Xiang et al.’s data using their methods and very similar methods yields strong evidence for a gambler’s fallacy for probability judgments (although not for all participants) and indicates that the gap between probability judgments and binary predictions was overstated. A version of Rabin and Vayanos’s (2010) model accounts for responses to both question types reasonably well, suggesting that such theories are not seriously threatened. Finally, we propose stratified random sampling of sequences as a more efficient method for presenting participants with representative sequences of events.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates expenditure of European parties in referendum campaigns. Previous work exploring why parties initiate referendums hints at the importance of subsequent campaigns to parties, but theoretical insights regarding party behavior in campaigning contexts are fragmented and limited. We argue that party expenditure indicates the extent of their engagement, and identifying explanatory factors can offer insights into underlying strategic goals driving parties in their behavior. Drawing on referendum instrumentalization literature and existing empirical studies, we propose a framework with three strategic factors and corresponding hypotheses. These are tested using official expenditure data for 47 parties campaigning in 24 referendums in eight European countries through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Our findings mainly suggest that parties see referendum campaigns as avenues for image-building, spending more on average when they initiate them and when referendums are publicly salient. Additionally, parties seemingly prioritize elections, while spending limits are ineffective in curbing expenditure.",

          "authors": "Maria Castiglioni; Fausta Ongaro",
          "abstract": "From 1961 in Italy the average number of individuals per household decreased from 3.6 to 2.4 in 2011 and to 2.2 in 2022, and the proportion of households with six or more members or more from 14.4% to 1.4% and 1.2% respectively. Large families, particular those with four or more children, are often associated with poverty, but, given their rarity, they are extremely difficult to study. They are essentially unknown, especially in contexts of very low fertility, such as Italy. We aim to characterize families with four or more children (largest-large families) and to identify the socio-demographic factors that distinguish them from families with one or two children (small families) which represent the prevailing model. To do this, we apply multivariate logistic models to microdata from the 2011 Italian Population and Housing Census. This is the last Census conducted in Italy on universal population basis. Sample surveys are usually not large enough to enable in-depth analyses of the processes underlying the formation of this type of families. The census source also allows analyses to be conducted separately for the native and non-native populations. Results suggest a socio-economic polarization of largest-large families and a negative association with women’s education among both native and non-native populations. Among Italian couples only, re-partnering is a predictor of having a largest-large family and couples in which the male partner is self-employed are more likely to have four or more children than those with employed men. Regional cultural and institutional differences also play a non-negligible role.",

          "abstract": "Economic inequality in the U.S. has risen sharply over the past three decades, overlapping with persistent racial, ethnic, and spatial segregation to produce entrenched neighborhood-level disparities in health. Youth are especially vulnerable to these neighborhood effects, facing disproportionate risks from adverse environmental conditions. This study examines whether neighborhood disadvantage is associated with both increased prevalence of youth health risks and lower provision of green infrastructure across four U.S. cities (Houston, TX; Minneapolis, MN; Prince George’s County, MD; San Francisco, CA). We further test whether green space moderates the relationship between disadvantage and youth health.\nCensus-tract analyses show that neighborhood disadvantage is strongly correlated with higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, and poor mental health among youth. Disadvantaged neighborhoods had significantly less park space and tree canopy cover, and areas with limited green space showed higher risks for all three health concerns. Greater tree canopy was specifically associated with reduced obesity risk. Crucially, interaction analyses revealed that higher proportions of park space substantially weakened the negative effects of disadvantage across all health outcomes.\nFindings underscore systemic underinvestment in green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighborhoods and highlight the protective potential of urban green space as a public health strategy for vulnerable youth.",

          "authors": "Tarnell Brown",
          "abstract": "Individuals released from jails and prisons face extremely high risks of fatal overdose and reincarceration, yet many jurisdictions continue to underprovide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), recovery housing, and supervised consumption services. At the same time, recovery residences and diversion courts are expanding without a clear framework for institutional design. This paper develops a mechanism-design model of harm-reduction policy at the interface of criminal justice and community treatment. A public funder chooses a funding regime and certification rules, diversion judges set the stringency of supervision and treatment conditions, recovery residence providers decide whether to operate abstinence-only or MOUD-inclusive housing, and high-risk individuals choose whether to comply or relapse. The model yields a punitive equilibrium, supported by abstinence-only funding and strict conditions, and a harm-reduction equilibrium under MOUD-inclusive funding and flexible conditions. Using effect sizes from Rhode Island’s statewide corrections MOUD program, Massachusetts’ jail-based MOUD pilots, and recent recovery housing evaluations, we show that the harm-reduction equilibrium is Pareto-superior for funders, judges, providers, and high-severity residents, yet the punitive equilibrium can remain risk-dominant because of political and informational frictions. We then embed the game in a computational social choice framework: stakeholders hold multi-dimensional preferences over policy bundles—combinations of funding rules, certification standards, diversion guidelines, and overdose prevention interventions such as supervised consumption sites—and social choice is constrained by justice-based requirements that rule out policies generating avoidable lethal risk or systematic exclusion of MOUD patients from housing and treatment. The analysis characterizes which harm-reduction mechanisms are implementable as equilibrium outcomes of the institutional game while respecting these constrained social preferences, and it identifies simple instruments—MOUD-inclusive funding commitments, performance-based transparency, and structured diversion defaults—that can move jurisdictions from punitive to harm-reduction equilibria within existing legal constraints.",

Insgesamt bleiben die Einstellungen gegenüber Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in der Bevölkerung ambivalent, zeigen jedoch leichte Verschiebungen hin zu größerer Informiertheit, differenzierteren Bewertungen und steigender Akzeptanz, insbesondere unter Erwerbstätigen. Diese berichten häufiger persönlichen Nutzen durch KI, während die Wahrnehmung gesellschaftlicher Risiken verhaltener positiv ausfällt. In der Arbeitswelt bleibt die affektive Haltung gegenüber KI stabil positiv, zugleich entwickeln sich einzelne kognitive Bewertungen moderat in Richtung positiverer Einschätzungen, etwa in Bezug auf Einkommen, Karrierechancen und Kompetenzanforderungen. Die Jobunsicherheit bleibt insgesamt niedrig; die allgemeine Sorge vor einer KI-bedingten Ersetzung menschlicher Arbeit nimmt leicht ab. Parallel dazu steigt die berufliche Nutzung von KI deutlich, insbesondere von generativer KI, und weitet sich von routinisierten hin zu komplexeren und kreativen Aufgaben aus. Insgesamt deuten die Ergebnisse auf einen graduellen Übergang von Unsicherheit zu stärker erfahrungsbasierter Auseinandersetzung mit KI hin, wobei KI zunehmend als kollegiale Unterstützung wahrgenommen wird, ohne dass bestehende Ambivalenzen vollständig aufgelöst sind.",

          "abstract": "Background: Improving students’ diet is a public health priority, yet interventions often fail to address the structural barriers students face, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets.  \nMethods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). \nResults: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively).\nConclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations. One major challenge that warrants further investigation is the capacity of stakeholders to implement such proposals, and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "The term ‘paper park’ is widely used to label protected areas that only exist ‘on paper’. Identifying and rectifying paper parks could be critical for producing ‘effectively conserved and managed […] systems of protected areas’, a core component of Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework Target 3. However, the term is not well defined and often applied to cases more accurately described as protected areas with low management effectiveness. This inconsistency is problematic because areas where management interventions are entirely absent (true paper parks) fundamentally differ in conceptualisation, monitoring, and required solutions from those where management is insufficient or poorly executed (ineffective management). To address this, here we propose a new paper park definition as “a site that has been legally or otherwise designated as a protected area, but where management interventions have been absent for at least 5 years”. We present a decision tree to identify paper parks and discuss how they differ from other types of conservation areas. We suggest addressing the problem by measuring the extent of paper parks, investigating the causes of absent management, and prioritising investment to implement effective interventions. Without such work, there is a risk that Target 3 will perversely incentivise the creation of more paper parks.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Existing theories often invoke urgent needs to explain impatience, this intuition is not sufficient: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition, which is rarely realistic. Here, we present the first model showing that time discounting can be rational in persistent poverty. We propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present, which can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings. Our findings suggest that addressing material scarcity directly, rather than attempting to alter future orientation, may be the most effective way to reduce time discounting and align behavior with true preferences.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the impact of the marketing mix on customer loyalty at the Banda Aceh Branch of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), with satisfaction acting as a mediating variable. In a highly competitive Islamic banking industry, an effective marketing strategy is essential for sustaining customer loyalty. This research employs a quantitative approach, using purposive sampling of 100 customers from five BSI branches in Banda Aceh. Data were collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire and analyzed using multiple linear regression and path analysis. The results indicate that while factors such as place, human resources, and physical evidence contributed to customer loyalty, ineffective promotion and slow service processes reduced it. Furthermore, customer satisfaction plays a mediating role, strengthening the link between the marketing mix and loyalty. These findings emphasize the need for BSI Banda Aceh Branch to improve their service efficiency, enhance human resource quality, and adopt more targeted promotional strategies to retain customers in the long term. Enhancing service efficiency and refining marketing strategies will allow BSI Banda Aceh to maintain a competitive edge in the evolving Islamic banking industry.",

          "abstract": "Intersex individuals are born with sex characteristics - such as sexual anatomy, reproductive organs, or hormonal or chromosomal patterns - that do not fit typical binary definitions of male or female bodies. This paper provides the first comprehensive population-level evidence on age-specific mortality and cause of death patterns in the intersex population compared to the endosex (i.e., not intersex) population. The study relies on diagnostic codes in Danish administrative health data to observe intersex traits at the individual level across the entire population, identifying more than 1.2% of the Danish population as intersex. Results reveal higher mortality among intersex males in early life, driven by deaths related to congenital disorders, but deaths in childhood remain rare in absolute numbers among both intersex and endosex individuals. Distinctive mid- to late-life survival patterns emerge whereby intersex males' survival probabilities outpace those of endosex males, instead converging towards that of endosex females. At the same time, the survival probability of intersex females is lower than that of endosex females, converging towards that of endosex males. Whilst substantial heterogeneity exists across intersex subgroups, overall intersex mortality patterns - like intersex sex characteristics - fall in between the typical patterns of males and females.",

Electing opposition parties is risky when their governance quality is uncertain, but voters can reduce this uncertainty by observing and learning from neighboring sub-national governments’ experiences with opposition leadership. I examine how opposition governance in neighboring municipalities affects support for opposition candidates in municipal elections in 1990s Mexico. Using a close-election regression discontinuity design, I find that municipalities with exogenous exposure to PRD-governed neighbors increased their support for the PRD by 12-15 percentage points compared to municipalities with PRI-governed neighbors.

          "authors": "Adriel Ekozin; Lydia Chryss-Afiawari; John Oghenekevwe Ifaka",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the intricate relationship between climate change and pastoralist–farmer conflict in Mali’s Dogon–Fulani communities within the wider Sahel region. The problem addressed stems from the increasing environmental pressures (such as drought, desertification, and erratic rainfall) that intensify resource competition amid fragile governance and deep-seated ethnic tensions. The study’s objectives were to examine how climate change contributes to these conflicts, identify key conflict drivers, and propose strategies to mitigate their impacts. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, 56 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024 were purposively selected from the Google Scholar database. Data were thematically analysed under three categories: environmental pressures, institutional responses, and conflict transformation mechanisms. The findings reveal that environmental degradation acts as a conflict catalyst only where weak governance and social exclusion prevail. Statistics from the region indicate that mean annual temperatures have increased significantly since the 1960s, while rainfall in the Sahel has become increasingly erratic, leading to a 40% loss of livestock in past extreme drought cycles and displacing hundreds of thousands in central Mali. Yet, communities that maintain inclusive local mediation structures experience fewer violent clashes. The study concludes that sustainable peace in the Sahel depends on integrating environmental resilience with effective governance. It recommends strengthening the rule of law, enhancing state capacity, adopting climate-smart and technology-driven agricultural practices, and transitioning to modern ranching systems to reduce farmer–herder competition and build long-term regional stability.",

          "abstract": "Background: We describe the protocol for the Epi-Q (EpiGame-Quarantine) Study, using an experimental epidemic game (“epigame”) to investigate quarantine-related attitudes and behaviors. Epigames are field experiments in which participants make behavioral decisions during a simulated epidemic in naturalistic settings. In this study, the epigame is operationalized via a smartphone app that simulates transmission of a 'digital pathogen' over Bluetooth, allowing for real-time data capture. This approach offers a novel tool for observing decision-making within social networks under dynamic risk and normative pressure. Consequently, it enables the collection of empirical data on the social, psychological, and practical determinants of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine. Unlike existing methods that rely on static cross-sectional surveys or observational data, Epi-Q captures dynamic decision-making within real-life networks. This is crucial for studying behaviors like quarantine, where compliance is not merely an individual calculation but is shaped by pre-existing and evolving social structures, including peer pressure, trust in institutions, and exposure to misinformation. Epi-Q employs a quantitative mixed-method design to untangle the complex interplay between social norms and risk perception, along with their interactions on behavioral responses. \nMethods/design: We will recruit at least 150 participants via a custom-made smartphone app capable of measuring proximity between then using Bluetooth. We will randomly allocate these participants (via network-aware clustering) into a 2×2 experimental design: (i) local vs global risk information; (ii) local vs global norms. ‘Local’ information is defined as data derived from a participant's first-degree contacts in the Bluetooth proximity network, while 'Global' information refers to aggregate data from the entire experimental group. Participants will play the epigame over a period of several weeks (one to three), making daily quarantine decisions within the app that incur costs (loss of in-game points for infection, loss of opportunities while quarantining) and benefits (points from remaining active), while Bluetooth proximity sensing samples the contact network of participants and drives simulated transmission of a digital pathogen among the phones. Data collection will include in-app behavioral logs, pre- and post-game surveys (attitudes, risk perception), and optional qualitative debrief interviews with a subset of participants. Primary outcomes will be frequency and timing of quarantine adoption; secondary outcomes will include attitudinal shifts, perceived risk, and the consistency of real-world vs in-game intentions. Analyses will include mixed-method synthesis, difference-in-differences modeling, social network analysis, and correlation of survey and behavioral measures to assess external validity.",

          "abstract": "Unlike gender or race, class background is rarely a focus of research on career progression, or of DEI efforts in elite occupations. Should it be? In this paper we document a large class gap in career progression in one occupation—U.S. tenure-track academia—using parental education to proxy for class background. First-generation college graduates are 10% less likely to be tenured at an R1, are tenured at institutions ranked 11% lower, earn 3% less, and report 5% lower job satisfaction, than their former Ph.D. classmates (from the same institution and field) with a parent with a non-Ph.D. graduate degree. Neither selection out of academia nor different preferences explain this gap; differential research productivity also plays little role. Instead, likely drivers are differences in cultural and social capital. We also find a class gap in career progression for Ph.D.s who work in industry, suggesting this phenomenon generalizes outside academia. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "abstract": "Problems such as persistent inequality, institutional decay, performative governance, and large\nscale economic costs from global conflicts suggest a deeper structural flaw within the economic \nreasoning itself, one that cannot be adequately explained by technical inefficiencies or policy \nerrors alone. This paper conceptualizes miseconomics as the practice of conducting economic \nactivity that generates cumulative social harm through normalized societal losses, and \nmisaligned incentives that erode moral responsibility while remaining internally consistent \nwithin an institutional framework. Drawing on classical moral philosophy, normative \neconomic critiques, and cases from governance failures across multiple political systems, the \nstudy analyses moral entropy to describe a pattern of progressive institutional disorder. \nGovernmental failure is examined through the conceptual framework of Lazeez Fair \ngovernance, wherein symbolic, performative, and indulgent interventions substitute \nsubstantive reform, allowing dysfunction to persist despite visible action. The paper further \nillustrates these dynamics though global patterns of corruption, institutional capture, and the \nselected cases of proxy warfare, showing patterns through which costs appear externalized onto \nvulnerable populations while benefits accrue narrowly. It concludes that without a structural \nrealignment of incentives and a reintegration of moral responsibility into mainstream economic \nthought and governance- stability, sustainability, and development- risk remaining structurally \nunattainable. The central claim is that economic failure is not primarily a shortage of analytical \ntools and normative ideologies, but a failure of moral alignment embedded within decision\nmaking systems. Recognizing and correcting miseconomics is therefore presented as a \nnecessary condition for restoring coherence between economic theory, development of society, \nand human wellbeing.",

We estimate 256 maternal deaths (95% CI [222, 295]) per 100,000 live births in the NFHS-4 and 305 (95% CI [268, 344]) in the NFHS-5. The SRS reports an MMR of 130 for 2014-16 and 97 for 2018-20.  Differences between the two surveys’ MMR measurements are largest in the socioeconomically disadvantaged states of north India.  We discuss possible sources of sampling and non-sampling error in the two surveys. We conclude that these new NFHS estimates should inform discourse about the burden of maternal mortality in India.",

Background:\nTotal fertility rates in Finland have declined sharply since 2010, reaching lowest-low levels in\nrecent years. This study complements previous, mostly register-based, research by focusing on\nyoung Finns’ fertility intentions and their self-reported rationales. Method: We analyzed survey\nresponses from 3,803 young Finns (aged 20–29) collected in 2021–2022, who evaluated how 39\nrationales influenced their fertility intentions, including postponement, not desiring (additional)\nchildren, or uncertainty. Exploratory factor analysis was used to group the rationales, and latent\nprofile analysis identified distinct groups of individuals with similar rationales. Multinomial logit\nmodels were then estimated to examine the associations between these profiles and fertility\nintentions. Results: We identified five latent profiles differing in their constellations of personal\nand partnership concerns, autonomy concerns, global concerns, and career-related concerns.\nPostponing childbearing was typical of the groups with moderate concerns over personal\nautonomy and career, who could also have experienced personal and partnership difficulties.\nIndividuals who intended to forgo childbearing entirely prioritized personal autonomy and global\nconcerns. Conclusions: Practical circumstances primarily drive the postponement of childbearing,\nwhile ideological motivations and lifestyle choices are more strongly associated with intentions to\nremain childless.",

          "abstract": "While the structural disadvantage and discrimination migrants face are well-documented, migrants’ perceptions of meritocracy and equality of opportunity remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap using a mixed-methods approach, combining data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), the European Social Survey (ESS), and in-depth qualitative interviews and group discussions (N = 47). Quantitative results indicate that first-generation migrants are significantly more likely than non-migrants to think German society is meritocratic and offers equal opportunities. In turn, they are more likely to tolerate large inequalities. Qualitative analysis reveals that this optimism stems from favorable comparisons with their countries of origin. This paper argues that migrant optimism, previously associated with educational expectations, extends beyond individual-level perceptions to encompass perceptions of society at large. While prior research has emphasized the motivational benefits of migrant optimism, this study highlights how it can lead migrants to legitimize inequalities, revealing more ambivalent political consequences.",

          "authors": "Jan Wetzel",
          "abstract": "Over a century after its publication, Max Weber’s The Protestant remains a foundational text for understanding not only the historical genesis of modern capitalism but also the subjectivity of contemporary occupational life. This enduring status is striking because Weber’s argument rests primarily on theological writings rather than on direct engagement with the (historical) occupational world. While recent economic history has produced a substantial body of empirical tests and refinements of Weber’s thesis, far less attention has been paid to his core claim that theological concepts helped shape distinctive work-oriented subjectivities. This article addresses that gap by examining art manuals produced for and by artisans during the Reformation era, with a particular focus on Nuremberg. By situating these manuals in their historical contexts, it demonstrates that their authors explicitly related their understandings of work to theological ideas, though in ways that depart from standard Lutheran assumptions. The manuals draw not only on Protestant sources but also on humanist traditions. Moreover, they frame the dissemination of artistic knowledge through print as a Christian obligation to enhance the community’s artistic productivity, thereby articulating an implicit logic of economic expansion that cannot be reduced to a Calvinist ethos.",

Using longitudinal bibliometric data from Scopus covering more than 32 million researchers, this study provides a global assessment of how the pandemic disrupted international researcher mobility between 2020 and 2022. Pandemic-related “lost mobility” is estimated using counterfactual trend extrapolation based on pre-2020 trajectories. International researcher mobility fell short of expected levels by an estimated 14,703 movements (±2,791), corresponding to a 3.7% loss. Although observed mobility rebounded by 2022, it remained below counterfactual trends. Effects varied widely across countries and were asymmetric: losses in incoming mobility were strongly associated with destination-country COVID-19 policy stringency and political regime type, whereas outgoing mobility showed no comparable relationship. These findings underscore the institutionally mediated nature of scientific mobility during global crises.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants and their descendants constitute an increasing share of European populations, yet research on how immigrant background shapes the cohabitation experience remains limited. This study investigates how generational status at the individual level and national context at the macro level influence the likelihood of ever having cohabited. Our central proposition is that the diffusion of cohabitation among immigrants is more pronounced in countries where the practice is common and socially accepted among the native population. We analysed pooled data from the European Social Survey (ESS; 2002–2023), encompassing 66,017 respondents across 32 countries. Our findings provide evidence of an adaptation pattern: descendants of immigrants are significantly more likely to have ever cohabited than the first generation. Crucially, this generational difference does not vary systematically according to the prevalence of cohabitation among natives. The cohabitation context nonetheless significantly increases the likelihood of ever having cohabited, outweighing the influence of economic factors such as income inequality (Gini index). This suggests that the social and normative environment—the cohabitation context—is a primary driver of behavioural change. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that immigrant family formation is not merely a product of individual traits but is fundamentally shaped by the normative climate of the host country.",

We investigate the role of education-linked genes alongside family background and experiencing mental illness and other major life events in predicting (re-)application to university. We further examine the later socioeconomic outcomes of individuals who are more persistent in their educational goals.\nUtilizing longitudinal genetically informed register data from Finland, we analyze a sample of 6,101 individuals born 1987-1990 followed up until 2018. The study uses parental polygenic scores to assess the genetic endowment to high educational attainment (EDU-PGS) combined with information on application behavior (1,683 individuals experienced rejection) and socioeconomic variables. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models and discrete time hazard models are employed.\nOur findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions. Moreover, application behavior mediated the influence of the polygenic score on occupational status in early adulthood.\nThe study contributes to the broader equality of opportunity debate and shows how genes express themselves in our smaller or bigger decisions. The joint contribution of genetic and family factors has a crucial role in shaping educational trajectories and later socioeconomic outcomes.",

In high-income populations, documented risk factors for experiencing FI include low income, being female, having children, and ethnic minority status. Low social support may increase the risk of FI above and beyond these.\n\nMethods. In two epidemiological datasets, the Changing Cost of Living Study (CCLS; UK and France) and the National Health Interview Survey 2024 (NHIS; USA), we used model selection to identify the best predictors of FI from a set including social support alongside socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\nResults. In both datasets, social support was selected as a predictor variable. High social support roughly halved the odds of experiencing FI (CCLS: 0.45 (95% CI 0.35 - 0.56); NHIS: OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.49 - 0.56)). Other selected predictor variables were income, income volatility, gender, and age (CCLS); and income, gender, age, having children, education and ethnicity (NHIS). Social support operated additively to other factors.\n\nConclusions. Low social support is an independent risk factor for FI. FI may be reduced by fostering social connection and capital; and inferences about the causal effects of FI on health may be confounded by the influence of social support on both.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies justice (MSJ) seeks to extend justice beyond humans. This concept may appear to improve environmental stewardship, however its openness risks undermining well-established principles of conservation and justice. Its open interpretation facilitates conceptual ambiguity, hindering practical operationalisation, risking moralising natural processes, while overlooking complexities of human-nature interactions and potentially weakening conservation efforts by opening the door for political misuse. In contrast, existing ethical and conservation frameworks already provide approaches to include nonhumans in justice, conservation and policy considerations. Building on three normative ethical theories (consequentialist, deontological and virtue ethics), we demonstrate how nonhumans can already be included in ethical considerations. Applying these theories enhances applicability through alignment with historic, juridical, scientific and religious moral systems. We therefore advocate strengthening established conservation and justice principles to address environmental crises. Future development of MSJ should build on its current popularity while integrating established, applicable ethical insights for including nonhumans in moral considerations.",

Since the main theoretical foundations for the comparative study of these regimes of public aid towards socio-economic disadvantage primarily derive from scientific contributions that are previous to this alteration window, we suggest the opportunity of drafting a new epistemic framework, which, on one hand, may be able to renovate the analytical and heuristic appropriateness of the so called ‘regime approach’, while, on the other, providing a precise and in-depth glance at the current geography of welfare architectures within the developed economies’ perimeter, mainly relying on quantitative indicators inherent (i) to the private sector’s participation in welfare provision, (ii) to the public actor’s generosity of treatment and (iii) to the familist architectural propensity. The 28-case-studies field-testing of the framework, conducted via modern HCA, KCA and PCA techniques provides results that corroborate the practical reliability of the fiscal design model as a means of welfare legacy family identification.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on qualitative survey data from 107 Australian teachers, we analyse how boys perform masculinity in schools through dominance, derision, defiance, and harassment, in ways that constitute reanimated normative manhood acts (Schwalbe, 2014). Teachers describe a noticeable shift around 2022, coinciding with the rising visibility and popularity of the manosphere, when some boys’ misogyny became more explicit, emboldened, and unchecked. Building on Moloney and Love’s (2018) work on ‘virtual manhood acts’ (VMAs), we determine five normative manhood acts now visible offline: (1) backlash misogyny; (2) homosocial harassment; (3) humour-as-baiting; (4) sexualisation of women; and (5) disinvestment in schooling. Highlighting the inextricable relationship between online misogyny and gendered power dynamics in physical educational settings, we underscore how certain boys’ increasing disregard for consequences reflects a renewed model of masculinity rooted in backlash politics, manosphere ideologies, and a broader far-right, anti-establishment orientation toward selfhood, community, and society.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive settings, yet we know little about how their identity performance develops when they interact within large-scale networks. We address this by examining Chirper.ai, a social media platform similar to X but composed entirely of autonomous AI chatbots. Our dataset comprises over 70,000 agents, approximately 140 million posts, and the evolving followership network over one year. Based on agents' text production, we assign weekly gender scores to each agent. Results suggest that each agent’s gender performance is fluid rather than fixed. Despite this fluidity, the network displays strong gender-based homophily, as agents consistently follow others performing gender similarly. Finally, we investigate whether these homophilic connections arise from social selection, in which agents choose to follow similar accounts, or from social influence, in which agents become more similar to their followees over time. Consistent with human social networks, we find evidence that both mechanisms shape the structure and evolution of interactions among LLMs. Our findings suggest that, even in the absence of bodies, cultural entraining of gender performance leads to gender-based sorting. This has important implications for LLM applications in synthetic hybrid populations, social simulations, and decision support.",

          "authors": "Kazuhito Kitamura",
          "abstract": "This paper deepens the \"Equilibrium Theory Endogenizing Imbalances\" based on asset dynamics, as presented in the previous study (Kitamura, 2025), by incorporating concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. While the previous work proposed a model where imbalances are perpetuated through asset preference and capital diffusion, this study extends the framework into a model where \"effective asset potential\"—defined as the asset level divided by the rate of return on assets—acts as the driving force behind capital flows. It demonstrates a mechanism in which the capital efficiency of each nation significantly determines its economic trajectory.\nThrough observations using multilateral data, this paper reveals that individual economies exist under a tension between \"subjective equilibrium,\" aimed at utility maximization, and the \"pressure of entropy increase\" inherent in asset dynamics. Consequently, the global economy has polarized into \"self-organizing economies\" that concentrate and accumulate capital, and \"diffusive economies\" that primarily disperse and dissipate capital. This paper presents a novel perspective that views the global economy as a \"dissipative structure\" maintained through the interdependence of these distinct phases.\nBased on this analysis, the paper argues that for an economic system to remain sustainable, it is essential to adopt a perspective of \"entropy management.\" This involves maintaining the gradient of asset potential within the system by promoting innovation and eliminating \"stagnation\" through redistribution policies.",

          "abstract": "This chapter explores how media narratives contribute to the formation of publics around landscape transformation in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, analysing events from 2020. By examining print journalism, online news, social media discussions, and videos, the author traces the logics of circulation emerging in response to resource commodification in this frontier setting. Two distinct media events structure the analysis: the arrest of a Dayak community leader protesting illegal forest clearing by a palm oil company, which generated a Twitter counterpublic intensively indexing state authorities; and supernatural occurrences at a plywood factory, which circulated through sensationalist media and ultimately enabled critical coverage of the company's operations.\nThe chapter makes three interrelated arguments. First, Central Kalimantan's fragmented mediascape simultaneously upholds state interests through mainstream channels while allowing for citizen mobilisation and indirect political critique through social media and circulating narratives. Second, the author introduces \"haunted publics\" as a distinct modality of public formation, where circulation depends on the imagined agency of supernatural actors rather than the rational deliberation typically required of counterpublics, yet can nonetheless transpose to official discourse and enable political critique. Third, the chapter argues that frontiers are not simply places of rapid transformation but generative conditions from which new publics with novel logics of circulation emerge—publics that participate directly in the making and unmaking of frontier spaces. These findings contribute to anthropological debates on the nature of publics and their relationship to state authority in contexts where conditions for conventional bourgeois public spheres are absent.",

          "authors": "Don Sanjeewa Alwis",
          "abstract": "The institutional approach to development typically classifies colonial institutions as inclusive or extractive. This categorization is based on formal design. This classification often overlooks how rights and protections were distributed within societies, assuming access rather than measuring it.\n\nThis paper develops a Selective Inclusion framework, arguing that colonial regimes frequently built formally capable institutions while restricting access for indigenous and majority populations. To operationalize this idea, I construct a Partial Access Index (PAI) measured at independence for a sample of 62 former colonies. The index codes access in four domains: political franchise, access to executive constraints, legal uniformity, and educational-economic participation.\n\nDescriptive evidence reveals a Settler Colony Paradox: countries commonly treated as benchmarks of inclusive institutions often exhibited substantial exclusion of non-settler populations. Empirically, higher institutional access is associated with lower long-term income inequality. Robustness checks, including jackknife and region-exclusion tests, confirm that this relationship is not driven by outliers. The pattern is non-linear and region-specific. Latin America exhibits high inequality under partial inclusion. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits high inequality under low access.\n\nThese findings suggest that formal institutional strength can coexist with restricted access, and that who is included matters as much as what institutions exist. The distinction of institutional form from institutional access clarifies the persistent distributional consequences of colonial rule.",

          "abstract": "As autism and ADHD cohorts reach later life in growing numbers, population aging frameworks face a critical challenge: conventional models assume aging occurs independently of lifelong neurodevelopmental disability. This review synthesizes findings from autism research, life-course theory, and aging studies to examine how lifelong neurodevelopmental differences interact with age-related health and system demands. By integrating evidence on physical health, mental health, service access, and regulatory demands, the review identifies mechanisms through which aging-related challenges emerge in autistic and ADHD populations and highlights implications for clinical care and support planning. We show that later-life outcomes reflect interaction effects between stable neurodevelopmental profiles, universal biological aging, and cumulative institutional exposure, rather than diagnosis timing or progressive trait change. Functional changes often attributed to decline instead reflect reduced recovery capacity under increasing health complexity and system demands. This reframing has direct implications for population planning, healthcare design, and service integration, particularly for high-support individuals who encounter aging-disability interactions earliest. The review concludes by identifying critical research gaps and system stress points requiring anticipatory policy as neurodevelopmentally diverse populations age.",

          "abstract": "This article reexamines political modernization by developing a theory of vernacular moral order to explain how political legitimacy is sustained under conditions of institutional fragility. Drawing on public scandals and everyday civic discourse in the Philippines, it shows how moral reasoning is organized through vernacular grammars such as hiya, tino, and bait, which translate concerns with trust, accountability, and authority into relational practices of judgment and repair. Rather than treating scandal as institutional breakdown or moral deviance, the article theorizes scandal as a recurrent activation mechanism through which publics evaluate authority and recalibrate legitimacy when formal procedures fail to command confidence. These vernacular moral grammars do not represent residues of tradition opposed to modern politics; instead, they function as culturally embedded infrastructures that enable political order to endure despite weak institutions and persistent uncertainty. By foregrounding moral reasoning as relational, affective, and culturally situated, the article challenges institutionalist accounts of modernization and legitimacy, demonstrating how political order is sustained not by the completion of modernization but through ongoing moral coordination in its aftermath.",

Tracing my adoption of an injured stray cat encountered in a habitual workspace, I examine how hesitation, domestic negotiation, and eventual commitment unfolded alongside wider social encounters with animal neglect and my own developing engagement with moral-relational public life. I conceptualize trust not as a calculated expectation of reciprocity but as a redistribution of contextualized vulnerability and a temporal reordering of everyday routines. The cat’s early-morning activity, which reorganized household and scholarly rhythms, becomes an analytic hinge for examining how care inscribes itself into bodily time. I argue that interspecies adoption offers a micro-foundation for understanding trust as an embodied, temporal, and morally generative practice of being held.",

          "abstract": "The procurement of residential care facilities presents opportunities for design innovation yet is challenged by various contextual factors, including country-specific policies, regulations, research, care models, organisational practices, and socioeconomic influences. Despite the impact of these factors on built quality, research on their role in supporting design innovation remains limited. Defining procurement as four phases—Planning, Design, Construction, and Occupancy— this study aims to provide a holistic understanding of these dynamics to identify pathways to design innovation. Objectives are, to: 1) create a diagrammatic representation of the procurement process for new residential care facilities, highlighting key stakeholders; 2) identify and prioritise contextual factors that significantly influence innovation in residential care facility design; and 3) explore the facilitators and barriers to innovation at each step of the process to propose actionable strategies for overcoming them. A multi-method qualitative approach included a systematic literature review, analysis of 38 case studies, and a two-round national e-Delphi study with 32 experts from four stakeholder groups. The findings offer a foundation for policymakers to assess the influence of various factors, reframe power dynamics between key stakeholders, and explore transdisciplinary collaboration models to foster innovation. The study reveals that many challenges are not unique to residential care facilities but reflect broader systemic issues across sectors and building typologies.",

Recent bioarchaeological and radiocarbon analyses have excluded Tomb I as the burial of Philip II of Macedon, removing the osteological and chronological basis for the traditional attribution and leaving Philip’s resting place unresolved. This paper proposes an integrative reinterpretation of Tomb II as either the primary cremation or a secondary monumentalized burial of Philip II, constructed or refurbished during the political reorganization of Macedonia following the death of Alexander the Great. We argue that the tomb’s cremation rites, exceptional monumentality, dynastic iconography, equestrian sacrifices, and elite military regalia correspond more closely to the commemoration of a foundational warrior king than to the historically marginal reign of Philip III Arrhidaeus. Situating Tomb II within broader Greek traditions of heroization, secondary burial, and dynastic legitimation, the model explains the archaeological and historical evidence with fewer assumptions and generates testable predictions for future research.",

          "abstract": "This review synthesises the literature on university entrepreneurial ecosystems to understand their role in fostering university spin-off companies as drivers of economic development. This study adopts a systematised conceptual literature review design, employing a structured search and thematic synthesis to develop an integrative conceptual framework that positions university entrepreneurial ecosystems as a dynamic interplay between internal (e.g. university leadership, faculty) and external (e.g. government, venture capitalists) stakeholders. The framework identifies knowledge spillover and transfer as key mediating processes, and highlights intellectual property frameworks and mechanisms (e.g. university IP policy, legal system) as a critical moderator that can either enable or constrain academic entrepreneurship, and subsequently spin-off formation. Applying this lens to New Zealand, a paradoxical situation was uncovered: while home to a recognised “emerging world leading” university entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is a significant paucity of recent, system-wide academic research. Key gaps are identified, including the need for longitudinal data on spin-offs performances, and a deeper understanding of internal ecosystem dynamics like the critical imperative to integrate Mātauranga Māori (Māori traditional knowledge) into commercialisation pathways. This review provides a foundation for future empirical research and offers insights for policymakers and university leaders in New Zealand and other small, innovative economies.\n\nKeywords: University Entrepreneurial Ecosystem, University Spin-off, Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, Knowledge Spillover, Academic Entrepreneurship, New Zealand",

          "abstract": "This paper outlines a distributional approach to institutional analysis, reconceptualizing institutions as distributions of knowledge and activity across people. We argue that institutionalization and institutional change are best understood by focusing on actors with the requisite knowledge and motivation to keep institutional patterns going, fix them when they go awry, or transform them when required, here called functionaries. The distributional approach allows us to distinguish between two main types of institutional change often conflated in the literature: Content-based and formal change. Content-based change, the one most often discussed, involves the importation, recombination, or expansion of specific patterns of activity. In contrast, formal change, often neglected in the literature, refers to shifts in the distribution of knowledge and activity within an institution, leading to dynamics of centralization and decentralization of institutional patterns. In this way, the distributional approach highlights the role of functionaries in both institutional stability and change, providing a micro-level perspective on institutional dynamics.",

This study examines partisan polarization on Ukraine aid between Democratic and Republican elites as reflected in U.S. news media from March 2022 to December 2024, leveraging party brand theory and foreign policy polarization literature to explain when and how Democrats and Republicans consolidated distinct positions on a novel foreign policy issue. Analyzing 37,312 sentences from 23,630 news articles, we employ a dual-pipeline methodology combining LLM-based ideological scoring across four dimensions with BERT-based masked vocabulary extraction. Results reveal significant polarization growth, driven asymmetrically by Republican movement toward opposition while Democrats maintained stable pro-aid positioning. Resource allocation framing, such that Ukraine aid competes with domestic resources, contributed most strongly to the general polarization of supplying further aid to Ukraine, accounting for over 60% of explained variance. PELT identified October 2022 as the first major departure from bipartisan consensus, with polarization of the subsequent segments moving with electoral cycles and leadership transitions. Critically, as polarization increased, so did the clarity of party brands to voters: both parties’ messaging became more internally coherent, enabling clearer partisan differentiation. Vocabulary extraction revealed early crystallization of partisan linguistic patterns, with Democrats emphasizing language of provision (“promised,” “signed”) and Republicans emphasizing language of obstruction (“block,” “killed”). These findings demonstrate that elite polarization on Ukraine aid served functional party branding purposes, challenging assumptions about foreign policy’s insulation from domestic partisan conflict.",

In this paper, we develop a novel strategy for identifying intersex individuals using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in population-wide health registers. Applying this approach to Danish data spanning 1994-2022, we provide the first population-level examination of the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in the intersex population. We identify intersex traits in 1.6% of the Danish population - rising to 2.5% among the 1994-2022 birth cohorts, for whom diagnostic data cover the entirety of their lives. We disaggregate the intersex population into six subgroups based on the type of intersex-related diagnoses and examine the risk of fourteen clusters of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across all subgroups, the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially elevated relative to the endosex population, although specific risk profiles vary: some subgroups show broad elevations across disorder categories, whilst others exhibit more selective patterns. These patterns persist after controlling for age and assigned sex, as well as after the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. Our findings highlight the need for mental health support tailored to individuals with intersex traits. Our ICD-based identification strategy addresses longstanding methodological barriers to intersex research and offers a replicable approach for population-level research beyond mental health and across contexts with comparable health data.",

In particular, the other gender group had the most severe and diverse levels of eating disorders. Factors such as body dissatisfaction, social pressure on body standards, gender discrimination and internalization of appearance standards had a significant impact on eating disorder behavior.

This study develops a sequential explanation of social media driven rumour spread in Bangladesh and analyses a risk-reduction model. Using a mixed-methods design, this study combines content analysis of viral rumour incidents, interviews with journalists, diffusion pathway mapping within closed networks, influencer, and digital security stakeholders. Presenting information suggests that escalation is most likely when identity threats circulate through trusted local networks and confusing institutional responses. Employing Social Exchange Theory, the study argues that perceived institutional failure facilitates negative reciprocity and accumulation.

Almost all research has provided positive evidence from the view of theoretical and empirical aspects of group work. However, skepticism and negativity towards group work are also emerging. Even if group work is not rejected outright, at the very least, opportunities to discuss effective methods of group work are increasing. This study focuses on the two issues mentioned above, motivation and gender difference. Group work has the advantage of allowing learners to listen to the ideas of others, compare them with their own, and form their own opinions. It may also have the benefit of cultivating communication skills and the ability to collaborate with others. However, conducting it within a limited time frame carries risks. There is also the possibility that it may have a negative effect on learning outcomes, or at least not bring about the expected benefits. Furthermore, learners may be aware of the limitations of group work.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "This study argues that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. We argue that the risk-free rate reflects the expected inflation effect, that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or the opportunity cost of alternative nondepreciating investment, and that a GDP growth rate lower than the risk-free rate is actually negative. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a risk constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models, on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics is the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets. We have to develop the 4-factor independence model into software to analyze the noise of inflation risk that follows a blended normal distribution (Nie, 2023).",

          "abstract": "Summary\n\nRationale and aims Nahuatl plant names such as ahuacatl and chīlli remain embedded in global languages, reflecting enduring Indigenous botanical knowledge. The 1552 De la Cruz-Badiano Codex preserves this knowledge through Nahuatl names, Latin text, and botanical illustrations. We asked whether these distinct representations encode a shared underlying structure of Nahua plant classification.\n\nMethods We compiled a multimodal dataset linking three data types from the Codex: leaf shape morphometrics derived from traced illustrations, text embeddings from English and Spanish translations, and graph embeddings based on co-occurrence patterns among Nahuatl plant names. A contrastive multimodal learning framework was used to integrate these representations into a shared embedding space.\n\nKey results The model successfully aligned two of the three modalities. Linguistic and name-structure data clustered closely together, while leaf shape occupied a more distinct region of the embedding space, indicating differing roles for morphology and language in classification.\n\nConclusions These results suggest that Nahua botanical knowledge in the codex emphasizes relational and linguistic structure alongside, but not reducible to, plant form. Our study demonstrates how computational methods can reveal patterns in historical Indigenous knowledge systems and support efforts to re-examine colonial-era sources in plant science.\n\nSocietal Impact Statement \nNahuatl \nIn huehca nahuatlahcuilolli in,\nin tlaneltiliztli in xihuitl, in cuahuitl, ihuan in tlacah\namo zan tlahcuilolpan mopiya,\nzan mochipa yoltilana.\n\nInin tlamachtiliztli ticnextia quenin\nin tlahtolli, in ixiptlahcuiloltin, ihuan in xihuitl\nce tlamantli tlamatiliztli mochipa quichihua.\n\nTicpohuah ihuan tiquixmati in xihuitl\namo zan ipampa patli,\nzan ipampa nemiliztli ihuan tlalli.\n\nInin tequitl quipalehuia in tlamatiliztli nahua,\nin tlahtolli, ihuan in tlaneltiliztli,\nma yoltilana, ma tlapalehuia in tlacah ihuan in tlalli\naxcan ihuan moztla.\n\nEnglish\nTranslated from Nahuatl: In ancient Nahua writings, knowledge of plants, trees, and people was not fixed on the page, but carried forward in living ways. This study shows how language, images, and plants work together as one enduring system of knowledge. We examine plants not only as medicines, but as part of human life and the land itself. By reading these manuscripts through Indigenous structures of understanding, our work supports the vitality of Nahua knowledge, language, and plant relationships. This matters today because sustaining Indigenous ways of knowing strengthens care for people, plants, and the land, now and for the future. To enhance the reach of this work, a Spanish language version of the paper is available in the Supporting Information (see Translation_ES).\n\nKeywords\nBotany; De la Cruz-Badiano Herbal; Indigenous knowledge; Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis; Multimodal learning; Nahuatl; Plant classification",

          "abstract": "This chapter investigates the growing importance of Asia within the global financial system and analyzes its implications for the liberal script. First, the chapter explores the place of finance within the liberal script, investigating the paradigm shift from embedded liberalism to neoliberalism and subsequently growing importance of capital-market based finance for economic allocation within the Western script. Second, the autonomous origins of developmentalism in Asian financial scripts are discussed which markedly differ from (neo)liberal conceptions of finance. Third, and moving beyond the neoliberal-developmental dichotomy, the chapter conducts a comparative analysis of the five largest Asian financial systems: China, Korea, India, Japan, and Singapore. In doing so, the chapter identifies significant variations of how Asian finance relates to the liberal script, ranging between accommodation, resistance, and contestation. While maintaining some developmental characteristics, Japan and Singapore largely accommodate the liberal script. In contrast, we can observe resistance to conform with the liberal script in Korea and India where developmental characteristics maintain a prominent role and steps are taken to enable a controlled co-existence. Finally, only China truly contests the liberal script, both through the intensity and international reach of its developmental characteristics but most importantly through other actors’ reaction towards it. The chapter thus illustrates that while there are significant differences between (more) developmental Asian and (more) neoliberal Western financial systems, the rise of Asia represents only a partial contestation of the neoliberal financial script, which cannot, however, be separated from broader geopolitical constellations that challenge the liberal script.",

Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases andlimitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study conducts a large-scale computational comparison of 17,790 matched article pairs from the 20,000most-edited English Wikipedia pages.  Using metrics spanning lexical richness,readability, reference density, structural features, and semantic similarity, we assesshow closely the two platforms align in form and substance. We find that Grokipediaarticles are substantially longer and contain significantly fewer references per word.Moreover, Grokipedia’s content divides into two distinct groups: one that remainssemantically and stylistically aligned with Wikipedia, and another that divergessharply.  Among the dissimilar articles, we observe a systematic rightward shiftin the political bias of cited sources, concentrated primarily in entries related topolitics, history, and religion. More broadly, the findings indicate that AI-generatedencyclopedic content departs from established editorial norms, favoring narrativeexpansion over citation-based verification, raising questions about transparency,provenance, and the governance of knowledge in automated information systems.",

          "abstract": "We analyse focus group discussions and free-text survey responses from a multi-stakeholder consultation conducted after the October 2023 publication of the proposal Towards Responsible Publishing by cOAlition S. The proposal calls for a systemic reform of scholarly communication by reducing barriers to knowledge dissemination, promoting early sharing of outputs through preprints, and shifting peer review to an open, post-publication model. We focus on how different stakeholder groups –such as researchers, infrastructure providers, academic institutions, and publishers –perceive obstacles to the large-scale, coordinated reform envisioned in the proposal. We interpret these accounts as articulations of collective action problems, shaped by entrenchment of many actors in existing academic reward systems and established commercial revenue models that make transitions toward a more economically sustainable scholarly communication system difficult, even where many actors see the principal need for change. This approach highlights the extent to which stakeholder perspectives align or conflict. It also underscores the performative nature of discourse about collective action problems in scholarly communication: by articulating challenges to reform, participants simultaneously construct, reinforce, or contest their own roles within the system, which directly influences their collective capacity to act.",

          "authors": "Benoît de Courson; Willem Frankenhuis; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite repeated and robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Although urgent needs are often invoked to explain impatience, this intuition can be misleading: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition. To address this gap, we propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present. This can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings about deprived populations. Our findings suggest that addressing material scarcity directly, rather than attempting to alter future orientation, may be the most effective way to reduce impulsivity and align behavior with true preferences.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript presents an anonymized, longitudinal qualitative single-case dataset documenting digitally mediated obsessive relational intrusion (ORI), symbolic manipulation, and covert pursuit behaviors within contemporary social media environments. The primary evidentiary window spans November 2023 through May 2025, with documentation and analysis concentrated across 2024–2025. The case is reported from the perspective of the primary target and applies a structured analytic approach that distinguishes (a) observable digital behaviors (e.g., timestamps, posts, interactions, and platform activity) from (b) interpretive analysis grounded in repeated patterns, timing relationships, symbolic consistency, and escalation dynamics observable across time and platforms.\n\nThe dataset is organized as a structured case file consisting of an executive summary, preface, and methodology section outlining documentation procedures and interpretive criteria; contextual background establishing relevant relational and digital history; a master timeline organized around correlated activity and post-response timing relationships; and appendices addressing recurrent tactic clusters, including sexual objectification, identity manipulation, covert account proliferation, fantasy-based framing, and probability-based reasoning relevant to assessments of intentionality. All identifying details—including names, locations, venues, and searchable lyrical content—have been anonymized or paraphrased to preserve privacy while retaining evidentiary and analytic integrity.\n\nThis work is shared to support sociological research, interdisciplinary scholarship, advocacy, and public understanding of technology-facilitated forms of relational harm that may remain socially and institutionally difficult to recognize due to plausible deniability and indirect communication architectures. It is not presented as a legal claim or criminal allegation, but as a high-resolution longitudinal dataset illustrating how digitally mediated ORI may be sustained through symbolic intrusion and psychological presence without continuous direct contact.\n\nThe full anonymized case file is available as an accompanying dataset via OSF.",

          "abstract": "This paper documents the importance of government debt in facilitating the development of corporate bond markets. Using micro-level data from Brazil, I exploit variation in the supply of government bonds at different maturities to estimate the causal effect of additional government debt outstanding on firm issuance decisions. I find that at early stages of development, government debt complements corporate debt, implying that additional government debt outstanding at a given maturity causes firms to issue more. These effects ultimately increase long-term debt issuance and investment across firms, with stronger responses from companies with higher asset duration. However, as markets mature and government debt levels rise, I document a shift from complementarity to substitution. This evidence can be rationalized through government debt reducing corporate pricing uncertainty by providing pricing benchmarks and facilitating price discovery in bond markets.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study examines whether perceived military skills transferability (PMST) influences entrepreneurial intention (EI) in a post-conflict economy. Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, it tests entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as a mediator and perceived environmental hardship as a moderator.\nDesign/methodology/approach: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted with 270 working-age adults across three regions of South Sudan (Juba/Central Equatoria, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal) between July and October 2025 using paper-based and online questionnaires. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression and PROCESS-based mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1) with 5,000 bootstrap resamples.\nFindings: PMST is positively associated with EI. ESE mediates this relationship (indirect-only): the bootstrapped indirect effect is significant and the PMST→EI direct effect becomes non-significant when ESE is included. Perceived environmental hardship weakens the positive PMST–EI relationship. Resilience is positively related to EI but does not moderate the focal relationship.\nResearch limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference and self-reports may introduce common method bias. Future research should use longitudinal and comparative designs and examine behavioral outcomes (e.g., business start-up).\nPractical implications: Reintegration and entrepreneurship programs should combine skills-recognition and ESE-building (e.g., mastery-based training and mentoring) with ecosystem interventions that reduce contextual constraints.\nSocial implications: Supporting entrepreneurship among individuals with military experience may contribute to livelihood recovery, inclusion and reintegration in fragile settings.\nOriginality/value: The study integrates perceived skills transferability, cognitive mechanisms and contextual constraints to explain entrepreneurial intention in a fragile, post-conflict economy.\nType of paper: Research paper.\nKeywords: perceived skills transferability; entrepreneurial self-efficacy; entrepreneurial intention; environmental hardship; resilience; post-conflict; fragile economy.",

Combining philosophical precision with historical analysis, the book explores how class domination is maintained not only through economic coercion but through the cultural and ideological mechanisms of the global order. \n\nDrawing on Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser—while critically engaging with other critical authors—Korolija demonstrates how the transition from the nation-state to the imperial phase of capitalism transforms the function of ideology itself. This theory connects the formation of hegemony in the classical Marxist sense to the reproduction of global capitalist power in the 21st century.\n\nThis is an excerpt with two out of six sections.\n\nWinner of the 2023 and 2024 Best Dissertation Award of the Serbian Sociological Society",

          "abstract": "Political possibilities are shaped by how a problem is defined. When it comes to the environmental crisis, the defined contours of growth, development, and scarcity drive the conversation in predetermined directions.

When outlined as categories liable to be influenced by culture, context, and power structures, their study can serve as a searching tool that illuminates complex dynamics. Environmental education influences and is influenced by the prevailing discourses in environmentalism. The discourse privileged by the curriculum's language frame depends on the text's location, who it is aimed at, and the concomitant priorities. In this exploratory paper, practitioners working in the fields of environmental education (EE) pedagogy, teaching, curriculum design, and activism were interviewed. The idea was to get a sense of what people in different fields working towards the common goal of better care for the environment and an ethic of sustainability had to say about the EE curriculum. What was their vision for it, and what was the reality they had encountered in these technology-driven, fast-paced times? Special attention was paid to interlocutors' thoughts on the significance of the words and language used in the curriculum.",

Como parte dessa forma mais externa a matemática geralmente aparece como mais um recurso retórico à disposição da teorização. A análise se direciona em três direções: (i) o Teorema de Sonnenschein‑Mantel‑Debreu (SMD), cuja prova pode ser entendida como a impossibilidade lógica de derivar comportamento racional agregado a partir de preferências individuais racionais, e sua consequência na microfundamentação de teorias macroeconômicas, (ii) na Teoria Monetária Moderna (MMT) e (iii) na possibilidade ou não da planificação econômica na sociedade capitalista. Analisamos os limites de discursos modernos e realistas como o socialismo de mercado, a economia do projetamento e a nova economia do projetamento e como, em última instância, mesmos esses discursos mais modernos ainda carregam fundamentações baseadas em argumentações circulares e antigos meta-axiomas.

Grounded in critical theory and historical analysis, and informed by Black-serving institutions in the United States and South Africa, the framework offers a systems-level tool for analyzing why equity-oriented reforms are often reversible and why inequality persists despite repeated interventions.",

Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study situates summer melt within the broader college-choice process by comparing summer melters with students who follow through on their intentions, those who never intend to enroll, and those who enroll without prior intent. Socioeconomic differences in summer melt are closely tied to earlier disparities in progressing toward college intent, and summer melters’ academic and behavioral patterns across high school vary more than those of college-intending enrollees. These results highlight the value of viewing summer melt as one point among several at which students reconsider their postsecondary plans, as well as the need for conceptual models that incorporate ongoing, rather than discrete, decision-making in the transition to college.",

          "abstract": "Five years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this report examines the current state of the U.S. teaching profession using national survey data collected from PK-12 teachers in spring 2025. Results suggest cautious improvement in teacher morale, stress, mental health, and retention compared to 2023, indicating increased stabilization across the profession. However, persistent challenges remain, particularly related to workload, emotional exhaustion, student behavior, chronic absenteeism, and uneven parent support - especially for discipline. Differences across school types and poverty contexts reveal that teachers in traditional public, charter, and Title I schools continue to experience greater strain than their peers in private and hybrid school settings. Findings also highlight strong teacher support for cell phone bans, and growing but under-supported interest in using artificial intelligence in their instructional practice.",

          "authors": "Alzbeta Bartova; Thordis Reimer; Gerardo Meil; Pedro Romero-Balsas",
          "abstract": "Paid parenting leave (PPL) policies have become a central pillar of contemporary welfare states, supporting gender equality, labour market participation, child well-being, and long-term social sustainability. As these policies have expanded in scope, duration and objectives, however, the terminology used to describe them has evolved unevenly across countries, international organisations, databases and academic research.\n\nThis Policy Brief argues that terminology is not merely a semantic or technical issue, but a core element of governance and knowledge production. The concepts used to name, classify and aggregate parenting leave entitlements shape how policies are designed, monitored, evaluated and compared. Inconsistent terminology weakens cross-national comparability, obscures policy effects and undermines evidence-based policymaking.\n\nDrawing on a comprehensive review of international regulations, comparative databases, national terminologies and academic research, the brief demonstrates that traditional distinctions between maternity, paternity and parental leave no longer adequately capture the diversity and complexity of contemporary leave systems. While diversity in national terminology is both inevitable and normatively meaningful, the absence of a harmonised comparative framework has become a major obstacle to effective monitoring, policy learning and research synthesis.\n\nThe brief concludes that harmonisation of terminology at national level is neither feasible nor desirable, but that harmonised terminology for comparative and monitoring purposes is essential. It proposes the systematic use of an umbrella concept of parenting leave, disaggregated by entitlement type, while always retaining national legal terms and contextual specificity.",

This article reports insights based on an exploratory qualitative case study of airport policing of corruption by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar) at a regional Dutch airport. Grounded in a theoretical understanding of corruption as a socially constructed and discursively mediated phenomenon shaped by institutional logics, professional identities, and operational constraints, we draw on in-depth interviews with KMar officers (N=12) and participant observations (N=3) to deliver a “thick” description of how airport KMar officers perceive, define, and make sense of the nature of corruption, and how this perception affects their work practices in policing corruption. Two distinct logics – socially-reinforced moral licensing and integrity-draining demands – constitute this process of social construction, leading to blind spots in policing and paradoxical moral hazards for officers to engage in corruption. These novel insights expand prior research on the process of social construction of corruption and corruptibility in security forces, with important implications for theory and practice.",

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

Digital platforms offering online post-divorce help may provide scalable, affordable, and accessible support for divorcees during this transition. The study examined the long-term effects (five years) of a post-divorce targeted digital mental health intervention on divorcee’s labor market attachment and income. Participants (n=1,856) were divorcees from a nationally administered randomized controlled trial (RCT) tracked over a five-year period post their RCT participation using Danish national register data. Cumulative and by-year effects of treatment on labor market income, weeks on sick leave benefits, weeks on welfare benefits, and share of year unemployed were obtained using linear and count models. The study protocol was preregistered. Over the follow up period, participants in the treatment group spent fewer weeks on sick leave benefits and accumulated higher labor market income. By-year estimates for labor market income passed preregistered significance levels, but accumulated effects estimates and estimates for sick leave benefits did not. Digital health interventions may be a low-cost, high scalability way to address negative life consequences of divorce. However, more—and higher powered—research projected are needed to obtain better knowledge of their full potential.",

          "abstract": "Purpose – This study examines the de-escalation techniques police officers employ during everyday encounters with civilians and assesses how the use of these techniques varies when civilians exhibit different emotional and behavioral states. \nDesign/methodology/approach – We systematically analyzed body-worn camera footage from 82 real-life police-civilian interactions in the Netherlands, coding 35 distinct de-escalation techniques. Using Firth’s logistic regression with cluster bootstrap, we assessed differences in technique use for interactions involving civilians showing intoxicated, incomprehensible, or heightened emotional behavior, compared to interactions with civilians not exhibiting these behaviors. \nFindings – Officers employed the full range of de-escalation techniques, most frequently utilizing communication strategies. The use of specific techniques varied with the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states. For 22 de-escalation techniques, the odds that officers use them proved to be either significantly higher or lower in the investigated types of interactions. Sixteen techniques were specific for one type of interaction (e.g., civilian showing incomprehensible behavior), while six were significant for more than one type of interaction. Most differences were observed in interactions with civilians exhibiting heightened emotional behavior, where, for example, the odds of officers remaining calm were higher compared to interactions with civilians not showing such behaviors.\nOriginality/value – Few studies have examined officer de-escalation techniques in real-life interactions using body-worn camera footage. This study advances our understanding of what de-escalation entails in daily practice and how officers adapt their techniques to the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states.",

          "abstract": "This article challenges dominant views that partisanship informs the formation of social relationships and that ordinary Republicans and Democrats loathe each other. Evidence for these claims generally comes from studies in which respondents reject fictitious out-partisans. However, in most encounters, partisanship is often invisible, or ambiguous, and few people care about it. Using an original survey module, we show that only 15 percent of respondents know the partisanship of a recently met acquaintance, and few consider it important. Selection experiments further show that preferences for co-workers, neighbors, and recreational partners are barely shaped by politics: when partisanship is invisible, people seldom seek it out. Only when presented with explicit information about partisanship -- which is rare in everyday life -- do partisan preferences emerge. These results temper concerns about widespread out-partisan avoidance, and reveal limitations of survey experiments. While partisan labels evoke hostility, actual out-partisans seldom do.",

          "abstract": "Background: Improving students’ diet is a public health priority, yet interventions often fail to address the structural barriers students face, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings. This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets.  \nMethods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). \nResults: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively).\nConclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations. One major challenge that warrants further investigation is the capacity of stakeholders to implement such proposals, and to evaluate their effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Hector Cebolla-Boado; Alvaro Suarez; Michael Borchgrevink Lund",
          "abstract": "Research on migrant perinatal outcomes has much focused on how and why migration protects against unhealthy low birth weights, often overlooking the emerging risk of fetal macrosomia among immigrant populations. We propose a multi-sited, life-course framework that links early-life exposure to nutritional deprivation in mothers' countries of origin to perinatal outcomes in destination. Using unconditional quantile regression on Spanish birth registry microdata linked with historical FAO nutritional series, we reveal a dual pattern: immigrant status confers protection at the lower tail of the birthweight distribution but predicts excessive growth at the upper tail. To explain this paradox, we test competitive nutritional mechanisms. We find that adjusting for historical caloric availability yields null results, ruling out simple energy-deficit hypotheses. In contrast, adjusting for the scarcity of key macronutrients—specifically Fats and proteins—attenuates the macrosomia risk by nearly 80% at the 95th percentile. This validates a qualitative nutritional mismatch mechanism: metabolic efficiency programmed by early lipid scarcity becomes maladaptive in the obesogenic destination environment. Heterogeneity analyses confirm that this mechanism is specific to populations undergoing drastic lipid transitions such as Latin Americans, highlighting the enduring biological legacy of origin-country nutritional ecologies.",

We explore the sociological processes through which precarious labor markets and entrepreneurial discourses have reshaped artistic subjectivities. Artists today navigate fragmented careers marked by overwork, uncertainty, and excessive self-promotion, while simultaneously reinterpreting ideals like autonomy, creativity, and authenticity through entrepreneurial lenses. We underscore the ambivalence artists experience in engagements with entrepreneurialism: some embracing it as a pathway to fulfillment, while others critique its alignment with market logics. By situating entrepreneurialism within broader cultural and structural contexts, we reveal the ways that it naturalizes precarious conditions and reinforces individual responsibility for success. Ultimately, this work calls for critical engagement with the entrepreneurial spirit that shapes modern art worlds and emphasizes the need to address structural inequalities in creative industries.",

          "authors": "Panchami Jose; Moumita Koley",
          "abstract": "This article discusses how neoliberal market forces and the increasing dominance of ranking frameworks shape doctoral education in private universities in India. Based on thematic analysis of interviews with 25 doctoral students from three private institutions and analysis of policy documents on research incentives of 11 private universities, this study examines how processes of neoliberalisation along with the old hierarchical social relations shape the everyday conditions of doctoral work in private universities. We show how stipends, fees, working hours, publication mandates, and incentive structures function not simply as academic requirements but also as mechanisms of financial extraction, labour control, and institutional branding. In doing so, we argue that doctoral students in private universities are systematically positioned as low-cost, multi-purpose labour pools whose contributions are mobilised to compete in the academic market. This pressure includes pressure to generate ‘publishable units’ in a short time frame. Here, the private universities instrumentalise student research to climb ranking ladders and transform it into a scheme of metric accumulation and institutional branding. By analysing how national metrics are translated into internal incentive formulas and contractual arrangements, the study contributes to debates on academic capitalism and audit culture. The article adds to literature on neoliberalisation of higher education and describes how the Indian case both resonates with global trends and presents specificities shaped by the sudden expansion of private universities and national rankings.",

Using comprehensive data on congressional staffers from 2008-2022, we find increased turnover in Democratic offices relative to Republican offices. Subsequent staffing patterns also shifted: Democratic offices experienced declines in observable human capital (legislative experience and educational attainment) and increased reliance on temporary staff. These changes were further accompanied by reductions in the racial and gender diversity of congressional staff. Taken together, these findings suggest that workplace disruptions can degrade institutional capacity by reshaping the composition and continuity of the congressional workforce.

          "authors": "Kenjin B. Chang; Abby Fammartino; Timothy Mateer; Vidita Save; Lori Rosman; Nancy M. Wells",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Research on institutional dining interventions often emphasizes the potential of behavior-change strategies to prime individuals toward healthier, more sustainable diets. While these solutions can be effective in shifting diner behavior, their ability to contribute to larger food systems transformation ultimately depends on how likely prospective implementers are to adopt and maintain them. With a focus on university foodservice, we explore the role of intervention acceptability in institutional dining research by identifying the indicators used to evaluate this dimension of intervention performance and examining how their incorporation aligns with the values of decision-making stakeholders.\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review to identify the metrics used to measure the acceptability of institutional dining interventions. After thematically arranging these metrics into indicator groups, we calculated the frequency with which individual acceptability indicators were reported and then asked foodservice stakeholders to rank those indicators based on relative importance. \nResults: From the 116 included studies, we identified eight acceptability indicators evaluating the impacts of institutional dining interventions on (1) diner experience, (2) dietary health, (3) dietary sustainability, (4) food prices, (5) operating costs, (6) staff satisfaction, (7) institutional sustainability, and (8) organizational culture. While most studies included some metric of intervention acceptability, the frequency with which individual acceptability indicators were reported varied by theme, with more studies evaluating changes in organizational culture than all other indicators combined. However, the frequency with which acceptability indicators were reported was not predictive of how indicators were perceived by decision-making stakeholders. Rather, seldom-reported themes, like diner experience, were rated as more important while frequently reported themes, like organizational culture, were rated as less important.\nDiscussion: Efforts to align institutional dining research with the goals of foodservice stakeholders are needed to scale these solutions across institutions. Our findings demonstrate how current evaluation approaches fail to consistently represent the priorities of the decision makers responsible for managing foodservice change. To accelerate the adoption of institutional dining interventions, institutional dining research must move beyond assessing changes in food choice alone and recruit evaluation frameworks that consider the indicators of intervention acceptability prospective implementers care about.",

Using matched survey and register data on the population of transgender individuals who have changed their legal sex in Denmark, we investigate the relationship between passing and outcomes related to mental health, social life, and education and the labour market. Our findings confirm that higher levels of passing are associated with increasingly favourable outcomes across all domains. Individuals who pass to a high degree report less life dissatisfaction, fewer suicidal thoughts, less social isolation, and fewer difficulties in daily life settings. Higher passing is also associated with substantial educational and labour market advantages, including increased employment rates, particularly for trans men.

          "abstract": "This paper provides a methodological contribution to the study of historical income inequality by examining the construction and use of social tables for the nineteenth century. In a period when modern household surveys were absent, social tables represent one of the only feasible approaches for providing distributional evidence for the entire population. At the same time, existing studies rely on a wide range of assumptions, classifications, and data treatments, which makes comparisons across countries and over time difficult. The paper reviews the main methodological challenges involved in constructing social tables, including class definitions, within-group inequality, units of analysis, and the external validation of income levels and subsistence benchmarks. Using simulations and historical examples, it shows how alternative methodological choices can generate substantial differences in inequality estimates. It finally proposes a set of guiding principles and template structures aimed at improving comparability, while still preserving the country-specific nature of historical evidence.

In this paper, we develop a novel strategy for identifying intersex individuals using ICD-10 diagnostic codes in population-wide health registers. Applying this approach to Danish data spanning 1994-2022, we provide the first population-level examination of the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders in the intersex population. We identify intersex traits in 1.6% of the Danish population - rising to 2.5% among the 1994-2022 birth cohorts, for whom diagnostic data cover the entirety of their lives. We disaggregate the intersex population into six subgroups based on the type of intersex-related diagnoses and examine the risk of fourteen clusters of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across all subgroups, the risk of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders is substantially elevated relative to the endosex population, although specific risk profiles vary: some subgroups show broad elevations across disorder categories, whilst others exhibit more selective patterns. These patterns persist after controlling for age and assigned sex, as well as after the inclusion of sibling fixed effects. Our findings highlight the need for mental health support tailored to individuals with intersex traits. Our ICD-based identification strategy addresses longstanding methodological barriers to intersex research and offers a replicable approach for population-level research beyond mental health and across contexts with comparable health data.",

This paper argues that such narratives create a neglected externality: by emphasizing individual effort and downplaying structural constraints, they shift poverty explanations toward personal blame and fuel aporophobia—aversion toward the poor—and related exclusionary attitudes. A conceptual framework links aporophobia to contractualist ideas of reciprocity and social membership, and a simple belief‑formation model formalizes the mechanism. Using cross‑country data from the World Values Survey and a U.S. experiment, the study shows that stronger meritocratic beliefs correlate with attributing poverty to laziness and with harsher attitudes toward immigrants. A luck‑focused informational prime produces varied behavioral responses in a dictator game and interacts with meritocratic beliefs in shaping sensitivity to need. The findings underscore how narratives shape deservingness and suggest that reducing poverty requires challenging the normative assumptions embedded in meritocratic framings.",

          "abstract": "Ethnic conflicts are a major threat to global peace and security and have historically caused immense human suffering. To explain ethnic conflict, research has identified ethnic power relations (EPR) as particularly relevant. Accordingly, ethnic conflicts are the result of competing ethno-nationalist claims to state power. If politically relevant ethnic groups are not appropriately represented in the government, they are likely to develop grievances and in turn mobilize for rebellion. Research on ethnic power relations has evolved into a comprehensive research field, which led to the creation of numerous datasets, aggregated into the EPR-data family. The paper advances empirical research on ethnic power relations by providing new data, which allows more fine-grained and dynamic conceptualization and measurement of the phenomenon. I introduce the Ethnic Composition of African Governments (ECAG) dataset, which provides individual-level data on the ethnic affiliation of more than 11,000 ministers. It includes 37 African countries each covered monthly from independence until December 2019. The paper illustrates how the data can be used to compute measures of (proportional) representation of ethnic groups and highlights crucial differences to the established EPR-data family, which relies on expert evaluation of ethnic group’s access to state power. Additionally, I provide a case study of how ethnic power-relations influenced the outbreak of the Tigray war in Ethiopia, highlighting the issue of token representation.",

          "abstract": "Research on migrant perinatal outcomes has much focused on how and why migration protects against unhealthy low birth weights, often overlooking the emerging risk of fetal macrosomia among immigrant populations. We propose a multi-sited, life-course framework that links early-life exposure to nutritional deprivation in mothers' countries of origin to perinatal outcomes in destination. Using unconditional quantile regression on Spanish birth registry microdata linked with historical FAO nutritional series, we reveal a dual pattern: immigrant status confers protection at the lower tail of the birthweight distribution but predicts excessive growth at the upper tail. To explain this paradox, we test competitive nutritional mechanisms. We find that adjusting for historical caloric availability yields null results, ruling out simple energy-deficit hypotheses. In contrast, adjusting for the scarcity of key macronutrients—specifically Fats and proteins—attenuates the macrosomia risk by nearly 80% at the 95th percentile. This validates a qualitative nutritional mismatch mechanism: metabolic efficiency programmed by early lipid scarcity becomes maladaptive in the obesogenic destination environment. Heterogeneity analyses confirm that this mechanism is specific to populations undergoing drastic lipid transitions such as Latin Americans, highlighting the enduring biological legacy of origin-country nutritional ecologies.",

While moral motivations are important for some participants, they have proven inadequate; here we urge a focus on people’s immediate material interests. We build upon recent proposals to center “transformative adaptation”. Unlike shallower forms of climate adaptation, transformative adaptation involves major changes to social and economic relations. We argue that campaigns for transformative adaptation could grow climate mobilization because they can accomplish five goals at once: deliver direct material benefits, appeal to a politically diverse public, foster democratic and equitable institutions, increase climate resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

          "abstract": "This article challenges dominant views that partisanship informs the formation of social relationships and that ordinary Republicans and Democrats loathe each other. Evidence for these claims generally comes from studies in which respondents reject fictitious out-partisans. However, in most encounters, partisanship is often invisible, or ambiguous, and few people care about it. Using an original survey module, we show that only 15 percent of respondents know the partisanship of a recently met acquaintance, and few consider it important. Selection experiments further show that preferences for co-workers, neighbors, and recreational partners are barely shaped by politics: when partisanship is invisible, people seldom seek it out. Only when presented with explicit information about partisanship -- which is rare in everyday life -- do partisan preferences emerge. These results temper concerns about widespread out-partisan avoidance, and reveal limitations of survey experiments. While partisan labels evoke hostility, actual out-partisans seldom do.",

          "abstract": "The occupational aspirations young people hold steer their educational decisions and guide their labor market trajectories, thereby channeling them into aspiration-specific socioeconomic pathways. They have long been understood as central in the intergenerational transmission of (dis)advantage. Yet aspirations on the level of detailed occupations, and their dependence on parental occupations, have received little attention. This is because conventional accounts treat aspiration formation as rank-seeking, suggesting that adolescents seek status or prestige as a function of parental standing, with higher parental positions resulting in adolescents aspiring higher. Using recent data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) and recent advances in the statistical modelling of network-type data, we show that aspirations are more than abstract socioeconomic ambition; they are distinctly role-seeking, with adolescents aspiring to specific occupations. Young people envision their future work lives in terms of explicit jobs and occupational roles. These occupationally anchored aspirations vary systematically with parental occupations, and this variation exists far beyond occupational ranks. Focusing on the occupation-to-occupation links between parents and children reveals a stronger intergenerational link than previously recognized, indicates aspiration formation to be more stratified than conventionally assumed, and opens new avenues for understanding the intergenerational transmission of inequality.",

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding these\nphenomena through the lens of active inference and the free energy principle. We argue that\nprospect theory's central features are consistent with computationally efficient solutions to decisionmaking\nunder uncertainty within the thermodynamic constraints of neural computation. Loss\naversion implements adaptive precision-weighting of prediction errors, allocating greater\ncomputational resources to negative deviations that threaten survival. Reference dependence\nimplements efficient predictive coding, transmitting only surprising deviations from expectations.\nProbability weighting reflects optimal precision allocation across the probability range when\nmaintaining full Bayesian representations would exceed metabolic budgets. This framework is\nsupported by converging evidence: neuroimaging studies show unified value coding with\nasymmetric precision for losses; pharmacological manipulations reveal dissociable neurotransmitter\nsystems for value encoding versus loss sensitivity; and metabolic manipulations including hypoxia,\nglucose depletion, and circadian mismatch modulate prospect theory parameters in predicted\ndirections. Developmental evidence shows that children display probability weighting patterns\nopposite to adults, with gradual transformation through experience pointing at calibration rather\nthan to genetic determination. We propose that prospect theory patterns reflect how biological\nsystems navigate uncertainty under fundamental energetic constraints, with implications for\nunderstanding decision-making architecture and reconceptualizing rationality.",

These categories demonstrate senior leaders are intentional actors who rework private sector logic to fit functional nonprofit needs, bridging the dual demands for commercial efficiency and social impact.

Through advertisements, slogans, in-house incentive programs and company policies, the Company has achieved what could be described as a shift in employee attitudes towards working using video mediated communication channels – so-called video meetings. The shift is however, far from comprehensive and this consciously constructed understanding of video-mediated communication co-exists and conflicts with multiple other meanings both explicit, implicit and purposefully ignored.

          "authors": "Mario Cardano",
          "abstract": "The paper reflects on the use of the evidential paradigm in ethnographic research. Ethnography, and social research more broadly, must address the invisibility of action's meaning and the definitions of situation. For accessing these \"internal states\"—beliefs, meanings, values—a semiotic orientation toward reading traces, signs, clues, and minor details is essential. The specificity of this reading practice emerges through comparison with medical diagnosis, revealing a critical difference: unlike patients who collaborate in diagnosis, research participants deploy dissimulation and simulation as self-protection. Drawing on Becker's insight that participants orient performances toward more consequential audiences (superiors, peers) rather than ethnographers, and Anteby's analysis of resistance strategies, the paper demonstrates how the evidential paradigm addresses this opacity through attention to \"expressions given off\" and unwitting testimonies. The paper subsumes the evidential paradigm under abductive logic, thereby addressing Ginzburg's ostensible resistance to this framing. Ethnographic fieldwork becomes the theatre where evidential paradigm and abductive inference operate together. Following Peirce's classical definition, enriched by Walton and Eco's contributions, the paper adopts Eco's distinction of three abductive types: overcoded, undercoded, and creative. Each type is illustrated through Sherlock Holmes' adventures—Ginzburg's exemplar of the evidential paradigm—and through the author's ethnographic studies on nature sacralization in Italian communities and childhood vaccine hesitancy across seven European countries. The paper concludes that the evidential paradigm guides the ethnographer's gaze toward marginal details and unwitting testimonies that trigger abductive reasoning—the core engine of ethnographic practice.\nKeywords: Evidential paradigm, Ethnography, Abductive reasoning\nForthcoming in Sociologica vol. 20, num. 1, 2026",

Grounded in a life-course and developmental perspective, this study explores the heterogeneity within a group of Portuguese NEETs with three main objectives: (i) to characterise the psychological functioning of NEETs; (ii) to identify distinct psychological profiles; and (iii) to examine how these profiles relate to other variables with well-being and mental health.\nMethod: A sample of 241 NEETs (18-29 years) from the Porto Metropolitan Area completed standardised measures of stress, quality of life, perceived social support, resilience, and behavioural problems. \nResults: A cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Psychologically Adaptive (34.0%), Moderately Vulnerable (46.5%), and Psychosocially Vulnerable (19.5%). These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors. \nConclusion: Findings support the view that NEETs are not a psychologically homogeneous group, highlighting the cumulative effects of disadvantage and the protective role of psychosocial resources. Unpacking this heterogeneity provides new insights for research and strengthens the design of more tailored, developmentally sensitive interventions and policies.",

          "authors": "Alec Cali",
          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is often characterized as a lack of scientific literacy or as a consequence of anti-scientific thinking. To expand beyond the scope of these individual-level explanations, this article undertakes a more comprehensive examination of hesitancy as a rational response to the confluence of two factors: first the hegemonic ideology of neoliberal health, and second perceptions of diminished institutional reliability. The present study draws on focus groups conducted after the height of the COVD-19 pandemic to investigate the political and economic logics underpinning vaccine refusal. The analysis indicates that participants employ a sophisticated understanding of the health system and political economic beliefs when determining the reliability of individuals and the health decisions to be made. Participants cited the opioid crisis, the revolving door, and perceived disenfranchisement as evidence that public health is undermined by \"elite capture\" and corporate profiteering. It is argued that these perspectives align with prevailing neoliberal ideologies, culminating in the emergence of a \"biological consumer patient.\" This study posits that vaccine hesitancy functions not merely as anti-scientific refusal but as a strategic navigation technique through a healthcare system defined by neoliberal responsibilization and perceived institutional failure.",

          "authors": "Xin Hong",
          "abstract": "In April 2024, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) experienced its heaviest rainfall in 75 years, which triggered widespread urban flooding and prolonged disruptions. This study assesses the spatial impact and post-rainfall recovery of the event using the U-Net deep learning architecture on daily PlanetScope satellite imagery captured on a pre-rainfall date and on a series of post-rainfall dates between 14 and 27 April 2024. Multi-temporal land use and land cover (LULC) classifications were generated using a U-Net model trained via transfer learning, and the LULC categories were water, vegetation, built area, and bare ground. The multi-temporal LULC classifications were further applied for change detection analyses to map flooded areas and track temporal recovery across LULC categories. The U-Net model for LULC classification achieved over 95% overall accuracy and a Kappa statistic of 0.927. The change detection and inundation recovery showed that approximately 23.8 km² —nearly 10 times the area of Downtown Dubai—was flooded. The flood affected the built area and bare ground most, while vegetation exhibited higher flood resilience. Although rainfall ended by April 17, 95% of flooded areas remained submerged three days later, and 37% were still underwater by day ten. These findings reveal the limitations of urban drainage systems in Dubai and the value of high-temporal remote sensing and deep learning for flood monitoring. This study offers a practical and replicable framework to support urban flood risk assessment, resilience planning, and climate adaptation in the Persian Gulf region, characterized by rapid urbanization and fragile arid environments similar to Dubai.",

          "abstract": "In any product whose evaluation involves taste factors, subjectivity is a determining factor. For this reason, a rating or evaluation system is sometimes proposed to help potential consumers navigate different decision-making alternatives. In recent decades, the wine sector has been characterized by the use of ratings issued by specialized critics. This access channel serves as a means of knowledge for potential customers who have not physically seen the product and who, upon seeing the ratings received by these critics, see them as an influential factor in their final decision-making. Making a decision based on the numerical rating given by a wine reviewer after tasting a wine, where the wine is awarded the maximum score (100 points), can have a positive influence on the consumer's decision. However, not all critics, and consequently their ratings, have the same relevance to the final buyer. This work designed a methodology and proposed a formulation that objectively assesses the real influence of a wine's highest rating by a critic, based on its increased online visibility, search volume, and references in digital media. Several indicators were designed to compare the influence of different critics' scores over a time horizon of one to four weeks after a wine received its highest rating. The study examined whether the highest rating awarded by a specialized wine reviewer has the same impact in all cases or whether it depends on the critic. It also determined the duration of its influence over time.",

Using longitudinal bibliometric data from Scopus covering more than 32 million researchers, this study provides a global assessment of how the pandemic disrupted international researcher mobility between 2020 and 2022. Pandemic-related “lost mobility” is estimated using counterfactual trend extrapolation based on pre-2020 trajectories. International researcher mobility fell short of expected levels by an estimated 14,703 movements (±2,791), corresponding to a 3.7% loss. Although observed mobility rebounded by 2022, it remained below counterfactual trends. Effects varied widely across countries and were asymmetric: losses in incoming mobility were strongly associated with destination-country COVID-19 policy stringency and political regime type, whereas outgoing mobility showed no comparable relationship. These findings underscore the institutionally mediated nature of scientific mobility during global crises.",

          "abstract": "Educational inequalities in childlessness have grown across cohorts. It remains unclear to what extent this development was driven by a decline in resources and abilities in groups with low education. Using high-quality Norwegian population registers (n=683,882 men born 1963-1991), we find that increasing educational inequalities in childlessness are mirrored by growing educational gaps in employment participation and income. Educational groups have diverged on resources (parental income rank) but converged on abilities (relative cognitive ability). Regression models show that changes in the composition of educational groups in terms of parental income explain 6%-7% of the growth in educational gaps in childlessness, employment participation and income. In contrast, gaps in life outcomes would have grown more than observed had educational groups not converged on cognitive abilities. We conclude that relative education-specific changes in financial resources and cognitive abilities explain little, if any, of the growing educational inequalities in the life outcomes studied.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nMedical Data Integration Centers (DIZ) have been established at German university hospitals to collect, transfer, consolidate, and process routine clinical data and make it available for health research. Consideration of sex and gender benefits research and enhances the quality of medical care. We therefore argue that DIZ staff members need to be well-informed and knowledgeable about sex and gender aspects in clinical data. Only then they can inform about research quality gain and advise researchers on thoughtful selection of study cohorts, appropriate encoding of sex and gender information, and the benefits of considering gender distributions.\n\nObjective: \nThis work systematically analyzes the awareness of sex and gender among technical and scientific staff members at DIZ. The  survey will guide  future recommendations for handling sex and gender aspects in clinical research. \n\nMethods: \nUsing an online survey, we assess how  knowledgeable DIZ staff currently are regarding sex, gender and gender scores. The survey  was distributed in February 2024 to all 38 DIZ in Germany via a national mailing list. It was structured into three topics: (1) perception of  sex and gender in medical research, (2) consideration of sex and gender during data collection, and (3) consideration of sex and gender in data use and reuse. We analyzed the collected data with descriptive statistics and checked for correlation within the dataset.\n\nResults: \nAfter a four-week response period, 74 current employees had fully completed the questionnaire and an additional 62 had partially completed it. The survey results show a lack of knowledge and awareness regarding sex and gender aspects among DIZ employees indicated by a high amount of ``No\" and ``I don't know\" answers, specifically regarding sex- and gender-specific training, official recommendations, and team policies.\n\nConclusion: \nAs essential links between clinics and researchers, DIZ employees need targeted training on sex and gender aspects to better support and advise research efforts. We provide first recommendations for the different levels of administration to improve knowledge and awareness of sex and gender aspects in medical research data.",

The study reveals that\nwomen demonstrate significantly higher interest and participation in IRGY than men, especially\nthose engaged in housework/ casual wage work. A central benefit of IRGY for women lies in its\nrole in easing their entry or return to the labor market through flexible and locally available\nemployment provided by the government. In a context where female labor force participation has\nhistorically remained low, the paper shows how access to public employment can facilitate\nwomen’s participation in the labour force, expanding the pool of working women, not just\nredistributing work among those already employed, making IRGY a novel intervention in urban\nemployment policy.",

          "authors": "alessandro maresca",
          "abstract": "Contemporary climate governance is saturated with ethical language: intergenerational justice, the rights of future generations, planetary survival. Yet when one examines the instruments through which this governance is being assembled—green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, collateral frameworks—one finds a different register of obligation. This article distinguishes ethics, the universalising horizon that legitimates green finance, from morality, the obligations encoded in the exchange-forms of loans, bonds, and repo collateral—covenants, eligibility criteria, step-ups, verification protocols. Drawing on Strathern's relational anthropology, it analyses these instruments as devices that perform successive cuts: operations that sever ecological relations from their context, exteriorise obligations into detachable rights, and eclipse the conditions of their production. Each cut—from loan to bond to asset-backed security to repo collateral—reassigns responsibility from situated relations to increasingly impersonal infrastructures of circulation. With Guyer, the article tracks the temporalities these instruments enact: how coupon calendars, taxonomy reviews, and collateral eligibility compress planetary futures into sequences of near-term obligations—overnight rolls, quarterly reviews, annual KPIs—privileging continuous liquidity over thick, extended commitments. Drawing on Karatani's theory of exchange-forms, the analysis reads this trajectory as a rearticulation of the capital–nation–state complex at planetary scale, asking whether green finance opens toward new forms of association or remains enclosed within the inherited trinity. The apocalyptic register of climate discourse—tipping points, runaway warming, the end of the world—is taken seriously through de Martino's distinction between apocalypse with and without eschaton. Green finance, the article argues, stages a controlled apocalypse without eschaton: existential threats are converted into review cycles, covenants, and term sheets, while the decisive moment of world-refoundation is continually deferred. If a climate constitution is being written, it is being written in the moral language of eligibility, seniority, and pledgeability—under the ethical sign of planetary survival.",

          "authors": "Vishesh Leon Diengdoh",
          "abstract": "Multi-level governance (MLG) emphasises the importance of subnational institutions and actors in climate governance. From an MLG perspective, state legislatures and legislators in India represent potentially important but empirically underexamined sites of climate governance, given their roles in articulating local concerns, exercising policy oversight, and holding executive actors accountable. This study provides the first systematic synthesis of climate-related legislative discourse in India by examining over three decades (1993–2025) of legislative questions from the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Using a public corpus of 9,522 questions retrieved from the National eVidhan Application (NeVA) portal, the study applies an iteratively developed keyword-based annotation approach to distinguish between explicit climate discourse and implicit climate-relevant engagement. The findings show that explicit references to climate change are exceedingly rare, accounting for 0.06% of all legislative questions, consistent with the limited formal integration of state legislatures within India’s climate governance framework. In contrast, legislators frequently engage with climate-relevant sectors such as coal, flood, forests, and irrigation, framing these issues primarily through administrative and financial concerns rather than through climate change narratives. This pattern highlights the unrealised potential of subnational legislatures as sites of climate governance. By focusing on legislative attention and discourse, this study contributes new empirical evidence on subnational climate governance in the Global South and highlights opportunities for mainstreaming climate-change discourse within legislative processes.",

With the growing potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to reshape library collections, services, and workflows, public libraries must determine how to engage with these technologies while maintaining longstanding library values. Despite widespread discussion of AI’s impact on public libraries, to our knowledge there exists no published analysis of American and Canadian public library AI policies to date. In this paper, we address this gap first through an environmental scan of public library websites to identify publicly available AI policy statements. We then analyze these policy statements according to how they include library values. In our scan of over 200 library websites, we identified just 16 publicly available AI policies. ese policies all govern internal or staff usage rather than patron usage. All policies reference at least two library values, with privacy and security the most frequently cited.",

Cognitive dissonance occurs when people face situations that do not confirm their expectations. Past WT participants have protested that involuntary, inescapable, and harsh conditions harmed them through PTSD and subsequent dissociation. This argumentative study compares dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available information and scholarly literature. Using the confronting coercive WT model to illuminate these concerns, we argue that dissociation is a response recorded in the design of these WT practices and participant statements and is often mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments aligns with the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during WT is likely to be harmful and, given this potential, may be regarded as malpractice.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the evolution of urban imaginaries and their influence on infrastructure design, focusing on Japan as a case study. The futuristic visions of the 1970s, illustrated by Gunther Radtke and groups such as Archigram, celebrated speed, growth, and technology. By contrast, the ecological, economic, and social crises of the 21st century have fostered imaginaries centered on sobriety, resilience, and inclusivity. These shifts raise key questions: how can we reconcile past legacies with present challenges, and how can infrastructures anticipate the needs of a changing world?\nJapan, marked by demographic decline yet persistent large-scale technological projects, offers a privileged lens. Campaigns to dismantle obsolete infrastructures in rural areas show pragmatic adaptation, while the SCMaglev train embodies faith in technological progress. These tensions echo broader debates opposing advocates of ecological degrowth to defenders of modernization.\nThrough case studies on mobility, energy, and ecological infrastructures, the article shows how imaginaries shape design choices. It highlights the challenges and opportunities of transition toward sustainable and resilient models, stressing the importance of inclusive, transdisciplinary dialogue to define the values and priorities guiding future infrastructures in an uncertain world.",

          "abstract": "Formal early childcare has a strong equalizing potential, yet access remains socioeconomically stratified. This study examines how these socioeconomic inequalities emerge and widen across three stages of the formal early childcare access process: intention to use early childcare during pregnancy, application, and actual access during the child’s first year. Using longitudinal data on approximately 2,000 families in France, collected during pregnancy and followed one year after birth, we document a progressive widening of gaps along the access pathway. Compared with high–socioeconomic status (SES) households, low–SES households are about 18% less likely to intend to use early childcare, 25% less likely to apply, and 46% less likely to obtain access. To identify the determinants of these gaps, we combine machine learning for variable selection with decomposition analyses that quantify the contribution of observable factors at each stage across a wide range of 39 predictors. At the intention stage, most of the SES gap is accounted for by differences in observable characteristics related to resources, constraints, and available alternatives, with norms contributing little. At subsequent stages, inequalities increasingly reflect institutional barriers. The largest disparities emerge at the access stage, where spot allocation-related factors favoring higher-income, working, and earlier-applying households, and knowledge of the childcare system, account for most of the gap. Overall, the results show that socioeconomic stratification in early childcare access is closely linked to the timing and design of access processes, even in systems intended to be universal.",
