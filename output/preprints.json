          "abstract": "Interest in food noise has grown following reports that it decreases after treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). To support research in Hispanic persons, we translated the Ro Allison Indiana Dhurandhar Food Noise (RAID-FN) inventory into Spanish. The RAID-FN inventory assesses food noise across three domains: preoccupation with food, persistence, and dysphoria. Using a structured process guided by international recommendations for cultural and semantic accuracy, we translated both the 23-item long form and the 7-item short form. The process included forward translation by a bilingual scientist, expert review, back translation, and professional certification under international standards (ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 17100:2015). This Spanish translation will enable measurement of food noise in Hispanic persons, who have high rates of obesity and diabetes and increasing use of GLP-1 therapies. Future research will evaluate the psychometric properties of the RAID-FN instrument, extend the translation to multiple languages, and confirm its comparability across languages.",

          "authors": "Emily C. Kemp; Paul Frick; Taylor Miller; Julianne Speck; David Gertz; Zeying Du",
          "abstract": "Callous-unemotional (CU) traits, defined by deficient empathy and remorse, characterize a distinct subgroup of antisocial individuals with more severe behavioral problems and unique affective profiles. Two processes implicated in the development of CU traits are hyporeactivity to and inaccurate recognition of others’ emotions. Although many studies link CU traits to emotional processing deficits, findings have been inconsistent across age and sex. We conducted multilevel meta-analyses of emotional reactivity and recognition, accounting for age and sex as moderators, to clarify these discrepancies. A four-level meta-analysis indicated CU traits were negatively associated with emotional reactivity to both broad emotional stimuli (r = -.23, p &lt; .0001; k = 106, n = 402) and distress-specific stimuli (r = -.22, p &lt; .0001; k = 83, n = 234), with no moderation by age or sex. Similarly, a three-level meta-analysis showed CU traits were negatively associated with recognition accuracy for both broad facial emotions (r = -.09, p &lt; .0001; k = 97, n = 437) and distress (e.g., fear, sadness; r = -.10, p &lt; .0001; k = 60, n = 140). Sample age moderated broad (r = .003, p = .01) and distress (r = .004, p = .04) recognition deficits, such that effects diminished with sample age. These results have important implications for causal theories of CU traits and support emotional hyporreactivity as a core deficit that may cause delays in the development of emotion recognition abilities. Such developmental changes have implications for improving treatments for individuals with elevated CU traits.",

          "authors": "Yiqin Zhu; Kevin Trent; Beatris Garcia; Renee J. Thompson",
          "abstract": "A growing body of research has sought to understand the contextual factors that influence emotion regulation (ER) strategy choice. As a process that is usually involuntary to start and difficult to end, perseverative thought (PT) can be an ongoing context that influences how individuals respond to emotions. This study investigated how different PT dimensions, captured through written language, predicted subsequent ER strategy choice, including engagement (i.e., reappraisal, acceptance, and problem-solving) and disengagement (i.e., experiential avoidance, distraction, and expressive suppression) strategies. College students (N=413) completed an experimental paradigm once a day for ten days. Each night, they underwent a PT induction writing task and were instructed to regulate (to feel better) and report their ER strategy use (1 = selected; 0 = not selected). We used the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count program to construct PT dimensions and multilevel logistic regressions to examine links between each PT dimension and subsequent ER strategy choice. Within individuals, higher negative valence predicted more subsequent distraction. Higher self-focus predicted a bigger likelihood of avoiding internal experiences and suppressing expressions. Higher situation certainty, more social words, and more past focus during PT predicted a lower likelihood of problem solving. Overall, the findings support PT dimensions as important contextual features for ER strategy choice, and highlight the benefits of computational linguistics and a dimensional approach to study PT.",

          "title": "The \"Feeling\" of Inattention: A Novel Perspective on the Mind Wandering-ADHD Link",
          "authors": "Liam Yeo; Emma Fernando; Nicholaus P. Brosowsky",
          "abstract": "Mind wandering is frequently associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the precise nature of this relationship remains elusive. The current study applies a novel approach from mind wandering research to the context of ADHD, distinguishing between remembered mind wandering (explicitly recalling off-task thoughts) and subjective feelings of inattention (sensing one's mind has wandered without recalling specific thoughts). We investigated how these distinct aspects of inattention relate to ADHD symptomatology and well-being. Participants from university and online ADHD communities completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) incorporating our thought probe methodology, along with measures of ADHD symptoms and well-being. Results revealed a double dissociation: subjective feelings of inattention predicted overall ADHD symptomatology, inattention symptoms, and measures of well-being and daily impairment, while remembered mind wandering only predicted hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Our findings suggest that the link between mind wandering and ADHD is best characterized as an association between subjective feelings of inattention and inattention symptoms. We propose that this association can be explained in terms of executive dysfunction, which may underlie both increased subjective feelings of inattention and symptoms of ADHD. This nuanced perspective provides novel insights into the complex relationship between mind wandering and ADHD, underscoring the importance of considering multiple dimensions of inattention in both research and clinical contexts.",

          "authors": "Luis Eduardo Garrido; Lara Lee Russell-Lasalandra; Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly inform psychometric practice through item generation and semantic analysis, embedding-based approaches offer a pre-empirical pathway for assessing dimensional structure before human response data become available. However, the methodological choices used to recover dimensions from embedding spaces remain underexamined. The present study compared the performance of principal component analysis (PCA), which currently dominates generative psychometric applications, with network-based exploratory graph analysis (EGA) for estimating dimensional structure from item embeddings. Using Monte Carlo simulations across six personality facets nested within two domains, we generated 180 items per condition via LLM prompting and represented them as semantic embeddings. Dimensional recovery was evaluated across four analytic pipelines: Kaiser's rule with PCA extraction and varimax rotation, parallel analysis with PCA extraction and varimax rotation, EGA, and EGA combined with network-integrated item filtering. Results showed that PCA-based methods severely overestimated dimensionality and yielded poorer recovery of the generating structure. EGA demonstrated markedly improved performance relative to PCA-based approaches, whereas EGA combined with network filtering procedures achieved near-perfect dimensional accuracy and structural recovery. These findings indicate that network psychometric workflows provide more accurate structural representations than component-based approaches when analyzing embedding spaces, with direct implications for generative psychometric workflows in which item pools are evaluated prior to data collection. More broadly, the findings demonstrate that analytic choices made during pre-empirical assessment have substantive consequences for item selection, construct validity, taxonomic clarity, and downstream theoretical interpretation.",

          "title": "Limits to intuition in number compositionality:  the case of multiplicative commutativity",
          "authors": "Marie Amalric; Elizabeth Spelke; Manuela Piazza",
          "abstract": "Commutativity—the principle that operand order does not affect the result of an operation—is a core feature of two foundational operations of arithmetic: addition and multiplication. Recent theories propose that such compositional structures emerge from an innate “language of thought” that enables abstract principles to apply flexibly across symbolic and non-symbolic formats. While children possess early intuitions about additive commutativity, less is known about their grasp of the commutativity of multiplication. Here, we ask whether children’s understanding of the commutative principle of multiplication stems from pre-existing intuitions that the order in which sets are grouped does not matter, or whether it instead emerges from reasoning about structural relations among numerical symbols. We tested 8- to 9-year-old children in a number comparison game, probing their understanding of multiplicative commutativity in both symbolic expressions (3x2 = 2x3) and in non-symbolic sets of grouped dots. On average, children performed better with symbolic expressions than with non-symbolic arrays. Moreover, their performance on the arrays of grouped dots was directly linked to their mastery of commutativity in symbolic expressions, and independent of their intuitive, non-symbolic numerosity estimation skills. To probe children’s developing mastery of the commutativity of multiplication, a subset of the children were given brief training on commutativity and played the same game in a second session, 2 to 14 days later. Children who, in the first session, did not master the commutative principle with symbolic stimuli showed improvement on symbolic trials, while those with high initial symbolic commutativity mastery improved on non-symbolic trials. These findings suggest that symbolic learning acts as a gateway for children to apply the principle of commutativity of multiplication to concrete contexts. Moreover, they provide evidence for format- and operation-specific limits to children’s mastery of the compositional structure of the natural number system.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently experience internalizing and externalizing problems, but their developmental patterns and predictors remain unclear. This study examined age trends and subgroup differences to inform individualized intervention efforts. Methods: Data from 1,841 children with NF1 (ages 3-18) were combined from nine institutions using integrative data analysis. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed with parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; N = 1,087) and Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC; N = 754), which were analyzed separately. Time-varying effect modeling was used to delineate the age trends of internalizing and externalizing problems for the total samples and for subgroups based on sex, NF1 heritability (familial vs. sporadic), the presence (vs. absence) of plexiform neurofibromas, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. Results: Across CBCL and BASC assessments, children with NF1 consistently exhibited elevated internalizing and externalizing problems compared to the normative means. The between-group gap in internalizing problems significantly widened with age, whereas the gap in externalizing problems remained relatively stable across ages. Age patterns for both types of problems were consistent across sex, NF1 heritability, and status of plexiform neurofibromas. Children with ADHD exhibited significantly higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems compared to those without ADHD, with the age trends of both problems also differing between the two groups. Conclusions: Internalizing and externalizing problems in NF1 persist during childhood and adolescence and are particularly elevated among children with ADHD. Findings highlight the need for early, sustained, and developmentally tailored interventions, with attention to co-occurring ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study presents the first Spanish-language validation of a stress induction method originally developed for English-speaking samples. The protocol, based on time pressure and performance feedback to elicit stress, was tested in a laboratory setting. Methods: A total of 60 participants from the general adult Spanish population were randomly assigned to either a stress (n = 30) or control condition (n = 30). The experimental group completed general knowledge and arithmetic tasks under time pressure with feedback, while the control group completed easier versions of the same tasks without time constraints and feedback. Participants rated their state anxiety on visual analogue scale and their emotional valence on Likert-type scale. The number of errors made was also assessed. Results: Participants in the control group showed significantly higher accuracy on the acute stress task than those in the experimental group. Stress responses also differed between groups: the experimental group reported significantly higher anxiety and lower emotional valence, indicating a more negative affective experience. Discussion: These findings support the validity of a culturally adapted acute stress protocol for Spanish-speaking population. The protocol highlights its potential for scalable applications in both clinical and educational contexts.",

          "authors": "Mary Newsome; Nicola L. de Souza; Gunes Avci; Darrell Zeno; Matthew Su; Kenneth Podell; Ana V. Durand-Sanchez; Bernd Figner; Elisabeth A. Wilde",
          "abstract": "Background. Cognitive decrements (executive function, processing speed) have been found in post-9/11 Veterans who have mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Decision making (DM) involves the coordination of cognitive sub-processes involving different brain regions known to be impacted by mTBI and/or PTSD, and so may be expected to be compromised. However, DM abilities, including DM that requires taking context into account, are not typically assessed or investigated in Veterans. The ability to incorporate context is important because it plays a role in almost every cognitive and social process.\nMethods. In the current study, Veterans with mTBI and comorbid PTSD (mTBI+PTSD) and Veterans without mTBI or PTSD performed the Cognitive Bias Task, a DM task in which participants are asked to make a decision based on preference, and the extent to which choices are influenced by contextual information is measured. To further understand any association between DM and mTBI+PTSD, participants also filled out questionnaires to measure postconcussive and PTSD symptoms. To limit heterogeneity in small samples, Veterans were screened to have: no TBI prior to deployment, mTBI due to blast only, current PTSD (diagnosed within 6 months), and be under 55 years of age.\nResults. While Veterans without mTBI+PTSD based their choices on the provided context, Veterans with mTBI+PTSD did not, p=.034), similar to individuals with severe TBI and frontal lesions. As expected, Veterans with mTBI+PTSD also demonstrated elevated scores on the symptom measures. Scores reflecting the extent to which context impacted decisions were significantly negatively associated with cognitive and somatic postconcussive and PTSD arousal symptoms across groups. \nConclusions. Veterans whose mTBI was due to only blast explosion(s) an average of 3.77 years after injury and who had active PTSD (mTBI+PTSD) and reported elevated cognitive and somatic postconcussive and arousal symptoms did not incorporate contextual information when making their decisions. Because understanding context is required in many everyday activities, if findings replicate in studies with larger samples, cognitive training for context assimilation may contribute to improving everyday life in Veterans.",

          "abstract": "Empathy, encompassing affective and cognitive components, is considered fundamental to understanding psychopathic traits and its relationship with facial emotion recognition. Nonetheless, existing evidence is inconsistent, reflecting variability in measurement approaches and limited use of ecologically valid tasks. We examined associations between empathy, psychopathic traits, and facial emotion recognition in 227 participants. Empathy was assessed using both self-report (Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy; QCAE) and performance-based measures (Multifaceted Empathy Test; MET). Psychopathic traits were measured with the Psychopathic Personality Traits Scale–Revised (PPTS-R). Facial emotion recognition was tested using dynamic stimuli across ten emotions. Affective empathy was negatively associated with psychopathic traits across both QCAE and MET. Cognitive empathy showed divergent patterns: self-reported cognitive empathy correlated negatively with psychopathic traits, whereas performance-based cognitive empathy did not. Facial emotion recognition was positively associated only with performance-based cognitive empathy, particularly for embarrassment. No significant associations emerged between psychopathic traits and facial emotion recognition. These findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating diverse assessment tools to investigate empathy, alongside self-report measures. The study further contributes to the existing literature on the relationships among empathy, psychopathic traits, and facial emotion recognition.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Counterspeech Trias Taxonomy, a comprehensive classification of counterspeech techniques against hate speech and other forms of incivility in social media.\nThe taxonomy categorizes counterspeech techniques into three primary psychological-functional domains, paralleling the behavioral, affective, and cognitive components of attitudes and persuasion: (1) Behavioral techniques appeal to social norms and evaluate behavior, (2) affective techniques influence through emotional engagement, and (3) cognitive techniques aim to change beliefs or understanding through information and reasoning.\nThe techniques were identified through a systematic literature review of English and German sources published between 2004 and June 2025, describing specific intervention techniques against hate speech and other forms of incivility. Through an iterative and inductive empirical-to-conceptual approach, 16 distinct techniques were identified and organized into seven strategies within the three overarching approaches.\nAn initial search conducted in March 2024 established the tripartite structure based on 44 sources. Two subsequent updates (November 2024 and June 2025) added 12 additional sources, resulting in a final sample of 56 articles.\nThe Counterspeech Trias Taxonomy clarifies the concept of counterspeech by detailing its elemental techniques, enabling a precise definition and facilitating systematic investigations into the effectiveness of different techniques. By providing a psychologically grounded framework, the taxonomy supports systematic investigation of counterspeech effectiveness and the development of evidence-based interventions to foster constructive online discourse and democratic participation. Furthermore, it offers a practical basis for educating community managers and citizen counter-speakers.",

          "authors": "Veronika Chernetska; Yael Millgram",
          "abstract": "Background: Suicidal thoughts affect approximately 10% of the population during their lifetime. In about one-third of cases, these thoughts persist, contributing to poorer health and elevated suicide risk. Emotion regulation deficits were found to be a central prospective risk factor for suicidal thought persistence. Still, little is known about the mechanisms driving these deficits. Difficulties in identifying causes of emotions could undermine emotion regulation by limiting the ability to target the source of distress. Recent cross-sectional evidence suggests that such difficulties are linked to the occurrence of suicidal thoughts. However, these associations were never examined longitudinally. This study tested whether difficulties in identifying the cause of negative emotions predicted the persistence and severity of suicidal thoughts over 6 weeks, and whether perceived regulatory success mediated this link. \nMethods: Participants who reported suicidal thoughts in the past week (N=138) completed baseline and 6-week follow-up assessments including questionnaires and Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs). Difficulties in identifying causes of emotions were assessed using EMAs and language processing. \nResults: Difficulties in identifying causes of negative emotions predicted greater persistence of suicidal thoughts at follow-up, even after accounting for initial suicidal thought severity and initial depressive and psychiatric symptoms. Mediation analysis revealed that this effect was partly accounted for by lower perceived success in emotion regulation. However, such difficulties did not predict suicidal thought severity. \nConclusion: Findings point to difficulties in identifying causes of emotions as a novel predictor for the persistence of suicidal thoughts, and as a potential target for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Affective touch offers numerous benefits for touchers and touchees, including emotional regulation. However, individuals are engaging in affective touch increasingly less, in part due to the digitalization of experiences, which motivates the question of whether the emotional benefits of affective touch can be conveyed in alternative ways, such as through different sensory modalities. With this in mind, we investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch gestures. In particular, participants in our five online experiments evaluated different sounds resulting from touch gestures performed by real romantically involved dyads. Experiment 1 provided an overview of the organic affective touch space. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues about the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited emotional responses with reduced positivity, similar to those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. Experiment 3 revealed that framing organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, rather than as object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Experiment 4 revealed that greater congruence between individuals’ expectations of the sounds of affective touch and the actual auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by the sounds. Experiment 5 replicated the effects of framing on the valence of elicited responses with a more salient experimental manipulation. These findings contribute to our understanding of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in the construction of its emotional space.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces Interdependence Acceptance (IA) (i.e., the disposition to embrace mutual reliance as a source of strength and resilience rather than a threat to autonomy or worth) and presents the development and validation of the Interdependence Acceptance Questionnaire (IAQ). Across four studies, we establish the IAQ’s psychometric robustness and demonstrate its relevance for psychological functioning. Factor analyses confirmed a consistent three-factor structure (Openness to Receiving Help, Valuing Cooperation, and Appreciation of Helping Others) with strong internal reliability in both French (Study 1) and English (Study 4) samples. Study 2 supported construct validity, revealing that IA correlated positively with connectedness to humanity, self-transcendence, and basic need satisfaction, and negatively with egocentrism and basic need frustration. Importantly, IA was associated with both competence and autonomy, suggesting that it shapes whether interdependence is experienced as ego-threatening or autonomy-supportive. Subdimension analyses further revealed that openness and cooperation are more closely tied to motivational and relational functioning, whereas appreciation of helping others reflects broader altruistic orientation. Finally, studies 3 and 4 demonstrated criterion validity, showing that IA predicts lower burnout in students and workers, and greater affective well-being in students. Beyond psychometric validation, this work discusses how IA may serve as a corrective to the cultural myth of radical self-reliance, suggesting that embracing mutual reliance can buffer anticipatory anxiety, guilt, and self-blame, while reframing autonomy as strengthened, rather than weakened, by interdependence. Together, our findings establish IA as a distinct psychological resource that promotes resilience, flourishing, and social cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Empathy, encompassing affective and cognitive components, is considered fundamental to understanding psychopathic traits and its relationship with facial emotion recognition. Nonetheless, existing evidence is inconsistent, reflecting variability in measurement approaches and limited use of ecologically valid tasks. We examined associations between empathy, psychopathic traits, and facial emotion recognition in 227 participants. Empathy was assessed using both self-report (Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy; QCAE) and performance-based measures (Multifaceted Empathy Test; MET). Psychopathic traits were measured with the Psychopathic Personality Traits Scale–Revised (PPTS-R). Facial emotion recognition was tested using dynamic stimuli across ten emotions. Affective empathy was negatively associated with psychopathic traits across both QCAE and MET. Cognitive empathy showed divergent patterns: self-reported cognitive empathy correlated negatively with psychopathic traits, whereas performance-based cognitive empathy did not. Facial emotion recognition was positively associated only with performance-based cognitive empathy, particularly for embarrassment. No significant associations emerged between psychopathic traits and facial emotion recognition. These findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating diverse assessment tools to investigate empathy, alongside self-report measures. The study further contributes to the existing literature on the relationships among empathy, psychopathic traits, and facial emotion recognition.",

          "abstract": "The prevailing consensus in the psychological literature regarding the construct of meaning in life typically aligns with a tripartite perspective. In this article, we advance theoretical arguments and present empirical evidence that challenge this prevailing view, arguing that the self-transcendent nature of meaning in life has been overlooked, particularly the importance of evaluating one’s life as having a positive impact. Our introduction puts forth several arguments in favor of our hypothesis and justifies our reasons for exploring this new avenue. In Studies 1 and 2, part of our results indicates that individuals who have a positive impact on others are considered to have a more meaningful life than those who don’t. In Study 3, we find that when participants are asked to rate and rank definitions of meaning in life, having a positive impact on others is among the highest-ranked definitions. In Study 4, we present two key findings. We show that a 4-factor model including measures of impact, purpose, coherence and significance has a better fit to our data than a 1, 2 or 3-factor model. Furthermore, we show that people who see themselves as having a positive impact on others rate their life as more meaningful, and this effect remains after controlling for the other three dimensions of purpose, coherence, and significance.",

Although working memory (WM) is believed to play an instrumental role in event segmentation, its specific contribution remains under debate. Here, we used two electroencephalography (EEG) indices of WM load, alpha-band suppression and contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitude, to test whether WM supports event segmentation by gradually accumulating information during unfolding events or by reactivating information at the transitions between events (i.e., event boundaries). Participants viewed object images paired with sounds that both remained in the same category for 6 consecutive items to form a stable event, followed by 2 items from another category, creating an event boundary. Temporal order and sequential memory were used to assess event segmentation. We found increased alpha-band suppression following event transitions, supporting the reactivation account. Evidence for the accumulation was mixed, with no evidence for increased alpha-band suppression and moderate evidence for increased CDA during events. These results indicate that WM contributes to event segmentation primarily through boundary-triggered reactivation, with only limited evidence for within-event accumulation.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

Despite the long history of person-environment fit research, surprisingly little is known about person-job fit in terms of basic personality traits. This study examined three basic tenets of fit theory regarding personality-job fit: Fit (1) is pleasurable, (2) regulated by individuals, and (3) changes over time. We hypothesized that personality-job fit would be associated with higher subjective well-being (RQ1), predict less occupational change (RQ2), and vary across the professional lifespan (RQ3). Fit was conceptualized as ‘broad congruence’ between individuals’ Big Five trait levels and expert-rated trait demands of their occupations. We used nationally representative data from German jobholders (N = 18,712-30,883). Multilevel polynomial regression and response surface analysis showed no significant congruence effects but some interactions: More extraverted and open individuals felt better and were less likely to leave their jobs when these traits were strongly demanded by their work, though these outcomes were not optimized at exact personality-job fit. Additionally, personality-job fit improved over time, showing a linear increase across the lifespan. These findings emphasize studying fit theories in detail and considering individuals’ personalities, such as being communicative or original, in career choice.",

          "abstract": "To address Cronbach’s longstanding call to unify experimental and correlational psychology, Hierarchical Factor Models (HFMs) have emerged as a promising approach to estimate individual differences while accounting for trial-level noise. As formalized by Rouder et al. (2025), this framework assumes Gaussian response times (RTs) and operates in raw units. Here, we generalize this framework by introducing the Standardized Generalized HFM (GenHFM), which incorporates two natural extensions: explicitly modeling asymmetric distributions and implementing a fully standardized latent structure. First, modeling asymmetry allows us to capture the true shape of RTs and, crucially, quantify the bias introduced by fitting Gaussian HFMs to skewed data. Second, the standardized parameterization ensures transparent prior specification and facilitates the analysis of factor loadings, enabling researchers to directly compare the degree of association between experimental effects and common factors, regardless of their original metrics. Consequently, this allows researchers to evaluate the discriminative capacity of each task regarding the latent process, mirroring the assessment of construct validity in classical psychometrics within experimental settings. We conducted a simulation study showing that Gaussian HFMs can underestimate true correlations by up to 50%, whereas GenHFM yields unbiased and more efficient estimates. Finally, we re-analyze data from two published studies using executive control tasks to illustrate the empirical application of these models. Furthermore, we show that GenHFM achieves better predictive accuracy than complex models typically used in the field, such as hierarchical models with covariates or Drift Diffusion Models.",

Eighty-eight participants (44 long COVID and 44 controls) completed at least one testing session involving either a cognitive or physical task. Pre and post-task measures included somatosensory processing, state fatigue, perceived effort, and heart rate variability (HRV). Trait fatigue, autonomic symptoms, mood, and illness beliefs were assessed using validated questionnaires. Group differences and task-related changes were analysed using multivariate and linear mixed models. There was no multivariate effect of group on baseline somatosensory attenuation or gating (p = .172), nor did these measures change following exertion, or associate with post-exertion fatigue. Long COVID participants reported greater fatigue than controls, with 64% meeting criteria for severe fatigue. State fatigue was greater at baseline, throughout both exertion tasks (all p &lt;.001), and increased more during both tasks compared with controls. Despite this, cognitive and physical performance improved similarly across the task, with no group differences in fatigability (p = .199–.441). Long COVID resting HRV was lower, indicating autonomic dysfunction, but was not associated with fatigue. Only group status (p &lt; .001) and pre-task fatigue (p &lt; .001) were associated with post-exertion fatigue. Within long COVID participants, greater depression (p &lt; .001) and perceived illness threat (p = .033) were associated with higher trait fatigue. The absence of somatosensory attenuation or gating abnormalities provides no support for sensory attenuation models of fatigue in long COVID.",

In an empirical application, they found statistically significant necessity effects of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging on suicidal ideation. However, necessity effects in NCA do not prove that X is necessary for Y, as the effect could, for example, be due to a correlation between X and Y and this correlation could, in turn, be due to a confounding impact by a third variable Z. We scrutinized the findings and conclusions by Marchetti et al. by estimating “ranges of spuriousness”, i.e., 95% confidence intervals of necessity effects that could be expected due to the correlations between suicidal ideation and perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging, respectively. The necessity effects fell within the range of spuriousness, meaning that they could be accounted for by the correlations between the variables. Hence, conclusions by Marchetti et al., that perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging are necessary for suicidal ideation, may be challenged. It is important for researchers using NCA to be aware of the method’s severe limitations. We recommend scrutinizing findings by estimating ranges of spuriousness and to require that necessity effects are above this range if concluding that X is necessary for Y.",

While most research has focused on short-term, school-based programs and intra-personal outcomes, this qualitative study explored how adolescents integrated mindfulness into their lives one month after participating in an intensive, weeklong retreat. \nMethods\nFifteen adolescents (Mage = 16.74 years, SD = 1.58 years; 73% girls, 27% boys; 53.3% White, 6.7% African American, 6.7% East Asian, and 33.3% Multiracial) completed interviews one month after a six-day mindfulness retreat. Participants reflected on retreat takeaways and described how they applied mindfulness to personal and social challenges. Data were analyzed using a three-cycle coding process to identify patterns in intra- and inter-personal applications.\nResults\t\nAdolescents described intra-personal applications, such as self-awareness and regulation (100% of adolescents; e.g., regulating thoughts and emotions), practicing self-compassion and acceptance (73%; e.g., being less self-critical), and gaining a broader perspective (60%; e.g., focusing on what matters). They also reported inter-personal applications, including navigating social anxiety and building connections (73%; e.g., using mindfulness to reduce social apprehension), engaging in compassionate communication (67%; e.g., active listening and providing emotional support), and greater social awareness and attunement (53%; e.g., practicing empathy and perspective-taking).

Fatigue severity and impact were high, with physical fatigue rated more severe (Z = −2.96, p = .003) and impactful (Z = -8.714, p &lt; .001) than cognitive fatigue. Correlational analyses showed moderate-to-strong associations between fatigue and autonomic symptoms, interoception, illness perceptions and distress. In regression models, these variables explained 21–54% of variance in fatigue. Autonomic symptoms were positively associated with cognitive and physical fatigue. Depression was associated with cognitive fatigue. Illness perceptions were associated with physical, but not cognitive fatigue. Interoceptive sensibility showed both positive and negative associations with fatigue.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong COVID fatigue is severe and multifaceted. It involves a dynamic interplay between dysfunction in physiological systems, illness perceptions, and distress, with interactions varying across dimensions of fatigue.

We challenge the static nature of the field, demonstrating how societal shifts in individualism, gender equality, and fertility rates can be understood as adaptive responses to changing physical and social ecological conditions. We then situate this ecological framework in relation to other major theories of cultural change. Building on this framework, we explore the impact of the emerging “digital ecology” on cultural transmission and the importance of culture-ecology feedback loops. Finally, we discuss the new frontiers of a predictive science of cultural dynamics, including efforts to forecast the future, “retrodict” the past, and develop new tools, such as AI-based Historical Large Language Models, for the study of cultural dynamics.",

A Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model was fitted to separate within-person from between-person processes and to test bidirectional associations across time, controlling for age at each wave. \n\nResults: At the between-person level, higher average dysphoria, rumination, and peer victimization were strongly inter-correlated. Within-person analyses showed that elevations in dysphoria predicted subsequent increases in both rumination and peer victimization, and that increases in peer victimization also predicted later elevated levels of dysphoria. Furthermore, the within-person analyses revealed rumination did not predict later changes in the other constructs. \n\nConclusion: Findings suggest that, at the within-person level, changes in dysphoria and peer-victimization may be reciprocally related. In contrast, changes in rumination were only predicted by changes in dysphoria, and not peer victimization, challenging previous theory and evidence on the temporal order between the three constructs. Modeling these processes as transactional and across various levels of analyses may inform more precise estimates for multilevel prevention efforts aimed at reducing disparities experienced by adolescent girls.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that contingency instructions (CI), stating that the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) will not be presented anymore, can enhance extinction learning, and additional CI before extinction retrieval can reduce the return of fear. However, immediate pre-retrieval instructions are impractical in therapeutic settings. Thus, this study investigated the impact of CI before and/or after extinction training on extinction learning in 240 participants (120 patients with anxiety disorders (ADs), 120 healthy controls) using a three-day sequential conditioning paradigm. Electrical shocks and colored lamps served as UCS and conditioned stimuli (CS), with skin conductance responses (SCRs), CS valence, and UCS expectancy ratings as readout measures. CI before extinction training enhanced extinction learning for both patients with ADs and healthy controls across the physiological and subjective measures. Instructed healthy controls displayed even lower SCRs than instructed patients during early extinction. Furthermore, participants receiving post-extinction CI showed reduced CS differentiation in their SCRs during extinction retrieval. After a reinstatement, instruction timing differentially affected fear responses across contexts. Participants instructed before and after extinction, and uninstructed participants showed higher fear responses in the original conditioning context. Those instructed only before extinction exhibited increased fear responses in extinction and novel contexts, while participants instructed only after extinction showed heightened fear responses exclusively in the extinction context. The findings highlight how the timing of providing contingency information shapes fear learning and memory.",

Prior work has established initial validity and reliability of a digital interactive measure of this model called The Three Circles with young adults.

Participants then completed The Three Circles. \n\tWe found evidence of good construct validity, with scores on the Three Circles correlating as predicted with established self-report scales, as well as criterion validity, with high threat dominance and low soothing dominance predicting psychological distress and difficulties in emotion regulation, and the opposite predicting higher self-compassion. \n\tResults indicate that The Three Circles is suitable for use with adolescents, providing a parsimonious alternative to assess emotion that may mitigate caveats associated with established measures, such as verbal and emotional literacy, alexithymia, and attentional difficulties. As such, there are positive implications for its use in social context settings with adolescents, whereby these advantages may be particularly useful.",

          "abstract": "The last decade has seen a surge in studies using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), where participants complete brief daily questionnaires to capture real-time experiences. While widely used to study adolescents' social-emotional processes, parent-adolescent EMA remains underutilized, particularly within diverse families. This gap is surprising given the proven value of dyadic EMA in studying adult relationships and its potential to elucidate contextualized family dynamics. This systematic review synthesized and critically evaluated existing EMA research on parent-adolescent dyads and triads (i.e., an adolescent and both parents) published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on which populations have been systematically excluded. Following a systematic search of electronic databases (e.g., PubMed), we identified 85 publications originating from 44 distinct datasets that conducted EMA on parent-adolescent dyads or triads. Substantial variability was observed across studies in the number of daily assessments, EMA days, and data-waves collected. Utilization of the multilevel and dyadic features of the data also varied: most papers fully utilized the temporal aspect (e.g., examining within-family processes), while the dyadic/triadic aspect was only partially utilized (e.g., most studies examined unidirectional effects, typically parent-to-child). Regarding populations studied, while most focused on White, non-Hispanic, highly educated samples, some targeted only minority groups (e.g., Chinese-American). However, whether within-family processes differ between populations was rarely examined. Across dyadic (vs. triadic) studies, fathers were underrepresented, and gender identity and sexual orientation were almost never assessed, likely masking the exclusion of gender and sexual minorities. Parent-adolescent dyadic and triadic EMA appears feasible and could provide unique insights into family dynamics in typical and diverse populations. Gaps in the literature and suggestions for advancing inclusion and diversity are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral accounts of altruism have focused on costly reward and costly punishment. A third facet is expressed here as costly countercontrol, defined as persistent counteraction of dominant reinforcement schemes for the benefit of others. While this form of behavior is inherently risky, it involves behavioral reversal, and if it spreads, it can trigger long-term collective benefits through sociocultural transformation. In a game scenario, it could be operationalized as establishment of other-benefiting behavioral rules despite socially enforced contingencies to the opposite. Different from moral and civil courage, it is conceptualized here from a behaviorist standpoint. Examples from real life include whistleblowing and principled dissent in support of a moral cause. The article explores the challenges of assessing such behavior and reviews selected paradigms that contain its main components. Lastly, the limitations of current artificial intelligence systems in generating countercontrol are discussed, thereby highlighting the uniquely human capacity for this antagonistic form of altruism.",

          "abstract": "When we encounter a novel label, what, if anything, do we assume about the appearance of its referent? Prior work has shown that sound-shape correspondences (e.g., rounded sounds pairing with rounded shapes) can guide how people map novel labels to objects. Here we examine whether people also have a bias to map labels that are similar in form onto perceptually similar concepts (and vice versa). Across three experiments, we show bidirectional evidence of this. In Experiment 1, adults were first introduced to a novel label–referent pairing (e.g., “This is a toku.” written above an image of an alien species) and then selected which of two new species best fit a second, novel label. When the new label was similar to the initial one, e.g., teki, participants reliably mapped it onto the species that looked more similar to the first one. In Experiment 2, we show that this label similarity effect is robust enough to override pre-existing sound-shape preferences. And in Experiment 3, we demonstrate that the effect also operates in production: after being introduced to a novel creature, participants generated more similar labels when asked to label a perceptually similar, but distinct creature. We propose a bias to assume that similarity in conceptual space maps onto similarity in lexical space when inferring new label-referent mappings, and we speculate that this bias may be an instance of a broader principle of similarity-based mapping across domains. Finally, we discuss potential implications for language learning and use more broadly.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, insights from cognitive psychology on unconscious learning have been applied to second language acquisition (SLA) research, proposing that unconscious knowledge gradually becomes conscious through repetitive experience. This perspective offers a reinterpretation of the interface between implicit and explicit knowledge in SLA, contrasting with the traditional view that explicit knowledge gives rise to implicit knowledge. While the phenomenon of unconscious knowledge becoming conscious provides valuable insights into the dynamics of knowledge acquisition, it also suggests the need to reconceptualize the traditional notions of implicit and explicit knowledge. This paper aims to propose a framework that integrates recent insights on unconscious learning with traditional claims in SLA. Specifically, we propose replacing the unidimensional linear continuum view—which positions implicit and explicit knowledge as two ends of a single axis and conceptualizes second language development as a back-and-forth transition between these poles—with a multilayered knowledge view: The Hierarchical-Layer Model of Conscious-Unconscious Knowledge (H-L Model). This alternative model serves as a working hypothesis to better capture the multilayered and differentiated nature of linguistic cognition.",

          "authors": "Marios Adamou",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the philosophical foundations and implications of what we term \"shadow epistemology\" within the neurodiversity movement, understood as parallel knowledge validation systems that emerge when experiential certainty about neurodivergent status diverges from institutional psychiatric recognition. Drawing on critical psychiatry traditions, phenomenological approaches to mental distress, and contemporary debates in social epistemology, we argue that shadow epistemologies reveal fundamental tensions in psychiatric knowledge production that cannot be resolved through improved clinical practice alone. We trace the genealogy of shadow epistemology through anti-psychiatry movements, disability studies, and feminist epistemology, examining how each tradition contests medical authority whilst constructing alternative frameworks for understanding minds that differ from statistical and functional norms. The paper explores three central philosophical problematics: the incommensurability between first-person phenomenological knowledge and third-person clinical observation, the social construction of diagnostic categories alongside the material reality of cognitive difference, and the tension between epistemic democracy and expert authority in psychiatric contexts. We argue that shadow epistemologies function simultaneously as legitimate challenges to psychiatric power and as potentially problematic resistance to disconfirmation, embodying contradictions that mirror deeper philosophical tensions within psychiatry itself regarding the nature of mental disorder, the status of subjective experience, and the proper relationship between medical expertise and lived knowledge. The analysis concludes by considering what shadow epistemologies reveal about the limits of psychiatric epistemology and the possibilities for more pluralistic approaches to neurodevelopmental difference that neither collapse into relativism nor reassert unexamined clinical authority.",

While one study has examined early maladaptive schemas in this population, Early Adaptive Schemas (EAS) – cognitive-emotional patterns associated with mental well-being – remain unexplored. This study investigated EAS prevalence in gay versus straight men and examined associations between parental acceptance and EAS development in gay men. \nMethods: A cross-sectional study recruited 122 participants (51 gay, 71 straight) between November 2024 and June 2025. We measured 14 distinct EAS using the Young Positive Schema Questionnaire. Parental acceptance was assessed using the Perceived Parental Reactions Scale.\nResults: Gay men showed significantly lower overall EAS scores compared to straight men. Exploratory analyses revealed gay men scored lower on Basic Health and Safety/Optimism and Stable Attachment schemas, with a potential difference in Healthy Self-Reliance/Competence. Parental acceptance was not significantly associated with overall EAS scores among gay men, though a potential relationship emerged with Emotional Fulfillment without multiple comparisons correction.\nConclusions: Gay men demonstrated specific vulnerabilities in specific schemas, while maintaining comparable levels in most domains. These findings suggest minority stress may operate through targeted rather than global mechanisms. Parental acceptance may foster resilience through specific adaptive schemas.\nPolicy Implications: Results support strength-based therapeutic approaches for gay men, with interventions potentially targeting specific schemas like Basic Health and Safety/Optimism and Stable Attachment to enhance resilience against minority stress experiences.",

          "abstract": "Background: Parent-adolescent emotion dynamics are considered instrumental in clinical formulations of adolescent mental health; however, parent-adolescent affective synchrony in day-to-day life has received little empirical attention. Most research has relied on brief laboratory paradigms, which provide limited insight into how affective synchrony unfolds in everyday life and what factors drive its patterns.\n\nMethod: In this preregistered study, 112 adolescents (12–18 years) and 108 parents completed baseline measures of closeness, responsiveness, insensitivity, depressive symptoms, and social anxiety symptoms. Then, for 28 subsequent days, participants reported their positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). We used Bayesian linear mixed effects models to quantify concurrent, adolescent-lagged, and parent-lagged synchrony in PA and NA and tested whether mean-centered baseline measures predicted each synchrony type.\n\nResults: Parents and adolescents exhibited concurrent and adolescent-lagged synchrony in their daily PA and NA. Concurrent, adolescent-lagged, and parent-lagged synchrony in PA were only weakly correlated with those in NA. Adolescent-rated closeness positively predicted concurrent synchrony in PA, but not NA. Adolescent-rated parent insensitivity and adolescent social anxiety positively predicted synchrony in NA, but not PA. Parent-rated adolescent responsiveness positively predicted adolescent-lagged synchrony in PA. Adolescent-rated parent responsiveness and insensitivity predicted adolescent-lagged synchrony in NA. \n\nConclusions: Concurrent and adolescent-lagged synchrony in PA and NA are differentially predicted by adolescents’ (but usually not parents’) perceptions of their relationship and social anxiety symptoms. In addition to enhancing theoretical understanding of parent-adolescent emotion dynamics, this study has important implications for how such dynamics should be targeted in clinical settings.",

While previous research has shown that such choices in native speakers are influenced by such factors as animacy, pronominality, and verb bias, little is known about the developmental timing of these effects in L2 production. Using 5,785 dative constructions from a large-scale learner corpus (EFCAMDAT), we analyzed how these variables interact with learners’ proficiency levels across 23 verbs. We found that learners showed systematic sensitivity to all of these factors, including statistical verb bias derived from a native speaker corpus (COCA), at much earlier stages than previously suggested. These results suggest that learners may possess a cognitive bias that maps preexisting conceptual structures onto linguistic constructions, reflecting more than mere statistical learning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Proactive and reactive inhibition are key components of inhibitory control that support flexible, goal-directed behaviour. Proactive inhibition involves the anticipatory regulation of motor responses based on contextual demands, whereas reactive inhibition refers to the rapid cancellation of an already initiated action following an external stop signal. Although these processes are often grouped within a unified inhibitory control framework, emerging evidence suggests they may rely on partially distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms.\n\nMethods: This pilot study examined whether individual differences in proactive inhibition are associated with reactive inhibition performance. Fifteen healthy young adults (M = 23.4 years) completed a Go/No-Go Task (GNGT) and a Stop-Signal Task (SST) in a counterbalanced order. Proactive inhibition was indexed using NoGo accuracy, and reactive inhibition was indexed using Stop-trial accuracy.\n\nResults: Pearson correlation analyses revealed a moderate negative association between NoGo accuracy and Stop-trial accuracy (r = −0.43), which did not reach statistical significance (p = .108).\n\nConclusion: Although preliminary, the observed pattern is consistent with accounts proposing a dissociation between action restraint and action cancellation. These findings highlight the importance of assessing proactive and reactive inhibition as potentially separable components of executive control.\n\nKeywords: proactive inhibition; reactive inhibition; go/no-go task; stop-signal task; inhibitory control",

While its restorative functions are well documented, they describe what happens during sleep rather than why a complex organism must repeatedly enter a state of profound vulnerability and unconsciousness to perform them. Here, I propose the Computational Necessity Hypothesis: that sleep is an unavoidable consequence of a non–modular, high–dimensional neural architecture optimized for flexible behaviour. In biological neural networks, learning is distributed and overlapping; optimizing synaptic weights for a new task inevitably creates interference with prior capabilities (\"catastrophic interference\"). I argue that sleep provides the necessary \"offline\" state for a global optimization process – traversing network configurations to find a system–wide equilibrium that cannot be computed during real–time sensory–motor processing, i.e. wakefulness. This framework generates testable predictions about stage-specific cognitive deficits and representational drift across waking and sleep.",

Factorial structure was examined through confirmatory factor analyses. Reliability and discriminant validity were assessed using satisfaction with life, sense of coherence, and self-esteem. Item-level properties were analysed using Item Response Theory (Graded Response Model), focusing on discrimination, threshold parameters, information curves, and differential item functioning (DIF) by gender.\nResults: Analyses supported an essentially unidimensional structure, despite slightly superior fit of multidimensional models, given high interfactor correlations. Internal consistency was robust (α = .88, ω = .89), and discriminant validity was confirmed. Item Response Theory (IRT) results indicated optimal precision in the mild-to-moderate distress range (θ ≈ 0–2). Items such as “Difficulty concentrating” and “Loss of sleep” emerged as early-warning signals, while “Couldn’t overcome difficulties” and “Feeling unhappy” and depressed functioned as critical markers of moderate-to-high risk. More severe items, including “Thinking of self as worthless”, acted as indicators for immediate referral. DIF analyses revealed minimal gender bias.\nConclusions: The GHQ-12 demonstrated strong reliability, validity, and nuanced item functioning in this population. Its layered item structure supports its use not only as a global indicator of distress but also as a tool to inform stepped-care strategies in university mental health programmes, from universal prevention to targeted interventions.\nKeywords: GHQ-12; psychological distress; Item Response Theory; reliability; validity; university students",

The experimental group completed general knowledge and arithmetic tasks under time pressure with feedback, while the control group completed easier versions of the same tasks without time constraints and feedback. Participants rated their state anxiety on visual analogue scale and their emotional valence on Likert-type scale. The number of errors made was also assessed. Results: Participants in the control group showed significantly higher accuracy on the acute stress task than those in the experimental group. Stress responses also differed between groups: the experimental group reported significantly higher anxiety and lower emotional valence, indicating a more negative affective experience.

However, we believe that additional within-person research is also needed for social-cognitive measures, in addition to personality measures based on trait models, as most psychometric research on these measures has been cross-sectional and/or at the between-person level. We also hope that research can continue to advance understanding of the significant overlap across personality and social-cognitive models and measures. In addition to highlighting important areas of overlap, we also describe how general assessments of personality and related constructs can provide helpful information, in initial treatment planning phases, especially for screening; strengthening diagnostic formulations; and collaboratively establishing general profiles of client strengths, functioning, and areas of need in a structured manner.",

This assumption is particularly salient for children born preterm, who often experience reduced early physical contact and prolonged neonatal separation, potentially shaping later caregiver–child attunement. Here we present a large-scale, systematic investigation of mother–child physiological synchrony in 102 dyads (70 preterm 5-year-olds and 32 matched full-term controls). Heart rate was recorded across eight interaction paradigms spanning passive viewing to face-to-face play. We applied the major commonly used analytic approaches, combined with rigorous surrogate-data controls and multiverse analyses, to assess the robustness of synchrony estimates. Across all paradigms, metrics, and analytic variants, synchrony in real dyads never exceeded that observed in pair-shuffled or segment-shuffled surrogate data. Patterns were virtually identical in full-term and preterm groups, and no reliable variability in synchrony remained that could be related to indices of prematurity. Together, these findings challenge the view that autonomic synchrony is a robust or ubiquitous feature of early social interaction and reveal substantial methodological fragility in current synchrony research. Our results underscore the need for more rigorous analytical frameworks and raise critical questions about when - and whether - physiological synchrony genuinely emerges in caregiver–child relationships.",

Across 11 studies (N = 6,824) with American and French participants, this research shows that cancelers underestimate how acceptable others find being canceled on. This underestimation effect is robust across different plan types, whether alternatives to the original plan exist, the level of effort exerted by the person canceled on, and justifications for canceling. Findings also reveal that the effect is partly driven by the cancelers’ beliefs that others are less forgiving and more impacted by cancellations than they actually are. Consequently, cancelers also overestimate monetary amounts of gifts and the time commitment of favors that those canceled on expect as compensation. Interestingly, upfront compensatory action only partly attenuates the underestimation effect, suggesting the misperception is deep-rooted. Together, these findings extend consumer research on misperceptions about others, from social beliefs regarding plan cancellations to compensatory gift-giving.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that semantic processing of sentences engages more activity in the bilingual compared to the monolingual brain and, more specifically, in the inferior frontal gyrus. The present study aims to extend those results and examines whether semantic and also grammatical sentence processing involve different cerebral structures when testing in the native language. In this regard, highly proficient Spanish/Catalan bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals made grammatical and semantic judgments in Spanish while being scanned. Results showed that both types of judgments recruited more cerebral activity for bilinguals in language-related areas including the superior and middle temporal gyri. Such neural differences co-occurred with similar performance at the behavioral level. Taken together, these data suggest that early bilingualism shapes the brain and cognitive processes in sentence comprehension even in their native language; on the other hand, they indicate that brain over activation in bilinguals is not constrained to a specific area.",

          "authors": "Zihan Yan; Ashley Sylvara; Pengda Wang; Tianjun Sun; Ziang Xiao",
          "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new possibilities for automating personality assessment through text-based chatbot interviews. While prior research has applied machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to score interview responses, these approaches often lack a strong theoretical foundation for extracting and interpreting trait-relevant behavioral cues. In this study, we integrate Funder’s Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM) into LLM-based autoscoring to enhance the identification and utilization of behavioral cues in personality evaluation. We use two archival samples (N = 521) to examine the alignment between LLM-derived personality scores and established measures, including human-coded behavioral description and narrative interview ratings, as well as self-reported Big Five personality assessments. We compare results from a job-focused behavioral interview (Sample 1; N = 218) and narrative identity interviews (Sample 2; N = 303). In the behavioral interview sample, RAM-based LLM prompts demonstrated stronger convergence with human ratings than zero-shot prompts. However, in the narrative interview sample, this advantage was attenuated, with RAM- and zero-shot-based LLM scores showing similar convergence. In Study 2, we analyzed differences in the behavioral cues extracted by LLMs and human raters to better understand the rating reasoning process. Similarity analyses revealed moderate overlap between LLM-extracted and human-annotated cues. These findings suggest that theory-guided LLMs can identify behavioral cues that partially overlap with those used by humans. Limitations and implications for scalable, accurate, and interpretable AI-based personality assessment are discussed.",

          "abstract": "We provide the first systematic analysis of electoral competitiveness in American ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections. First, we develop a novel dataset of the margin of victory in American RCV contests from 2004 to 2024 by integrating a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm with over 38.9 million candidate rankings submitted by actual voters. Second, we propose a theoretical explanation for how the presence of an incumbent may shape electoral competitiveness under RCV. We show that incumbent-held seats are, on average, less competitive and have fewer candidates than open races. Using regression discontinuity with non-ignorable sample selection, we also illustrate how incumbency may allow candidates to cultivate favorable rankings under RCV. Finally, we also show that incumbent-held seats are, on average, less likely to have second and higher rounds than open races, making voters' lower preferences count less. These findings have broad implications for election reforms, the incumbency advantage, and electoral competition.",

          "abstract": "How do people evaluate social movement protest tactics? Theories covering public perceptions of protest emphasize that activists face a tactical dilemma, employing disruptive tactics to advance goals without alienating public support. Existing quantitative evidence on the perceived relationship between tactical disruptiveness and effectiveness, as well as how tactics are influenced by objective properties or subjective perceptions across social groups, remains limited. We address this gap through survey experiment data measuring U.S. voters’ paired-choice preferences across 66 tactics. Using Bradley-Terry models, we show that perceptions of disruptiveness and effectiveness are nonlinearly related, and their misalignment varies across different tactical dimensions. Additionally, results show that perceivers' sociodemographic characteristics moderate the effects of tactical dimensions on protest perceptions. We find that social characteristics pattern views of effectiveness but not disruptiveness. Our research highlights the need to understand how perceptions of effective and disruptive protest are analytically distinct, shaped by tactical dimensions and the diverse publics perceiving them, and holds implications for how tactics may be perceived as legitimate.",

This study estimates the effects of institutional social capital on postsecondary outcomes, focusing on how students’ interactions with school- and college-based actors shape their college choice and educational attainment. Using nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and doubly robust propensity score matching models, we assess the impact of interactions with high school teachers, coaches, guidance counselors, and college representatives on postsecondary enrollment and degree completion. The results indicate that meeting with a coach, counselor, or college representative significantly increase students’ likelihood of enrolling in a four-year college, whereas meeting with a teacher has no such effect. Counselors and college representatives also positively impact enrollment in two-year or less-than-two-year institutions, though the effects are smaller than those for four-year enrollment. All four types of institutional interactions increase students’ likelihood of earning a bachelor’s degree, while none affect sub-baccalaureate credential completion. These findings suggest that institutional actors can play a critical role in promoting four-year college enrollment and completion but are less effective in facilitating access to alternative postsecondary pathways. By isolating the effects of students’ interactions with distinct institutional agents, this study contributes to the literature on social capital and highlights the importance of broader college-related support beyond traditional counseling roles.",

          "abstract": "Collective intelligence research spans multiple disciplines and focuses on a broad range of collective behaviors, including group problem-solving, flocking in social animals, and the formation of social knowledge. It is not apparent what these different forms of collective intelligence have in common, apart from being instances of collective behavior. In this paper, we develop a framework that enables us to better classify different forms of collectively intelligent behavior in relation to one another based on the information processing mechanisms involved. We argue that these behaviors share a common foundation, which we call collective information processing, or CIP. CIP involves two key mechanisms: (1) individual processing of group information and (2) group processing, or group-level sensitivity to the arrangement of individual information. We operationalize the CIP framework to analyze different forms of collective intelligence, both classifying them in relation to one another and in alignment with generalized quantifiable measures of information processing. Our account of collective intelligence as CIP offers a novel framework for identifying and classifying forms of collective intelligence across a wide range of disciplinary contexts. This framework is meant to unify and subsume, rather than simply challenge, existing attempts to define collective intelligence.",

          "abstract": "In February 2021, Meta announced it would reduce the distribution of political content in users' News Feeds, implementing the policy globally by July 2022 before reversing course in January 2025. Despite the significance of these changes for democratic communication, no independent research has quantified their effects on elected officials. This study examines Meta's political content reduction policy using a dataset of over 2.5 million Facebook posts from Italian parliamentarians, prominent politicians, and political extremist accounts spanning 2021–2025, collected via the Meta Content Library API. Employing a discovery-validation design with structural breakpoint detection methods, the analysis identifies three cross-validated breakpoints that reveal policy effects emerged in Italy approximately ten months before Meta's announced global implementation. The findings document a 72% reduction in average reach for re-elected Members of Parliament, declining from approximately 53,000 views per post before the policy to 15,000 at the trough. Although Meta's January 2025 reversal produced a significant rebound, post-reversal reach recovered to only 65% of pre-policy levels. A robustness check reveals asymmetric effects: while mainstream politicians experienced substantial visibility losses, extremist accounts' high posting volume more than compensated for modest per-post declines, resulting in increased total weekly reach during the policy period. These findings expose significant transparency deficits in Meta's policy communication while also demonstrating the research value of the transparency infrastructure that made this study possible.",

          "abstract": "Educational aspirations are a key driver of educational inequalities. This article explores how such aspirations are transmitted within families, drawing on psychological research and extending the Wisconsin Model. Challenging its assumption of a universal parental influence on children’s aspirations, we build on Coleman’s notion of an interplay between human and social capital. We argue that high parental aspirations shape children’s aspirations only when there is close intrafamily exchange, which builds the channel to transmit parental aspirations to children. Using data from the National Educational Panel Study, we distinguish between realistic and idealistic aspirations from 6,053 children and their parents and structural and process related aspects of intrafamily social capital. A series of linear probability models find assumed interaction effects only for realistic aspirations and process-related aspects of intrafamily social capital. Consequently, high parental aspirations are specifically transmitted to children when there is strong and close interaction within the family and aspirations are understood as expectations.",

          "abstract": "This study re-examines whether a supportive school climate, specifically teacher- and classroom-level climate, is uniformly associated with academic resilience among socioeconomically disadvantaged students across education systems. Using a methodologically rigorous analysis of PISA 2022 data (N = 29,728), we uncover a 'Resilience--Support Paradox': a negative association between perceived teacher- and classroom-level support and academic resilience in multiple systems. Rather than implying that support is harmful, this pattern is consistent with a support-follows-need dynamic: targeted instructional resources are disproportionately directed toward students who are struggling, while resilient students exhibit greater autonomy, functioning independently of these remedial structures. In contrast, the strongest positive correlate of resilience is students’ internal Math Disposition (self-efficacy, interest, and low anxiety). We propose a 'Resilience Lifecycle' framework: institutional support may help build internal psychological assets early on, but later-stage resilience is characterized by greater autonomy. Practically, the results motivate differentiated interventions: (a) for disadvantaged low performers, interventions that cultivate math-specific confidence and reduce anxiety; and (b) for disadvantaged high performers, opportunities for autonomous exploration and appropriately challenging learning pathways. Scalable educational technologies may serve as a practical facilitator of such differentiation alongside instructional and policy-based approaches.",

Traditional methods for creating experimental stimuli are time-consuming and prone to bias, potentially undermining scientific rigor. This study investigates whether AI models generate high-quality pictorial stimuli for interventions aiming to change consumer behavior, both as single stimuli and as groups with controlled variations. In an online experiment (N = 995), we compare AI- and human-generated pictorial stimuli, evaluating AI models’ effectiveness in conveying object and emotion accuracy (for happy), anthropomorphic qualities, and overall appeal. Results show AI-generated pictorial stimuli outperform human-created stimuli in object and emotional accuracy, anthropomorphism, and visual appeal. Notably, participants struggled to distinguish AI-generated pictorial stimuli from those created by humans, highlighting the credibility and realism of AI outputs. ChatGPT 4o excelled in generating consistent stimuli with simple styles, though complex emotions like envy remain challenging to depict.

          "abstract": "M3 theory introduces a descriptive framework for entrepreneurial innovation through collaboration in pursuit of solutions to more complex market problems. Through a Social Realism epistemological lens, M3 coding presents complex strategic positions as essentialist (via modes), relative (via models), and dynamic (via momentum) to plot the dynamic trajectory of innovation transmuting over time. At a fundamental level, the M3 theory identifies a consistent set of rules that decision-makers intentionally or unintentionally engage with or ignore to take strategic positions based on four integrated yet polarized pairs of modes: +S, +R, and +C, +D. Systematic (+S) vs. responsive (+R) strategies juxtaposed the tension of processes dedicated to increasingly sophisticated +S bounded rational cognitive processes; planning, compartmentalizing, regulating emotions, against increasingly +R sensitized intuiting; reflectivity, associating, emotionally expressive action. The second pair, conforming (+C), vs. differentiating (+D) strategies. intersects but expresses the tension between +C’s converging; through adapting or conveying socially perceived superior norms, or exploiting existing resources and power, against +D’s departure from traditional norms; with exploration, novelty-seeking, sabotage, risk-taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery. Finally, dynamism (momentum) informs how strategic modes and models of decision-making improve and adjust in sophistication under the pressure and demands of the four drives (+L). The M3 theory is informed by three distinct but interrelated and simultaneous empirical streams of data: (i) field data from five ethnographic case studies, with research participant feedback loops; (ii) the mapping of 200+ peer-reviewed decision-making models; and (iii) prototyping the principles in the construction of the emergent M3 theory.\n\n[This research is part of a larger doctoral project originally submitted in 2017.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Dissipative Representations (DiRe) as both a practical notion and a methodological framework that transcends dualistic thinking in language research, identity studies, and cognitive sciences. Drawing from the foundational premise that reality equals information (R=I), DiRe offers a coherent alternative to traditional analytical frameworks characterized by informational flexibility, provisional utility, relational dynamics, and critical resistance to objectification. The framework synthesizes Analytic Idealism, Decolonial Theory, and the Informational Field Metaphor to provide researchers with tools that honor the dynamic and emergent nature of meaning-making without sacrificing analytical rigor. This revised version integrates developments from the Trace &amp; Trajectory Framework (TTF), introducing Trajectorial Dissipative Representations (Tra_DiRe) as a bridge between foundational ontology and applied analysis, and refining the concept of representational granularity through the orthogonal distinction between structural configuration (λ) and epistemic access (σ). The significance of this work extends toward a transformative epistemological shift with applications for decolonizing knowledge systems and revitalizing genuine diversity in approaches to intersubjective meaning-making.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a non-cooperative game-theoretic model to analyze strategic natural gas export decisions under binding geopolitical and institutional constraints, focusing on Iran–Qatar interaction in the European market. Export strategies are defined as empirically grounded regimes rather than continuous quantities, capturing observed export suspensions and partial utilization under sanctions and infrastructural frictions. The model incorporates quantity-dependent production and transportation costs as well as explicit geopolitical constraint penalties. Scenario-based payoff matrices calibrated to post-2022 market conditions reveal that rising constraint costs can render high-export strategies unprofitable even at elevated gas prices. The analysis identifies an asymmetric Nash equilibrium in which Qatar maintains high exports while Iran optimally reduces or suspends exports. These results highlight that institutional access and geopolitical frictions, rather than resource endowments alone, are central determinants of export behavior and European energy security in fragmented gas markets.

Scholars have identified various human rights issues that experience contestation and have suggested explanations, but those have not been verified through systematic studies. This article presents the first content analysis of all 1,338 resolutions adopted by the UNHRC until 2021 by computing the average vote contestation for every single word and word pair appearing in the resolution text. The resulting dataset enables nuanced verification of hypotheses for the contestation of issue areas, country mentions and language strength. I find that resolutions on women’s rights issues enjoy consensus, and even physical integrity rights like torture are not contested heavily. The UNHRC also criticises countries directly, albeit selectively. Instead, the highest contestation is experienced by resolutions on interventionism and economic rights, where the Global South challenges Western hegemony.",

          "authors": "Jason Kreger",
          "abstract": "Background: Despite modern advances, prevention programs often exhibit participant attrition and limited behavior persistence following program cessation. Program evaluation methods have proven helpful for retrospectively examining intervention efficacy; however, there is a lack of standardized methods to jointly assess intervention-period outcomes and post-intervention prevention practice durability with respect to program characteristics. The absence of such an evaluation instrument limits comparative inference and represents a gap in contemporary prevention science. Objectives: To develop and propose a standardized, theory-informed, multi-component program evaluation tool that facilitates systematic assessment of intervention-phase attrition and post-intervention behavior sustainability, while incorporating key program design, implementation, and equity characteristics to enable comparative synthesis across heterogeneous interventions. Methods: The Longitudinal Prophylactic Capacity Evaluation (LPCE) Tool was developed through analytic abstraction of prevailing evaluation constructs used in lifestyle prevention research, with explicit emphasis on participant retention, behavioral durability, and real-world implementation feasibility. LPCE evaluates prevention programs as the unit of analysis, using six ordinally scored domains: (1) Intervention-period attrition; (2) Post-intervention behavior sustainability; (3) Intervention design and behavioral framework fidelity; (4) Engagement and participant-resonance strategies; (5) Implementation and scalability; and (6) Equity and accessibility considerations. Domain scores are synthesized into two standardized indices: (1) A Composite Program Score (CPS), which applies equal domain weights; and (2) A Weighted Program Score (WPS), which prioritizes sustainability domain influence through differential weighting and a durability-based gate rule. LPCE then normalizes domain scores for subsequent integration into a heatmap-based visualization to support transparent, pattern-based comparative analysis. Results: LPCE will facilitate reproducible, interpretable program-level performance profiles that distinguish interventions that achieve only short-term engagement from those that demonstrate durable post-intervention behavior maintenance. The sustainability-weighted scoring structure prevents inflation of overall program performance in the absence of post-intervention durability, while the domain-level heatmap approach facilitates cross-program comparisons and identifies design and implementation features associated with sustained outcomes. Conclusions: The LPCE Tool provides a standardized, extensible framework for evaluating the longitudinal prophylactic capacity of lifestyle prevention programs. By explicitly integrating attrition, sustainability, behavioral design, implementation feasibility, and equity considerations into a unified evaluation system, LPCE addresses a critical methodological gap.",

In such alternation, which can also appear as constant change, lies the unity of the world. The entirety of an alternation, however, is a consciousness structure due to the special relationship between the circumscribing periphery and the infinitesimal center. This process structure unites determinacy and indeterminacy also totally at every place. Therefore, we are dealing with forms of consciousness everywhere, with more or less freedom of choice and an increasingly unknown depth. We live in a world of the choosing consciousness or better: awareness. In this respect, our environment expresses a deep truth about ourselves.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a procedural model to formalize the emergence of power as an emergent property of decentralized social feedback, imitation, and influence dynamics. Building on prior models of norm emergence, we extend the framework to incorporate heterogeneous influence weights reflecting agents' symbolic standing and material resources. In doing so, we bridge classical sociological theories of power—including Weberian authority, Bourdieuian capital, and Emersonian dependence—with a tractable microfoundational mechanism grounded in reward-sensitive behavior and reputational dynamics. We demonstrate how differential weighting of social feedback leads to the stabilization of power hierarchies and centralized influence within groups. The model formalizes power as a process rather than a static attribute, providing a unified account of how influence asymmetries emerge, persist, and shape collective action.  By clarifying the procedural underpinnings of power emergence, our contribution advances the understanding of influence, authority, and social structure, laying groundwork for cumulative theory-building.",

Addressing a core gap in sociological theory, we specify the micro-level mechanisms by which individual cognitive interpretations—operating through both automatic and deliberative adaptation—converge into collective behavioral patterns. These processes give rise to emergent symbolic order and stabilized social norms. The model demonstrates how decentralized feedback loops generate shared norms and interpretive frameworks, providing a foundation for studying the bottom-up emergence of social structures. Illustrated through the case of the neurodiversity paradigm shift, this framework offers a precise, dynamic account of how schemas and actions co-evolve, highlighting the central role of social feedback in cultural formation.

          "authors": "Emmalinde Roelofse",
          "abstract": "The M3 theory contributes to new knowledge through original research and advanced scholarship by introducing a descriptive framework for strategic decision-making in uncertain and changing environments. Aided by the introduction of the Social Realism epistemology into management literature, it differentiates its ability to present complex strategic positions as essentialist (via modes), relative (via models), and dynamic (via momentum) to plot the dynamic trajectory of innovation emergence, change, adaptation, and transformation over time. At a fundamental level, the M3 theory identifies a consistent set of rules that decision-makers intentionally or unintentionally engage with or ignore to take strategic positions based on four integrated yet polarized pairs of modes: systematic (+S) vs. responsive (+R) strategies, and conforming (+C) vs. differentiating (+D) strategies. \n\nSystematic strategies (+S) are the mode dedicated to increasingly sophisticated rational cognitive processes; these processes plan, purposefully compartmentalize, and regulate emotions. Responsive strategies (+R), conversely, are the mode dedicated to increasingly sensitized intuitive processes; these processes are reflective, associative, action-oriented, and emotionally expressive. The second pair of modes intersect with the two aforementioned modes, employing conforming strategies (+C), which move towards convergence by adapting to or conveying socially perceived superior norms; these processes involve the exploitation of existing power. In contrast, differentiating strategies (+D) represents the mode dedicated to diverging from traditional norms with empowerment for exploration. These processes include novelty-seeking, sabotage, risk-taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and higher levels of innovation. Finally, the dynamic (momentum) component informs how strategic modes and models under uncertainty evolve and refine their sophistication in response to the pressure and demands of the four drives (+L).\n\nThe M3 theory is informed by three distinct but interrelated and simultaneous empirical streams of data: (i) field data coding decision framework patterns from five ethnographic case studies of collaborations leading to emergent innovation in the fields of corporate contracting (C1), higher education scaling (C2), economic development around economic disparity (C3), health and safety software startup (C4), and health and well-being (C5) with research participant feedback loops; (ii) the mapping of 200+ peer-reviewed decision-making models; and (iii) meta prototyping the principles in the construction of the emergent M3 theory itself. \n\n[Originally submitted as a doctoral thesis at Newcastle University (2017); reissued in 2025 for open access under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0.]",

          "abstract": "This article develops a procedural model of behavioral norm emergence based on the recursive interplay of social action and social feedback. Behavioral norms, shared expectations about appropriate conduct, are foundational to social organization, yet their formation and dynamics remain difficult to model concretely. We address this challenge by using social feedback received in response to behavior as the core mechanism linking individual action to collective patterns. Our model shows how agents monitor and adapt their behavior based on feedback, leading to the stabilization of shared practices, the emergence of reputation hierarchies, and the diffusion of norms through imitation and influence. These dynamics drive the co-evolution of norms and social networks, with reputation connecting individual behavior to broader patterns of coordination and social order. While existing theories often focus on \"why\" behavioral norms exist, our model addresses the \"how\". We argue that norms are not merely imposed from above, but co-constructed from below through iterative acts of validation and imitation.",

          "abstract": "Con una facturación anual de alrededor de US$ 1,5 billones, la industria farmacéutica se ha consolidado en las últimas décadas como uno de los sectores más poderosos de la economía global, ejerciendo una influencia significativa sobre la producción de conocimiento y el ejercicio de la medicina. Este artículo analiza críticamente las relaciones entre la industria farmacéutica y la formación y la práctica médicas, con foco en las transferencias de valor – como pagos, obsequios e incentivos financieros – dirigidas a médicos e instituciones académicas, desde la graduación hasta el desempeño profesional. La investigación combina un análisis documental descriptivo de datos del programa Open Payments, en los Estados Unidos – donde dichas transferencias están reguladas y se declaran públicamente –, con una revisión narrativa de la literatura internacional. En el recorte empírico, se observa que, entre 2015 y 2024, las entidades reportantes en Open Payments (incluidos los fabricantes de medicamentos y dispositivos médicos) transfirieron aproximadamente US$ 23,2 mil millones a médicos y US$ 23,3 mil millones a hospitales universitarios, exclusivamente en los Estados Unidos, principalmente en forma de comidas, viajes, apoyo educativo, consultorías, investigación y otras remuneraciones. A la luz de la literatura internacional, estas transferencias se examinan como parte de estrategias de aproximación e influencia sobre los prescriptores: estudios observacionales indican asociaciones – a menudo inconscientes – entre la recepción de beneficios y una mayor prescripción de productos de las empresas pagadoras, una mayor participación de medicamentos de marca en detrimento de los genéricos, la promoción de productos con beneficio clínico marginal y el incremento de costos en los sistemas de salud. Movilizando marcos teóricos y conceptos de la psicología social, la economía conductual y la teoría de la comunicación – como la reciprocidad, el sesgo de autoservicio, la influencia inconsciente y el third-person effect –, se discute cómo incluso beneficios de bajo valor, como las comidas, pueden actuar como mecanismos de socialización y arraigarse en el “currículo oculto” de la formación médica, normalizando conflictos de interés y moldeando identidades profesionales. Por último, se sostiene la necesidad de transformar la lógica de relacionamiento entre la industria y el campo médico, mediante mayor transparencia, restricción de obsequios y fortalecimiento de modelos institucionales de financiamiento y gobernanza alineados con la salud pública.",

In New Paradigm, HUMAN is post-140,000 years hominins except the last Javanese H. erectus. \n1) Pre- 140,000 years Homo is an unknown extinct taxon PROTO-HUMAN (ProtoHomo). Apparently, the glacial maximum ~140,000 years ago wiped them out (incl. the so-called Homo luzonensis, Pseudo-Neanderthals and Pseudo-Denisovans). \n2) Homo sapiens (incl. initial Neanderthals and initial Denisovans) originated from the Levantine macroevolution ~140 ka ago. In other words, the common ancestral population was neither in Africa before 500 ka nor outside Africa ~1 million years ago. If the extinction and the macroevolution cannot be rejected, H. sapiens is an isolated taxon. \n3) The relationships shown here between extreme climatic warmings and anatomical progressions (and vice versa) reveal that, instead of natural selection, DNA was the primary driving force of ProgRetrogProg or RetrogProgRetrogProg evolution, suggesting a nonstop struggle for dominance in the DNA between the two opposing forces. \n4) Anatomical and behavioral fluctuations sometimes occurred in parallel such as at the Grotte Mandrin ~54 ka, and sometimes in opposition such as Shanidar 4 anatomically retrogressive but behaviorally progressive Neanderthal \"flower burial\" ~73 ka ago. Likewise, H. naledi's anatomically retrogressive but behaviorally progressive situation supports DNA-driven ProgRetrogProg or RetrogProgRetrogProg evolution.",

Building on previous work that interprets the Indus script as a semasiographic/logographic writing system used for commercial administration, this article examines a group of neglected asymmetric vessel-shaped signs and proposes that they depict copper-smelting crucibles. Through a multi-pronged methodology integrating graphemic analysis of the Indus script signs, cross-script comparison, archaeological context, script-internal positional analysis, linguistic symbolism, and sign co-occurrence patterns, the study argues that these signs signified refined copper or bronze, copper ingots, and copper-smelting or metalworking activities. The proposed identification is supported by close visual parallels with wedge-shaped crucibles known from the ancient Near East, which inspired Egyptian hieroglyphs used for copper and bronze, as well as by archaeological contexts from Chanhu-daro associated with metalworking. The consistent occurrence of these signs in core informational segments of Indus inscriptions further supports their interpretation as commodity or craft names within taxation and licensing systems.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a cognitively grounded agent-based model of trust and cooperation in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. To move beyond the common “black box” treatment of decision-making in simulation research, it operationalizes the Free Energy Principle and active inference as an explicit process of Bayesian belief updating and prediction-error minimization. Agents are implemented with a hierarchical recurrent neural network inspired by predictive coding and trained to jointly forecast both players’ next actions, payoffs, and opponent-type indicators from interaction histories. In an Axelrod-style tournament, the resulting agent is evaluated against canonical strategies (ALLC, ALLD, Random, and Tit-for-Tat) and in dyadic interaction with another independently initialized agent of the same kind. The agent exhibits conditional cooperation with reciprocating opponents, rapid withdrawal under sustained defection, and systematic vulnerabilities under stochastic play. Crucially, trajectories of latent internal states provide a process-level account of how cooperation emerges, stabilizes, and collapses, linking observable behavior to evolving expectations about the social environment. The study demonstrates how cognitive modeling can enrich sociological accounts of trust by making the micro-dynamics of inference empirically inspectable within simulations, and it outlines a transferable framework for extending such models to richer action spaces and institutional settings.",

This research points out the transportation system as an expression of the conscious landscape through the combination of aesthetic gaze and urban design. Conscious landscape is an extensive concept of landscape. It is based on the existence of \"landscape\", but its existence mainly relies on “consciousness.” Based on the discussion of consciousness, the aesthetic gaze of the city starts from economic consciousness and takes the cultural capital system as the foundation of consciousness. This research discusses the transportation system around Taipei city, especially taking the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) as an example. It is like a blood vessel that runs through the city, and its penetrating characteristics divide Taipei city. From the perspective of sightseeing and economic awareness, the MRT is a landscape with special positioning currently. MRT combines the nature of transportation with strongly economic display. In addition to being a traffic landscape, it is also a type of conscious landscape. MRT is positioned as conscious landscape, which is a description that is very specific to the characteristics of strong economic map in human brain. This includes the impression of the economic field superimposed by the MRT network nodes, and the conscious landscape is instrumental but tends to be life-oriented. The aesthetic gaze of the city locates the transportation system as a conscious landscape, and the design is the aesthetic practice of capital.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a compartmental modeling framework for analyzing the dynamic interplay between innovation and imitation in socio-technical systems. Drawing inspiration from epidemiological models, we represent agents as belonging to distinct behavioral states, such as aspiring innovators, successful inventors, idle imitators, and successful imitators, and model transitions between these states using a system of differential equations. We investigate how varying the fraction of innovators within a fixed population affects system-wide social utility over time. Simulations conducted in Berkeley Madonna reveal that, contrary to common intuition, higher proportions of innovators do not necessarily lead to higher social utility in the short run due to front-loaded opportunity costs. In the long run, however, utility is maximized not when innovation is maximized, but when there is a modest surplus of innovators relative to imitators. We further extend the model to incorporate a baseline productivity class of agents contributing constant social value, allowing for a more realistic assessment of marginal utility. These findings offer insight into the design of balanced innovation policies and provide a flexible foundation for future empirical and agent-based research.",
