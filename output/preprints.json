          "title": "The influence of drinking consequences on alcohol expectancy likelihoods and valences: an item-level multi-level approach",
          "authors": "Megan Elizabeth Schultz; Jonas Dora; Kevin Michael King",
          "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol expectancy theory proposes that beliefs about drinking motivate or deter drinking. Although expectancies influence drinking, less is known about how the consequences of drinking influence expectancies. We modeled a feedback conceptualization of how the experience of specific consequences influenced people’s beliefs about how likely a consequence will occur (i.e., likelihoods) and how positive the consequence will be (i.e., valences). Method: We re-analyzed cross-sectional data from college drinkers (n = 504), using Bayesian cross-classified multilevel ordinal regressions to estimate associations between consequences, likelihoods, and valences. We performed a preregistered replication in new data (n = 362). Results: Participants had higher likelihoods (95% CIStudy 1 = [2.06, 2.43], 95% CIStudy 2 = [1.75, 2.12]) and valences (95% CIStudy 1 = [0.28, 0.52], 95% CIStudy 2 = [0.33, 0.60]) when they had experienced consequences more often, but these associations leveled off at higher consequence frequencies. Participants also believed consequences to be more likely when they viewed them as more positive, and vice versa, and again, these associations leveled off at higher levels of the predictor. Critically, the strength of these associations varied across both people and consequences. Conclusions: Experiencing specific consequences more often was related to people judging them to be more likely and more positive in the future, aligning with alcohol expectancy theory. This may lead to experiencing negative consequences repeatedly because people are not being demotivated from drinking in the same fashion. Given the person and consequence level variability, clinicians should consider an individualized approach when targeting drinking consequences.  \n\nKeywords: alcohol, college drinking, expectancies, consequences",

          "title": "Low Flexibility of Emotion Regulation in Adults with Childhood Maltreatment Experiences",
          "authors": "Diana Armbruster-Genc; Ulrike Basten",
          "abstract": "Background: Childhood maltreatment is associated with a higher risk for developing psychological disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Dysfunctional emotion regulation (ER) has been implicated as a neurocognitive mechanism linking adverse childhood experiences to an increased risk for psychopathological outcomes. \nObjective: This preregistered study investigated the relation between childhood maltreatment and different aspects of ER, including implementation capacity and effort as well as tendency and flexibility in strategy selection.\nMethods: In a non-clinical adult sample (N = 227), childhood maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. In two experimental ER tasks, participants viewed pictures of varying emotional intensity while applying one of three ER strategies (distraction, reappraisal, suppression) or without any active regulation. The ER implementation task allowed to assess emotion reactivity, implementation capacity, and subjective effort for ER. The ER selection task allowed to assess tendency and flexibility in strategy selection. \nResults: Childhood maltreatment was associated with a lower capacity to implement reappraisal (r = -.12), a stronger tendency to choose suppression (r = .15), and lower flexibility in ER strategy selection (r = -.12). Contrary to our hypotheses, there was no significant association to experimentally assessed emotion reactivity or subjective effort exerted on ER.\nConclusions: We show that people with childhood maltreatment experiences do not only choose suppression more frequently but seem to have a deficit in flexibly adjusting strategy selection to context factors, e.g., stimulus intensity. This can be interpreted as an important factor rendering emotion regulation less adaptive in a clinical sense.",

          "authors": "Jais Adam-Troian; Thomas Arciszewski; Jocelyn Belanger; Eric Bonetto",
          "abstract": "Recent geopolitical events have exposed critical gaps in the ability of peace and conflict psychology (PCP) to engage with conflicts beyond intractable or post-war contexts. This paper introduces the concept of \"naïve pacifism\" to describe underlying assumptions in PCP that hinder its ability to address complex modern conflicts effectively. Three pillars of naïve pacifism are identified: (1) the homeostatic view of peace as the natural state and violence as a dysfunction, (2) the belief in the reactive nature of violence, and (3) a perspectivist approach that overlooks objective features of conflicts. These assumptions lead PCP researchers to oversimplify, perpetuate pseudoscientific views of and promote ineffective interventions to solve violent conflicts. By challenging these pillars and proposing a more nuanced framework, this paper aims to advance PCP toward a true science of peace-making that is better equipped to address contemporary global conflicts.",

          "authors": "Grace Reid; Ryan F Lei; Brandon Kinsler; Naomi Faber",
          "abstract": "Once children learn category-relevant traits and characteristics, they must automatically apply them to people to navigate social interactions. Yet, how social categorization becomes automatic is not entirely clear. The present work tests whether and how priming conceptual knowledge of social categories might influence the efficiency of social categorization across development. Children (N = 223; Mage = 7.24, SDage = 2.51; 132 girls, 90 boys; 50.26% racially minoritized; 49.74% White) were primed with gender-relevant, race-relevant, or neutral words and then gender-categorized racially diverse faces under a time constraint. Priming concepts of social categories delayed categorization for White children 6 years and younger. By 12 years, priming categories facilitated White children’s automatic categorizations. Conceptual priming did not affect the efficiency of racially minoritized children’s social categorizations. Top-down information then contributes to how social categorization becomes efficient, but children’s identity influences what information they use to inform categorizations.",

          "authors": "Leon Patrick Wendt",
          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2024) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

          "title": "Neurological and Behavioural Correlates of Construal in Economic Decision-Making Under Cognitive Load.",
          "authors": "Christopher James Wilson",
          "abstract": "Construal level has been shown to influence economic decisions, affecting both risk perception and risk-taking. However, there has been some inconsistency as to the exact effects of high/low construal on economic decisions, with some findings suggesting that construal might interact with cognitive load and self-control in a risk-taking context. In two experiments, the current paper examines behavioural and neurological (using functional near-infrared spectroscopy) responses to high and low construal manipulations during and economic decision task, under experimentally-induced cognitive load. We also examine the how construal interacts with self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy to predict lateral pre-frontal cortex (LPFC) activation during these decisions. Some of the behavioural results supported previous findings that under cognitive load, high construal prompts risk aversion. Neurological data supported the theory that construal promotes risk sensitivity. Self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy were all found to interact with construal in predicting LPFC activation during decision-making. These findings extend our understanding of how construal effects economic decisions under cognitive load while also providing new insights into how self-control, financial literacy and subjective numeracy might interact with construal in this context.",

          "title": "Embracing Ambiguity",
          "authors": "Dustin Fife",
          "abstract": "Objectivity has long been touted as a virtue in science, and certain statistical (e.g., null hypothesis significance testing) and scientific methods have been championed as means for obtaining objectivity. One way in which objectivity has been championed is through the use of universal statistical significance tests, where researchers conclude results are statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. While such objective criteria may improve communication and increase consensus, it does so at a cost. Specifically, objective criteria (such as p value threshholds) provide a means whereby poor quality studies can pass publication filters, they stifle creativity, and they thwart the self-correcting mechanisms of the scientific process. In this paper, I argue in favor of embracing ambiguity, either by allowing scientists to define their own criteria for statistical significance or by allowing researchers to refrain from making any decisions of statistical significance entirely. While allowing researchers to set their own decision criteria will inevitably lead to disagreements and a lack of consensus, it will only do so when evidence is weak. This is exactly as it should be, as disagreement should be welcomed in cases of interpretive ambiguity.. I conclude this paper by giving practical recommendations about how researchers might develop their own decision criteria using metrics relevant to their variables of interest.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in fluent conversation is a surprisingly complex task that requires interactants\nto promptly respond to each other in a way that is appropriate to the social context. In\nthis study, we disentangled different dimensions of turn-taking by investigating how the\ndynamics of child-adult interactions changed according to the activity (task-oriented versus\nfreer conversation) and the familiarity of the interlocutor (familiar versus unfamiliar).\nTwenty-eight autistic children (16 male; Mage = 10.8 years) and 20 age-matched typically\ndeveloping children (8 male; Mage = 9.6) participated in seven task-orientated face-to-face\nconversations with their caregivers (336 total conversations) and seven more telephone\nconversations alternately with their caregivers (144 total conversations, 60 with typical\ndevelopment group) and an experimenter (191 total conversations, 112 with autism\ngroup). By modelling inter-turn response latencies in multi-level Bayesian location-\nscale models to include long tails, we found good test-rest reliability across sessions and\ncontexts, and showed that context strongly shaped group differences in response latencies.\nAutistic children exhibited more overlaps, produced faster response latencies and shorter\npauses than than typically developing children – and these group differences were stronger\nwhen conversing with the unfamiliar experimenter. Unfamiliarity also made the relation\nbetween individual differences and latencies evident: only in conversations with the\nexperimenter were higher socio-cognitive skills, lower social motivation and lower social\nawareness associated with faster responses. Information flow and shared tempo were also\ninfluenced by familiarity: children adapted their response latencies to the predictability\nand tempo of their interlocutor’s turn, but only when interacting with their caregivers\nand not the experimenter. These results highlight the need to construe turn-taking as\na multicomponential construct that is shaped by individual differences, interpersonal\ndynamics, and the affordances of the context.",

          "abstract": "Although Assessment Center (AC) role-play assessments have received ample attention in past research, their reliance on actual behavioral information is still unclear. Uncovering the behavioral basis of AC role-play assessments is, however, a prerequisite for the optimization of existing and the development of novel automated AC procedures. This work provides a first data-driven benchmark for the behavioral prediction and explanation of AC performance judgments. We used machine learning models trained on behavioral cues (C = 36) to predict performance judgments in three interpersonal AC exercises from a real-life high-stakes AC (selection of medical students, N = 199). Three main findings emerged: First, behavioral prediction models showed substantial predictive performance and outperformed prediction models representing potential judgment biases. Comparisons with in-sample results revealed overfitting of traditional approaches, highlighting the importance of out-of-sample evaluations. Second, we demonstrate that linear combinations of behavioral cues can be strong predictors of assessors’ judgments. Third, we identified consistent exercise-specific patterns of individual cues and cross-exercise consistent behavioral patterns of behavioral dimensions and interpersonal strategies that were especially predictive of the assessors’ judgments. We discuss implications for future research and practice.",

          "abstract": "In Eastern Europe, collective victim beliefs have become integral elements of national ideologies, especially amid rising geopolitical polarisation. In this study, we investigated how exclusive victimhood was related to geopolitical attitudes in Hungary and Serbia. The study involved Serbian (N = 630) and Hungarian (N = 471) adult national samples stratified by gender, age, political orientation, and place of residence. As expected, exclusive victimhood predicted higher support for a geopolitical shift from the West (i.e., EU and US) to the East (i.e., Russia and China) via Euroscepticism in both samples. In Serbia, the strongest indirect effect was observed among participants with neutral attitudes towards the war in Ukraine. In Hungary, there was no expected moderated mediation while the direct effect of exclusive victimhood on the West-to-East geopolitical shift was largest for pro-Russian participants and non-significant for pro-Ukrainian participants. Different measures of ethnic identity showed no expected moderation effect, but an exploratory analysis revealed that exclusive victimhood partially mediated the relationship between identity measures (superiority and attachment) and support for a pro-Eastern (vs. pro-Western) geopolitical orientation. We discuss how the construals of the past based on exclusive victimhood shape future geopolitical preferences of the public in Hungary and Serbia.",

          "abstract": "Confidence is increasingly viewed as a barrier to recognizing misinformation, as people who are more confident tend to be more likely to believe and share false news. Here, we challenge this view by distinguishing between two types of confidence: general confidence in one’s abilities, and specific confidence in a particular judgment. Using a large, pre-registered study in which participants judge the accuracy of news posts, we demonstrate a striking dissociation between these two forms of confidence. While higher general confidence is associated with worse discernment of true versus false headlines (in line with past work), we find that higher confidence in specific judgments is associated with better truth discernment - a finding that we observe among both Democrats and Republicans. These results call for a reevaluation of the role of confidence in the detection of misinformation. Focusing on confidence in specific judgments, rather than general abilities, could play an important role in helping to mitigate belief in misinformation.",

However, no research to date has used a multi-pronged assessment approach necessary to investigate whether and how affective congruence typically relates to empathy (i.e., perception of others’ affect, self-reported affect, and self-reported empathy during interpersonal interactions). Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between affective congruence and empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person). We found that while empathy is generally higher when there is affective congruence, empathy is highest when there is congruence in high positive affect. Further, people are least empathetic when they feel emotionally worse than they perceive the other person is feeling. These findings provide novel insights into the empathic processes.",

          "authors": "Lorenzo Lorenzo-Luaces; Meghana Boinpally; Johan Bollen",
          "abstract": "Background: Young adults in the United States are heavy users of social media which has been identified as a possible risk factor for depression. However, it is unclear whether social media use is associated with internalizing disorder symptom vulnerability beyond depression or whether it is related to other relevant symptom dimensions like externalizing symptoms (e.g., substance use). Moreover, it is unclear what aspects of social media use beyond frequency are associated to symptoms. Methods: A large cohort of undergraduate students from a Midwest university (N= 7123) participated in a screening of transdiagnostic symptoms of psychopathology. Data collected included: time spent on social media, social media platforms used, and aspects of problematic social media use (i.e., use for emotion regulation, compulsive use, or social-media-related impairment). We also collected sociodemographics and self-reported symptoms: depression, panic, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, alcohol use, drug use, insomnia, and pain. We correlated depression scores to time spent on social media to confirm prior findings of an association between social media use and depression. We then used a principal components analysis to identify shared dimensions of psychopathology across these symptoms and explored the correlations between symptom dimensions and elements of social media use. Results: Participants who reported higher social media usage exhibited significantly higher self-reported depression. Our PCA suggested two dimensions of psychopathology consistent with the HiTOP model which we dubbed “emotional” and “externalizing” symptoms. Time spent on social media was correlated with emotional symptoms and with externalizing symptoms, albeit to a lesser extent. However, these associations were not significant after controlling for problematic social media use. Moreover, problematic social media use had differential relations to dimensions of psychopathology. For example, using social media for emotion regulation was associated with more severe internalizing symptoms but less severe externalizing symptoms. E-value analysis suggested that unmeasured confounds could potentially explain these associations. Discussion: Our results suggest that the association between time spent on social media and psychopathology could be accounted for by the way in which social media is used, which in turn is differentially associated to emotional and externalizing symptoms. However, unmeasured confounding remains a threat to these inferences.",

          "abstract": "Many religious concepts, such as belief in the existence of God, cannot be learned through first-hand observation alone. How do young learners come to develop a sense of belief in religion and the supernatural? We take a social-interactionist perspective to this question and argue that children’s belief is dependent on the particular cultural input to which they are exposed in their environment. We highlight research showing the impact of learning via interaction with family, peers, and the larger environment. Within these contexts, children learn both via the verbal testimonial information to which they are exposed, as well as through participating in rituals, and imitating other cultural group members. We indicate specific mechanisms that aid in the transmission of belief such as the credibility of the informant, the quality of the explanation posed to the child, and the saliency of the ritual. Such mechanisms can shed light on important ways in which to present novel information to learners across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "This study uses unique auction data to study loss aversion in sellers. Our analysis of TV shows including 512 auctions and 3,940 offers reveals that sellers perceive the appraised market value as the reference price. Consistent with the predictions of prospect theory, the likelihood to bargain for higher offers as well as the willingness to sell then reflects loss aversion. Specifically, we find that most bargaining happens in the loss domain and that sellers are 6% more likely to bargain for higher offers when the current offer is below the appraised market value. Conversely, the median value of accepted offers falls precisely on the reference price and willingness to sell is 11% higher for offers in the gain domain. We also investigate reference point formation and find that sellers’ initial expectations affect the outcomes of auctions. Consistent with the application of a MinMax heuristic, sellers who initially underestimate the value of their item sell below the reference price while sellers who initially overestimate the value of their item sell above the reference price. Finally, we find that duration of ownership can positively influence sellers’ price expectations, but neither duration of ownership nor emotional attachment affect seller behavior.",

We argue that qualitative researchers have largely been overlooked in guidance on participating in open science, but that the shared values among interpretivist qualitative research and open science offer many opportunities for converging practices. Central values of open science, including openness, integrity, and rigor, have long been espoused by qualitative researchers and enacted in practice. However, we argue that there is even more potential for qualitative researchers to participate in open science by enacting practices that have been appropriately designed or modified for qualitative methodologies. We present seven open science practices that we suggest that qualitative researchers adopt to further the openness, integrity, and rigor of our scholarship. We close by discussing the implications of these practices for researchers across methodologies and communities of practice.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between the theme of interdependence in the narratives of American adults with disabilities during the first three years of the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological well-being.  In contrast to independence, interdependence has emerged as a focus of research about people with disabilities in both the humanistic discipline of disability studies and in prior psychological research.  In the present study, 108 participants completed questionnaires assessing well-being and responded to three narrative prompts once a year between 2020 and 2022, resulting in a total of 952 narratives.  Narratives were reliably coded for the new narrative variable of interdependence.  In addition, narratives were also reliably coded for the narrative themes of independence, dependence, agency, submissiveness, communion, and disconnection.  The results of multi-level modeling analyses indicated that the themes of interdependence and disconnection were most strongly associated with psychological well-being over time.  Within-person analyses indicated that higher levels of interdependence were associated with lower levels of well-being in 2020 and with higher levels of well-being in 2022.  These results (along with a qualitative case study) suggest that the associations between narrative themes and well-being are contextualized and may demonstrate unusual associations during periods of extreme events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.  This study quantitatively establishes interdependence as an important narrative theme, one especially salient for people with disabilities.  It also suggests that people with disabilities may offer alternative ways of narrating contemporary American identity that might serve as an example for non-disabled and disabled people alike.",

Many insights are starting to form an overall picture of the unique difficulties for establishing functional and precise phonolexical representations in L2; however, in order for the field to move forward it is pertinent to outline its major emerging research questions and existing challenges. Among significant obstacles for further research, the paper explores the current lack of theoretical agreement on the concept of phonolexical representations and the underlying mechanism involved in establishing them, as well as the variable use of the related terminology (e.g. fuzziness and target-like). Methodological challenges involved in investigating phonological processing and phonolexical representations as well as their theoretical implications are also discussed. To conclude, we explore the significance of L2-specific phonological representations for bottom-up lexical access during casual, conversational speech, and how our emerging knowledge of L2 lexical representations can be applied in an instructional setting as two potentially fruitful research avenues at the forefront of the current research agenda.",

          "abstract": "Cultural experiences can be a powerful influence on human cognition. Here, we asked whether the experience with written language, a human cultural invention, predicts the speed of spoken word recognition beyond any (potential) influence of spoken language experience. Previous research had obtained inconsistent and contradictory results using a variety of experimental methods. Using a large dataset (Hintz et al., 2024a) that is unprecedented in size (number of participants) and depth (number of skills assessed), 613 typically developed native Dutch adults between 18 and 30 years carried out a lexical decision task (ALDT), a standard spoken word recognition task. The task neither involved pictorial input nor sentential processing. Participants listened to Dutch words and nonwords and judged their lexical status as quickly as possible. We performed drift diffusion modelling on the lexical decision response times and focused on drift rate as an indicator for the amount of auditory information that individuals accumulate before deciding on non/words’ lexical status. We hypothesized that participants differed in the quality of their lexical representations due to their spoken and written language experience and thus in how quickly and efficiently these representations can be accessed. Hierarchical regression analyses on participants’ drift rate parameters revealed that written rather than spoken language experience predicts speed of spoken word recognition. Further research could be directed at elucidating the exact mechanisms of these cultural (reading) influences on spoken word recognition.",

          "abstract": "Exposure to musical rhythms has been shown to influence the perception of subsequently presented speech. Until now, this effect has only been studied in native language (L1) processing. The present study investigated whether rhythmic priming could also benefit second language (L2) processing. A musical rhythmic priming experiment was designed based on previous studies in L1 children. Over two experiments, 66 L2 adult speakers of French were asked to detect grammatical errors in naturally spoken French sentences. Sentences were either preceded by a regular or an irregular musical rhythmic prime. We also assessed participants’ French language level, rhythmic perception abilities, and musical training. In Experiment 1, participants from various L1 backgrounds were recruited. In Experiment 2, only participants with a Latin native language were recruited. For both experiments, grammaticality judgments did not differ after regular versus irregular rhythmic primes. However, grammaticality judgments correlated significantly with rhythmic abilities, suggesting that participants with better rhythm perception were better at grammaticality judgment tasks. Moreover, musicians were better at detecting grammatical errors than those who had not received music training. We also found that the rhythmic priming effect (better grammatical judgments after regular than after irregular rhythms) increased with the number of years of musical training, suggesting that regular rhythmic primes may improve L2 perception in particular for musically trained participants. The results offer promising perspectives on the use of musical rhythmic primes as a means of improving language skills in second language acquisition, and on the potential impact of musical training on language processing.",

In our tutorial, we highlight the importance of setting a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) for which researchers want to conduct their power analysis. The SESOI is the smallest effect that is practically or theoretically relevant for a specific field of research or study. We provide how such a SESOI can be established and how it changes hypotheses from simply establishing whether there is a statistically significant effect (i.e., null-hypothesis significance testing) to whether the effects are practically or theoretically important (i.e., minimum-effect testing) or whether the effect is too small to care about (i.e., equivalence testing). We show how power analyses for these different hypothesis tests can be conducted via a confidence interval focused approach. This confidence interval focused simulation-based power analysis can be adapted to different research designs and questions and improves the reproducibility of power analyses.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive research on the cognitive basis for mathematical activity, the associations between long-term memory and math skills remain relatively understudied. In our fuzzy-trace theory-driven study, we addressed this issue by investigating the relationships between long-term memory for numbers and prominent math skills, namely approximate number processing, arithmetic fluency, and math reasoning, along with math self-concept. Individuals who performed better in the numerical memory task demonstrated better math reasoning, a higher math self-concept, and were more arithmetically fluent at the general level and in multiplication and division when analyzed separately, but not in addition, subtraction, or approximate number processing. Crucially, our memory task, based on the conjoint recognition model, allowed us to go beyond merely measuring overall performance and, as a result, to test fine-grained memory processes related to two memory traces: verbatim (remembering exact numbers) and gist (remembering a general intuition about a number’s magnitude). While both gist and verbatim processes were associated with different math skills, the associations with gist-based processes were more prominent. On the other hand, even though math self-concept was positively associated with overall numerical memory performance, it correlated significantly only with verbatim-based processes. We discuss our results in relation to the findings of a few previous fuzzy-trace theory-driven studies on mathematical cognition, highlighting discrepancies between them and their possible origins. Overall, our study shows the nuanced role of long-term memory in mathematical skills and demonstrates the power of fuzzy-trace theory in the fine-grained investigation of mathematical cognition.",

Psychology, like many other disciplines, uses peer review to determine whether researchers’ work is published, where it is published, and in what form. However, the peer review system is imperfect, often perpetuating harm, exclusion, and inequities. We believe these problems hinder psychology from becoming a truly representative and valid science. In this paper, we uncover the historical roots of the peer review system in psychology and describe how these roots persist today. Then, using personality psychology as an exemplar, we leverage a social justice lens to: (1) document key contemporary problems in the peer review system; (2) identify global challenges in peer review; and (3) provide recommendations and guiding questions that might help the field become more equitable, diverse, just, and inclusive. To do so, we draw upon three sources of information: our personal experiences, qualitative and quantitative data from 104 self-identifying personality psychologists, and the prior literature. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to give voice to those who have been harmed in peer review, and to inform how we might reimagine peer review in personality psychology and beyond.",

Using a novel paradigm, we tested people’s capacity to infer another person’s desires, beliefs, or visual experience across three logically equivalent tasks. Despite the logical equivalence, people were less accurate, slower, and reported expending more effort when inferring the content of others’ visual experience compared to inferring others' beliefs and desires (Experiments 1 and 2; N = 120 U.S. adults and N = 60 U.S. adults). However, additional training rapidly improved people’s capacity to infer others’ visual experience (Experiment 3; N = 60 U.S. adults).

          "authors": "Dustin Fife; Joseph Lee Rodgers",
          "abstract": "The standard undergraduate statistics curriculum, which focuses on testing hypotheses, was first developed a century ago when hand-calculations dominated statistical analysis. While graduate training has advanced somewhat, the undergraduate curriculum has remained relatively unchanged for the last 50-100 years. This situation is particularly troubling when one considers how it fails to prepare students for advanced statistical methods, perpetuates misunderstandings, and masks the underlying logic of statistics. It also is highly limited in its application, leading researchers to shoehorn their analyses into a hypothesis-testing framework. An alternative to the hypothesis-testing framework is one that focuses on building, evaluating, and comparing models. In this paper, we argue that a modeling framework (and an extension of modeling called ‘model comparisons’) highlights the underlying logic of statistics, deepens understanding of the language of statistics, prepares students for advanced procedures, and promotes sound statistical reasoning. We argue for a pedagogical shift away from the hypothesis testing status quo and toward a modeling framework, all while discussing obstacles to such a change and how such obstacles might be (fairly) easily overcome.",

          "authors": "Junsong Lu; Chujun Lin",
          "abstract": "People make a variety of social inferences about others in daily life. Long-standing research suggests that these inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). However, prior work relied on constrained designs (e.g., face images, forced ratings), limiting ecological validity. Others suggest that social inferences are more complex than just a few dimensions could summarize but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences unreducible to shared latent constructs better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing what inferences people tended to make for the same individual and how inferences shifted from concrete to abstract over time (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one social inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative, non-mutually exclusive model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with the low-dimensional latent construct approach.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of research on emotion regulation processes has been restricted to controlled laboratory settings that use experimental paradigms to investigate short-term outcomes. A true understanding of emotion regulation requires an unobtrusive, ecologically valid assessment of the construct as it occurs in the environment. Digital phenotyping is a novel method for evaluating human behavior in naturalistic settings. \nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate whether smartphone-based digital phenotyping data predicts individual differences in emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings.\nMethods: During an in-lab session, unselected university student participants (N = 69) completed self-report questionnaires measuring trait emotion regulation as well as state emotion regulation and state affect following a baseline period, a negative mood induction, and a recovery period. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping data were then collected over the course of a 7-day follow-up. Variation in global positioning system (GPS) distance and mobile power state level were examined as predictors of longitudinal variation in negative affect, emotion regulation, and depression. \nResults: Results showed that variation in GPS distance was significantly associated with variation in state cognitive reappraisal (b = -0.0004, SE = 0.0002, p = .02) and negative state affect (b = 0. 005, SE = 0.002, p = .01) over time. Variation in power state level was also significantly associated with variation in cognitive reappraisal over time (b = -4.98, SE = 1.72, p = .005) and marginally associated with variation in negative state affect (b = -29.58, SE = 16.73, p = .08) over time. Cluster and classification analyses showed both power state level and GPS distance accurately classified two trait emotion regulation clusters with high sensitivity (.95 and .96 respectively) and specificity (.86 and .97 respectively). Variation in power state level and GPS distance together with trait and state emotion regulation did not predict current depressive symptoms (ps &gt; .05).\nConclusions: Overall, the findings provide initial and foundational data on the use of digital phenotyping data in predicting individual differences in state and trait emotion regulation in both in-lab and naturalistic settings. The results suggest that operationalizations of digital phenotyping data and modeling approaches are particularly important factors to consider when implementing digital phenotyping methodology in the study of mental health processes such as emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "The construct of racial microaggressions has been well-contested in the psychological literature, and numerous methodological challenges have been presented in terms of operationalizing and measuring racial microaggressions. To that end, racial microaggressions, stress, and coping may be best measured by combining ambulatory assessment and qualitative methods to better understand how microaggressions are contextualized in real-time. This study aimed to explore the day-level associations between perceived stress and racial microaggressions among graduate students of color using an 8-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method. Participants (N=36; M age= 28.4, SD=2.24) completed a baseline survey and a 7-day EMA protocol, providing contextual information on instances of racial microaggressions as well as bi-daily measurements of perceived stress. Qualitative analysis of EMA data, utilizing thematic and content analysis, revealed that racial microaggressions were primarily verbal, often related to assumptions of threat or intelligence. Quantitative analysis using linear mixed-effect models indicated no significant associations between the frequency of racial microaggressions and changes in daily perceived stress. However, greater frequency of microaggressions measured via the Racial and Ethnic Microaggressions Scale (REMS) were significantly related to a greater frequency of racial microaggressions as measured by EMA. These findings provide insights into the frequency, context, and impact of racial microaggressions among graduate students of color and call upon future research to employ more data-intensive approaches to understand racial microaggressions' impact on mental well-being in other marginalized groups.",

Despite well-documented issues of validity and reliability with polygraphs, they continue to be used in various stages of the legal system. With Black individuals already facing disproportionate incarceration rates, the reduced reliability for skin conductance used in polygraphs for Black individuals can further exacerbate legal system inequity. Furthermore, these biases accentuate existing challenges interpreting polygraph results given their subjectivity as well as the heightened police-related anxiety reported among Black individuals.

Here, we share our experiences and recommendations for identifying and preventing bad actors and bots from enrolling in remote studies of cognitive task performance. As part of a large-scale study, 3,488 participants were recruited through various platforms, including social media and MTurk, and were compensated for their participation. Participants were categorized according to bad actor status as determined by 1) number and risk-level associated with red flags within initial screening and pattern of responses; and 2) a researcher review process to identify patterns of aberrant, patterned, or inconsistent responding. Participants were either automatically labeled as bad actors (n=2,829), labeled as bad actors after researcher review (n=242), or labeled as good actors after researcher review (n=417). Cognitive task performance was assessed with Adaptive Cognitive Evaluation Explorer (ACE-X), a mobile, gamified collection of executive function tasks including measures of working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. We considered differences between good and bad actors for mean response times, variability in response times, accuracy, and number of trials attempted. Across 6 of the 7 ACE-X tasks evaluated, bad actors responded slower than good actors on average (β=34.10-150.15, P&lt;.001-.047). Additional differences in task performance suggested that overall, bad actors also tended to be more variable in their response times (β=-0.32-1.01, P&lt;.001), less accurate (β=-2.15-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000), and responded to fewer trials (β=-1.30-.00, P&lt;.001-1.000).

Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants’ evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self- and other- evaluations depended directly on the combination of self- and other- outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one’s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, self-positivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one’s partner’s benefits for self-evaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner’s, rather than one’s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others’ outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self.  The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.",

The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence for an emerging cognitive-affect model of PA by investigating the effect of pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control on exercise-induced affect and perceptions of exertion. \nMethods: Healthy active young adults (N=28, 22.50 ± 3.25 yrs; 75% ♀, BMI = 24.89 ± 4.37 kg·m-2) completed the Flanker and N-back tasks (2 &amp; 3-back) before completing an acute bout (31-min) of moderate-to-vigorous intensity (HR= 158.6 ± 9.9 b·min-1) treadmill running. Feeling Scale (FS) and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were recorded every 3-minutes during the running session. Participants’ prior enjoyment to running was recorded pre-session and the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was measured immediately following the session. \nResults: Reaction time (RT) measures were used for the cognitive tasks. Participants RT performance during 2-back (β= -0.51, t(23) = -2.51, P &lt; 0.05) and 3-back (β= -0.40, t(24)= -2.14, P&lt; 0.05) predicted more positive FS (i.e., pleasure) during exercise. Flanker RT significantly predicted RPE (β= 0.49, t(21)= 2.24, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, pre-exercise EF was not associated with post-exercise enjoyment (i.e., PACES). \nConclusion: Pre-exercise working memory and inhibitory control performance predicted affect and perceived exertion during exercise.

Children (n = 95, 4-8 years old, 30ADC/65TC, 34M/59F/2NB, 55 White / 35 of color / 5 did not report) completed five trials of an Adoption Task concerning five personal characteristics (hair color, spoken language, personality, interests, and intelligence). Across trials, ADC children made fewer essentialist judgments than TC children (ηp2 = .07); the odds of an essentialist response were threefold greater among TC than ADC participants. Exploratory analyses revealed that with age, children’s essentialist judgments became increasingly differentiated across different characteristics (e.g., increasingly divergent views of the genetic basis of hair color vs. spoken language), and that this differentiation was more pronounced in the ADC than the TC sample. No differences were observed in the genetic-essentialist views of ADC and TC children’s parents, suggesting that the mechanism underlying effects was children’s own sense-making capacities. Whereas nature and nurture are confounded for TC children, these factors are decoupled for ADC children, supporting them in building their causal theories. Cognitive, developmental, and social implications are discussed, along with translational implications for ADC children and their families.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers advantages over retrospective questionnaires by reducing recall bias and capturing rapid symptom dynamics, and it is increasingly used to measure depression symptoms. However, few depression symptom measures are validated for EMA use in the manner expected for traditional questionnaires. Therefore, the current study examined the internal consistency, longitudinal stability, and convergent validity of the Mobile Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (MPHQ-9), a version of the PHQ-9 modified for EMA. Depressed participants (N = 280; Female = 83.93%; White = 79.29%) completed the MPHQ-9 three times daily for 90 days. Data from the first and last 2 weeks were analyzed to align with a pre-study PHQ-9 and post-study PHQ-9 and Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms - Expanded Version (IDAS-II). The MPHQ-9 demonstrated fair to substantial adjusted item-total correlations (r = 0.42–0.83), often exceeding the PHQ-9 (r = 0.39–0.72). Inter-item correlations ranged from slight to substantial for the MPHQ-9 (r = 0.26–0.87) and were typically larger than the correlations observed for the PHQ-9 (r = 0.11–0.71). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were substantial for both the MPHQ-9 (.91) and PHQ-9 (.81). The MPHQ-9 showed moderate and superior stability (r = .69), compared to the slight stability of the PHQ-9 (r = .39). There was moderate agreement between the MPHQ-9 and both the PHQ-9 (r = .71) and the IDAS-II General Depression subscale (r = .65). This study provides initial validation of the MPHQ-9 and suggests it may be a better measure of depression symptomatology than the PHQ-9 in some contexts.",

          "abstract": "Societal expectations have been found to determine which social roles people should occupy. However, so far, these beliefs have been mainly explored using implicit measures where expectation-confirming (vs. violating) judgments tend to be more efficient. The present study (N = 44) applied a novel approach – the random generation paradigm – to explore how pre-existing social assumptions determine which information is retrieved from memory when prompted by different social categories. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ explicit estimates of gender proportions. Together, these findings offer a new, and widely applicable, method for exploring cultural beliefs and help clarify how social information is sampled from memory when making social judgments.",

Our research investigated how two competing causal information encountered at different times during an event description affect memory of that event. Our first experiment (N = 67) found a misleading post-event information effect (correct first; incorrect second) with written texts (rather than videos and questions). Our second experiment (N = 51) found a continued influence effect with a reversed order of accurate and misleading causes (incorrect first; correct second). Thus, both experiments demonstrated misinformation effects. Our third experiment (N = 54) showed that presenting incorrect and correct causes in direct relation reduced the influence of misinformation.

          "authors": "Maurizio Sicorello; Moritz Elsaesser; David R. Kolar",
          "abstract": "Difficulties in emotion regulation are an essential transdiagnostic phenomenon of mental health. While there is extensive literature focusing on emotion regulation difficulties as trait-like constructs, it is inherently a dynamic process that unfolds over time. This raises the need for state-like measures to capture these temporal dynamics in both laboratory and real-world settings, such as the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS). In the present study, we report the German translation and validation of the S-DERS and present a cross-sectional network analysis to stimulate novel hypotheses for pathways linking single discrete difficulties. A sample of 214 participants underwent a negative mood induction followed by an assessment of the 21-item S-DERS. The results confirm the four-factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of the original English version. Consistent with previous studies on the trait-DERS, we find that an exploratory structural equation modeling approach with extensive cross-loadings is necessary to reach good model fit. Moreover, a model with four correlated factors outperformed a bi-factor and high-order model. This indicates there is no single latent construct of emotion regulation difficulties, but rather four distinct but related constructs for (a) Non-acceptance of Current Emotions, (b) Limited Ability to Modulate Current Emotional and Behavioral Responses, (c) Lack of Awareness of Current Emotions, and (d) Lack of Clarity about Current Emotions. These associations may imply a complex causal interplay between these factors.",

These selection procedures have faced extensive criticism for being biased with respect to socio-demographic factors. However, the different methodologies adopted in prior research to assess target selection have made it difficult to evaluate the actual existence of biases, especially due to difficulties in establishing a comparable benchmark population. To circumvent these limitations, we propose using covert systematic social observations as a method to investigate and evaluate the potential bias of police’s selection procedures. Using the weapon control performed by the Dutch police in Amsterdam in 2022 as a case, we present a method to detect selection biases based on ethnic profiles of citizens that can be reliably applied and has the benefit of allowing for varying police’s selection practices. In sum, given how covert on-site observations offer a realistic picture of how the situation unfolds, we recommend this as a method to examine stop-and-search actions and other bias-prone citizen selection procedures.",

However, there is a mismatch between the elderly’s appreciation of assistive technology in theory and their adoption in practice. The current study investigates, via a mixed methods approach, key variables that influence the perception of the elderly towards in-house digital assistants. A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector. Emphasizing these two factors may therefore increase the adoption and acceptance of digital assistants, allowing longer aging in place.",

Our goal is to determine if users consider the value of the data to be collected when planning to use such devices. Drawing on theories from media and cognitive psychology, we proposed two causal and two extended models of privacy behavior and conducted a study to compare the evidence for one over the other respectively. We employed a factorial within-between-subject design (NA = 517; NB = 420), considering five types of smart home devices, three levels of endogenous data value (severity of risks), and three levels of exogenous data value (likelihood of risks). Bayes Factor model comparisons of the fit multilevel models indicated extreme relative evidence for the model assuming value-dependent privacy behavior over one predicting deviations from rational data valuation.

          "abstract": "Spending time alone is a virtually inevitable part of daily life that can promote or undermine well-being. Here, we explore how the language used to describe time alone—such as “me-time” “solitude,” or “isolation”—influences how it is perceived and experienced. In Study 1 (N = 500), participants evaluated five common labels for time alone. Descriptive and narrative evidence revealed robust interindividual variability and significant mean differences in how these labels were perceived. Overall, “me-time” was rated most positively, and “isolation” was rated least positively (but not negatively). In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated the linguistic framing of time alone, describing it as either “me-time” or “isolation”. Participants (N = 176) then spent 30 minutes physically alone, without digital interaction. Notably, positive affect increased for participants in the “me-time” condition but decreased for those in the “isolation” condition. Negative affect decreased for both conditions, but the magnitude of the decrease was larger after “me-time”. Additionally, linguistic framing affected what people thought about, but not what they did, while alone. People’s beliefs about being alone improved after “me-time” but not after “isolation.” These findings demonstrate meaningful variation in how people perceive different labels that refer to time alone and suggest that simple linguistic shifts may enhance subjective experiences of time alone.",

          "abstract": "Social disconnection, which includes objective social isolation and subjective loneliness, is associated with increased risk of physical health problems and early mortality. The hypothesized nature in which social disconnection operates was recently outlined in the theory of social homeostasis. The theory proposes that individuals strive to maintain an optimal level of social connection, with loneliness serving an adaptive purpose by motivating social reconnection and preventing prolonged isolation. Social homeostasis may be especially relevant for explaining how social disconnection can evolve and change over time in various forms of psychopathology. In this paper we developed a mathematical model based on the theory of social homeostasis to help explain social disconnection in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, two mental disorders characterized by social functioning impairments. First, we formalized the theory of social homeostasis as a set of differential equations. We then implemented the equations computationally using simulations. From there, we simulated three examples of the model, including an example characterizing a theoretical healthy individual and examples characterizing theoretical individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The healthy simulation successfully reproduced the predicted dynamics of social homeostasis, while the bipolar and schizophrenia simulations revealed distinct patterns of social dysfunction. By formalizing social homeostasis through differential equations, we provide a more precise framework for understanding how social disconnection can evolve over time as a dynamical system. We also discuss the model’s implications for future psychopathology research and highlight potential avenues for theory and model refinement.",

          "abstract": "Emotional crying is a complex and multifaceted expression that is frequently observed in humans. Its communicative effects have been recently studied in more detail. However, many studies focus on just one specific feature of emotional crying, most often emotional tears, neglecting the complex nature of the expression. Reports about crying episodes observe that tears most commonly occur in combination with other features such as facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, and varied temporal dynamics. This shortcoming in research is mostly explained by a lack of adequately controlled stimuli depicting different crying features. Here, we provide a solution for this problem by introducing the Dynamic Posed Emotional Crying Behavior Database (DPECBD), an openly available resource of 500 videos depicting 10 actors showing variations in tears intensity, facial expression intensity, vocalizations, gestures, and temporal dynamics and the combination thereof. We present two studies (N = 2729) providing evidence for the validity of the database. In addition, we developed a static supplementary resource (DPECBD-S) with 70 pictures depicting variations in tears and facial expression intensity that was successfully validated across two studies (N = 601). Overall, our findings support the validity of this new stimulus set that closes a gap in the research on the interpersonal effects of emotional crying.

Atypical lateralization in auditory processing has been widely accepted associated with impaired reading skills in alphabetic languages. However, whether Chinese adults with reading difficulty (RD) history presents atypical lateralization in auditory processing similar to those in alphabetic languages remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Chinese adults with poor reading would show lateralization of neural oscillations during auditory sampling. \nDesign: Thirty-two adults with self-report RD history and 44 adults without RD history were screened out by Chinese Adult Reading History Questionnaire (CARHQ). Reading accuracy, phonological accuracy, and rapid automatized naming (RAN) were assessed in all the participants. Auditory steady state cortical responses (ASSR) modulated at 10-80 Hz was recorded during a 6s white noise. Time-frequency power and phase synchrony indices were used to measure induced oscillatory power and synchrony of beta and gamma oscillations related to phonemic processing. \nResults: Adults with RD history performed worse than adults without RD history in reading accuracy and phonological accuracy. Also, adults with RD history showed atypical rightward lateralization in the gamma band, whereas the adults without RD history showed leftward lateralization. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in the left hemisphere negatively correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history, while left hemisphere ERSP lateralization positively correlated with phonological accuracy in adults without RD history. The inter-trial phase synchrony (ITPS) in the right hemisphere also correlated with reading accuracy in adults with RD history. \nConclusions: The present study revealed auditory lateralization deficits in Chinese adults with RD history. \nKeywords: Reading difficulty history, Chinese adults, Auditory processing, Lateralization, Event-related spectral perturbation.",

Verbal data is collected using jsPsych (De Leeuw, 2015), making it suitable for online and lab-based experiments. The transcription and analyses rely on machine-learning methods (e.g., large-language models), making them substantially more efficient than current methods using human coders. We demonstrate how to use the software we provide in a case study via a simple memory experiment. This collection of software was made to be modular, so that the various components can be updated and replaced with superior models and new methods easily added.

Adolescents' peer-reported social status and behaviors were associated with the SMU patterns. Withdrawn or more prosocial adolescents were less likely to engage in SMU overall. Popular or proactive aggressive adolescents were likely to show non-problematic heavy SMU, while disliked, reactively aggressive, or less pro-social adolescents showed some risk for problematic SMU.

          "abstract": "Retrieved-context models of memory posit that a slowly drifting neural context signal is encoded alongside items in memory. However, this signal can be disrupted by event boundaries, affecting the temporal relationships between items across event boundaries. Here, we investigated how temporal proximity and event boundaries affect the detailed recall of events. Specifically, we assessed memory for events in the movie Forrest Gump, chosen specifically because of its hierarchical event structure with individual events in the movie being nested within broader life-periods (e.g., childhood, college, etc.). Importantly, the trial order at recall was structured such that adjacent trials tested events that were (1) either temporally close or far and (2) either within or across a life period. Participants provided both more event-specific details and more false memories for an event when the preceding event came from the same life period, suggesting that recall of the life period supported recall of episodic information, but also increased the likelihood of providing false information. Further, participants provided more intrusions from non-cued events after just recalling an event that was temporally distant, with this effect exacerbated if the preceding event was also across a life period boundary. Quantifying event similarity between the cued event and the sources of intrusions suggests that participants may be providing supplementary information to help scaffold memory for the cued event. Altogether, these results demonstrate that both temporal proximity and event boundaries affect detailed memory recall, extending previous findings into the domain of naturalistic events.",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals commonly exhibit difficulties with emotion recognition, difficulties that contribute to social issues in Autism. Both emotion recognition and social abilities are distributed along a spectrum in Autism and the general population. We explored this relationship between emotional processing, as measured via the physiological response of pupil dilation, and Autistic traits, including social abilities. We presented participants with dynamic, audiovisual stimuli of actors uttering a semantically neutral phrase. These utterances were expressed with either neutral tone of voice and facial expression, or with angry, fearful, disgusted, sad, or surprised tone and expression. Each emotion was presented with high- and low-intensity depictions. Participants were asked to identify the emotion and rate its intensity. Participants’ pupillary responses were recorded during viewing. Traits associated with Autism were measured through a battery of self-report scales. We then tested for associations between Autistic traits and pupillary response to emotional stimuli. Broadly speaking, individuals with higher Autistic traits exhibited smaller overall pupillary responses to emotional stimuli. More specifically, emotional responses were related to socio-communicative Autistic traits. Further, social traits were especially correlated with physiological responses to low-intensity emotional presentation. This reflects previous studies suggesting that Autistic individuals show more pronounced difficulties with emotion recognition when emotional expression is more subtle. Finally, social Autistic traits were related to physiological responses to anger, fear, surprise, and to a lesser extent happiness, but not to sadness or disgust.",

No gender difference in science-task persistence was found, and Bayesian analysis indicated moderate support for the null hypothesis of no gender effect. Instead, task accuracy and enjoyment predicted persistence. There was mixed evidence of gender-STEM stereotypes, and stereotypes did not relate to persistence on the science task.

          "abstract": "In recent years, the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has proliferated across various domains, ranging from advertising and social media to the generation of artwork for presentation at esteemed art exhibitions and for sale on the art auction market. Despite its growing prevalence, empirical data show that people maintain a clear bias against AI-generated art. Here we explore why this bias might exist, and whether its existence dooms the eventual acceptance and even celebration of art generated by artificial means. We do this by bringing together recent empirical evidence from the disciplines of neuroaesthetics, social cognition, art history, and human-machine interaction to develop several new perspectives that are ripe for empirical evaluation. Given the growing momentum and outlook of AI-generated art in today’s society, our aim with this paper is to provide novel evidence-based propositions for understanding the relationship between art and artificial intelligence with a clear focus on social cognitive neuroscience perspectives.",

          "abstract": "Analogies are a fundamental part of our cognition and communication. Humans are also a social species with shared cultural repertoires learnt throughout our lifetimes. As such, we expect analogies to enable the learning of complex, novel information by communication that takes advantage of shared cultural information. Here, we demonstrate the plausibility of this proposal and clarify its scope through computational modelling. We first model the individual-level process of learning via analogy with access to a shared repertoire of cultural information, using NK landscapes to represent high-dimensional solution spaces for complex problems. We then analyse a model of population dynamics to consider the conditions under which analogical communication will evolve and be maintained when costly. Our analyses suggest that even when analogy use is costly in terms of both search time and memory constraints, it can nevertheless be advantageous by allowing learners to obtain high-quality solutions more efficiently and more often than those who don't learn via analogy.",

          "abstract": "Social media has increasingly been recognized as guiding public opinion and shaping attitudes towards a variety of topics. While moderation efforts such as Community Notes are primarily used for fact checking to counter misinformation, we investigate its ability as a vehicle for attitudinal change, using a neutral case study of a commonly disliked animal species exhibiting natural behavior in human environments. We discuss results of a between-groups experiment investigating whether dislike can be neutralized using community notes moderation, and to what extent lexical style of the community note may affect neutralization. We found that a tweet accompanied by a community note explaining the gull behavior as natural led to a significantly less negative attitude towards the gull by reducing polarity, and discuss what implications this holds for a broader important use of media moderation to reduce polarization on social media.",

          "abstract": "Parenting programs have proven effective in reducing disruptive child behavior. However, not all families benefit equally, and, to date, we have little insight into who benefits more or less, and why. One possible solution is to explore how different potential moderators cluster together in individual families and whether such family profiles predict who benefits more or less from these programs. This study explores: (1) how family, child, and parenting risk factors for disruptive behavior cluster together in families enrolled in the popular and evidence-based Incredible Years Parenting Program using latent profile analyses; (2) how family profiles relate to covariate family characteristics; and (3) whether profiles predict program engagement (i.e., number of sessions attended by caregivers), and effectiveness of (i.e., pre-post changes in disruptive behavior). Individual participant data from six studies across four countries (Norway, the Netherlands, England, Portugal) were used, including a total sample of 772 families with children aged 2.5 to 9 years (M = 5.14; SD = 1.10; 58.0% boys). Families could be profiled into a low and high risk profile, which differed on most child and family (but not parenting) risk factors as well as on covariate family characteristics, such as severity of disruptive behavior. Profile membership predicted engagement in, but not effectiveness of, the program. These findings provide useful insights into the heterogeneity in families participating in parenting programs, although there is a need for further research on how such differences may relate to differences in program effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal research has become increasingly popular in the social and clinical sciences in recent years. However, this popularity has brought about many challenges for both methodological and empirical researchers, including challenges regarding measurement. In this study, we are particularly interested in the assessment of the reliability when multiple items are used to measure the same construct in intensive longitudinal data. This is important because reliability estimates are necessary (albeit not sufficient) to evaluate the quality of measures. Here, we evaluate the internal consistency reliability of scales used during Stage 2 of the WARN-D study, a 3-month period of daily and weekly measurements. The WARN-D study is a prospective 2-year study of approximately 1750 students conducted in the Netherlands, aiming at building an early warning system for depression. Stage 2 includes three months of data on positive and negative affect measured four times a day, and depression and anxiety measured once a week. To assess the reliability of each scale, we use six different statistical approaches including three simpler approaches that estimate the reliability at the between-person and within-person level, and three idiographic approaches that estimate person-specific reliability coefficients. This paper also serves as a tutorial guide for substantive researchers, providing coded examples to facilitate the reporting of the reliability of Ecological Momentary Assessement (EMA) measures. We encourage all researchers to report the reliability of their data when applying the introduced statistical approaches, contributing to a collaborative effort toward developing more reliable measures in psychological and behavioral science.",

          "authors": "Yutaka Horita; Miku Yamazaki; Asuka Tahara",
          "abstract": "Relational mobility, the degree of opportunity to form new relationships in a particular environment, explains cultural differences in interpersonal behavior. Theoretically, relational mobility is thought to be related to the contrasting tendencies in social networks: expansion of relationships (i.e., trust) and commitment to existing relationships (i.e., intimacy). This study reexamined whether perceived relational mobility is associated with the formation and maintenance of social networks. A cross-cultural survey was conducted with 299 American and 298 Japanese people. We investigated the correlations between generalized trust, intimacy with friends, self-disclosure, and the number of social networks. Consistent with previous studies, this study found that Americans are more likely than Japanese to trust strangers, feel intimate with and disclose themselves to their closest friends, and have more relationships. Perceived relational mobility explained the cultural difference in generalized trust but not in intimacy with friends when controlling for other individual characteristics. Generalized trust was associated with a greater number of people to seek advice from, and a greater number of advice networks correlated with higher levels of well-being. The results suggest that relational mobility is associated with psychology related to expanding networks, rather than strengthening existing relationships.",

This study examines the joint effects and interplay of positive and negative contact on minority support for social change, and the role of system-fairness beliefs across seven ethnic minority samples in six countries (N = 790). Multigroup Structural Equation Modelling showed that negative contact predicted higher minority support for social change. Positive contact predicted both less support for social change indirectly via enhanced system-fairness beliefs, and more support for social change directly. Except for one national context, the total effects of positive contact were either non-significant or significantly positive. This shows that increased system-fairness beliefs can explain sedative effects of positive contact, and that positive contact may also promote support for social change. We conclude that sedative effects of positive contact may be overestimated by not considering negative contact.",

This longitudinal, comparative, lab-in-the-field study tested the impact of a socio-emotional learning intervention based on Humanitarian Principles (Humanity, Neutrality, Impartiality, Independence) and Values on social emotions (compassion, empathic distress, malicious joy) and on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member (immigrant or local minority). 96 teenagers and young adults (mean [SD] age: 17.06 [3.56] years; female: 66) in Armenia, Belarus, The Gambia, and Russia were assigned to a three- or five-day intervention in Humanitarian Principles and Values or to a control group. Although there was no overall effect of the intervention on social emotions nor on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member, an intervention-related increase in compassion and empathic distress predicted an intervention-related increase in the willingness to help an out-group member. We also observe differences between countries. This study highlights the importance of socio-emotional learning interventions in promoting prosocial behaviour in teenagers and young adults from different countries. In addition, this research contributes to the growing body of empirical and policy-oriented work on the implementation of socio-emotional learning and thus contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Education) and 16 (Peace).",

The stimuli are auditory “textures”\nconstructed by adjusting the distribution of power across upper frequency bands. In Experiment\n1, people rated similarity between pairs of stimuli; in Experiments 2 and 3, they also engaged in\na recognition memory task using the same stimuli. In Experiment 4, they did all the same tasks\nfrom the first three experiments, and rated stimuli for distinctiveness. Multidimensional scaling\nsuggested the stimuli were perceived along three dimensions, a result which replicated across all\nfour experiments. Similarity ratings, recency, and list homogeneity predicted recognition\nperformance, but distinctiveness ratings did not. These effects were accommodated by the\nExemplar-Based Random Walk model (Nosofsky and Palmeri, 1997)—extending prior work\n(Visscher et al., 2007) to show that memory and attention processes in the auditory domain are\nfundamentally like those in the visual domain, though particularly strong recency effects in the\nauditory domain may be due to echoic memory.

Although rare, linguistic analyses that go beyond emotion words provide deep insights into emotional experience across cultures.

We analyzed the interviews in three stages: 1) topic modeling to characterize content, 2) word counting to examine linguistic resources, and 3) inductive analysis to uncover broader themes. Our findings revealed notable cultural differences alongside some similarities. US English speakers used more first-person pronouns and emotion words, emphasized high-arousal emotions, and prioritized asserting personal achievements and openly expressing their feelings. In contrast, Belgian Dutch speakers’ descriptions reflected a more moderated approach to emotions, illustrating how social standards and broader worldviews gave meaning to the events, with use of fewer first-person pronouns and more language focused on relativization and comparison. Taken together, our observations are consistent with previous psychological research on US and Belgian culture. We evaluate our approach against other means of exploring the conceptualization of emotion across cultures.",

In this experimental paradigm, indeed, humans tend to falsely recognize newly presented words via activation of other previously shown stimuli. In the present study we aimed to test what happens in cases in which no apparent prior semantic knowledge is available, like in the case of entirely novel lexical stimuli. To do so, we evaluated semantic similarity effects in a DRM task with lists entirely composed by pseudowords (or “novel words,” i.e., letter strings resembling real words but lacking assigned meanings). Semantic similarity between pseudowords were established through a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. Participants were instructed to memorize those lists and then to perform a recognition task. Results showed that participants false and veridical recognition increased with increasing semantic similarity between each stimulus and the stimuli comprising its list, as estimated by the distributional model. These findings extend previous evidence indicating that humans are sensitive to the semantic (distributional) patterns elicited by novel words by showing that this sensitivity can even induce humans to falsely recognize stimuli that they have never encountered in their entire lives.",

In three experiments, undergraduate students learned word-definition pairs\nusing flashcards alone (Individual condition) or with another student (Paired condition).\nParticipants then made global judgments of learning (gJOLs; Experiments 1-3), and item-level\njudgments of learning (iJOLs; Experiment 3). Finally, participants took a cued-recall test after a\n5-min delay (Experiments 1-3) and a 24-hour delay (Experiments 2-3). In Experiment 1, students\nin the Paired condition dropped flashcards less often than in the Individual condition (dropping\nwas prohibited in Experiments 2-3). In addition, although final test performance tended to be\nsimilar across conditions, inaccurate gJOLs for the immediate test—inflated by ~20% relative to\nactual immediate test performance—were common in the Individual condition but not in the\nPaired condition in Experiments 1-2. In Experiment 3, we tested whether this difference in\nmetacognitive calibration was due to the Paired condition requiring overt retrieval by instructing\nparticipants in the Individual condition to retrieve out loud. With this change, participants in the\nIndividual and Paired conditions reported similarly accurate gJOLs and iJOLs. Taken together,\nthese findings suggest that although performing retrieval practice with flashcards alone versus\nwith a partner yields comparable amounts of learning, doing so with a partner can increase\nmetacognitive accuracy, a benefit possibly driven by the facilitation of overt retrieval.

          "abstract": "During human spatial navigation, individuals transform visuospatial information between egocentric (i.e., first-person, viewer-dependent, body-centered) and allocentric (i.e., third-person, viewer-independent, world-centered) representations for optimal understanding of the surrounding environment. To capture reference frame utilization in a laboratory setting, researchers often utilize naturalistic, immersive, open-environment settings in virtual reality to mimic real-world navigation. However, few studies have paired navigation through these environments with robust, standardized, post-session testing of reference frame utilization. Therefore, this study developed a novel, immersive, city-like, naturalistic virtual reality environment (‘NavCity’), paired with an accompanying NavCity Allocentric Representation Assessment (NARA), to quantify naturalistic navigation ability and effects of repeated environmental exposure on the formation of allocentric reference frames within a singular experimental session. Notably, the NavCity task provides an open-source, standardized, editable, accessible, virtual reality paradigm for assessing naturalistic navigation ability, and the accompanying NARA serves to promote standardization of measures quantifying allocentric knowledge recall. Our central hypothesis is that we will observe within-session improvement in navigation performance after repeated NavCity exposure, which will scale with stronger recall of allocentric representations measured by NARA. Results support this hypothesis and show that within-session NavCity improvements are associated with the assessment of formed allocentric representations tied to the navigated environment. Importantly, this study addresses the need to standardize and methodologically measure transformations of first-person, egocentric navigation experiences to third-person, allocentric knowledge using an open-source, naturalistic tool. Immediate next steps are to characterize effects of aging on NavCity and NARA performance to provide understanding of aging-related deficits in allocentric reference frame utilization in older adults.",

Nonetheless, syntheses of research on the effectiveness of such interventions are currently lacking, hampering our ability to inform and propose new research directions to increase sustainability in real-world contexts. In this paper, we review and evaluate the current body of evidence, focusing on studies targeting a reduction in animal-based food consumption and/or an increase in plant-based consumption, and specifically motivated as contributing to the climate change discourse. We searched five databases, theses repositories, and grey literature and contacted authors in the field to obtain manuscripts and pre-prints. Our search identified 23 articles including 34 separate studies meeting our eligibility criteria. Since 2017, we witnessed a rapid increase in research interest for trials exploring the effect of social norms to nudge individuals towards sustainable food choices. Overall, based on the results of this review, we conclude these interventions have had limited success and we identify opportunities for future research on this topic, such as identifying the most relevant referent group for various segments of the population.",

          "authors": "Isabel Thielmann; Benjamin E. Hilbig; Christoph Schild; Daniel W. Heck",
          "abstract": "A fundamental assumption about human behavior forming the backbone of trait theories is that, to some extent, individuals behave consistently across structurally comparable situations. However, especially for unethical behavior, the consistency assumption has been severely questioned, at least from the early 19th century onwards. We provide a strict test of the consistency assumption for a prominent instance of unethical behavior – dishonesty – in a large (N = 1,916) and demographically diverse sample. Dishonest behavior was measured three times – up to three years apart – using different variants of well-established, incentivized cheating paradigms. A key advantage of these paradigms is that lying is individually profitable but not self-incriminating. Besides varying the specific task at hand, we experimentally varied the nature of incentives (i.e., money vs. avoiding tedious work) as well as their magnitude across measurement occasions. The consistency of dishonest behavior was estimated using a newly developed statistical model. Results showed strong consistency of dishonest behavior across contexts in most cases. Furthermore, theoretically-relevant personality traits (i.e., Honesty-Humility and the Dark Factor) yielded meaningful relations both with dishonesty and indeed its consistency. Thus, contrary to long-standing assumptions, there is notable consistency in dishonest behavior that can be attributed to underlying dispositional factors. Overall, the current findings have important implications for the theoretical understanding of dishonest behavior by providing strong evidence for (dis)honesty as a trait as well as for practice (e.g., honesty interventions). Moreover, the newly developed statistical approach can serve future research across scientific fields.",

          "authors": "Flavia Chereches; Guðrún Rut Guðmundsdóttir; Gabriel Olaru",
          "abstract": "Sense of purpose is a key construct explaining individual differences in health. However, much is still unclear about how sense of purpose and health affect each other over time in older age. Using four waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 11,390) spanning 12 years, we investigated the reciprocal associations between sense of purpose and multiple objective and subjective markers of health (e.g., self-reported health; grip strength). Across the 12 years, better health was associated with higher levels of purpose for all investigated health markers. Cross-lagged panel models implied reciprocal associations for six of the 11 health markers. When looking at within-person associations (i.e., random intercept cross-lagged models), purpose emerged as a stronger predictor of later health than the other way around, with purpose changes predicting subsequent changes in five health markers while changes in only two health markers predicted later changes in purpose. Taken together, these findings further support the notion that sense of purpose has protective effects  against health decline in older age. We discuss the findings in the context of lifespan theory and emphasize the potential benefit of considering sense of purpose as a potential target for public health interventions.",

          "authors": "Siu Kit Yeung; Winnie WS Mak; Gabriel M.H. Cheung; Ching Wan Li; Hoi Ching Yu; Yuxuan Zheng; Chun Ming Lee",
          "abstract": "Health goal message framing refers to ways information about favorable consequences of healthy behaviors and unfavorable consequences without engaging in healthy behaviors can be presented in influencing attitudes, intentions, and behaviors (Rothman et al., 2006). Some findings have been mixed and sometimes contradictory while hundreds of studies have been conducted since the previous large-scale meta-analysis on health message framing (Gallagher &amp; Updegraff, 2012). This project includes three-level meta-analyses for message framing studies that aim to encourage healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, with 836 effect sizes, 307 studies and 273 reports from 23 countries. When comparing pleasure-framing (benefits and/or problems prevented through healthy behaviors) and pain-framing (benefits forgone and/or potential problems without engaging in healthy behaviors), we found inconclusive evidence of pleasure-framed advantage for health promotion and/or illness prevention and found support for very small pain-framed advantage (g = -0.09) for health detection. Furthermore, we found evidence for moderation of behavioral frequency, with a very small pleasure-framed advantage for frequently repeated behaviors. When comparing gain-framing (benefits through healthy behaviors) and loss-framing (detriments without healthy behaviors), we found substantial cultural differences, with loss-framing outperforming gain-framing for people from non-western, collectivistic, and survival-oriented regions (gs = -0.27 to -0.28). Findings showed inconclusive evidence for moderations of indulgence-restraint, power distance, and dialecticism. Implications and directions, including culturally-congruent health communication (Betsch et al., 2016), more analyses and research on real-world benefits, costs, and risks of message framing choices as well as more realistic effect size expectations for sample size determination, were discussed. We also called for more multi-regional studies, experiments that tease apart confounds, and studies on mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: message framing, health behavior, behavioral function, cultural moderation, meta-analysis",

          "authors": "João Tenório",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the meanings and feelings represented by semiotic elements available in the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho. The theoretical approach adopted is the Semiotic Cultural Psychology (SCP) in which considers human beings as meaning makers in the world through the mediation of signs. In this paper we consider signs from the Peirce perspective as the representation of objects in the real world and divided into symbols, indexes and icons. From SCP we considered how these signs can represent mediation by pleromatization and schematization in order to understand meanings and feelings represented by field-like signs and point-like signs. In the excerpt from this article, we selected the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho to understand how meanings and feelings are regulated through existing complexes of signs during the narrative. To achieve this, we cataloged the main semiotic elements of the episode, classifying them as point-like signs or field-like signs. Subsequently, we analyzed which of these signs were part of a semiotic hybrid complex (pleromatization/field-like signs/hyper-generalization) regulating feelings related to the narrative and which expressed constructed and shared meanings (schematization/point-like signs/generalization). In the results, we found that semiotic elements can be considered as narrative devices to involve the viewer in the story based on the intentionality of the author. In the Yu Yu Hakusho first episode, the intentionality is based in the presentation of the character Yusuke and the creation of feelings related to him. In this sense, in order to present who Yusuke is, point-like signs were identified representing some characteristic about him. In the second part of the episode, there was a predominance of field-like signs in order to create some feelings about Yusuke based on the empathy constructed in the first part of the narrative. Then, as related in the literature, mediations by schematization and pleromatization acted all the time in order to relate cognitive elements (meanings constructed about Yusuke) and effective elements (feelings to be felt for Yusuke).",

This research program aims to characterize qualitative properties of consciousness, or qualia, by modeling relative differences in phenomenal experience in a mathematical structure, often referred to as qualia structures or qualia spaces. A recent explosion of research projects investigates the qualia structures of specific aspects of experience, such as color, sound, or odor; however, the investigation of how these local aspects of experience integrate into the qualia of a distinctively unified moment of consciousness has been largely neglected. We discuss key theoretical and experimental considerations and propose a novel mathematical framework for moving towards a structural characterization of global phenomenal consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Combined action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) training has been shown to facilitate motor skill performance, but limited research has explored its effectiveness on motor learning and possible moderating factors for the intervention. This study examined the influence of model type on the effectiveness of AOMI training for novices learning an Ankle Pick takedown. Twenty-eight novice participants were randomly assigned to AOMI training that displayed footage of a self-model (AOMISELF) or an other-model (AOMIOTHER). A motor learning design incorporating pre-test (Day 1), acquisition (Days 2-6), post-test (Day 7), and retention-test (Day 14) was utilised). Motor skill performance, self-efficacy and mental representation structures were recorded as measures of learning. There were no significant differences between the training conditions across all twelve kinematics measures of motor skill performance. Self-efficacy scores increased for all training conditions over time. Both the AOMIOTHER and Control conditions led to improved functional changes in mental representation structures while the structures for the AOMISELF condition moved further away from the reference structure over time. Collectively, the largely null findings suggest that physical practice is the main driver of motor adaptations for this complex motor skill at these early stages of learning. However, the findings also suggest model type may be an important factor for novices using AOMI training. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to explore different modeling approaches, such as mixed-modeling, when designing AOMI interventions for sport.",

          "abstract": "Optimal linear associative memories (OLAMs) possess several interesting properties. For instance, they can be implemented in terms of very simple neural networks and all encoding is done in a single forward step when a new stimulus is presented without the need for ”off-line” procedures such as back-propagation. Their main drawback is their limited storage capacity. Here it is demonstrated that the use of ensembles of OLAMs can overcome this limitation. Numerical simulations are employed to explore the capabilities of such ensembles in handling large datasets to produce familiarity judgments and cued recall. Their use for storing and retrieving paired associates and temporal sequences is also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception remains challenging for cochlear-implant recipients in conditions containing background noise. Modifications to the sound processing strategy could improve the transmission of information by the cochlear implant, alleviating speech perception difficulties in noise. One such modification, the temporal integrator processing strategy (TIPS), uses a model of temporal masking to identify and remove stimulation pulses that are unlikely to be perceived. In a previous investigation, TIPS significantly improved the perception of CIS-processed speech in the presence of speech-shaped noise (Lamping et al. 2020). This study extends the previous investigation to include conditions that better reflect everyday listening through two pre-registered double-blind within-participant experiments. The first experiment tested speech perception with CIS and TIPS and found that speech intelligibility in speech-shaped and multi-talker noise was unaffected by TIPS processing, although TIPS-processed stimuli achieved slightly lower quality ratings than their CIS counterparts in quiet (p = 0.044). The second experiment compared TIPS to ACE and found that both speech intelligibility in a multi-talker noise and speech quality ratings in quiet were unaffected by TIPS processing. Given that TIPS removes a substantial number of stimulation pulses, TIPS was estimated to result in net power savings between 22% and 42%, without compromising speech perception in the presence of background noise.",

Social interaction is, thus, both an antecedent and a consequence of empowerment. In Western societies, an emerging awareness that aging has become associated with  a loss of empowerment has motivated efforts to better address this necessity in older adults. In this context, we created an innovative cognitive stimulation tool, where exercises are created by the users themselves as an alternative form of stimulation. After a period of intense dissemination in geriatric institutions, we encountered lower-than-expected levels of engagement. To understand whether this could be due to lack of material and human resources and/or lack of awareness regarding empowerment needs, we carried out semi-structured interviews with older adults and coordinating technicians in institutions. We found evidence that supported both a scenario of scarce institutional resources (“no time”) and a lack of awareness of empowerment needs, especially among older adults (“no need”). We discuss potential  ways to help  change this scenario.",

          "abstract": "In studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), it is common practice to exclude participants for having too few trials for analysis to ensure adequate score reliability (i.e., internal consistency). However, in research involving clinical samples, the impact of increasingly rigorous reliability standards on factors such as sample generalizability, patient vs. control effect sizes, and effect sizes for within-group correlations with external variables is unclear. This study systematically evaluated whether different ERP reliability cutoffs impacted these factors in psychosis. Error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) were assessed during a modified flanker task in 97 patients with psychosis and 104 healthy comparison participants, who also completed measures of cognition and psychiatric symptoms. ERP reliability cutoffs had notably different effects on the factors considered. A recommended reliability cutoff of .80 resulted in sample bias due to systematic exclusion of patients with relatively few task errors, lower reported psychiatric symptoms, and higher levels of cognitive functioning. ERP score reliability lower than .80 resulted in generally smaller between- and within-group effect sizes, likely misrepresenting effect sizes. Imposing rigorous ERP reliability standards in studies of psychotic disorders might exclude high-functioning patients, which raises important considerations for the generalizability of clinical ERP research.",

Although individuals can monitor and report their own attentional state, it remains unclear whether these self-reports are primarily driven by estimation of performance or external cues. In this study, sixty-one participants completed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which they made binary choices to maximize monetary rewards. Due to the probabilistic nature of the task, participants could make accurate choices, such as selecting the option most likely to yield a reward, yet still observe a negative outcome. During task performance, participants rated their attentiveness at random intervals using a visual analogue scale. Using Bayesian regression analysis and computational reinforcement learning model, we found that self-reported attention was more strongly influenced by external outcomes (reward delivery) than by task performance estimates. Furthermore, we examined the causal association between task performance and the experience of attentiveness. Time-lagged analysis suggested that attentiveness ratings did not predict future performance, and rather were only influenced by reward history.  These findings suggest that individuals may rely more on external cues, such as rewards, rather than internal assessments of performance when reporting their level of attention.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the role of sleep in the consolidation and generalization of fear learning. 31 healthy, young adult participants (16 in the wake group and 15 in the sleep group) underwent a fear acquisition procedure in which a geometrical figure imposed on a background image was repeatedly presented and paired with a mild electric shock, making it a conditioned stimulus (a CS+). Another geometrical figure imposed on another background image was also repeatedly presented but never paired with the shock, making it a safety stimulus (a CS-). After a ~three-hour delay interval containing either a two-hour nap opportunity or an equivalent amount of time spent awake, participants performed a fear memory and generalization test. Here, participants viewed four different stimuli: the CS+ and CS- seen before, as well as two novel stimuli composed of the same two geometrical figures seen before imposed on novel background images. This design allowed us to examine a) whether sleep consolidates the original fear memory and b) whether sleep affects the degree of generalization of fear learning to when the originally fear-eliciting stimulus is presented in a novel context. Results revealed no group differences for either the consolidation or generalization of fear learning in either of our outcome measures (skin conductance responses, subjective ratings of unpleasantness, shock expectancy ratings, or explicit memory performance). Previous work on the effect of sleep on consolidation and generalization of fear learning has revealed mixed findings and there is currently limited evidence for sleep having an effect in either direction.",

Each indicator was evaluated based on definability, quantifiability, data availability, global representativeness, transparency, and temporal resolution. Our audit revealed that only 29.7% of pre-selected indicators and 32.3% of expert-suggested indicators met all quality criteria. Furthermore, the perceived importance of a domain was inversely related to the quality of its available indicators. Moreover, direct measures tended to score higher in quality than composite indices. These findings highlight significant gaps in the metrics used to track societal change, raising concerns about the data informing policy and public understanding.

In line with the method’s rationale, results revealed that CRT-A scores were affected by the omission of premises. On the item level, for six out of 22 items, the frequency of choosing illogical responses did not differ when the premises were removed. Correlations with self-reported aggression were similar for both versions of the CRT-A. We conclude that the CRT-A is indeed viewed by test takers as a reasoning task and point to possible improvements on the item level.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reliable and specific biomarkers that can distinguish Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from commonly co-occurring Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are lacking, causing misses and delays in diagnosis, and reducing access to interventions and quality of life. Aims: To examine whether an innovative, brief (one-minute), videogame method called Computerised Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) can identify ASD-specific imitation differences compared to neurotypical and ADHD children. Method: This cross-sectional study used CAMI alongside standardised parent-report (SRS-2) and observational measures of autism (ADOS-2), ADHD (Conners), and motor ability (PANESS). Sample included a total of 183 children aged 7-13 years who had ADHD (without ASD), had ASD (with ADHD: ASD+ADHD, and without ADHD: ASD-only), and were neurotypical. Results: Regardless of co-occurring ADHD, ASD children showed poorer CAMI performance than neurotypical children (p&lt;.0001, Adjusted R2=.28), whereas ADHD and neurotypical children showed similar CAMI performance. Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine analyses showed that CAMI distinguishes ASD from both NT (80% true positive rate) and ADHD children (70% true positive rate) with a high success rate significantly above chance. Among autistic children, poor CAMI performance was associated with increased autism traits, particularly ADOS measures of social affect and restricted and repetitive behaviours (Adjusted R2=.23), but not with ADHD traits or motor ability. Conclusions: Four levels of analyses – diagnostic group comparisons, dimensional associations, and classification metrics based on Receiver Operating Curve and Support Vector Machine – confirm that poor imitation measured by the low-cost and scalable CAMI method specifically distinguishes ASD not only from neurotypical development but also from commonly co-occurring ADHD.",

Subsequently, purposive sampling of 250 juvenile offenders, 84% boys and 16% girls (10–18 years old), with a range of conduct associated with the problem, were administered by a Clinical Psychologist. Result:The internal consistency and inter-rater reliability was found to be significant for clinician and self report subscale of CDS- CSR. In addition, the content correctness index and the face validity of 0.83 &amp; 0.87 was established respectively. The findings suggest that the measures are useful instruments for assessing sexual behavior, disruptive behavior, the environment's effect, and personality problems in children and adolescents.

          "abstract": "Life events have been theorized to cause personality trait changes. However, people differ in their personality trait trajectories after experiencing important life events. Although several studies have examined the sources of these individual differences, a replicable set of variables explaining individual differences in the reaction to major life events has yet to be identified. In a systematic literature review (Study 1), we integrated existing evidence on potentially important moderators of event-related changes in the Big Five personality traits (23 studies, Ntotal = 82,374). This review showed that (1) only a limited set of moderators has been linked to individual differences in event-related personality trait changes so far, and (2) that there are vast differences in the methods used to examine these effects across studies, complicating meta-analytical integration. To overcome these limitations, we conducted a coordinated data analysis (Study 2), generating novel and robust evidence for associations between a broad set of psychological, demographic, event-related, and contextual characteristics and event-related personality trait changes. Across eight large-scale panel studies (Ntotal = 90,934, Nobs = 391,024), we found several replicable moderators of event-related personality changes. For example, age and psychological variables such as life satisfaction moderated personality trait changes across datasets. Even though the effect sizes of the moderators were (very) small (bMedian = 0.007, ΔR2Median = 0.16%), the findings of the coordinated data analysis contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of event-related personality change, critical for the advancement of contemporary personality development theories.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and individual mental health remains debated. To address this, the present study introduces CAR variability across multiple days as a novel indicator, aiming to resolve inconsistencies in prior findings often caused by situational factors affecting the traditional mean CAR measure. We investigate the association between CAR variability and both trait anxiety and psychological resilience. In Experiment 1, we reduced CAR variability by minimizing sleep efficiency variation under natural sleep conditions, finding a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and trait anxiety scores. This suggests that lower CAR variability in stable conditions correlates with lower trait anxiety. In Experiment 2, CAR variability was increased through total sleep deprivation, revealing a significant positive correlation between CAR variability and psychological resilience. This indicates that greater CAR variability in dynamic conditions corresponds with higher psychological resilience. In contrast, CAR mean levels across both experiments showed no significant associations with either trait anxiety or psychological resilience. These findings suggest that, beyond mean CAR levels, CAR variability may serve as a more effective physiological indicator of mental health. Considering CAR variability across multiple days is crucial for understanding how individuals adapt to daily life stressors and challenges, providing new perspectives and potential avenues for promoting mental health and developing effective intervention strategies.",

Currently, there are limited treatment options available that effectively treat FM symptoms. Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) is an emerging combined drug-therapy intervention, but no studies to-date have investigated PAT for FM. Here, we report findings from an open-label, proof-of-concept trial of PAT for FM (N=5; NCT05128162). In conjunction with psychotherapy (two preparatory, four integration sessions), participants received two doses of oral psilocybin (15mg and 25mg) delivered two weeks apart. Regarding safety (primary outcome), there were transient elevations of blood pressure or heart rate during dosing which normalized by the end of treatment, with no serious adverse events. Four of five participants reported transient headaches following dosing. Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful improvements in the following secondary outcomes one month following their second psilocybin dose (reported as Cohen’s d): pain severity (d=-2.1, 95% CI[-3.7 to -0.49]), pain interference (d=-1.8, 95% CI [-3.27 to -0.24]), and sleep disturbance (d=-2.5, 95% CI [-4.21 to -0.75]). Using the Patient Global Impression of Change, one participant reported their symptoms “very much improved,” two reported “much improved,” and two reported “minimally improved.” Compared to baseline, there were improvements in the following exploratory outcomes after the intervention: FM symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue. This small open-label trial preliminarily supports that PAT is well-tolerated by people with FM, establishing a basis for larger randomized controlled trials.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

However, there is still a gap in our understanding as to how factors such as \nthreat level and performance feedback impact the frequency of checking and \nassociated concomitants. To address these questions, we collected data across two \nlab sites (n = 208) and manipulated threat level (low threat: performance score only; \nhigh threat: mild electric shock based on performance score) and performance \nfeedback (no feedback, feedback) during a visual discrimination and checking task. \nThroughout the task, we recorded checking frequency, ratings of the urge to check and \ndistress, task performance, and corrugator supercilii activity. High threat versus low \nthreat led to increased checking frequency in one testing site, but not the other. No \neffect of performance feedback was observed on checking frequency. Performance \nfeedback was associated with the urge to check differently across sites. Both, high \nthreat versus low threat, and no feedback versus feedback, were separately associated \nwith improved task accuracy for easier trial types. Lastly, no feedback, compared to \nfeedback, was associated with greater engagement of the corrugator supercilii. These \nresults suggest that: (1) higher threat level increases checking behaviour to some extent \nand improves task performance, and (2) the absence of feedback improves task \nperformance and is associated with greater distress or effort. Overall, these findings \nprovide insight into how factors such as threat level and performance feedback \ndifferently impact checking behaviour and its concomitants.",

Alcohol and substance use were measured using a modified version of the AUDIT administered every 6 months. SI was measured every 2 months using item 9 from the PHQ-9. Linear mixed effects models tested concurrent associations and Dynamic Structural Equation Models tested prospective associations between alcohol and substance use I/F and impairment with SI. \n\nResults: Cocaine I/F and alcohol and substance use impairment were concurrently associated with SI. When a person had more frequent and intense cannabis use compared to average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. When individuals experienced more alcohol and substance use impairment than average, they had higher SI at the next timepoint. \n\nConclusions: Both alcohol and substance use appear to increase SI for those with BSDs, though in different ways.",

To address this crisis, implementing evidence-based, single-session interventions for individuals seeking treatment may provide timely relief. StrongMinds—a mental health charity organization serving youth and adults in Uganda—piloted a Single-Session Consultation (SSC) service for new treatment-seekers with elevated depression symptoms. To optimize its reach and fit with StrongMinds’ service delivery model, the SSC was delivered by trained lay providers in both individual and group-based formats. Within two months (September-October 2023), the SSC was delivered to 200 Ugandan adults with elevated depression symptoms (ages 16-86; 73% female) upon initial outreach for StrongMinds’ group psychotherapy services. SSC clients reported significant improvements in hopelessness and depression symptoms at 2-week (ds = -0.73, -1.12) and 1-month follow-ups (ds = -0.96, -1.44), while waiting for group psychotherapy. SSC clients reported high SSC\nsatisfaction (M = 4.47/5), and intervention effects did not significantly differ by delivery format (i.e., individual vs. group format).

          "abstract": "Background: Thought suppression is suggested as a causal factor in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as it can lead to a paradoxical increase in intrusive thoughts. However, the neural mechanisms through which obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) influence thought suppression, particularly in the context of attentional bias toward negatively valenced stimuli, remain unclear. We hypothesized that OCS would predict increased recruitment of frontal inhibitory neurocircuitry during the suppression of negative words and that this would be mediated by an attentional bias toward these stimuli. \nMethods: EEG was recorded from 48 non-clinical participants tasked with directed forgetting of negative and neutral words. We examined the influence of OCS on neural correlates of thought suppression, specifically fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 (13-18 Hz) synchronisation and alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the parahippocampal cortex. The mediating role of attentional bias, measured via the late positive potential (LPP) following word was assessed using a mediated moderation model.\nResults: OCS predicted enhanced fronto-parahippocampal beta-1 synchronisation when instructed to forget negative words. This effect was mediated by attentional bias to negative stimuli, but only in individuals with higher levels of OCS. \nConclusions: Individuals with higher OCS exhibit compensatory engagement of frontal inhibitory mechanisms when attempting to suppress negative emotional stimuli. This compensatory activity is influenced by both attentional bias to negative stimuli and the severity of OCS, highlighting a neural mechanism that may contribute to the persistence of intrusive thoughts in OCD.",

This systematic literature review identifies and narratively synthesizes longitudinal studies of risk and protective factors for loneliness in children and adolescents aged below 25 years. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2023 using PsycINFO and MEDLINE, resulting in k = 398 articles, with k = 105 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. The examined factors included demographic (e.g., gender), socio-economic (e.g., income sufficiency), social (e.g., peer acceptance), mental health (e.g., depression), physical health (e.g., disabilities), health behavior (e.g., sport participation), and psychological factors (e.g., shyness). Additionally, adverse childhood experiences (e.g., child maltreatment) and environmental factors (e.g., neighborhood characteristics) were investigated. Despite the wide range of potential risk and protective factors examined, relatively few studies provided strong evidence for a prospective association with loneliness. Risk factors that were consistently identified across multiple longitudinal studies included low peer acceptance and peer victimization, depression, social anxiety, internalizing symptoms, low self-esteem, shyness, and neuroticism. Additional replication is required to evaluate factors that have shown significant associations with loneliness in only a limited number of longitudinal studies (e.g., aggression).",

Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards. We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting.",

          "abstract": "Time series are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Much of the current modelling work focuses on variations of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, in which variables are predicted by themselves and other variables at previous time points. An alternative to these models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which model time series with a process that switches between a number of latent states, each associated with a different response distribution. Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. The reason for this has been the lack of software to fit HMMs in a multilevel setting, which is required both to make estimation feasible in a realistic applied setting, and to quantify and account for heterogeneity between subjects. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing multilevel HMMs and their estimation in a Bayesian setting; we evaluate with numerical experiments how well these models can be estimated in settings corresponding to empirical research using the R package mHMMbayes; and we provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential positive impact of adding multilevel HMMs to the time series modelling toolbox and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "How does memory influence auditory perception, and what are the underlying mechanisms that drive these interactions? Most empirical investigations on the neural correlates of memory-guided perception have used static visual tasks creating a bias in the literature that contrasts with recent research highlighting the dynamic nature of memory retrieval. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to track the retrieval of auditory associative memories in a cue-target paradigm. Participants (N=64) listened to real-world soundscapes (cue) that were either predictive of an upcoming target tone or nonpredictive. Three key results emerged: First, targets were detected faster when embedded in predictive than in nonpredictive soundscapes (memory-guided perceptual benefit). Second, changes in theta and alpha power differentiated soundscape contexts that were predictive from nonpredictive contexts at two distinct temporal intervals from cue onset (early - 950 ms peak for theta and alpha, and late - 1650 ms peak for alpha only). Third, early theta activity in the left anterior temporal lobe was correlated with memory-guided perceptual benefits. Together, these findings underscore the role of distinct neural processes at different time points during cued retrieval. By emphasizing temporal sensitivity and isolating cue-related activity, we reveal a two-stage retrieval mechanism that advances understanding of how memory influences auditory perception.",

Despite their importance, there has been no systematic investigation into transparency- and quality-related aspects of these reviews in leading CCAP journals. This study protocol (https://osf.io/qhrau/) proposes a meta-review to assess the transparency, methodological quality, and statistical consistency of recent meta-analytic systematic reviews (2022-2024) published in leading journals from CCAP, aiming to improve future practices in the field. We will include meta-analytic systematic reviews from seven leading journals publishing CCAP-related content between 2022–2024 (estimated sample size based on piloting = 60). Eligible systematic reviews need to have conducted a frequentist meta-analysis, define eligible populations as children or adolescents between 0–20 years (ideally based on primary study sample mean), may include a clinical psychological or psychotherapeutic intervention, and need to focus on clinical psychological outcomes (no comparators defined). We will search Web of Science (Core Collection) by combining journal names and systematic review-related keywords. Eligible meta-analytic systematic reviews will be assessed for transparency (PRISMA-adaptation; newly developed set of items for CCAP-related content), methodological quality (AMSTAR 2), and statistical consistency (statcheck). Descriptive analyses will include overall and domain-based scores, as well as exploratory analyses assessing associations with transparency-promoting factors on review and journal level. This meta-review can potentially shed light on and enhance the transparency, quality, and statistical consistency within meta-analytic systematic reviews from the field of CCAP. In doing so, it may provide guidance for researchers, reviewers, and editors, while laying the groundwork for future, large-scaled meta-studies in this field.",

          "abstract": "Mental health disorders are highly heterogeneous, presenting diverse symptoms, risk factors,\nand treatment responses. Identifying distinct subgroups within these disorders is essential for\ndeveloping personalized treatment strategies, improving therapeutic outcomes, and\noptimizing resource allocation. This systematic review explores how cluster analysis has been\napplied in mental health research to categorize subgroups across various psychiatric and\npsychological populations, evaluating its implications for personalized care and addressing\nkey methodological challenges. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO,\nScopus, and Web of Science (October 2021 to October 2024) yielded 31 studies that used\ncluster analysis to identify subgroups within disorders such as depression, PTSD, anxiety,\nschizophrenia, BPD, ADHD, and OCD. In alignment with the study’s objectives, data\nextraction focused on clustering methodologies, subgroup characteristics, and the clinical\nimplications for treatment personalization. Studies employed a range of clustering techniques,\nincluding K-means, hierarchical clustering, latent class analysis, Gaussian mixture models,\nand DBSCAN, which effectively identified clinically meaningful subgroups characterized by\nunique symptom profiles, biological markers, and treatment responses. For instance,\nmelancholic, atypical, and anxious subtypes in depression were identified, each requiring\ntailored therapeutic approaches. Similarly, biomarker-based subgroups in generalized anxiety\ndisorder emphasized the potential for targeted interventions. This review affirms that cluster\nanalysis is a valuable tool in precision psychiatry, offering insights into disorder\nheterogeneity that support the development of individualized treatment plans and improve\npatient outcomes.\nKeywords: Cluster analysis, mental health, subgroup identification, personalized care,\nsystematic review, precision psychiatry",

The wide range of genetically related species exhibiting such complex behaviour allows for hypotheses regarding its evolution and the cognitive abilities of their common ancestor. Although there's much debate on the precise definition of tool use, most experts agree it involves using a manipulable object to change another object's physical characteristics through mechanical interactions1. This current report details an event where a house crow (Corvus splendens) and a Sunda crow (Corvus enca) entered our research laboratory and spontaneously solved unattended tool-use tasks. House crows have previously been reported to use tools in captivity2, but this is the first documentation of Sunda crows using tools. We first describe the instance of tool use before briefly exploring what this event suggests about the potential evolution of tool use in this cognitively advanced family of birds.",

          "abstract": "Background. Altered temporal experience lies at the core of various psychiatric conditions, including Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Mainstream research in psychopathology tends to explore BPD with scrutiny while neglecting other personality disorders (PD). At the same time, the dimensional approach to PD proposes looking through the disorders' subtypes and tracing lived experience-based commonalities. This study is the first to explore the temporality of PD by investigating the relationship between symptom severity and lived time and combining objectified measures of time perception with phenomenological interpretation. \nMethods. 63 participants of various educational backgrounds, with personality disorders (36,5% male), following ICD-10 coding diagnosed with paranoid (3.2%), borderline (41,3%), narcissistic (33,3%), avoidant (4,8%), dependent (1,6%) and unspecified (15,9%) personality disorder. Levels of personality functioning and intensity of maladaptive trait domains were controlled with Level of Personality Functioning – Brief Scale 2.0 and Personality Inventory for ICD-11, respectively, resulting in the overall sample classification as comprising 9 subclinical, 13 mild, 20 moderate, 16 severe, and 5 extremely severe conditions. Polish Short Version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (PS-ZTPI) and Cottle’s Circles Test (CT) were used to assess the temporal experience. \nResults. In comparison to healthy individuals, those with PD are more oriented toward past negative (4.01 vs. 2.98) and less toward past positive (2.31 vs. 7.71) and future (3.04 vs. 3.47), as measured with PS-ZTPI, their pre-reflective temporal experience as measured with CT is dominated either by the past or the future, while the present remains marginalized. BPD distinctiveness among other PD lies in higher orientation towards hedonistic present and lower orientation toward the future. While the general temporal profile of PD is independent of age and duration of hospitalization, it is related to the severity of the condition. The more severe the impairments in self-functioning, the higher the negative past perspective and pre-reflective past dominance, and the lower the positive and future perspective. The results of this study highlight temporality as an essential aspect of lived experience in PD. Lived time interplays with the level of self-disturbance and, as such, may be conceptualized phenomenologically as comprising the core of PD.",

          "abstract": "Humans can evaluate the accuracy of their decisions by providing confidence judgements. Traditional cognitive models have tried to capture the mechanisms underlying this process but remain mostly limited to two-choice tasks with simple stimuli. How confidence is given for naturalistic stimuli with multiple choice alternatives is not well understood. We recently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model – RTNet – that exhibits several important signatures of human decision making and outperforms existing alternatives in predicting human responses. Here, we use RTNet’s image computability to test four different confidence strategies on a task involving digit discrimination with eight alternatives. Specifically, we tested confidence strategies that consider the entire evidence distribution across choices (Softmax and Entropy), the difference between the winning choice and the second-best choice (Top2Diff), or only the evidence for the winning choice (Positive Evidence). Across 60 subjects, the Top2Diff model provided the best quantitative and qualitative fits to the data and the best predictions of humans’ image-by-image confidence ratings. These results support the notion that human confidence is based on the difference of evidence between the top two choices and demonstrate that Softmax – currently the standard way of deriving confidence from CNNs – is inadequate for modelling human confidence computations.",

          "abstract": "This paper synthesizes research on temporal experience in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from a phenomenologically grounded perspective. It advocates for a closer integration of phenomenology with empirical research results, with the specific goal of bridging the gap between theoretical and evidence-based understanding of BPD temporality. Utilizing a variant of indirect phenomenology, the paper adopts phenomenological insights into temporality to integrate the existing literature from cognitive sciences, chronobiology, and psychoanalysis, which provides qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical inputs. The findings reveal a coherent picture of BPD temporality characterized by fragmentation and discontinuity. Past experience is dense yet disorganized and recreated in the presence of present affective stimuli. The present absorbs one in an immediate, immersive manner. The future is perceived as blurred and disowned, with its horizon being truncated. This contributes to the feeling of being stuck and disoriented within one's temporal landscape. One lives in disturbing cycles between a negativity-biased past and a narrow present, which hinders the process of self development.",

          "abstract": "Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in China, yet access to evidence-based treatments remains limited. Written Exposure Therapy (WET) offers a brief intervention option but shows high dropout rates among Chinese patients and a need for culturally informed adaptations. Guided Written Exposure (GWE) builds on WET by integrating elements from Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) and specialized components tailored for Chinese patients to enhance trauma processing and treatment engagement. This study presents the protocol for a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of GWE in reducing PTSD symptoms in Chinese patients. Methods: Ninety adults aged 18–65 with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD will be randomly assigned to either GWE or minimal contact control (MCC) in a 2:1 ratio. GWE includes 5–8 online sessions over three weeks, incorporating enhanced psychoeducation, increased session frequency, and structured guidance on emotional expression to improve treatment acceptance. Primary outcomes are clinician-rated and self-reported PTSD severity, with secondary outcomes including depression and insomnia. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up assessments, with the GWE group undergoing additional follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. Group differences over time will be analyzed using multilevel modeling. Discussion: This study evaluates GWE's effectiveness as a culturally adapted PTSD treatment for Chinese patients, expanding the evidence base for PTSD therapies in diverse populations. By addressing barriers to treatment engagement, GWE may serve as a scalable and acceptable intervention for PTSD in China, offering insights for adapting exposure therapies cross-culturally.",

          "abstract": "Analysis of longitudinal data often relies on models which can be prone to statistical artifacts. We have previously shown that several published prospective associations can be explained by a combination of a general association between constructs, imperfect measurement reliability, and regression to the mean. Here, we formalize our analysis of this type of statistical artifact and introduce the Spurious Prospective Associations Model (SPAM). We show that the SPAM performs better than adjusted cross-lagged effects models to explain several observed prospective associations, including a new example involving loneliness and social anxiety, without assuming any true increasing or decreasing effects between constructs over time. Moreover, unlike the models we challenge, the SPAM is consistent with seemingly paradoxical findings indicating simultaneous increasing and decreasing effects between constructs. We conclude that the SPAM agrees well with observed data and is better supported than competing adjusted cross-lagged effects models in the cases investigated here.",

          "abstract": "Human brain, as the carrier of memory and consciousness, has become a hot topic in neuroscience research recently, the study of memory may be the hottest one. However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory.

          "abstract": "Shame appears to be part of human nature, yet it varies across time and between cultures. While differences in social norms or attributional styles are often cited as driving forces behind variation in shame, these approaches struggle to explain cross-cultural regularities in shame and the tight alignment between the features of the shame system and the challenges it addresses. In this chapter, we characterize shame from an adaptationist perspective—viewing this emotion as an evolved adaptation shaped by natural selection. We argue that despite its diversity of cultural expressions, shame functions to mitigate the actual or potential costs of being devalued by others. This framework can account for both cross-cultural similarities and differences in how shame is felt, expressed, and regulated. What may appear as culturally unique expressions of shame can be understood as variations on a universal theme: a finely tuned system evolved to manage the adverse consequences of devaluation. This approach reveals that even cultural differences in shame stem from a common adaptive logic.",

Contrary to hypotheses, average anxiety severity and strength of implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations did not spike at the start of the pandemic, and rates of change did not significantly differ by age from 2011-2020, except for explicit, non-relative self-as-anxious ratings. Instead, anxiety mostly remained stable, with emerging adults exhibiting consistently higher anxiety symptom severity and stronger implicit/explicit self-as-anxious associations than adults age 26+.",

          "abstract": "Spider phobia is one of the most common specific phobias and can be highly detrimental to one’s quality of life. To evaluate the efficacy of treatments, reliable pre- and post-treatment assessments are needed. Behavioral avoidance tests (BATs), where one is asked to approach a spider, are commonly used as such measures. With the increasing popularity of computerized interventions, there is a demand for quick assessments for fear of spiders, that can be completed using computers or smartphones. Here, we tested the validity of a novel computerized BAT (cBAT) that we introduced in our previous work. In this cBAT, participants unblurred three images of spiders up until a point where they still felt comfortable viewing them. We expected that the cBAT would be moderately to strongly correlated with established measures for fear of spiders. Our analysis revealed that the cBAT showed moderate convergent and concurrent validity through correlations with self-report questionnaires indicating spider fear, and with a real-life BAT, respectively. However, the latter was no longer observed in a follow-up. While the cBAT facilitates ease of application and has a quick, straightforward participant task, we conclude that the cBAT is a limited measure for fear of spiders and might not fully capture the complexity of spider-related avoidance behavior compared to tasks that simulate real-life scenarios more closely. We propose the development of a refined cBAT that maintains an easily applicable participant task.",

Novice (n = 8), intermediate (n = 8), or expert (n = 8) exercisers (based on self-reported habit strength) were recruited via purposive sampling to partake in semi-structured interviews.

Techniques were further grouped to information seeking, support, acceptance and overcoming initiation inertia, restructuring the environment, and personal growth. Two themes emerged: 1) using different techniques, 2) using techniques differently. Current findings indicate that people with different levels of experience and reported habit strength toward physical activity may require different approaches from physical activity habit interventions, which requires tailoring.

          "abstract": "Achieving far transfer, the application of learned skills to new and diverse contexts, has posed a persistent challenge in cognitive training, where gains often remain task-specific. The Strategy-Capacity Training Method addresses this limitation by integrating automatised core cognitive processes—such as working memory, attention control, and inhibition - with flexible, domain-general meta-strategies within the Successor Representation (SR) framework. This approach automates foundational cognitive skills to reduce cognitive load, creating a dynamic yet stable basis for adaptive strategy use across varying contexts. By embedding meta-strategies like decision trees, cost-benefit analysis, and causal reasoning into the SR's predictive coding framework, the method promotes cognitive flexibility, adaptive problem-solving, and efficient resource allocation. This training system exemplifies a hybrid of model-free and model-based learning, linking procedural efficiency with flexible strategic reasoning. Continuous feedback, supported by dopaminergic signalling (Reward Prediction Errors and Epistemic Prediction Errors), ensures adaptable refinement of automatised skills, facilitating seamless strategy transfer. This systematic alignment of core cognitive processes with meta-strategy execution enables far transfer, optimising general cognitive benefits and adaptability across tasks.",

          "authors": "Aja Sutton; Whitney Walker; Amy Hagopian; Zack W. Almquist",
          "abstract": "In the United States, no jurisdiction ensures the fundamental conditions producing health, including housing, even though the phenomenon of homelessness is intensifying. King County, Washington, twelfth largest U.S. county, hosts the third largest homeless population, many of whom reside in Seattle. Discouraging encampments and providing shelter beds has proven ineffective. We investigate how street survivors make encampment choices based on amenities proximity compared to those in shelters and rental units. We analyze rich spatial, administrative, and outreach worker data from Seattle’s Evergreen Treatment Services (REACH) on people living unsheltered (from 2016 to 2022). We discuss the implications of providing effective support for people living unhoused, and provide what is — to our knowledge — the most comprehensive and recent study of neighborhood access and proximity to amenities among the unsheltered population in Seattle, WA. We find that encampment locations more closely reflected the access of renting, housed populations across all amenities in the majority of neighborhoods., and that some amenities provide an opportunity for personal agency with regard to basic needs, particularly food-related amenities (with the exception of food banks), were closer to encampments than shelters. We conclude that housing options that feel like homes rather than institutions are critical to support the unhoused. In the interim, shelters should be more integrated into neighborhoods, and better reflect tent encampment and rental trends. Policymakers and practitioners must provide effective support that centers on autonomy, dignity, and harm reduction for those who survive outside.",

We examine the diffusion of an effective IPV prevention intervention beyond direct participants with 1181 married adult participants in Nepal’s Gandaki province. Study timepoints included pre-intervention, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and six months post-intervention. Cluster-adjusted regressions assessed change in IPV, social norms, and secondary outcomes for two intervention conditions (intervention participants; intervention community residents (community)) relative to adjacent control community residents. Intervention and community women's reported IPV decreased 26.8% and 20.5% respectively six-months post-intervention, with significant improvements in descriptive norms, gender equitable attitudes, relationship quality, and communication (for both intervention groups) and injunctive norms, leadership, and anti-violence advocacy (for intervention participants). Intervention and community men’s norms did not improve relative to control; however, both intervention groups reported improved anti-violence advocacy. Intervention men also improved in communication and help-providing to survivors. Change, an intervention intentionally designed for diffusion, may be effective at reducing IPV, improving associated norms, and extending programming benefits beyond those intentionally targeted.",

This project finds no evidence of a realignment with the Mao era in the party communiques or government reports under Xi Jinping. Instead, the reports under Xi Jinping are found to be more similar to those under his immediate predecessors. However, this project documents a divergence in the style of the party communiques and government reports under Xi Jinping, with the former becoming more abstract and ideological, and the latter becoming more concrete and policy-oriented. One source of this divergence is the downplaying of the five-year plans in the party communiques and government reports, which used to be the one of the overlapping themes of both documents.",

          "abstract": "Patterns of volunteering have predominantly been explained by focusing on the supply side of volunteering, where differences in volunteering reflect differences in resources and motivations. In this article, we shift the focus to the demand side of volunteering, and argue that a proper account of differences in volunteering must include differences in demand for help. We develop the concept of demand networks, as the inverse of support networks, and argue that demand networks are important to explain voluntary social work and support. We define demand networks as the demand for support requested through ego’s personal network. We propose a model where the amount of demand for help in ego’s network influences the likelihood that ego helps. We then turn to explain what factors create differences in amount of demand in personal networks as well as how they mediate and moderate the effect of demand networks. We focus on factors at 1) a structural level concerning the socio-economic strata of the individual and the organization of the voluntary effort, distinguishing between informal- and formal civil society, and 2) at an institutional level focusing on altruistic values and gendered social roles that may differentiate expectations to care for others and respond to demands for help. We test the resulting associational hypotheses using a cross-sectional population survey inquiring about volunteering during COVID-19 in Denmark. The results support the main hypotheses, indicating the importance of the demand side to adequately explain volunteering.",

          "abstract": "Australia’s newly established wellbeing framework, ‘Measuring What Matters’ (MWM), seeks to measure social progress and influence policy by reporting on 50 wellbeing indicators within five “themes”.  In this paper, we assess whether the MWM framework adequately measures what people in Australia value for their wellbeing by examining both the process of the framework’s development and its content. Firstly, we consider whether the consultation process undertaken was adequate. Secondly, we examine whether the MWM indicators align with existing research on what people in Australia value for their wellbeing. We identified limitations across all four aspects of the consultation examined: its comprehensiveness, reach, transparency, and extent to which it genuinely incorporated community feedback into the framework. While the MWM framework was found to broadly align with existing research on what Australians value for their wellbeing, there were some notable divergences. We urge the Australian Government to undertake a comprehensive, wide-reaching, transparent, and genuine consultation across Australia. Furthermore, we recommend that the Australian Government develop new indicators in consultation with the public. Enhancing the MWM framework will help establish it as a cornerstone of government decision-making, and importantly, ensure that it does what it purports to do: measure what Australians value for their wellbeing.",

          "authors": "Yisu Zhou; Yang SHEN; Xinyue Yao",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "This study proposed a strategy for causal identification in survey experiments by leveraging heteroscedasticity induced through information provision (Z). Here, Z affects attitudes (D), which in turn influences behavior (Y). While Z might traditionally serve as an instrumental variable (IV), a direct effect from Z to the outcome variable (Y) would invalidate it as an IV due to exclusion restriction violations. Building on prior methods, such as Lewbel’s IV approach, which utilize naturally occurring heteroscedasticity in observational data, this study explored the artificial induction of heteroscedasticity within survey experiments. \n\nWe developed a new unbiased estimator within linear structural model and conducted simulations to confirm that this new estimator outperforms conventional IV estimators. We further addressed the issue of endogenous non-compliance, and discussed that under the homogeneous function assumption, manipulating information ambiguity can yield a consistent bias-corrected estimator. This approach can enhance the possibility of causal identification by survey experiments and extend heteroscedasticity-based methodologies to complex compliance contexts, offering new tools for robust experimental design.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools for cognitive support in aging populations, focusing on their ability to enhance memory, provide task reminders, and facilitate social engagement. As the global population ages, the demand for adaptive technologies that support aging in place increases, while healthcare resources grow increasingly strained. LLMs represent a promising avenue for addressing this gap by offering culturally competent, conversational interfaces capable of supporting cognitive function. Despite current limitations in context retention and response accuracy, advancements in LLM technology could enhance personalization and continuity of care, potentially transforming LLMs into significant companions for older adults experiencing cognitive decline. This paper provides an overview of existing LLM capabilities, the challenges that remain, and a projection of how these models might evolve to meet the growing needs of an aging society.",

          "abstract": "The rise of “imposter participants” in research—individuals who misrepresent their identities or experiences to gain access to studies—has become a contentious issue, particularly as online research methods have expanded since the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing literature suggests indicators and strategies for identifying such participants, this approach risks excluding marginalized groups. This paper reframes the discussion, arguing that the current focus on detection and exclusion requires broader ethical and methodological debate. Specifically, we question how to balance research rigour with inclusivity, particularly in health research. This paper calls for urgent sociological intervention, advocating for a reframing of imposter participation as not just a methodological concern but as a critical issue in debates about epistemology, exclusion, and inclusivity in research practices. Rather than simply offering solutions, this paper seeks to provoke a conversation about the evolving challenges of participant verification in an increasingly digital and diverse research landscape.",

Teaching Innovation Grants maintain overall course quality (4.08 vs 4.12) while enabling substantial changes, with specific innovations rated highly (3.94/5). The curriculum game achieves high satisfaction (3.87/5) across several dimensions and the Student Research Platform shows strong engagement through both usage patterns and evaluations (3.92/5).

          "authors": "Dor Shilton; Aniruddh D. Patel; Kim Hill; Chris von Rueden",
          "abstract": "Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.",

          "authors": "Travis Van Isacker; Thom Tyerman",
          "abstract": "This article analyses the (post)colonial politics of UK bordering through the lens of monstrosity. Historicising contemporary bordering within colonial-era monsterisations of racialised people and their mobility, we identify four mechanisms through which migrants are constructed and policed as monsters today: animalisation, zombification, criminalisation and barbarisation. We then examine how the state embodies monstrosity itself through border policies of deterrence and creating ‘hostile environments’. In addition to the instrumentalization of horror, this entails extending the border’s reach domestically throughout everyday life and internationally through deportation and externalisation measures. We argue these developments embody a new form of state power, depicted as a headless tentacled Leviathan. Doing so provides insights into monstrosity as a form of liberal statecraft, the local/global diffusion of bordering, the transnationalisation of sovereign power, and the racialisation of citizenship. It also raises important questions about the construction of border violence as a necessary and legitimate monstrosity in (post)colonial liberal societies, the everyday complicity of citizens, and the limits of efforts to humanise monsterised migrants or reform monstrous state institutions. Revealing how within liberal regimes of citizenship and humanitarianism values ‘there be monsters’, we argue, opens space for thinking about abolitionist alternatives in international politics.",

According to this model, Kamala Harris is projected to win the popular vote with 52.5% of the two-party vote share, approximately 1.5-2 points higher than most other forecasts and polling averages. I then calculate each state’s deviation from the national vote share (its relative Democratic or Republican lean) based on recent high-quality polling, adding these deviations to the Economy-Quality Model’s national prediction to derive state-level predictions and electoral college results. The model forecasts Kamala Harris winning the electoral college with 319 votes.",

This study aims to fill that gap by exploring the extent and nature of toxic behaviors and the use of offensive language among rural adolescents playing online games in Baybay City, Leyte. Through Symbolic Interactionism, this study aimed to identify the underlying factors contributing to such behaviors and their potential impacts on communication and social development. This study conducted a series of interviews, focus group discussions, and community observation to supplement the initial survey. Results showed that adolescents in rural areas are aware of their toxic behavior, but due to its normalization, do not think of it as a problem and instead see it as part of online gaming culture. This suggests the need to strengthen proper communication and improve maturity among players engaging in online games that require them to socialize.",

Thematic analysis of all three studies resulted in four themes that informed the CT-informed AT (CTIAT) framework: (1) voluntary participation, (2) dignity of experience, (3) relational care, and (4) the development of a sense of self. Results highlighted the importance of eliminating coercion and replacing manualised treatment models with practitioner reflexivity. Ecological dynamics, which links ecological psychology and dynamical systems theory in a holistic person-environment-action interaction, is proposed as the mechanism of healing for AT and CT approaches.",

          "abstract": "The traditional framework of fertility research conceptualizes childbirth from the mother's perspective. From her perspective, birth is an uncertain and potentially recurring event. In contrast, the Born once, die once (B1D1) framework conceptualizes birth as an event experienced by the child. From its perspective, birth is certain and, like death, occurs only once. As an advantage over the traditional approach, the child's perspective allows for the use of density, survival, and hazard functions to study fertility age patterns at the macro level using birth counts for all parities by maternal age. Here, we reformulate the B1D1 framework using fertility rate notation and extend the traditional fertility framework by analogous density, survival, and hazard functions. We compare this extended traditional framework with the B1D1 framework using data on Swedish cohorts born in the 19th and 20th centuries. Large historical differences between the density, survival, and hazard functions in the two frameworks have diminished for more recent cohorts, suggesting converging conclusions about fertility age patterns. The new density, survival, and hazard functions can shed new light on differences in fertility age patterns across populations and advance traditional fertility research, including by capturing fertility and mortality age patterns with common concepts and measures.",

Donors, including bilateral and multilateral agencies, respond variably; bilateral aid often decreases following anti-NGO laws, while multilateral aid remains stable. Private donors' responses depend on factors like social trust and NGO transparency. NGOs adapt by diversifying funding, forming affiliates, or shifting to community-based support. As the space for civil society continues to shrink, coordinated international efforts are essential to counteract these repressive trends and uphold civil society's role in democratic governance.",

          "authors": "Garry Peterson; Elena M Bennett; Reinette Biggs",
          "abstract": "The predominance of catastrophic and dystopian visions about the future makes it difficult to envision and articulate pathways for sustainability transformations towards more positive futures. To address this challenge, the \"Seeds of a Good Anthropocene” (SoGA) project began over a decade ago, in 2014. The project seeks to identify and amplify existing, innovative, non-mainstream sustainability initiatives, which we call “seeds”, that have the potential to contribute to new development pathways and create positive futures. These “seeds” offer tangible examples of how positive change is already happening out of the mainstream, and imagining how they could grow provides a useful way of describing different plausible, desirable futures and articulating pathways to move towards those futures. This paper reviews the history of the SoGA project, its theoretical underpinnings, and its ongoing impact on futures thinking, scenario development, and sustainability science. Combining personal reflections of the project's founders with a bibliometric analysis of over 30 peer-reviewed papers connected to the SoGA project, the paper identifies key people, places, and ideas that have contributed to the project. It also highlights the project’s diverse activities, such as a mobile app to identify urban ‘seeds’ and assisting in the development of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Nature Futures Framework. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for the next decade of the SoGA project.",

          "authors": "Yansong David Wang; Tao Louie Xu; Cheng Yuan",
          "abstract": "This research employs the Alkire-Foster approach to measure multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, followed by examining the role of the three-pillar pension system in mitigating household multidimensional poverty. With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the knowledge of how household participation in pension pillars sustainably mitigates multidimensional poverty through micro-level mechanisms and to the policy praxis of why a facilitating state is called for poverty mitigation from the perspective of new structural economics.",

          "abstract": "This report investigates the feasibility of developing a holistic indicator to assess and communicate the social sustainability and quality of life in Vancouver. Despite the availability of various specific metrics, there is a noted absence of a comprehensive framework that integrates these metrics to\nprovide a singular, actionable view of the city's progress towards its social\nsustainability goals.\nThe City of Vancouver currently employs 45 population-level indicators under its Healthy City Strategy, demonstrating the city's commitment to transparent and data-driven governance. However, these indicators, while effective individually, do not collectively provide a complete picture of the city's overall\nhealth across various dimensions such as public health, housing, education, and environmental sustainability.\nThe aim of this research was to identify a holistic indicator that encompasses multiple dimensions of social sustainability to simplify assessments and improve strategic planning. \nThrough a desktop review of 70 existing indicators and consultations with experts, two models were identified as particularly promising: the Greater London Authority's (GLA) Wellbeing and Sustainability Measure, and the City of Calgary's Equity Index (CEI). These models offer robust frameworks that prioritize equity, accessibility, and stakeholder involvement, aligning closely with Vancouver's urban development goals.\nThis work highlights the need for an overarching metric that reflects the interdependencies among various domains, ensuring that progress in one area does not undermine another. By leveraging insights from this research, Vancouver can enhance its policy implementation and community engagement, moving closer to achieving a balanced and sustainable urban environment. The proposed holistic indicator will also support the city in benchmarking against other urban centers and refining its\nstrategic initiatives based on quantifiable metrics.",

While microeconomic fertility models stress the trade-off between child quality and quantity during the demographic transition, the extensive and intensive margin fertility model applies to the post-transition period, with implications for childlessness and the postponement of childbearing. The impact of micro decisions on economic growth is more substantial during the demographic transition than in the post-transition period.

          "authors": "Cristin Kearns",
          "abstract": "In the digital age, online industry documents have become an available and abundant source to inform qualitative health research on the commercial determinants of health. I offer the situational scoping method as an approach that applies rigorous and transparent methods to conduct an overview of large databases of industry documents by focusing on specific empirical “situations” as the object of study. It is conducted by a collective of transdisciplinary researchers and community members who shape knowledge production based on their unique experience and opinions about which situations are deemed essential for emancipatory action. The situational scoping method is rooted in a critical constructivist epistemology and consists of three stages: 1) identification of a broad range of external events over time perceived by industries as a threat or opportunity to business interests; 2) selection of a sample of external events for further analysis; and 3) social worlds/arenas mapping of industry responses to selected external events. I describe the epistemological and methodological influences, development, and procedures of the situational scoping method drawing from my experience conducting a pilot study with a project team engaged in scoping of documents related to environmental exposures and breast cancer in the University of California, San Francisco Industry Documents Library, which houses millions of documents produced by the tobacco, opioids, chemical, drug, food, and fossil fuel industries. This method enhances traditional tobacco documents research by engaging a collective or researchers and community members, offering a systematic approach to assessing a large corpus of industry documents, employing visual tools, and providing facilitation and research training. This study advances the use of qualitative methods in industry documents research.",

Gli autori analizzano le condizioni sociali e sanitarie dei “villaggi” durante i primi giorni di quarantena, evidenziando come l’isolamento abbia esacerbato l’accesso limitato ai servizi essenziali e peggiorato le condizioni economiche e di vita di queste popolazioni già vulnerabili.\n\nUtilizzando una metodologia innovativa di interviste telefoniche, resa possibile grazie a un rapporto di fiducia con i residenti, l’Associazione 21 luglio ha raccolto dati preziosi sui problemi quotidiani e sulle misure di auto-tutela adottate dai residenti. L’articolo rivela le gravi carenze nei servizi di base, come l’accesso all’acqua potabile, i dispositivi di protezione e le risorse alimentari, che non solo aggravano le difficoltà materiali ma intensificano anche la segregazione e la marginalità sociale.\n\nLe evidenze raccolte spingono a ripensare le politiche pubbliche di emergenza, promuovendo misure che includano la distribuzione di beni di prima necessità e il supporto educativo, soprattutto per i bambini in età scolare privati della didattica a distanza. Gli autori propongono azioni collaborative e incrementali, come programmi di assistenza alimentare per i bambini da 0 a 3 anni, e sottolineano la necessità di contrastare lo stigma e il razzismo nei confronti delle comunità Rom per costruire legami solidali e interdipendenti con la società circostante.\n\nQuesta ricerca, oltre a offrire una testimonianza sulle dinamiche di esclusione urbana, rappresenta un esempio cruciale di ricerca applicata che ha saputo tradursi in interventi pratici per migliorare la vita delle persone in difficoltà.",

The intervention has been partly modeled after the prominent Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ). To assess the impact of the intervention, we leverage register data containing information on all Dutch children finishing primary school in the period 2009 - 2022. Synthetic control analysis is applied to estimate the causal effect for each individual school. The findings show the program has had limited effect on educational outcomes with little variation between schools. Our contribution is in showing how several factors, such as goal switching, lack of participation, and teacher shortages, hamper program effectiveness and discussing to what extent a concept such as the HCZ is transferable to other international contexts. Finally, we also illustrate how the synthetic control method can be applied in educational research.",

          "abstract": "This report describes how immigration advocates—people engaging in political or legal campaigns for, and/or offering direct services and support to, immigrants—understand their efforts to reduce or prevent the harms of the U.S. immigration system on immigrants and their families. We draw on interviews with 67 immigration advocates representing 76 immigrant-serving nonprofits across the United States between November 2021 and February 2023. The interviews affirm advocates and their organizations’ important frontline roles in reducing systemic harm by addressing immigrants’ immediate material, social, and/or legal needs. Yet, when it comes to preventing harm by reforming or transforming the immigration system, many advocates believe their efforts do little but maintain the system’s structure. Advocates attribute this dynamic to several sources, including the ever-evolving harms of the current system; the demands of the public and private funders their organizations rely on; intraorganizational challenges common to immigrant-serving organizations; and the perceived immovability of the national, state, and local political contexts they work in. We conclude with several immediate and long-range suggestions for immigration advocates to consider as they continue their work.",

Currently, there is no taxonomy available for scholars and practitioners to refer to when discussing money laundering through online video games. Without a well-defined taxonomy it becomes difficult to reason through, formulate and implement effective regulatory measures, policies and security controls. As such, efforts to prevent and reduce virtual laundering incidence rates are hampered.\nDesign/methodology/approach — This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering\ncategorizations. However, instead of fixating on the processes undergirding individual instances of virtual laundering, it is argued that focusing on the initial locale of the illicit proceeds provides the appropriate framing within which to classify instances of virtual laundering. Thus, the act of classification becomes an ontological endeavor, rather than an attempt at elucidating an inherently varied process (as is common of the placement, layering and integration model).\nFindings — This paper proposes three mutually exclusive virtual laundering categorizations.

Secondly, which areas have been treated with a greater degree of ideological bias and would therefore benefit from a more critical realist approach (Pratschke, 2003)? Thirdly, what insights have been gained? In responding to these queries, the chapter considers the ways in which research has frequently examined associationism with a view to elucidating broader dynamics, including those pertaining to politics, professionalisation, organisation, community, elites, cooperation, and categories of stratification. As we examine the ways in which cities engage with associations, we observe a multiplicity of modes of governance, a diversity of instruments of public action, and a structure of associational opportunities. This allows us to investigate the mechanisms and processes involved, adopting a historical and comparative approach that aligns with Weberian principles.",

This paper examines how the Second Great Migration (1940–1970) spurred structural change in the American South between 1970 and 2010. Empirical results using shift-share instruments show that out-migration incentivized capital investment and capital-augmenting technical change, increasing capital per worker and output in both agriculture and manufacturing, at least until 2010. Labor was reallocated from agriculture to non-agriculture. I then develop a dynamic spatial equilibrium model that allows for substitution between factors of production, factor-biased technical change, and factor abundance-based trade to characterize this process. The quantitative analysis indicates that labor-capital substitution played a major role in adjustments to South-to-North migration.",

          "authors": "Moa Mårtensson; Maria Nordbrandt; Joakim Palme; Lauri Peterson",
          "abstract": "Carbon taxation is widely embraced as an effective tool for reducing emissions, yet it is economically regressive, disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable groups. Hence, it is no surprise that carbon taxes often are perceived as unfair, and if implemented without consideration of distributive effects, they risk generating polarization and climate policy setbacks, as well as increasing existing inequalities. We provide the first causal analysis of how and to what extent existing social protection programs could be used to reduce opposition to carbon taxes. We employ a conjoint experiment targeting 5,188 respondents from Sweden to assess the causal effect of increased generosity in pensions, sickness insurance, unemployment insurance, and child benefits, benchmarked against the effect of monthly monetary handouts. Our findings suggest that increasing benefit generosity within each of the four examined social protection programs reduces opposition to carbon taxation. Most importantly, increased old age pension generosity have a substantial and significant impact across various demographic groups, regardless of the respondents’ political affiliation. This effect is more potent than other compensatory measures, a critical insight in the search for socially acceptable climate policy strategies that avoid increasing inequalities.",
