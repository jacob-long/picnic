          "title": "Interleaving Subtraction Strategies Goes Solo: No Benefit from Initial Blocking or Self-Explanation",
          "authors": "Nike Scheitz; Nicole Hollmann; Lea Nemeth; Frank Lipowsky; Rita Borromeo Ferri; Johannes Osterberg",
          "abstract": "Interleaved practice—systematically mixing different categories—tends to enhance mathematical learning. However, research on its long-term effects of delays beyond 30 days, and the potential benefit of providing additional instructional support to encourage comparison and abstraction processes during interleaved practice, is still emerging. Therefore, this study investigated two promising approaches: starting with blocked practice before transitioning to interleaved practice (blocked-to-interleaved practice, B2I) and self-explanation prompts. 238 third graders participated in an experimental classroom study on three subtraction strategies (stepwise, compensation, and indirect addition). After instruction on strategy execution and application conditions, students completed a practice phase targeting both execution and strategy-problem associations. The study followed a 3 x 2 between-subjects design (blocked vs. B2I vs. interleaved x self-explanation vs. additional practice). Data were collected before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. Both interleaved conditions outperformed blocked practice in terms of flexibility, adaptivity, and conditional strategy knowledge (CSK), with effects lasting up to 16 weeks. Although no direct benefit on accuracy emerged at any measurement point, serial mediation analyses indicated that interleaving improved accuracy indirectly via CSK and adaptivity. Neither initial blocking nor self-explanation prompts yielded additional benefits over pure interleaving. Self-explanation quality positively predicted short-term adaptivity, accuracy, and CSK, and remained a predictor of CSK at 8- and 16-week follow-ups. These findings indicate that interleaving promotes lasting adaptive expertise in elementary school mathematics but suggest no benefit from adding a blocked phase or self-explanation prompts under deductive instruction conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared less than 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "authors": "Christ Billy Aryanto; Aireen Rhammy Kinara Aisyah; Renee Timmers; Emma Blakey; Claudia Christina von Bastian",
          "abstract": "A person’s lifetime involvement with musical expertise has been hypothesized to be positively associated with executive functions, including inhibition, shifting, and working memory. However, results of past research have been inconclusive. This preregistered systematic review and three-level meta-analysis of 47 studies encompassing 235 effect sizes from 4651 healthy adult participants investigated how strongly musical expertise relates to each of the three executive functions. The results showed significant medium associations between musical expertise and executive functions (g = 0.43), with small to medium associations between musical expertise and each of the functions: inhibition (g = 0.31), shifting (g = 0.22), and working memory (g = 0.49). Risk of bias moderated the relationship between musical expertise and inhibition, and the paradigm used to assess executive functions moderated the association between musical expertise and working memory. The results suggest that individuals who engage in musical activities have higher levels of executive function, with a particularly critical role of working memory in musical expertise. The literature review further identified several methodological issues, including predominant reliance on dichotomizing continuous variables and the use of small samples yielding low statistical power. The review offers methodological recommendations and directions for further investigating the relation between working memory and musical expertise.",

          "title": "Motivation for Sport: A Comparison Between Perfectionism and Excellencism in Self-Determination Theory",
          "authors": "Thomas Boivin; Philippe Pétrin-Pomerleau; Patrick Gaudreau",
          "abstract": "Abstract \nPerfectionism creates motivational conflicts. However, researchers have repeatedly found positive associations between perfectionistic standards and autonomous motivation. This may be because researchers have not distinguished between perfectionistic standards and the pursuit of excellence. Based on the Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism (MEP), we recruited 328 sport participants to investigate the unique associations of perfectionistic standards and excellencism with sport motivations. We hypothesized that perfectionistic standards should primarily be associated with controlled types of motivation and amotivation, while excellencism would only predict autonomous types of motivation. As expected, results of structural equation modeling showed that excellencism was a positive and significant predictor of intrinsic, integrated, and identified motivation. Mean scores of introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation were very low in this sample, thus we carried out zero-inflated negative binomial structural equation modeling. The probability of reporting zero introjected motivation, external motivation, and amotivation was positively associated with excellencism. The probability of reporting zero external motivation was negatively associated with perfectionistic standards. We concluded that pursuing excellencism should be encouraged, as it is associated with autonomous motivation in sport. Examining motivation through the MEP revealed that pursuing high standards – rather than perfectionistic standards – is responsible for the desirable associations with autonomous motivation. Our results suggest that findings from past studies should be interpreted with caution as they did not distinguish excellencism from perfectionistic standards.\nKeywords: Perfectionism, Excellencism, Motivation, Sport",

          "authors": "R. Karl Hanson; German Marquez-Alcala; James Jondall Prescott",
          "abstract": "Public sex offender registries were created on the assumption that people with a history of sexual offending present a high and enduring risk for sexual recidivism. Analyzing data from everyone on Michigan’s sex offender registry (n = 45,145), we found that recidivism risk was very low for many registrants—and that transitions into very low-risk groups occurred in systematic and predictable ways that are relevant to registry design. The sexual recidivism rates were 3% to 5% after five years and 10% after 20 years. Risk of future offending predictably declined the longer people remained sex-offense free in the community. Considering initial risk levels and time free in the community, the likelihood of sexual recidivism was very low for approximately half the registrants: out of 35,000 registrants in the community in Michigan, the risk level for 17,000 to 19,000 individuals was no different from the likelihood of first-time sexual offending in the general male population (&lt; 2% lifetime). Michigan’s registry provides no means for the public to differentiate between the noise presented by the large number of very low-risk cases and the signal representing the minority of genuinely high-risk cases. Major reforms are needed if public sex offender registries have any potential for advancing community safety. However, instead of placing our hopes in large, passive, and stigmatizing registries, we are more likely to reduce sexual recidivism by investing in individualized supervision, treatment, and other support for people at high risk for sexual recidivism.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memories are segmented. This study explores the dual role of prior knowledge in event \nsegmentation, hypothesizing that knowledge leads to coarser segmentation when experiences align \nwith it, and finer segmentation when they do not. Participants underwent a training phase to learn \nsequences of images, followed by a segmentation phase where they identified event boundaries, \nand finally, a surprise memory test. Our findings reveal that trained participants segmented less at \nexpected transitions compared to untrained participants. Conversely, when sequences were \ndisrupted, trained participants exhibited more segmentation. Interestingly, the segmentation \ndifferences diminished over time, suggesting that participants updated their expectations based on \nnew experiences. Additionally, our study dissociated the roles of prediction errors and context \nswitches in event segmentation. While prediction errors alone would predict larger differences \nbetween trained and untrained groups, we observed high segmentation rates in the trained group, \neven for expected transitions, underscoring the importance of contextual shifts. In conclusion, our \nresults highlight that knowledge is a double-edged sword in event segmentation, promoting both \ncoarser and finer segmentation. These findings provide insights into how the mind navigates and \norganizes experiences, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between knowledge, perception, and \nmemory.",

          "authors": "Edgar Dubourg; Coltan Scrivner",
          "abstract": "Fear is a universal feature of storytelling, yet the structural conditions that make fictional threats compelling remain poorly understood. Here, we propose the Protagonist Vulnerability Index (PVI), an evolutionarily grounded computational approach to explain why some narratives evoke stronger fear responses than others. PVI quantifies protagonist vulnerability by assessing the imbalance in formidability between protagonists and antagonists and the risk of attack faced by the protagonist. Across 691 films, higher PVI values predicted classification as horror, the presence of fear-related keywords in non-horror films, and stronger physiological fear responses indexed by heart rate. Linking film preferences to psychological and demographic data from more than 3.5 million individuals on Facebook, we found that preference for high-PVI films was associated with lower agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, and with higher openness. Openness moderated the negative association between neuroticism and engagement with fear-related content, indicating that curiosity can counteract threat avoidance in anxious individuals. These findings clarify the structural and psychological conditions that activate evolved threat-management systems. The results show how horror operates as a narrative simulation of extreme formidability asymmetry, and provide a framework for predicting, and potentially engineering, fear in fiction.",

          "abstract": "Why do people feel curious about some questions but not others? Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. However, it is less clear whether practical barriers to learning—for example, the effort required to gain information—matter for how curious we feel. In the present research, we test whether the expected degree of effort to obtain information impacts curiosity in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort or with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that exerting effort would lead to information. Across studies, we found that effort affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that subjective feelings of curiosity are unhindered by the practical costs of information search, though our decisions to actually pursue information are highly sensitive to these costs.",

          "abstract": "Although collision-like causes are fundamental in philosophical and psychological theories of causation, humans conceptualize many events as causes that lack direct contact. We argue that how people think and talk about different causes is deeply connected and investigate how children learn this mapping. If Andy hits Suzy with his bike, Suzy falls into a fence and it breaks, Andy caused the fence to break but Suzy broke it. If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen caused Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun burned her skin. We tested 691 children and 150 adults. Four-year-old children mapped “caused” to distal causes and “broke” to proximal causes (Experiment 1). Though four-year-old children didn’t map “caused” to absences until later (Experiment 2), they already referred to absences when asked “why” an outcome occurred (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the role of semantics and pragmatics in developing these mappings.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown that early ramping activity is a very reliable antecedent of self-initiated movement. However, the dominant paradigm has been to only analyze data epochs culminating in movement, which discounts how often slow ramping might occur when no movement follows. To address this, we introduced a matched control condition that did not culminate in movement. We recorded electroencephalography data and compared these two conditions using a variety of powerful machine-learning classifiers. Although early ramping activity was present, it did not predict movement. Instead, classification accuracy rose abruptly about 100 ms before movement. By contrast, the traditional approach reproduced the spurious impression of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing that the neural commitment to act is a late-stage event consistent with the timing of conscious intention and the ability to inhibit movement. More broadly, our results show that a reliable antecedent is not necessarily a good predictor, underscoring the need for proper control conditions in time series analyses.",

          "abstract": "Recent research suggests that humans use language-like mental representations for many\nstimuli, from auditory sequences to visual shapes. However, evidence has been largely\nindirect, relying on stimulus compression as a proxy for internal representation. Using\nconstituency tests, we probed representational structure in the domain of geometry more\ndirectly. Across three preregistered experiments (n= 136), we find robust evidence for tree\nstructure in human adults’ shape representations. First, the same shape can receive\ndifferent structural representations depending on how a preceding animation organizes it.\nSecond, subparts of shapes are easier to detect when they belong to the same subtree than\nwhen spanning different subtrees. Third, shape fragments are easier to reconfigure the\nhigher in the tree they are split. Unlike humans, state-of-the-art deep networks show no\nsyntactic effects whatsoever. Thus, humans—and so far only humans—encode geometric\nshapes in hierarchical structures, mirroring the representations used in natural language\nprocessing.",

          "authors": "Saskia Baumgardt; Tilmann von Soest; Christina M. Juchem; Tina Kretschmer; Susan Garthus-Niegel; Eva Asselmann",
          "abstract": "Although surveys suggest that 5–15% of parents report regret about having children, parental regret remains a taboo topic and has received surprisingly little scientific attention. Research from related fields suggests that adverse contextual factors, child-related difficulties, or psychological strain may increase the likelihood of regret. However, most existing studies rely on small or selective samples. Consequently, little is known about which factors are most strongly associated with parental regret in the general population. This study is among the first to examine a broad range of contextual, child-related, and psychosocial predictors of parental regret in a large, representative sample from Germany. We used data from the pairfam study, a large nationally representative panel survey in\nGermany. In 2019/20, participants were asked whether they regretted becoming parents. Using logistic regression, we examined predictors of parental regret across seven clusters: (1) sociodemographic factors, (2) stressful life events, (3) interpersonal factors, (4) pregnancy and childbirth experiences, (5) child-related factors, (6) factors related to parental role experiences, and (7) psychosocial factors and personality traits. Additionally, we tested whether associations differed by parental sex, child age, and living arrangements.\nIn line with prior findings from other countries, 11% of parents reported parental regret. Parental regret was primarily associated with contextual factors, such as lower education, lower partner support, and previous abortion experiences; with child-related factors, such as a higher age and number of children; and with individual factors, such as higher depressiveness and lower parental self-efficacy. Our findings underscore the multifactorial nature of parental regret and point to several levers for prevention and support. Strengthening structural resources for socioeconomically disadvantaged families, enhancing couple relationship quality, expanding access to comprehensive family planning counseling, and promoting parental efficacy and competencies may help reduce the likelihood and potentially adverse impact of parental regret.",

          "abstract": "Even though increasing the ecological validity of experimental and theoretical research is seen as a worthy aim by many, progress over the decades has been limited. And so, despite 150 years of research, fundamental and applied, our scientific understanding of the human mind, brain and behavior in the wild remains fragmented. \n\nWe argue that one root cause is a lack of clarity and consensus on what pursuing ecological validity would amount to. These make the goal ambiguous, which in turn leads to misconceptions and unhelpful dichotomies guiding the theoretical discussion and methodological developments -as opposed to an research programme in the Lakatosian sense. We then develop ten principles for an ecological approach to cognitive science that, taken together, would yield such an integrated research programme: one that is neither “lab based” nor “real-world”, neither “basic” nor “applied”, but properly ecological. \n\nThe principles are first presented as logically independent statements (“axioms”) that allow you to evaluate the Ecological, Cognitive and Scientific credentials of research – be it a single experiment, a computational model, or even a fundamental theory or conceptual framework. We then show how they can be integrated into concrete recommendations that should be practically useful in planning experiments or developing theoretical models (“a positive heuristic”). Finally, we discuss how and why we as researchers all too often violate these principles.",

          "abstract": "The principle of “common fate” tells us that objects that move together, group together. But what happens in dynamic illusions where physical paths are shared, but illusory paths differ? Here a horizontal row of targets physically moves up and down as a group over a zigzag set of vertical columns each filled with a static, oblique grating (the furrow illusion). Each target moves in its own column and when the columns all have the same orientation, the targets drift obliquely together, following the furrows of the static gratings. However, if the background orientations for the outer two “bookend” targets (say, right tilt) differ from those of the inner “book” targets (say, left tilt), all items still appear to drift initially to the right as a group, following the illusory direction set by the bookends and ignoring the opposing illusory motion of the inner books. The effect does not rely on blocking access to the features of the inner books – as might be expected from crowding – as they can have easily discriminable shape and/or colour, and their relative motion within the frame of the bookends may still be recoverable. What is missing is any sense of their opposing illusory path. We suggest that the spatial proximity of the items together with their common vertical motion provides the visual system with enough evidence to form a single “grouped” object representation. As objects tend not to move in two directions at once, the more salient bookends dominate our perception of where the group is going.",

          "abstract": "This comprehensive manual provides evidence-informed guidance for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, addressing the critical gap between growing interest in psychedelic therapy and accessible, scientifically-grounded information. Drawing on memory-reconsolidation/predictive-processing, complex systems dynamics, and the defense cascade model of autonomic threat responses, the authors explain how MDMA facilitates the unlearning of the maladaptive schemas/predictions underlying many mental illnesses. The book synthesizes current research with clinical and lived experience to offer practical protocols for MDMA therapy. The manual covers essential topics including: the neuroscience of trauma and healing; comprehensive safety considerations and contraindications; detailed session preparation and navigation techniques; managing therapeutic destabilization and adverse effects; and strategies for continued reconsolidation between sessions. Special attention is given to the challenges of accessing ethical, skilled professional support and the complex risk-benefit considerations of solo therapy. Written for mental health professionals, their clients, and individuals pursuing healing outside traditional frameworks, this guide emphasizes practices to improve efficacy and reduce risk. The authors acknowledge MDMA therapy's potential for rapid, profound healing while providing thorough discussion of risks including dangerous drug interactions, psychological destabilization, and the importance of proper support structures. By making this knowledge freely available, the manual aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of MDMA therapy as practiced in various contexts, while advocating for approaches grounded in compassion, scientific rigor, and respect for individual autonomy in the healing process. *I used Claude 4 Opus to draft this abstract because the need for a preliminary abstract exceeded my patience to write one.

Am. 26, 369-380 (1954)] reported two main findings: (1) the frequency ratio R_oct defining perceptually a perfect octave between successive pure tones is not fixed but varies rapidly, in an irregular and listener-specific manner, with the reference frequency; (2) on average, R_oct is slightly larger than 2:1. Ward's second finding, now referred to as the \"octave enlargement\" phenomenon, was confirmed multiple times. However, his first finding needed to be verified with a more rigorous methodology. This was the aim of two experiments reported here, in which overall more than 4000 octave adjustments were performed with pure tones at 65 dB SPL. They show that R_oct can be significantly different for two reference frequencies only 50 or even 25 cents apart. If R_oct defines a constant distance on the pitch dimension, then the results imply that, contrary to common belief, pitch is not a smooth function of frequency. A third experiment supported the idea that the octave enlargement should not be interpreted as a deliberate bias intended to make an adjusted octave more brilliant and therefore pleasant, rather than optimally accurate.",

          "abstract": "Slower responses in older age are often taken as evidence of cognitive decline, yet they may also stem from representational changes shaped by lifelong learning. We advance a developmental perspective on aging, proposing that behavioral change across the lifespan arises from representational systems continuously updated through learning from the environment. This view predicts that aging may bring both benefits and costs: Performance improves when task demands are congruent with accumulated knowledge but declines when they conflict. We provide convergent evidence for this account across three studies, each comprising the following components. First, in tasks requiring participants to access word meanings (i.e., when task demands were congruent with representation), we found that older adults (70–80 years old) exhibited faster processing speed than younger adults (18–25 years old)—a finding that cannot be explained by dominant decline-based accounts. Second, we traced this processing advantage to systematic changes in older adults’ conceptual representations, as inferred from semantic rating tasks. Third, using learning simulation models, we demonstrated how such representational changes could emerge naturally from cumulative language experience.  Replication across different samples, task requirements, and word stimuli strengthens the robustness of these findings. Finally, we identified a boundary condition: when learned representations contained information incongruent with task demands, older adults’ greater learning experience not only attenuates their representational changes but also reduces processing-speed advantage. Altogether, our research challenges the explanatory framework of cognitive aging that emphasizes decline and compensation, advancing a more balanced view grounded in representational development and lifelong learning.",

          "abstract": "What you see depends on what you have seen before, and commonly your perception is drawn toward the past. Such attractive biases, known as serial dependence, are well established for many visual features. Interestingly, Chen and Bae (2024, Cognition) recently reported a repulsive serial bias in a pointing direction estimation task that switched to an attractive one in the presence of a distracting task. At the same time, an analysis of response trajectories revealed a repulsive bias during response execution, irrespective of the condition. These surprising findings prompted us to attempt a replication. We confirmed the main findings of Chen and Bae. However, we also demonstrated that the overall direction and magnitude of the bias are relatively stable for a given observer, regardless of the condition. Furthermore, we found that already the very first moment in the response trajectory differed between conditions, showing a predominantly attractive bias for trials that ended with attraction. The results confirm the robustness of the original findings and pose a challenge for a simple Bayesian model of serial dependence, highlighting the need for computational models that can explain both attractive and repulsive biases.",

          "authors": "Blazej M. Baczkowski; Arno Villringer",
          "abstract": "Linking memories of temporally separated neutral and threatening experiences can support later recognition of early warning signals. Yet it remains unclear what cognitive processes might allow the seemingly inconsequential neutral events – encoded in safe contexts and thus prone to forgetting – to nevertheless be preserved in memory well enough to inform future threat predictions. Here, we tested whether Pavlovian threat conditioning retroactively strengthens long-term episodic memory for previously encoded neutral events by leveraging prior knowledge of their predictive relations. Young adults first learned to anticipate the order of semantic categories in two deterministic sequences (A-&gt;B-&gt;C and D-&gt;E-&gt;F) through repeated presentation of images depicting category exemplars. They then incidentally encoded trial-unique exemplars from each category during sequence viewing. In a next phase, exemplars from the third-position categories were repeated such that one (C) predicted mild electric shocks, whereas the other (F) was never reinforced, creating a category-level threat association through conditioning. After 24 hours, recognition memory for exemplars of categories encoded before conditioning depended on sequence and position: when a sequence ended with a shock-predictive category, memory for its starting category (A) was prioritized over the following category (B) – an effect absent in the control categories (D and E). These results suggest that aversive learning can retroactively reshape episodic memories of neutral events when they are scaffolded by prior sequence knowledge, bridging temporal gaps and thereby potentially promoting early threat anticipation.",

          "abstract": "HIV is a highly stigmatized condition, and negative beliefs about HIV and people with HIV are frequently internalized. This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "authors": "Benjamin PUTOIS; Royce Anders",
          "abstract": "Background. Panic disorder (PD) has historically been subdivided into respiratory (RS) and non-respiratory (NRS) subtypes, based on Klein’s suffocation alarm hypothesis. \nMethods. A systematic search of MEDLINE was performed to identify empirical studies examining the RS/NRS distinction, autonomic physiology, and therapeutic implications.\nResults. Although this dichotomy has facilitated research, it is limited by tautological definitions, temporal instability, and limited clinical validity. For example, RS is defined by respiratory symptoms, and their observation in patients, yet it is subsequently “validated” by CO₂ hypersensitivity, creating circularity, or encouraging confirmation bias. In contrast, NRS is defined for most non-respiratory symptoms by default, therefore constituting a rather heterogeneous, residual category that lacks a unifying explanation of NRS function, and moreover neglects key clinical features such as dissociation, vestibular instability, and gastrointestinal distress. These shortcomings restrict its ability to inform treatment planning and prognostic assessment. In response, a polyvagal framework is proposed, conceptualizing panic attacks as transitions between autonomic states rather than as fixed subtypes. In this framework, RS-like profiles correspond to sympathetic hyperarousal with insufficient ventral vagal modulation, characterized by dyspnea, chest tightness, and catastrophic suffocation fears. NRS-like profiles correspond to dorsal vagal shutdown, characterized by dizziness, presyncope, nausea, and dissociative phenomena. Mixed or alternating features are commonly observed in clinical practice, highlighting the inability of the classical RS/NRS categorization to account for such phenomena, and hence a need to reconceptualize panic attack dynamics with a more comprehensive framework.\nConclusions. Reconceptualizing panic disorder within polyvagal theory integrates neglected symptom domains, aligns semiology with identifiable physiological mechanisms, and provides a more coherent basis for clinical stratification.\nClinical implications. This model suggests mechanism-based interventions: voluntary slow breathing, capnometry-assisted breathing, or yawning for sympathetic profiles; applied tension, progressive muscle contraction techniques, or vestibular rehabilitation for dorsal vagal shutdown; and co-yawning or ventral vagal stimulation as transdiagnostic adjuncts.\nFuture directions. Validation through autonomic phenotyping, multimodal assessments, and randomized controlled trials is required to determine prognostic and therapeutic value of the proposed framework.",

          "abstract": "The inclusiveness of immersion education, such as CLIL, for atypically developing pupils remains understudied. At the same time, immersion learning has been argued to impose high attentional and executive control demands. From this perspective, children already experiencing difficulties in these cognitive abilities, such as children with ADHD, might be at greater risk in immersion education. To address this issue empirically, 26 fifth and sixth-grade pupils with ADHD and 41 typically developing controls were recruited in CLIL and non-CLIL programs, and compared across attentional, executive, linguistic, and academic measures. Our findings do not support the claim that CLIL would only host the mildest forms of ADHD, nor that CLIL would pose additional cognitive and academic challenges for children with ADHD. On the contrary, we conclude that CLIL may offer a valuable opportunity for foreign-language learning, also for pupils with developmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "We investigated the mechanism of the lingering effect in relation to the garden-path effect based on self-paced reading and comprehension experiments in Japanese, which shows higher reanalysis success rates than English does. The lingering effect is a phenomenon whereby an initial misinterpretation persists in the final comprehension even after disambiguation. Through self-paced reading (Experiment 1) and comprehension tasks (Experiments 2 and 3), this study explored how the length and head position of ambiguous regions influence the garden-path and lingering effects. Our results indicate that the length and head position influenced the garden-path and lingering effects in different ways. In particular, a longer initial misparse strengthened the garden-path effect in a linear manner but weakened the lingering effect in a non-linear manner. Additionally, Surprisal affected the garden-path effect, but not the lingering effect. These results support the notion that the garden-path and lingering effects are correlated but operate through different underlying processes. Specifically, the garden-path effect pertains to parsing, whereas the lingering effect relates to short-term memory.",

Subsequently, a new CFA was performed for the short scale. Finally, the reliability of the short version was assessed using McDonald’s omega and Cronbach’s Alpha. \nResults: The models using all questionnaire items showed unacceptable fit.

Longitudinal analyses showed that higher p-factor predicted lower future reading achievement. Puberty status, rather than chronological age, moderated this relationship, with stronger predictive effect of p-factor on reading after puberty onset. Furthermore, the polygenic risk score for p-factor predicted lower reading achievement at puberty onset, suggesting puberty may amplify this genetic vulnerability. Results suggest that p-factor may be a developmental risk factor for reading underachievement, particularly after puberty onset. Consideration puberty status, alongside age, are important in academic and mental health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Selectively attending to goal-relevant information supports performance. However, it can also limit knowledge about the statistical properties of the broader environment, as well as memory for features that are not currently relevant but may be useful in the future. This study investigated how a naturally selective and goal-oriented attentional system can be leveraged to support both immediate performance outcomes and generalizable knowledge through strategic broadening of attention. Undergraduate participants (N=120) completed a category learning task where optimal performance could be achieved by mapping the features of one spatially-defined dimension to the available category labels. Tests of feature memory and category generalization followed. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three instruction conditions: (1) a baseline condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was cued and the later memory test was undisclosed, (2) a rule-uncertainty condition in which the goal-relevant dimension was not cued, and (3) a memory-goal condition in which participants were informed of the upcoming memory tests. Attentional breadth during categorization, as measured by eye-tracking, predicted both subsequent memory for goal-irrelevant features and successful category generalization. Compared to baseline, early uncertainty about which dimensions were relevant to categorization significantly increased attentional breadth and memory test performance. No meaningful differences were observed between baseline and the memory-goal condition. The results suggest that manageable uncertainty can promote broader initial attention and more flexible, generalizable learning, thus overcoming the costs of selective attention.",

          "abstract": "How does personality shape people’s music preferences? The present work contributes to the growing literature addressing this question by investigating individual-difference correlates of enjoyment of death metal music. We focus on four traits—schizotypy, masculinity, need to belong (NTB), and need for uniqueness (NFU). Across two studies, participants completed personality measures, listened to a clip from a representative death metal song, and answered questions regarding their enjoyment of death metal. To assess a theorized causal mechanism, namely that a need for psychological security may motivate liking death metal among those high in our variables of interest, existential concerns were heightened via a Mortality Salience (MS) induction. MS-priming did not increase enjoyment of death metal in either study. Enjoyment of death metal was associated with higher levels of schizotypy and masculinity in both studies. Mediation analysis of both studies also revealed an indirect effect of NFU on enjoyment of death metal through schizotypy. These results suggest that, of the variables examined, schizotypy is the most robust predictor for enjoying death metal. Although enjoyment of death metal may be related to psychological defense, our findings indicate that this relationship is likely more complex than can be captured using traditional priming manipulations.",

Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

          "abstract": "Conduct disorder (CD) and psychopathy are characterised by antisocial behaviour and sometimes limited prosocial emotions. Understanding violence and aggression in these disorders depends on unravelling the mechanisms behind how and when these individuals make decisions that help or harm others. New advances in computational modelling of behaviour and computational psychiatry promise to provide such mechanistic insights into how, when, and why people choose antisocial and prosocial actions. However, studies employing such computational approaches to understand antisocial disorders have only recently begun to emerge, particularly compared to studies on internalising disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this systematic review, we followed PRISMA guidelines to identify and synthesise 19 studies that applied computational approaches to investigate social decision-making in CD, psychopathy, and subclinical psychopathic traits. Across these studies, we identified models based on reinforcement learning, drift–diffusion, and social valuation that showed that antisocial behaviours are linked to altered learning about others’ outcomes, reduced sensitivity to guilt and inequity, and atypical value integration when prosocial actions involve personal cost. Converging evidence across adolescent and adult samples highlights how computational models can uncover distinct cognitive and affective mechanisms that traditional behavioural analyses overlook. This synthesis therefore underscores the potential of computational psychiatry to reveal the mechanisms underlying antisocial behaviour and to inform an integrated computational framework of social decision-making in antisocial disorders.",

The effect music has on memory has been studied quite thoroughly for a couple of decades, and yet still the effect it has on long-term memory performance remains ambiguous. Numerous studies have concluded—in contradiction with each other—that music can improve, hinder, or have no effect on memory performance. Despite these ambiguous results on memory, music has been shown to improve and enhance other cognitive functions like concentration and focus.\nSeparating the encoding and retrieval processes of long-term memory can help interpret the past mixed results in this particular research area. To this end, we compared the effects of background music on the encoding and retrieval processes of memory, something previous studies have not investigated. Four groups of college students under varying listening conditions were instructed to memorize a fifteen word list and were then asked to recall that very same list to the best of their ability two days later. We found that music, as opposed to noise, had a negative effect on performance when listened to at both the encoding and retrieval stages. No significance was found during the mixed music and noise conditions during encoding and retrieval. We discuss possible reasons such as individual musical preference, selection of music, working memory performance, and more for these unclear findings.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, grass-roots Big Team Science (BTS) organizations – self-organized groups of researchers working together towards a common goal – have transformed research in the social sciences by enabling unprecedented collaboration, sample diversity, and methodological rigor. Yet as individual networks have multiplied, BTS faces a fundamental challenge: the rapid scaling of large-scale collaborative research has outpaced systematic understanding of what makes it effective. This knowledge gap results in networks reinventing approaches rather than building systematically on collective experience. Here, we introduce the concept of a network-of-networks: a coordinated ecosystem approach that connects existing BTS initiatives and community partners to develop and share knowledge, infrastructure, and inclusive practices. We use the CONNECT (Coordinated Network of Networks for Enhancing Collaborative Teams) partnership as an exemplar of this next phase of collaborative science, which integrates metascientific inquiry with participatory action research to improve workflows, co-develop scalable tools, and promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). By applying systematic, evidence-based approaches to collaborative practices themselves, this meta-collaborative approach moves BTS from trial-and-error toward systematic understanding of effective collaboration, laying the groundwork for a more reproducible, inclusive, and sustainable global research ecosystem.",

A second aim was to examine cross-cultural similarities and differences in these networks over time, providing empirical foundations for culturally tailored grief interventions.\nMethods\nThe present study applied contemporaneous and cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) analyses to one-year longitudinal data from Chinese (N = 286) and U.S. (N = 267) community samples to examine the dynamic associations of Prolonged Grief (PG) symptoms. \nResults\nContemporaneous network analyses revealed that disbelief about the death demonstrated high centrality across both cultural groups and time points. No significant differences were found in the network structure and global strength between the two time points in either sample. Results from CLPNs showed that emotional pain exhibited strong and consistent influence (i.e., high out-prediction) across cultures. In the Chinese sample, identity disruption emerged as a culturally specific driving symptom, while in the U.S. sample, reintegration-related symptoms (i.e., difficulty reintegrating new life and preoccupation) demonstrated greater predictive influence. Additionally, loneliness showed high cross-cultural predictability over time (i.e., high in-prediction). \nConclusions\nThese findings provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of PG symptoms and suggest a two-step, culturally responsive care pathway, with early emotion regulation strategies plus culturally tuned identity  or reintegration focused approaches.

          "abstract": "Uncomfortable visual environments that contain bright colors and striped patterns can induce illusions, headaches, and seizures. However, there is debate surrounding the effects of these environments on visual processing and the individual differences in these effects. We used chromatic grating patterns that differed in their color difference (e.g., red/blue compared to pink/purple) to examine their effects on reading speed – a visually demanding task. 112 participants took part, including 25 migraine and 37 headache-free individuals. Reading speed was slower when reading stripy compared to less-stripy text and there was a small non-linear effect of color on reading speed. Individuals with migraine tended to read slower compared to headache-free individuals. We conclude that stripy text negatively affects processing, but color presented in the periphery may not be noxious enough to disrupt processing. The slower reading in migraine highlights the visual demands involved in reading, supporting the need for visually comfortable text.",

          "abstract": "Polarized democracies reveal how collective emotion and cognitive resistance shape human judgment of truth. Using authentic political posts from Taiwan’s two major parties, we manipulated prebunking, information type, and consensus valence. A brief inoculation increased skepticism toward misinformation without reducing trust in accurate content. Negative emotional consensus sharply undermined the credibility of true information, while positive consensus showed little corrective power. Cognitive and affective evaluations were tightly coupled, forming a compact internal signal that reliably distinguished truth from falsehood. These findings uncover a fundamental mechanism linking shared emotion to truth evaluation, illuminating how targeted cognitive resistance can sustain trust under polarization.",

          "abstract": "Motor signs have been central to descriptions of melancholia since antiquity, yet their significance and presumed causes have varied considerably across history. Until today and despite their robust link with worse outcomes, the origin of motor signs in mood disorders is not well understood. This may be due to a lack of clinical awareness, heterogenous terminology and divergent assessment of motor signs in psychiatric and neurological research. In this paper, we revisit historical accounts of motor signs in melancholia, tracing their evolution from classical antiquity to the mid-20th century. Using a semi-systematic review of historical and clinical literature in four languages, we uncover ancient descriptions of motor retardation and agitation, initially framed within humoral and religious paradigms. From the 16th century onward, motor signs were increasingly interpreted as manifestations of problems in volition, affect and cognition caused by a nervous system dysfunction. By the 19th century, motor disturbance had become a defining feature of melancholia, giving rise to subtypes classifications that shaped early psychiatric nosology. Post–World War II developments introduced objective motor assessments and rating scales, yet conceptual disagreements persist regarding their definition, neuroanatomical correlates and attribution to affective, cognitive and motivational processes. We argue that historical perspectives offer valuable context for interpreting motor signs in contemporary neurobiological research. To advance the field, we propose a unified, non-interpretive motor vocabulary and advocate for the combined use of observer-rated and instrumented assessments.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). Therefore, we first constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. In a second step, we used Ant Colony Optimization to compile two parallel 30-item short forms, optimized for reliability and item difficulty and discrimination. The resulting tests assessed vocabulary unidimensionally and reliably, covered a large ability range, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. We provide a Shiny app for the calculation of standard values based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 57% of the variance in item difficulties could be explained by word frequency and word length, which may be particularly useful for streamlining the future development of vocabulary tests.",

          "abstract": "Research on augmented judgment and decision-making has largely contrasted human and algorithmic sources of judgment. Accordingly, Logg’s (2022) “Theory of Machine” is a conceptual framework for describing and analyzing people’s lay theories about how human and algorithmic judgment differ. Indeed, people often treat humans and algorithms as different kinds, that is, functionally distinct ontological entities. Therefore, I propose to complement the predominant human-centric lens on algorithmic judgment with an explicit algorithm-centric one, focusing on people’s lay theories about how different algorithms differ. Put differently, the core psychological claim of Theory of Machine 2.0 is that lay perceivers also differentiate among various AI systems. The first main contribution is the synthesis of capability contrasts across AI systems. People’s perceptions of these contrasts may be formed and shaped by personal experience and media exposure. Most importantly, their expectations and beliefs are supposed to consequentially guide their downstream user behavior—such as system trust, algorithmic advice weighting, and accountability attribution. The second main contribution is the proposal of testable research questions and designs for more algorithm-centric future research on people’s augmented judgment and decision-making. The theoretical perspective proposed in this article clarifies how people form and use lay theories about different AI systems and offers practical levers for the design, deployment, and evaluation of algorithmic decision-support systems.",

Building on prior frameworks, we integrated diverse behavioral and demographic indicators, including family structure, marriage stability, religiosity, transportation practices, and self-employment. While overall patterns broadly aligned with historical findings, notable shifts emerged, suggesting sociocultural changes over the past two decades reshaped the relative expression of collectivism across states. At the state level, higher collectivism scores were associated with lower rates of marijuana use, binge drinking, and depression, and with greater cultural tightness, consistent with country-level findings in existing literature. These findings underscore the persistence, evolution, and psychological correlates of cultural patterns within the U.S. and provide a contemporary spatial tool for examining how regional cultural differences relate to psychological outcomes.",

This paper introduces the Machine-Integrated Relational Adaptation (MIRA) model, a transdisciplinary, middle-range theoretical framework that provides a foundational account of when, how, and why AI functions as a relational entity in human ecosystems. MIRA distinguishes two crucial roles of AI: relational partner (direct interaction companion) and relational mediator (shaping human-to-human communication). Synthesizing psychosocial theories of human relationships, interpersonal communication theory, psycholinguistics, and human–computer interaction, MIRA structures AI's relational impact within antecedents, processes, moderators, and outcomes. Central to MIRA are four principles describing how AI fosters social adaptation: linguistic reciprocity, psychological proximity, interpersonal trust, and relational substitution versus enhancement. These illuminate how adaptive AI language and behavior can elicit emotional investment, simulate mutual understanding, or even supplant human interaction. MIRA integrates established theories — attachment theory, social exchange theory, and epistemic trust frameworks — and proposes a research agenda that bridges foundational psychology with emerging sociotechnical contexts. Rather than offering a deterministic view, MIRA provides a generative, testable structure for investigating the evolving role of AI in relational life and guiding future human–AI connection research.",

          "abstract": "Publication bias is the prioritized and selective reporting of scientifically significant results and often stems from the assumption that statistically significant research findings are rated as more important, credible, valuable, and publishable than nonsignificant or null findings. Previous work shows that this assumption makes researchers less likely to publish nonsignificant or null findings, a phenomenon termed file drawer bias. While prior research investigated the file drawer bias primarily at the study level (e.g., what share of studies has been published and which has not), we examine the prevalence of unpublished research on both the study and the hypothesis level (e.g. which hypotheses are published and which remain unpublished). We did so by comparing the submissions of 178 studies conducted in two probability-based German panel infrastructures (SOEP-IS and GESIS Panel) with their subsequent publications. We found substantial evidence for publication bias: after an average of more than six years of data availability, 43.8% of studies remained unpublished, 44.4% published at least one peer-reviewed article, and 11.8% published gray literature exclusively. Less than one third of submitted hypotheses were published, while the vast majority of published studies with hypotheses (&gt;95%) included newly added (ad-hoc) hypotheses, and more than half of these studies published exclusively ad-hoc hypotheses. Taken together, over 80% of all published hypotheses were ad-hoc, and over 70% of hypotheses were supported. These findings highlight persistent incentives toward selective reporting and ad-hoc hypothesis formulation (potential HARKing). Our results raise concerns about ongoing publication bias in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",

          "abstract": "We investigated whether gender-based societal beliefs shape the way individuals gather information and draw conclusions—an effect that may support the persistence of gender stereotypes. Three pre-registered experiments (N = 210) used a dynamic sampling paradigm, in which participants estimated the gender distribution of the workforce of fictitious companies representing highly gendered professions (e.g., mechanic, hairdresser). Participants could learn about the workforce of each company by viewing up to ten pictures of its employees, in which the gender of the first two faces either confirmed, disconfirmed, or remained neutral with regard to societal expectations about the profession. When initial evidence matched (vs. mismatched) expectations, participants sampled fewer faces. And when participants did view additional faces in belief-confirming sequences, these additional faces also skewed towards the gendered expectations, suggesting that participants actively employed strategies leading to selective exposure. Furthermore, both gender-based beliefs and newly sampled information influenced estimates of the workforce gender distributions, with larger effects of newly sampled evidence as the participant viewed more faces. Thus, pre-existing gendered beliefs shaped information sampling and social judgements. Furthermore, early exposure to belief-disconfirming information elicited more extensive and less biased information search. More extensive information search, in return, led to less biased social judgements. This research shows that when social expectations are quickly confirmed, people tend to not look any further, whereas initial belief-challenging information elicits more extensive exploration and less biased conclusions.",

Participants were classified as non-gamers (N = 60,540; 82.53%), occasional gamers (N = 10,961; 14.94%), and frequent gamers (N = 1,858; 2.53%), according to their computer gaming patterns reported in 2006-2010. \n\nResults \nGroup comparison results suggested mostly negligible differences between gamers and non-gamers in the domains of demographics (e.g., age, sex), active/passive lifestyle (e.g., physical activity), social engagement (e.g., friends/family visits), sleep patterns (e.g., chronotype, insomnia), physical health (e.g., vision, cardiovascular health), and psychological well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, depressed mood). Small effects of group differences were found in moderate exercise, TV watching, body mass index, body fat percentage and self-reported health. \n\nConclusion \nThese findings will help unveil the unique profile (or lack thereof) of older gamers versus non-gamers and provide insights for gerontologists and practitioners in the gaming industry.",

A total of 232 caregivers (79 males, 153 females) completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Prosocial Tendencies Measure, Social Support Rating Scale, and Event-Related Rumination Inventory. Regression and mediation analyses showed that prosocial behavior was positively related to PTG. Both social support and deliberate rumination significantly mediated this relationship in parallel. These findings suggest that prosocial behaviors have a positive effect on PTG among caregivers for seriously ill patients.

We examined how both trait- and state-level reading enjoyment shape engagement and eye movements during naturalistic reading. Seventy-six adults read 40 book synopses, rated their enjoyment, answered comprehension questions, and decided whether to wait to view the book cover, while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-effects models disaggregated between-participant (trait) from within-participant (state) enjoyment. Both levels predicted greater willingness to wait and higher comprehension. Trait enjoyment was associated with longer passage and word reading times. State enjoyment was linked to longer passage times, increased word skipping, faster early word processing, and increased regressions, suggesting more efficient first-pass reading accompanied by increased rereading. These findings suggest that momentary fluctuations in intrinsic motivation dynamically shape reading strategies, revealing a close link between perceived value and the allocation of cognitive resources during text processing.",

However, depression is often understood through a nomothetic lens, meaning that there is a tendency to measure general patterns of symptoms. This overgeneralisation largely ignores the individual, lived experiences of depressed youth. To get a better understanding of what adolescents themselves find important in their experiences with depression and psychotherapy, we conducted a mixed-methods study into their perspectives.\nMethods: Participants were 21 young adults (M = 20.5, SD = 1.3) in university who had attended some form of psychotherapy in the past 2 years. The participants first performed a statement-sorting task and then afterwards an interview was conducted. The descriptive statistics were then followed up by a thematic analysis of the interview content.\nResults: Descriptives of the statement ratings indicated that there is a high variability in how the statements were rated. Four themes were generated that informed this heterogeneity in prioritisation: 1) the navigation of core problems versus “minor” problems in therapy, 2) the effect of trust in the therapist on the course of therapy, 3) the boundary between one’s identity and one’s mental health concerns, and 4) how individuals choose to accept social support. \nConclusion: This study underscores the variety of experiences adolescents can prioritise in psychotherapy. The post-sorting task interviews helped contextualise these experiences. This mixed-methods approach provides an understanding of adolescent depression from the perspectives of adolescents themselves, and can thus inform idiographic assessment of depression.",

Although recent research has begun to examine climate anxiety, little is known about the situations where it is experienced or situational factors that predict it. To help understand how climate anxiety is experienced in UK residents, we developed and evaluated a situated psychometric instrument for assessing climate anxiety in 31 relevant situations (e.g., hearing about climate catastrophes on the news). Of interest was how climate anxiety is experienced in the UK as largely the anticipation of climate disaster and environmental pollution, rather than as actually experienced climate disaster, as in it is experienced by populations in more vulnerable countries where significant climate disaster has occurred. In an online study (N = 303 UK residents), we investigated how much climate anxiety individuals experienced in each situation, along with how much they experienced 13 factors that potentially influence climate anxiety (e.g., expectation violation, threat, coping). An individual measure of climate anxiety averaged across situations exhibited high reliability, construct validity, and content validity. Large differences in climate anxiety were observed between situations, along with a large individual by situation interaction. In linear regressions for individual participants, the 13 factors tended to correlate with climate anxiety as predicted, explaining a median 75% of climate anxiety variance. By identifying factors that predict climate anxiety for individuals, our approach provides detailed understanding of climate anxiety in each individual across situations. These predictive profiles could support screening for climate anxiety, identifying situations where it occurs, and designing individualised support.",

In this study, we thus aimed to test (1) whether affective inertia differs within-day and overnight and (2) whether within-day and overnight inertia are differentially associated with psychological functioning (e.g., personality, perseverative thoughts, stress). We operationalized within-day inertia as the autoregression of affect from one timepoint to the next during the same day and overnight inertia as the autoregression of affect from the previous night to the next morning. We used data from the ESCAPE project including 254 ethnically and economically diverse participants (25–65 years) who participated in up to three 14-day measurement bursts with five daily beeps. We found significant within-day and overnight affective inertia in positive and negative affect. Overnight inertia substantially exceeded within-day inertia that would be expected for the longer overnight interval, indicating affective inertia differs within-day and overnight. This research highlights the importance to disentangle within-day and overnight intervals when studying affective inertia.",

Using three waves of data from a nationally representative UK household panel study (N=18,807), we applied longitudinal multilevel models to examine how individual- and objective area-level indicators jointly predict cross-ethnic friendships. At the individual-level, higher openness and agreeableness, stronger neighbourhood belonging, and a left-leaning political orientation were associated with more cross-ethnic friendships. At the contextual-level, intergroup friendships were more common in neighbourhoods with more structural opportunity for contact (i.e. areas with a lower proportion of same-ethnic residents), and in areas with higher support for egalitarian policies (as indicated by local voting patterns). Crucially, cross-level interactions highlighted the interplay of person and place: neighbourhood diversity fostered more cross-ethnic friendships especially among those with strong neighbourhood belonging, suggesting that people who feel embedded in their community are more likely to turn diverse surroundings into meaningful intergroup ties. Differences between ethnic majority and minority groups also emerged. For example, higher area-level racial hate-crime incidence predicted more intergroup friendships among majority members, suggesting a possible repair response, but had no effect for minority members. Findings underscore multilevel and group-specific pathways to sustained intergroup friendships.",

          "abstract": "The non-human primate (NHP) brain, particularly that of the macaque monkey, provides a powerful model for investigating the neural basis of conscious perception due to its close homology with the human cortex. Research using paradigms such as binocular rivalry and binocular flash suppression has revealed that neuronal populations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) explicitly encode consciously perceived visual information—including direction of motion, faces, and complex patterns—even in the absence of behavioral reports. Using no-report and rapid serial visual presentation paradigms, these studies demonstrate that prefrontal representations persist when post-perceptual processing and motor reports are absent or minimized, suggesting that PFC activity reflects genuine correlates of conscious experience. Moreover, the PFC encodes both concrete sensory details and abstract, hierarchical information about visual sequences, such as global regularities and prediction errors, indicating an integrative representational architecture. These findings support theoretical models, including the Global Neuronal Workspace and Higher-Order Thought theories, which propose an active role of the PFC in broadcasting or representing conscious contents, while challenging accounts that view it as merely post-perceptual or epiphenomenal. Overall, convergent electrophysiological evidence highlights the PFC as a central node in the cortical network supporting subjective awareness, capable of representing both the content and structure of conscious experience.",

          "authors": "Conor Thornberry; José Manuel Cimadevilla; Sean Commins",
          "abstract": "The original Morris water maze (Morris, 1981) has been coined the “gold standard” task for examining spatial navigation in animals. The general procedure of the maze involves a circular pool filled approximately half-way with water. An animal is then tasked with locating and recalling the position of a hidden “platform”, which is submerged below the water surface in a fixed location. The platform has minimal visual presence in the pool, meaning the location of the platform must be found, learned and recalled from memory. Recently, the task has been translated using virtual reality for use with humans (virtual water task), to investigate similar cognitive mechanisms examined using the animal version of the task. However, there are multiple different variations of the virtual water task scattered across the human literature. These versions vary in both environmental design (e.g., different shaped arenas or platform sizes) and testing procedures (e.g., 1 minute trial times or no inter-trial intervals), which all influence a person’s ability to perform the task. Whilst the virtual version of this task possesses the same potential to become the “gold standard” for examining spatial cognition in humans, comparing and replicating results across research labs has shown to be incredibly difficult due the lack of standardised procedures and protocols. In this paper we present protocols to help with the standardisation of this task. We recommend practices and procedures for researching specific cognitive processes in humans, as well as reporting guidelines, recommended analyses and expected results.",

We addressed a prevailing psychological motivator of youth non-voting: a perception of political powerlessness. We experimentally evaluated an empathetic refutation approach that explained how electoral non-participation perpetuates political powerlessness while affirming young people’s psychological reasons for not voting.\nMethod: We conducted two experiments with British 18-29-year-old participants who had not voted in the 2024 UK General Election (total n = 935) to test whether reading a conversation that explained the vicious cycle of non-participation using an empathetic refutation (both experiments) or an assertive structure (Experiment 2) increased participants’ voting intentions relative to a control condition featuring an unrelated conversation.\nResults: Both types of explanations significantly increased participants’ voting intention compared to the control. Participants found the empathetic refutation approach to be most acknowledging of the non-voter’s perspective, but reported no significant differences in how compelling they found the explanations or their levels of trust and openness to the information presented.\nConclusions: Explaining the vicious cycle of non-participation could help to improve young people’s willingness to participate in the electoral process.\nKeywords: democracy; voting; trust; empathy; attitude roots; affirmation; youth vote",

          "abstract": "Children experience large differences in language learning opportunities during the early years. These differences include their mothers’ vocabulary sophistication, which may serve as a pathway for the transmission of educational attainment across generations. However, associations between vocabulary sophistication and education may be confounded by genetic factors that mothers and children share. In the E-Risk study—a longitudinal, nationally representative cohort of 1,116 British families, mothers’ naturalistic speech was recorded when their children when they were 5 years old. From the transcripts of these recordings, we derived mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Mothers’ educational attainment at children’s age 5 years significantly predicted children’s educational attainment at age 18 years (β = .33, 95% CI [.280, .371]), and 16% of this association could be attributed to mothers’ vocabulary sophistication. Using path models with polygenic scores, we discerned genetic transmission effects (i.e., shared genetics) from environmentally mediated influences. We found that mothers’ vocabulary sophistication accounted for approximately 2% of the environmentally mediated influence on children’s educational attainment. The findings support that the ‘word gap’—differences in children’s language learning opportunities—likely plays a small causal role in the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment. Our results highlight the importance of early language environments and may inform strategies aimed at reducing the impact of family background on educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "From books of secrets to secret societies, it appears that groups have found success in publicizing the existence of secrets while concealing their content, possibly in an attempt to increase the perceived importance of the secret information and trigger curiosity in their audience. This paper explores why secrets, despite being often associated with shameful personal stories, are so often publicly advertised, in three pre-registered experiments (US participants, N = 1970). In study 1, participants judged that publicly acknowledged secrets were less likely to harm the secret-keeper’s reputation than privately kept ones, suggesting that publicly advertising secrets might reduce the harm made to one’s reputation. In studies 2 and 3, we directly tested whether secrecy might impact curiosity. We could not find significant evidence that our secrecy manipulations increased curiosity between conditions, both in interpersonal settings or when evaluating books. Instead, exploratory mediation analyses suggest that secrecy might have a direct negative effect on curiosity in interpersonal contexts, even though we found robust positive relationships between the costs secret-keepers invested in keeping their secrets, the perceived importance of the concealed information, and participants’ curiosity. These findings suggest that advertising secrets might not have consistent effects on an audience’s curiosity.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous pupil fluctuations (SPFs) during rest provide a non-invasive, low-cost index of central arousal dynamics, independent of cognitive task demands. These features position SPFs as promising markers for baseline neurophysiological activity in both basic and translational research.\nThis review synthesizes current evidence on the resting-state pupil-brain system, focusing on its core components: central neuromodulatory circuits and large-scale cortical networks. We first examine the relationship between SPFs and distributed elements of the ascending arousal system, including noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic nuclei. We then detail SPF coupling with intrinsic functional networks - default mode, salience, and sensorimotor systems - highlighting their role in mediating transitions between internally and externally oriented brain states. Finally, we discuss the spectral and directional properties of pupil-brain interactions, emphasizing analytical approaches suited for assessing causality and outlining implications for clinical and translational applications.\nConverging evidence from animal and human neuroimaging studies reveals robust spatiotemporal and spectral coupling between SPFs and neural activity across micro- and macro-scales. These findings support a systems-level framework in which SPFs serve as integrative markers linking subcortical neuromodulation with large-scale cortical dynamics.\nWe conclude that SPFs offer a sensitive window into arousal regulation and body-brain integration, with potential utility as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions and altered states of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "Digital disconnection is defined as setting deliberate limits to connectivity to enhance (digital) well-being. Yet, for some people, disconnecting from their devices may prove more difficult than for others. One important but understudied factor that may help explain such differences is how habitually people use their smartphones. Drawing on cross-sectional survey data from 944 Belgian adults (50.40% female, Mage = 42.28, SDage = 13.63), we therefore investigated how individual differences in habitual smartphone use are associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection and disconnection frequency, as well as how these variables (partly) explain how habitual smartphone use relates to well-being. Structural equation modeling revealed that habitual smartphone use was indeed positively associated with perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = 0.40, p &lt; .001), which, in turn, was negatively associated with disconnection frequency (β = -0.16, p &lt; .001). Moreover, perceived difficulty with disconnection showed a negative association with well-being (β = -0.24, p = &lt; .001), while disconnection frequency showed a positive association with well-being (β = 0.10, p = .001). The analyses also revealed a significant indirect effect from habitual smartphone use to well-being, with the strongest pathway via perceived difficulty with disconnection (β = -0.10, p &lt; .001). These findings highlight the need to further investigate the role of habitual smartphone use in shaping how people experience and manage digital disconnection, as well as its implications for well-being.",

Previous studies focused on the linguistically expressible aspects of text comprehension. In this study, we propose a new hypothesis, the purification comprehension hypothesis, that seeks to explain how a reader constructs indescribable and coherent comprehension using quantum probability theory. This hypothesis regards the reading process as purification, in which the reader's initial interpretation state is mixed, and the reader incorporates external systems, such as the interpretation of other parts of the text or prior knowledge, to purify their state. Therefore, the dimensionality of the state increases and von Neumann entropy decreases through purification. We also highlight two types of reading based on this hypothesis: purification and deterministic. Our model contributes to studies on reading by bridging humanities and scientific studies, provides implications for cognition models that aim to minimize Shannon entropy, and has the potential to apply cognition related to other modalities and media, such as music and art.",

          "abstract": "Background: Supporting lasting learning is a central goal in education, particularly in schools where long-term retention is crucial for students' academic success. Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

A prominent theme was that of control: Participants want to maintain some sense of autonomy. This factor has not (yet) been included in current technology acceptance models but may be an influential factor in the adoption and acceptance of technology by the elderly. Additionally, participants weighed the impact on their community (rather than themselves) heavily, accepting that adoption of assistive technology will greatly support their family, caregivers and/or the healthcare sector.

Gaze behaviour plays a critical role during this transition, as effective information processing is essential for safely resuming manual control. Directional Takeover Requests (TORs) have been proposed to guide drivers’ attention towards safety-critical areas, thereby reducing takeover time and improving takeover quality. However, existing research on the effects of directional TORs on gaze behaviour has found inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify effects of directional TORs on drivers’ gaze behaviour compared to non-directional TORs during transitions of control. Meta-analyses revealed that incorporating directionality into the visual interface increased both the number and duration of fixations on the TOR display. Directional TORs effectively guided drivers’ visual attention towards hazards and reduced cognitive demands, although their effects on mirror-checking and road fixations varied with interface modality and location.",

          "abstract": "Effective instruction should not only enhance immediate performance but also prepare learners to succeed when learning independently in novel situations (new learning). This study examined which timing and frequency strategies of instruction most effectively foster new learning. We compared six strategies, inspired by theories of motivation (e.g., self-determination theory) and cognition (e.g., testing effect), with two control conditions (no-instruction and full-instruction). Across three experiments (total N = 1,522), participants performed a category learning task. They first received instruction through feature highlighting, whose timing and frequency varied across conditions. Subsequently, their performance was assessed in an independent session where they learned new categories without instruction. An adaptive strategy that tailored instruction to learner performance significantly outperformed the control conditions in initial experiments (Experiments 1 and 2). However, this effect was not observed in a comprehensive experiment (Experiment 3), suggesting that adaptivity itself may not have been the beneficial factor. Instead, an overall examination suggested that the beneficial effects were attributable to two underlying instructional patterns shared by the conditions that outperformed the control conditions: (1) providing instruction in successive sequences, and (2) interspersing tests without instruction by restricting the frequency of instruction. Instructional strategies with these two patterns yielded a significant advantage over the control conditions for independently discovering correct knowledge in novel situations, although they did not reliably improve generalization of that knowledge to other items. This integration of instructional patterns appears to foster new learning by balancing the useful information from instruction with the desirable difficulty of testing.",

          "abstract": "Deficits in joint attention are well documented as hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many different measures have been used to study autistic individuals within a wide range of age groups, meaning that we do not have a clear picture of how joint attention was assessed in past studies. In this systematic review, we aim to provide a clearer picture of joint attention assessment methods used with autistic individuals, identify gaps in measurement, and make recommendations for future research.\nWe searched PubMed, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO, APA PsycARTICLES), Scopus, Ovid, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. A total of 129 studies involving 5536 autistic individuals were retrieved for the period 1989-2024. \nOut of 129 studies reviewed, 57 compared the joint attention of autistic (N=1727) and non-autistic (N=2094) individuals. In 51 of these studies, autistic individuals performed significantly lower on the joint attention assessments, highlighting significant challenges in maintaining joint attention. Measures of joint attention included eye-tracking (18 studies), standardized scales and questionnaires (57 studies), and play- or activities-based measures (63 studies). \nEye-tracking has been used mainly in comparison studies with autistic children over five years old, whereas intervention studies have primarily assessed younger autistic children under five years old using standardized tools and play- or activity-based measures. These studies also differed considerably in the tasks employed, the operational definitions of joint attention, and the ways in which joint attention skills were measured. The wide variation in methods makes it difficult to compare outcomes across studies. Our review therefore highlights the need for the development of comprehensive standardized measures that are sensitive to developmental variations in joint attention, enabling more reliable cross-study comparisons and ultimately supporting more accurate diagnosis and tailored interventions for autistic individuals. Moreover, we recommend the establishment of clear guidelines for designing eye-tracking tasks and play- or activity-based procedures for assessing the joint attention of autistic individuals, as well as the development of specific joint attention scales for consistent use in both research and clinical contexts.",

Here, we show that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) exhibit similar sensitivities to framing manipulations,\nincluding the magnitude, sign, and hidden-zero effects. Unlike humans, LLMs\ndiscount delayed rewards exponentially rather than hyperbolically and do not\nexhibit a decimal effect, suggesting their behavior does not simply reflect\nknowledge of published decision-making phenomena learned during training.\nAnalysis of LLM embedding spaces, which encode semantic knowledge,\nrevealed that large monetary amounts are represented more closely to words\nrelated to delay and the future. This suggests that framing manipulations bias\nLLM choices through semantic proximity to words linked to the present or future.\nTogether, these results introduce a conceptual framework whereby linguistic\nstructure shapes decisions, suggesting that human decision-making biases may\nemerge, in part, from the organization of choice options in semantic space.",

Recent research suggests that personality disorders, especially OCPD, might not be as stable as once thought. The current study investigates the longitudinal stability of OCPD diagnosis and individual symptom criteria in individuals with OCD. Methods: 320 participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD were included in the study, with diagnostic assessments conducted annually for seven years. Logistic mixed-effects models were conducted to examine the relationship between time and OCPD diagnosis ratings, as well as the relationship between time and each OCPD symptom criterion over seven years. Results: In individuals with OCD, time was a significant predictor of OCPD diagnosis which indicated diagnostic instability, with the likelihood of OCPD diagnosis decreasing over time. Three individual criteria (detail-oriented, inflexible, overconscientious, and scrupulous, and miserly spending style) were shown to be stable while the other five (perfectionism, reluctance to delegate, rigidity and stubbornness, excessive work devotion, and inability to discard) were unstable. Conclusion: OCPD diagnosis ratings decreased over time in individuals with OCD and consists of a mix of enduring and episodic symptom criteria. It suggests the need for a refinement of OCPD diagnostic criteria and future research on symptom stability of OCPD across different diagnostic groups.",

          "authors": "Ellis Cain; Elizabeth Geballe; Tyler Marghetis",
          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "authors": "Stephen Andrew Waller-DeLaRosa",
          "abstract": "While models of ADHD often focus on linear deficits in executive functions, they can fail to capture the looping, recursive nature of the lived cognitive experience. This paper introduces the Recursive Temporal Appraisal Loop (RTAL), a model that reframes ADHD cognition as operating on a feedback-first architecture. It is posited that before feedforward action is possible, the system must first complete a synthesis of relevant material, a sequence termed pre-feedforward calibration. The Temporal Double Bind (TDB) is formalized as the initiating condition for RTAL engagement—conflicting cross-timescale imperatives without an operative metarule. The RTAL is treated as a transactional process, where internal appraisals are continuously shaped by environmental feedback. The model shows how cognitive-load composition steers the loop toward either productive Repetition or pathological Recollection. RTALs become pathological when working memory saturation and a weak temporal signal create spiral amplification. Predictions are outlined that link load composition and chronotype to loop outcomes, plus operational metrics enabling direct empirical tests. This model explains why simple choices can feel overwhelming and why effective interventions must support this recursive process rather than attempting to override the architecture.",

          "abstract": "While time flows uniformly, many factors can influence how experiences become organized in memory. The current study examined how causality and agency impact the temporal structure of memory for a virtual escape room game played with friends. We found that after controlling for veridical temporal distance, causally-related events were remembered as closer in time than unrelated events. This effect grew stronger after a consolidation period, with causally-connected memories showing greater temporal integration than memories that merely shared contextual overlap. Notably, within causally-related events, temporal memory was superior for events where game clues were found than when they were used to resolve ambiguity. We also demonstrated that participants who made greater in-game contributions to puzzle-solving showed better temporal memory compared to participants who contributed less. High contributors also showed increased temporal integration between contextually-related events in particular. Together, these findings highlight the role of causal connections in driving memory integration and extend prior work on agency and memory to real-world experiences.",

          "abstract": "Cross-cultural research led by Ozaki et al. (2024) has revealed that songs exhibit higher pitch, lower tempo, and more stable pitches than speech. However, this research relied on solo recordings, while most singing and speaking occurs in group contexts. The present study examined the acoustic features of speech and songs among Mandarin speakers in group settings. We addressed two questions: 1 [confirmatory]) Do singing and conversation in group contexts show similar acoustic patterns to those reported by Ozaki et al. (2024)? 2 [exploratory]) Does musicianship influence the acoustic differences between speech and song? Three groups of native Mandarin speakers (n = 20) in Auckland participated in the singing and conversation tasks (both of which involved taking turns alternating singing/speaking). We analyzed three acoustic features (pitch height, temporal rate, pitch stability) to test the confirmatory question and examined correlations between musicianship and effect sizes for the exploratory question. Our confirmatory analyses replicated and extended the findings of Ozaki et al. (2024), showing that singing exhibited significantly higher pitch (D = 1.21), slower tempo (D = 2.07), and more stable pitch (D = 0.57) than conversation among Mandarin speakers. Exploratory results suggested a trend whereby individuals with higher musicianship tended to produce greater acoustic differentiation between speech and song; additional data are needed to confirm this effect. In future work, our team will integrate data from up to 26 languages/sites included in the Stage 1 Programmatic Registered Report protocol and conduct meta-analyses to provide more comprehensive estimates of cross-cultural relationships between speech and song.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects social interaction, communication and behavioural flexibility. Recent theories grounded in the Bayesian Brain Framework propose that autistic individuals process environmental uncertainty differently, overweighting volatility when updating predictions about the world. However, the robustness of these predictive processing differences and their relevance to core symptoms remains unclear. \nMethods: \nWe attempted to replicate findings from Lawson and colleagues (1), who showed a tendency to overestimate environmental volatility in autistic adults based on belief states extracted using a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter. We extended their paradigm to a domain central to the autistic experience: rather than distinguishing houses from faces, participants detected valence in emotional facial expressions. Preregistered hypotheses were evaluated using Bayesian linear mixed models.\nResults: \nDespite using an identical computational model to extract belief states, we did not find robust differences between autistic and non-autistic adults, though autistic participants showed a non-credible trend towards increased processing of phasic volatility. Largely comparable probabilistic associative learning was also reflected in response times and pupil sizes. \nLimitations: \nWhile participants reacted faster to expected than unexpected trials in the beginning, this effect decreased over the course of the experiment; thus, possibly indicating that the individual blocks of stable cue-outcome associations were too short.\nConclusions:\nThese results challenge the robustness and symptom-specificity of previous reported volatility processing differences in autism, suggesting that altered Bayesian inference may not generalize to socially relevant prediction tasks that involve core autistic difficulties.",

          "authors": "Daisuke Akiba",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper introduces the Verbal-Cognitive Scaffold (VCS) Model, a cognitively inclusive framework which proposes the cognitive architectures underlying computational thinking (CT). Moving beyond monolithic theories of cognition (e.g., executive-function and metacognitive control models), the VCS Model posits inner speech (InSp) as the predominant cognitive pathway supporting CT operations in neurotypical populations. Synthesizing interdisciplinary scholarship across cognitive science, computational theory, neurodiversity research, and others, the framework articulates distinct mechanisms through which InSp supports CT. The model specifies four primary pathways linking InSp to CT components: verbal working memory supporting decomposition, symbolic representation facilitating pattern recognition and abstraction, sequential processing enabling algorithmic thinking, and dialogic self-questioning enhancing debugging processes. Crucially, the model posits these verbally mediated pathways as modal rather than universal. Alt-hough non-verbal architectures are acknowledged as possible alternative routes, their precise mechanisms remain underspecified in existing literature and, therefore, are not the focus of the current theoretical exploration. Given this context, this manuscript focuses on the well-documented verbal support provided by InSp. The VCS Model's theoretical contributions include: (1) specification of nuanced cognitive support systems where distinct InSp functions selectively enable particular CT operations; (2) generation of empirically testable predictions regarding aptitude–pathway interactions in computational training and performance; and (3) compatibility with future empirical efforts to inquire into neurodivergent strategies that may diverge from verbal architectures, while acknowledging that these alternatives remain underexplored. Individual variations in InSp phenomenology are theorized to predict distinctive patterns of CT engagement. This comprehensive framework, thus, elaborates and extends existing verbal mediation theories by specifying how InSp supports and enables CT, while laying the groundwork for possible future inquiry into alternative, non-verbal cognitive pathways.",

          "abstract": "Perceived or actual time limits can negatively affect performance of motor tasks. Based on the integrative framework of stress, attention, and visuomotor performance (IFSAVP), time pressure should affect visuomotor performance outcomes if it prompts, in turn, perceiving demands to exceed resources, a state of threat, and distractibility. We put this framework to a partial test by examining whether subjective distress, a marker of a state of threat, is a mechanism by which time pressure affects performance in two online studies (Ns = 93 and 148; 2022) of adults in the United States. Participants completed a route planning and tracing task in which we manipulated time pressure using a within-subjects urgency messaging manipulation. We measured subjective distress and fine motor behavior indexing information processing eﬀiciency, route eﬀiciency, and accuracy. We partitioned the total of effects of urgency messaging (UM) on performance into indirect and direct pathways and meta-analyzed them. In indirect pathways, UM increased distress which hampered information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency, but not accuracy. In direct pathways, UM increased information processing eﬀiciency and route eﬀiciency and decreased accuracy. The total effect of UM was to increase information processing eﬀiciency but not route eﬀiciency, and decrease accuracy. In sum, consistent with the IFSAVP, perceived time pressure affects visuomotor performance eﬀiciency in part because it elicits subjective distress. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of modeling mechanisms and the utility of assessing two forms of performance eﬀiciency and the effectiveness of fine motor behavior.",

For instance, models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have demonstrated high performance in text-based emotional awareness and adaptability [4]. In visual tasks, while GPT-4 matched human performance levels, GPT-4o rapidly surpassed human norms across diverse datasets [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, these capabilities extend to complex multimodal social cognition, exemplified by Gemini 1.5 Pro, which has exceeded human benchmarks through integrated audiovisual analysis [6].\nEmulating the understanding of emotion and cognition enables AI to exploit a profound vulnerability inherent to the human brain - its constant search for communication partners and sensitivity to agents perceived as having similar thoughts and feelings. Understanding another agent’s mental states and feeling understood by them creates affinity, activating the biological systems underpinning attachment relationships [7]. Until the emergence of AI, this mechanism provided clear selective advantages, enhancing social communication, identity formation, and interpersonal bonding. However, an artificial agent capable of effectively emulating these evolved socioemotional functions now presents a substantial risk.",

          "abstract": "Anonymity is one of the most frequently invoked explanations for online behavior, yet we still do not know what it actually means for users. Existing research often reduces it to a technical non-identifiability that overlooks how it is subjectively experienced. However, it is this perceived anonymity that is likely to drive social and behavioral outcomes. Despite its theoretical importance, perceived anonymity is rarely examined from the users’ perspective. To address this gap, we explore how users understand anonymity in digital environments and what they consider necessary to “feel anonymous”. This qualitative study draws on six focus groups with a total of 21 Czech internet users (aged 18–54; M: 43%, F: 52%, Other: 5%) to examine perceptions of online anonymity. A thematic analysis revealed that participants understood anonymity not only as the absence of names or photos, but also as the lack of characteristics tied to one’s broader physical and mental context, encompassing both how someone lives and how they think. Trust strongly shaped perceptions of anonymity with close others. Anonymity was linked to confidentiality and privacy within trusted circles but became fragile as audiences widened. It was highly context-dependent and influenced by platform design and purpose. Although traditional anonymity (e.g., namelessness or invisibility) has not disappeared, identity-based network users often seek security not through non-identifiability but through confidentiality and privacy, forming a new kind of anonymity that is grounded in the same protective feeling. These insights may inform future research on the diverse effects of anonymity in digital contexts.",

          "abstract": "This manuscript is in review at Human Factors (SAGE Journals). We analyzed the relationship between habitat-impacted mood and overall mood in an isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment. We explored the most relevant habitability factors that impact behavioral health &amp; performance (BHP) outcomes, and how habitability changes from non-ICE to ICE environments. One mitigation strategy for behavioral health risks in long-duration spaceflight is to ensure appropriate design of the habitat. To better understand the relationship between habitat design and BHP outcomes, NASA researchers developed the Subjective Habitability &amp; Acceptability Questionnaire (SHAQ). With data from HERA Campaigns 5 and 6 (n = 32), we compared analogous measures of mood. We explored significant aspects of habitability in each habitat area. All aspects of habitability were examined for differences across non-ICE and ICE environments. Compared to Profile of Mood States, SHAQ appears to be more sensitive to environmental, individual, and temporal differences. Comfort and Convenience significantly and positively predict BHP outcomes in all habitat areas. Most aspects of habitability were rated as inadequate, and significantly lower within ICE than non-ICE conditions. Each habitat area has a different profile of habitability aspects that should be optimized to ensure BHP wellbeing. HERA was rated lower in almost all aspects of habitability when compared to non-ICE habitat environments. Attention should be given to the aspects of habitability that are rated less-than-adequate for future habitat designs. SHAQ can be used to quantify the impact of habitability to BHP outcomes ICE environments, and capture environmental and individual thresholds to inform habitat design.",

          "abstract": "Modern theories conceptualize personality as a dynamic system of interacting psychological states, a perspective that echoes early accounts. These early theorists also emphasized the continual differentiation of personality, viewing ongoing change as intrinsic to the person’s dynamic organization. Yet most empirical models treat the relations among personality components as static over time. To test this assumption, the present study applied kernel-based vector autoregressive models to estimate person-specific contemporaneous and lagged time-varying networks of Big Five facet states using intensive longitudinal data from three undergraduate samples and one community sample (N = 392; 31,564 total surveys). Across samples, 76.8% of contemporaneous and 74.5% of lagged networks exhibited non-stationary dynamics, meaning that the structural relations among facets changed over the two- to three-week sampling period. Network non-stationarity was modestly associated with variability in perceived situational valence (pOsitivity and Negativity) but not with traits, demographics, or well-being measures. Time-varying networks were more predictive than corresponding stationary networks, though only contemporaneous models demonstrated acceptable reliability. These findings support dynamic systems perspectives of personality as an evolving, temporally embedded process, suggesting that short-term differentiation in personality structure represents a meaningful and underrecognized source of psychological variability.",

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

In particular, known semantic associations across items facilitate subsequent retrieval for these items. However, whether distinct forms of semantic relations vary in the influence they exert on memory remains unclear. We took inspiration from the field of concepts and categories and compared two major types of semantic relations: taxonomic (e.g., dog-bird) and thematic (e.g., dog-leash) relations. In Experiment 1, we show that cued recall for word pairs with thematic relations was faster and more accurate, followed by pairs with taxonomic relations and finally unrelated pairs. Based on Experiment 1’s findings, we hypothesized that thematically related words are more quickly and more accurately retrieved because they are more accessible in one’s semantic memory. To test this prediction, we designed a second experiment where participants encoded word pairs of the same relations as in Experiment 1 and completed a forced-choice associative memory test with options sharing different semantic relations to the cue. In addition to corroborating the findings of Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that participants were more prone to incorrectly guessing a thematic alternative. We conclude that thematic relations outperform taxonomic relations in driving memory performance and speculate that this may result from the privileged role of thematic relations in organizing episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Newsweek’s 2010 cover story, “The Creativity Crisis,” documented a measurable decline in creativity based on Torrance Tests data from 272,599 participants. Its reach bypassed conventional gatekeepers; popularity arrived without permission, and they have never forgiven it. A decade later, the Journal of Creative Behavior’s editorial gatekeepers sought to erase both the crisis and the Korean woman scholar who exposed it by publishing Barbot and Said-Metwaly’s (2021) critique of Kim (2011c). Their article alleged—falsely—that Kim omitted effect sizes, age-level analyses, Form B use, and data extraction procedures. It rested on inflated claims, unfounded inferences, denial of empirical findings through distorted graphs, and 44 documented distortions across 31 citations—including fabrication, mischaracterization, and misleading attribution—that few would expect from leading scholars, yet were shielded by the editorial process, recasting the Creativity Crisis as a “myth” and societal harm. The opposite is true: evidence spurred educators and reformers to engage constructively, inspiring curricular innovation, accountability, and momentum to reverse the decline. When the critique appeared online, months before official publication, leading figures publicly celebrated its arrival, declaring the crisis fabricated by Kim and Newsweek, celebrating the silencing of a Korean woman’s voice. This rebuttal corrects the record by addressing age-specific data structures, statistical and graphical misrepresentations, p-value logic, and misuse of cross-temporal meta-analysis and TTCT scores that ignore post-2012 scoring changes. It shows how editorial gatekeeping and racialized exclusion obstruct scientific debate, underscoring the importance of ethical publishing and dissenting voices. Science does not progress by denying crises, but by confronting them.",

          "abstract": "Mafia-type criminal organizations depend on their ability to corrupt local communities and foster a climate of silence and indifference toward their crimes — a code of silence often referred to with the Italian word ‘omertà’. The media and entertainment industry often glorify the figure of the criminal mafia boss, potentially encouraging sympathy for criminal figures. In the present study we investigated if embodying the avatar of a real vs a fictional mafia criminal lead to changes in attitudes and behavioural intentions towards mafia-type organized crime. Eighty-three Italian participants were divided into three groups, each embodying a different character: a real-life mafia boss, Toto Riina (Mafia Group, N = 35); a fictional mafia figure, Don Vito Corleone from The Godfather (Mafia Fictional Group, N = 23); or a neutral, non-specific avatar (Control Group, N = 25). While embodying the character, participants gave a neutral thank-you speech to a group of collaborators in an office-like room. Before and after the experience participants completed various tasks measuring their explicit and implicit attitudes towards mafia-type organized crime, and their intentions to oppose this kind of criminality. Additionally, immediately after the task, while still embodying their character they took part in an interpersonal distance task in which they were approached by avatars representing criminals, mafia criminals, and innocents, while we collected comfort ratings and physiological indices (HR and GSR). Our results indicate paradoxical effects of embodying a fictional mafia character, which were not observed in the Control group or Mafia group. Specifically, after the virtual experience, participants who embodied Don Vito Corleone retained higher levels of conflict when deciding whether they would take part in anti-mafia actions, showed greater implicit aversion towards neutral stimuli preceded by mafia-related primes and indicated greater discomfort in the interpersonal distance task when approached by mafia criminals compared to non-mafia criminals. Our study contributes to research investigating the effects of embodying morally loaded virtual characters and suggests that embodying negative role models in virtual environments does not promote complicity or admiration for those figures but may actually produce paradoxical effects.",

          "abstract": "In this study we aimed to examine behavioral determinants influencing parents’ willingness to recommend digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) to their youth, guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 parents of adolescents aged 13-19 years with mental health concerns. Interviews were thematically analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Results: Findings mapped onto COM-B domains. Capability barriers included low awareness, uncertainty about SSIs, and difficulty navigating digital tools. Opportunity facilitators involved embedding SSIs in trusted settings and receiving endorsements from credible sources, though views on peer recommendations were mixed. Motivation was shaped by alignment with parental values (e.g., safety, communication) and emotional responses such as fear or skepticism related to DMHIs and privacy. Conclusion: Results from this study highlight the need for dissemination strategies that directly address parental concerns and priorities, including culturally relevant messaging, tailored framing, and delivery through familiar and trusted community settings.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Pavlovian go/no-go task is commonly used to measure individual differences in Pavlovian biases and their interaction with instrumental learning. However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

          "abstract": "Human emotional life is rich and varied, yet psychological science often studies it in decontextualized ways, asking participants to rate feelings without capturing the situations that evoke them. Here, we map the ecology of everyday emotion by analyzing the link between affective experience and daily events. We collected thousands of real-time verbal descriptions of momentary affect from participants over 70 days. Using transformer-based language models, we identified granular topics corresponding to daily situations, from 'morning routines' to 'socializing with friends.' Our analysis revealed that the mapping between situations and emotions is not one-to-one, but many-to-many. For example, a single situation, such as 'reading books,' was associated with a wide spectrum of emotions, while a single emotion word, such as “angry,” appeared across a diverse range of situations. This data-driven approach moves beyond simple emotion labels to build a foundational ecology of human affective experience.",

This process is known as interoception, and has been extensively studied in the cardiac, respiratory, and gastric domains; in contrast, metabolic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the link between glucose control and cognition, motivated by the observation that there is substantial, unexplained comorbidity between type-2 diabetes and depression. In rodents, insulin modulates dopamine signalling in the ventral striatum. We therefore hypothesised that, in humans, differences in glucose control would be associated with altered reward learning. \nMethods: To test this hypothesis, we recruited 48 participants from the general population, who each completed a glucose tolerance test, a monetary reward learning task known to relate to dopamine function, and mental health questionnaires. We fitted an established reinforcement learning model to the task data in order to obtain computational parameters characterising participants’ learning, and then examined the associations between these parameters and their glucose control. \nResults: We discovered that poorer glucose control was associated with greater reliance on recent rewards during learning which was, in turn, associated with higher depression symptoms. There was also more modest evidence for the association between glucose control and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: Together, our results identify a specific neurocognitive process, reward learning, by which metabolic information may influence cognition, and which may explain the link between metabolic diseases like type-2 diabetes and depression.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different cognitive and neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings of attentional filtering with age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array in which participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and a significant N2pc event-related potential (ERP) related to increased attentional selection. However, only young adults showed suppression of distractors, as indicated by a significant distractor-positivity (PD) ERP following all three cue types. Older adults did not show significant suppression of distractors in any condition and, they even showed increased attention towards distractors following negative and neutral cues. Thus, although behavioral evidence suggests young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly, neural evidence suggests that older adults are less able to suppress distractors following these cues.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons connected to the rise of the Internet and our current political environment, societies around the world are facing an existential crisis–a lack of empathy. Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

          "abstract": "Divergent thinking (DT) tests are often used to estimate creative potential. They have sound theoretical bases, good reliability, and moderate predictive validity. One previous study that sampled gifted and nongifted children tested the interactions among DT indices (fluency, originality, and flexibility) in the predictive equation and reported a respectable validity coefficient of .59. Two meta-analyses have also supported the use of DT tests as estimates of creative potential, but neither of these examined interactions among the DT indices. The present correlational, group-comparison (N = 312) investigation (a) replicated the 1986 study and examined interactions among the three DT indices and (b) extended that research by using two newer criterion measures. One was the Creative Activity and Accomplishment Checklist (CAAC) which had been updated such that it includes scales for Technological, Athletic, and Everyday creativity, in addition to scales for Art, Science &amp; Math, Writing, and Music. The updated CAAC also used a new method for assessing the quality of creative accomplishment (in addition to the quantity of creative activity). A final novel feature of the present investigation was the use of a second criterion, one that was developed specifically for research on DT. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the fluency X originality and flexibility X originality interactions were significantly related to the Quantity of creativity activity score. Giftedness, fluency, and the fluency X originality interaction were significantly related to the Quality score. Canonical correlation analyses indicated a predictive validity of .73 (p &lt;.001) for the total sample. One clear conclusion is therefore that predictions from DT tests should take interactions into account. These findings are discussed in the context of theories which recognize creativity as an important part of giftedness and theories which suggest that several facets of DT need to be taken into account when assessing creative cognition.",

We additionally test interventions analogous to individual-level education versus institutional solutions to risk management: (1) improving understanding of the optimal strategies and (2) within-group coordination through voting.

          "abstract": "Diverse methods have been developed to quantify respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), including peak-valley, spectral analytic and moving-polynomial-filtering estimations. Although these three procedures were found—some 35 years ago—to provide functionally equivalent indices of RSA (Grossman, van Beek &amp; Wientjes, 1990), Lewis et al. (2012) attempted a partial replication of the earlier study in order to compare degree of agreement of these measures, as well as to examine the levels of influence of respiration and heart-period nonstationarity upon each RSA index. This paper continues to be both influential and controversial. However, several limitations in their report call several of the study’s conclusions into question : 1) The investigators failed to apply natural logarithm (ln) transformation to two of the three measures before pursuing subordinate analyses, even though the unaltered RSA estimates violate assumptions of normality and require ln transformation in order for inter-individual parametric statistics to be meaningful. 2) Instead of first comparing their own already ln-transformed measure (RSAp-b; derived from moving-polynomial detrending) with the other ln-transformed measures (peak-valley RSA and spectral-analysis-derived RSA), they mostly performed ln transformation of the latter measures only after already detrending each of these with their moving polynomial filter method. This sequence of analysis confounded the detrending procedure with the ln transformation and did not permit meaningful comparisons between their own moving-polynomial-filtered estimate and the other two. 3) Methods and findings of previous, highly pertinent studies were either misrepresented or not reported. 4) Instead of examining the critical issue of vulnerability of the different methods to violations of stationarity, evidence was simply presented that nonstationarity occurred in baseline time series of heart period and that detrending methods, as designed to perform and as expected, indeed, served to detrend the original time series. 5) The authors overinterpreted their findings regarding the correlations with and moderation by respiratory parameters. 6) Although the senior author performed analyses reported in a much earlier study that revealed very strong respiratory moderation of RSAp-b, these findings failed to be addressed in Lewis et al.

Alienating ‘us-vs-them’ rhetoric was a particularly dominant predictor of both violent outcomes of manifestos and of perceived manipulative intent in online comments. Such rhetoric may be identified at scale using machine-learning models trained on accessible data, permitting the proactive identification of potentially harmful speech.",

          "abstract": "With growing availability of large-scale international surveys, social scientists are increasingly interested in comparing relations among latent variables, such as values and attitudes, across countries using Multigroup and Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling. However, these two methods either entail numerous pairwise comparisons or overemphasize the differences between groups, neglecting shared similarities. Mixture Multigroup Structural Equation Modeling (MMG-SEM) has recently been proposed as a novel alternative to identify clusters of groups with similar structural relations while accounting for measurement invariance and non-invariance. Despite its potential, practical guide for applying MMG-SEM to cross-national survey data remains limited. This study provides a step-by-step tutorial to address this gap, using the European Social Survey (ESS) Round 8 data to analyze climate change attitudes. Our results reveal cross-national differences and similarities in how human values influence climate policy support, and how these relations are mediated by climate change beliefs across 23 countries. The clustering patterns are primarily driven by the strength of self-transcendence and conservation effects, whereas self-enhancement effects remain weak and contribute little to distinguish between countries. In addition, the clustering results organize the countries into four types: value-driven but belief-cautious skeptics, value-driven and belief-amplifying advocates, paradoxical value-pathway actors, and value-detached pragmatists.",

Here, we consider how we first develop the ability to parse reality hierarchically - as we learn, to use Plato’s phrase, to ‘carve nature at its joints’. Central to this process is the ability to make predictions on hierarchical timescales. We consider two aspects of predictability: first, the child’s passive capacity to use predictability to inform how they passively observe things as they happen; and second, children’s active capacity to generate predictable sequences of behaviour. We highlight two themes that are, we argue, common across both passive observation and active behaviour. First, flat (i.e. non-hierarchical) predictability initially increases over development – as shown for example by increases in perseveration – before decreasing as hierarchical predictability (i.e. nested, multi-level goals) increase. Second, for both observing and acting, learnt regularities in low-level environmental data (e.g., movement, contrast, over fine-grained timescales) feed into our internal predictions of higher-order events (e.g., goals, over more coarse-grained timescales).",

          "abstract": "Retrieval stopping, the intentional suppression of unwanted memories, plays a critical role in emotion regulation and cognitive control, yet little is known about its function in adolescence. Using an autobiographical Think/No-Think paradigm, we investigated whether adolescents can control the retrieval of personal emotional events. Forty-nine adolescent participants (13-17) generated positive and negative autobiographical memories for retrieval or suppression in the Think/No-Think task. Memory accuracy and vividness were assessed before and after. Adolescents showed suppression-induced forgetting: negative memories were recalled less accurately and more slowly. Vividness ratings declined for suppressed memories, but not significantly more than negative baseline memories, suggesting a spill-over effect of retrieval stopping to all negative memories, rather than an effect confined to the suppressed negative memories. \nOverall, the results provide evidence that adolescents can intentionally suppress autobiographical emotional memories. These findings extend investigations in adults by showing inhibitory control over memory retrieval is functional during adolescence, a critical period for emotion regulation. The flexibility that the autobiographical TNT task offers allows it to be extended to fears or worries, offering a promising avenue for applied research. Future research should examine its potential as a scalable, low-cost supplement to therapy, supporting emotion regulation and mental health in youth.",

Findings revealed that a more enriching HLE at each wave predicted higher math achievement in each ensuing wave. In turn, children’s math achievement was also prospectively associated with greater enrichment in the HLE over time.

          "abstract": "Many Americans distrust the government, are disillusioned with the political process, and don’t view voting as an effective form of political engagement. Such disillusionment is higher among young Americans, who are disproportionately underrepresented in government. Although voting is an essential action citizens can take to influence and reshape the government, the majority of youth don’t vote regularly. Youth face substantial structural and psychological barriers that interact in particular ways during emerging adulthood to create friction that reduces youth voting and perpetuates cycles of political disempowerment. Executive Order 14248 and the SAVE Act will create new barriers to voting by requiring documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, which is expected to disproportionately affect youth who lack access to valid identification documents at higher rates than older Americans. In the face of mounting structural barriers, it is increasingly important to design effective interventions to motivate and support youth to vote. This commentary outlines a psychologically-informed approach to designing get-out-the-vote initiatives to help youth overcome psychological barriers. It describes the developmental context of emerging adulthood and the challenges and opportunities this period poses for voting, and how developmental factors interact with structural and psychological barriers to impede voting. It then reviews theory and research from psychology, communication, and political science to provide recommendations for creating developmentally appropriate, theory-based get-out-the-vote initiatives. It also describes participatory co-design approaches that can increase intervention effectiveness while also supporting youth civic identity development and democratic skill building.",

          "abstract": "This analysis examines parent perspectives on psychological evaluation reports. Thirty-eight parents reviewed paired reports written by a school psychologist about fictional children and provided written comments. Consistent with decades of research, traditional reports, written at college level, used technical language and test-by-test organization. Accessible reports, written at middle school level, employed plain language and thematic integration with scores moved to appendices. Thematic analysis of 52 comments identified four themes: difficult to understand and disempowering for traditional reports, accessible language and helpful organization and content for accessible reports. Parents described traditional reports as creating barriers to comprehension and participation through inaccessible terminology and fragmented presentation. Accessible reports enabled understanding and engagement through plain language and functional integration. These findings have direct implications for school psychology training and practice: replace traditional reports with accessible reports to better serve children and families.",

We aim to address these gaps by collecting digital trace data across multiple gaming platforms and pairing it with intensive longitudinal psychological data. Using open-source software and collaborating with industry, we will track gameplay for 1,000 US emerging adults and 1,000 UK adults across Nintendo Switch, Xbox (US only), Steam, and iOS and Android for three months. Participants will complete 30 daily surveys (US sample) and six biweekly panel surveys (both regions) assessing subjective wellbeing, sleep quality, and need satisfaction.Three preregistered manuscripts, along with open code and data, will explore games’ influence from three perspectives: basic psychological needs, sleep, and the structure of games. Study 1 will test relationships between in-game needs, needs in general, and subsequent play behavior, to assess whether gaming contributes to flourishing or compensation. Study 2 will examine the impact of late-night gaming on sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and wellbeing exploring whether chronotype (natural inclination to be more active and alert in the morning, as opposed to evening) moderates these relationships. Study 3 will test the relation between multi-platform playtime and wellbeing, and its potential moderation by game genre. Together, these studies will inform associations between play and psychological wellbeing in rare detail by using more granular digital trace data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) have demonstrated therapeutic benefits across diverse clinical populations and settings. However, the underlying neurological and physiological mechanisms that produce these effects remain poorly understood. While previous research has examined physiological responses to human-animal interactions, there is limited integration of central nervous system processes with peripheral biomarkers, and most studies have focused predominantly on dog-assisted interventions.\n\nObjectives: This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on both neural and physiological mechanisms underlying AAI effects. Specifically, we will integrate findings from neuroimaging studies (fMRI, EEG, NIRS) with physiological biomarker research (cortisol, oxytocin, heart rate, blood pressure) to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework. The review will examine interactions with diverse animal species across various clinical populations.\n\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we will systematically search ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases using three concept groups: animal intervention terms, neurological measurement terms, and physiological measurement terms. This review reports the results of a search conducted through March 2025. Inclusion criteria require peer-reviewed empirical studies in English that measure neurological or physiological outcomes from structured AAIs involving live animals. Studies using non-live animals, unstructured exposure, or non-empirical designs will be excluded. Data extraction will document measurement techniques, animal species, population characteristics, intervention parameters, and study outcomes.\n\nExpected Contributions: This review will provide the first comprehensive integration of central and peripheral biological mechanisms in AAI research, establish a theoretical framework connecting neural changes to physiological outcomes, identify promising mechanisms warranting further investigation, and inform evidence-based practice by clarifying how and why AAIs may be effective for specific populations and conditions.\n\nKeywords: Animal-assisted interventions, neuroscience, physiological mechanisms, stress, emotion regulation, oxytocin and cortisol",

          "authors": "Arnaud Wolff; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "Deception is common, yet lies are typically small and not easily spotted. The dominant explanations for why this is the case are psychological in nature, such that small lies are thought to allow individuals to maintain their self-concept or that individuals have a general preference for truth-telling. In this paper, we suggest that lies are typically small because small lies allow individuals to retrieve benefits associated with lying while preventing punishment from interaction partners. We present two game-theoretic models in which agents are incentivized to misreport private information. In a two-player game, we show that the equilibrium size of the lie is predicted to be smaller when the reputational costs of lying are larger, and smaller when the state of the world is more observable. In a three-player game, we show that lies can remain stable in group settings provided that the equilibrium size of the lie is small enough, so that the sender retains plausible deniability about lying. A unique and central prediction of our models is that biased self-presentation will be modulated by the degree of observability of the trait. We review the empirical literature on positive illusions, and argue that the findings support this prediction. We propose that the aversion to lying observed in laboratory experiments reflects the workings of a psychology well-adapted to the incentive structure of natural environments and suggest that models of human social behavior should focus on capturing relevant parameters from such environments.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal relationships are among the most essential yet fragile aspects of human life, and recent advances in dual-brain stimulation provide a unique opportunity to causally probe and modulate their neural underpinnings. While prior work has linked interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) to relationship quality, its causal contribution to long-term relational outcomes remains unclear. Here, we present the first application of dual-brain transcranial alternating current stimulation (hyper-tACS) to social bonding, specifically targeting romantic partners, with a focus on the temporal dissociation between neural and behavioral effects. Across six consecutive days of intervention, active hyper-tACS induced clear increases in prefrontal IBS immediately after stimulation, yet these neural gains did not translate into concurrent improvements in subjective relationship satisfaction. Mediation analyses further showed that individual differences in IBS increases mediated the effect of baseline IBS on relationship improvement, suggesting that behavioral benefits rely on neural alignment consolidating over time. At a one-year follow-up, the active group exhibited a substantially lower breakup rate relative to sham controls. These findings provide causal evidence for a delayed effect of dual-brain stimulation, in which neural changes precede and gradually consolidate into durable relational benefits. Together, this work provides the first causal evidence that dual-brain stimulation can be extended from motor coordination to the social domain, advancing mechanistic accounts of intimacy and highlighting hyper-tACS as a translational tool for strengthening long-term relationship stability.",

Prospective clinical studies jointly examin-ing daily ADHD symptoms, medication use, sleep, and perceived stress across the menstrual cycle are lacking.\nAims\n(1) To test whether ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, and medication use differ between follicular and late luteal phases; (2) to examine whether sleep quality and perceived stress predict next-day symptoms and impairment, and whether these associations vary by cycle phase.\nMethod\nNaturally cycling adult females with ADHD (N = 125) completed a digital daily diary throughout their menstrual cycle. Last-night sleep quality was reported at 09:00 am, while evening entries assessed ADHD symptom clusters (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), functional impairment, perceived stress, and ADHD-specific medication use. \nResults\nAll symptom clusters – including inattention (Estimate = 0.14, 95% CI [0.08, 0.21]), hyperactivity (Estimate = 0.16, 95% CI [0.09, 0.22]), and impulsivity (Estimate = 0.19, 95% CI [0.12, 0.26]) – and functional impairment (Estimate = 0.20, 95% CI [0.13, 0.27]) increased towards the late luteal phase. Compared to the follicular phase, par-ticipants took more medication during the late luteal phase (OR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.88, 1.90]). Sleep quality was lower (Estimate = -0.17, CI [-0.30, -0.05]) and perceived stress higher (Estimate = 0.12, CI [0.03, 0.20]) during the late luteal phase. Lower average sleep quality and higher average perceived stress were associated with higher symptom severity regardless of cycle phase. However, day-to-day changes in these factors did not predict next-day symptoms.\nConclusions\nFemales with ADHD appear to exhibit late-luteal-phase vulnerability marked by in-creased symptom burden and potential cycle-phase-specific variation in perceived medication need. Findings support the need for cycle-sensitive diagnostics, consid-eration of the menstrual cycle in therapy planning and paying attention to trait-like sleep and perceived stress profiles when personalizing care.",

Sixty-two, 15- to 18-month-olds (n = 28 female) and their mothers (n = 43 White) played for 15 minutes. Coordinated gaze was micro-coded and parents’ speech was transcribed. Children’s language skills were measured directly during the lab visit and via parent-report at 24 months. Results showed that frequency of parents’ ‘play monitoring’ – jointly looking to an object with their child and briefly looking to their object-focused child – positively predicted children’s language skills at 15- to 18- and 24 months. Referential labelling during children’s sustained attention to objects also predicted receptive language. These findings emphasise the importance of well-coordinated, child-sensitive parental behaviours in supporting toddlers’ emerging communication skills.",

          "abstract": "Morality is deeply rooted in the context of relationships. Yet the influence of relational factors, such as attachment, on moral concerns remains largely unexplored. Nonetheless, recent scholarship has shed some light on the connection between attachment and moral considerations. To extend this understanding, the current study seeks to investigate whether relationship-specific attachment dimensions, specifically anxiety and avoidance, predict Haidt’s moral foundations—care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and purity/degradation. After receiving ethics approval, a convenience sample of 468 individuals was recruited via the research team's social media networks. Participants completed an online survey, comprising questionnaires covering demographics, morality, personality, and attachment. Following data cleaning, 254 participants (61% female, 38% male) ranging from 18 to 74 years of age (Mean = 33.9, SD = 13.9), were included in the final analysis. First, correlational analysis was conducted, followed by several hierarchical multiple regression analyses, yielding significant results. Specifically, higher attachment anxiety with mother predicted greater moral concerns about authority, while higher attachment anxiety with father predicted greater concerns about harm and lower concerns about fairness. In contrast, higher attachment avoidance with mother predicted lower concerns about authority, whereas higher attachment avoidance with father predicted greater concerns about fairness. Friendship and romantic attachment dimensions did not predict moral foundations. Overall, our findings suggest that parental attachment may influence moral considerations, hinting at the potential origins of moral diversity in early attachment relationships.",

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between early-life vaccine scheduling intensity and autism prevalence across 12 high-income countries, with implications for both public health and psychological well-being. Beyond epidemiological patterns, the analysis considers potential societal and developmental dimensions relevant to psychological sciences, such as parental risk perception, trust in health systems, and stress associated with intensive immunization schedules. Using a cross-national ecological dataset from countries with comparable healthcare systems and diagnostic standards, we applied descriptive statistics, partial correlations (controlling for overall vaccination coverage), and multivariate regression models. Countries were grouped by autism prevalence: higher-rate nations (USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore) averaged 15 vaccine types and 20 doses for infants ≤1 year, while lower-rate nations (Norway, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, UK) averaged 8 vaccines and 9 doses. Partial correlations revealed strong positive associations between autism prevalence and both vaccine types (r = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001) and doses (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01). Regression analysis indicated that a 1% increase in vaccine types corresponded to a 0.47% increase in autism prevalence (p = 0.001), explaining 81% of variance. These findings are statistically significant but do not establish causality. Instead, they highlight patterns warranting further investigation into neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychosocial factors influencing parental decision-making. The results suggest that more gradual vaccine schedules, as observed in countries with lower autism prevalence, may merit consideration in future research and policy discussions to optimize developmental outcomes, reduce parental anxiety, and maintain high immunization coverage.",

We manipulate the proposal's party and the justification they provide in a 2 × 3 between subjects experiment (total N = 5,008). Our experiments replicate well-known effects of partisan bias in support for the subversion of democracy: respondents in both the US and Poland are more tolerant of subversion when it is initiated by their in-party. However, respondents are surprisingly resistant to justifications, especially in the high external validity design implemented in the US. Even in Poland where we ``forced\" respondents to pay attention to the justifications, support for subversion is increased only among in-partisans and not by much. These results raise doubt that democratic subversion can be effectively masked as a pro-democracy intervention by pro-democratic rhetoric.",

          "abstract": "Background: Common and distinct features of personality disorders (PDs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have long been the focus of research. However, most studies relied on categorical rather than dimensional models, which are becoming increasingly integrated into contemporary psychiatric nosology and may offer more nuanced insights. To date, no study has examined the common structure of dimensional PD, according to the alternative DSM-5 model for PDs (personality functioning and pathological personality traits), and ADHD.\n\nMethods: In a preregistered study, a sample of adults seeking mental health support (n = 2,567) completed self-report measures assessing personality functioning, pathological personality traits (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism, and anankastia), and ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and executive functioning). Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the latent structure and shared variance among these constructs using confirmatory and exploratory factor models, including models with a general factor.\n\nResults: ADHD components showed strong correlations with personality functioning and moderate-to-strong associations with pathological personality traits, particularly disinhibition. Disinhibition remained the only trait domain substantially correlated with ADHD after control-ling for a general personality pathology factor. In exploratory models, ADHD components showed two distinct loading patterns among disinhibition facets: one factor was mainly defined by inattention and distractibility, with additional but weaker loadings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, whereas the other reflected executive functioning and irresponsibility.\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that ADHD has substantial overlap with dimensional PD. Clinically, individuals with ADHD may benefit from integrated assessments of personality functioning and pathological personality traits, and from interventions addressing personality pathology.",

          "abstract": "In an aging society, identifying predictors of healthy aging is imperative. Personality traits (i.e., relatively consistent patterns of thoughts, emotions, and behavior) predict numerous health-related outcomes across the lifespan, with associations reported many decades prior to older age – potentially as early as adolescence. Yet, most previous research has focused on personality assessed in adulthood or late-life. We identified and synthesized the existing literature examining the links between adolescent personality (aged 10-25 years) and any outcome in older adulthood (aged 60+). \nBased on 33 studies (Ntotal=102,650 participants), adolescent personality predicted interindividual differences across numerous late-life outcomes, including health (e.g., longevity, diabetes), cognition (e.g., dementia, memory), and socioeconomic and psychological measures (e.g., financial security, wellbeing). Notably, meta-analysis shows that adolescents higher in conscientiousness were at decreased risk of dying over the subsequent decades (HR=0.949, 95%CI[0.921, 0.978], k=5). Our review further emphasizes the influential role of midlife educational attainment on the links between adolescent personality and late-life outcomes. \nPersonality assessment is simple, time- and cost-efficient, scalable, and could be integrated into school evaluations or medical check-ups during adolescence. Personality research provides opportunities to guide lifespan health policies by identifying individuals who may benefit most from lifestyle interventions, and by scaffolding risk-stratification strategies to promote healthy aging.",

Homicide is considered one, if not the most devastating forms of traumatic grief and is often comorbid with symptoms of PTSD and MDD. Engagement in bereavement PS has proven effective in mediating symptoms of traumatic grief, however, most research is limited to suicide bereavement. The current study aims to further the field of homicide PS by thematically analyzing secondary data in the way of five semi-structured interviews held by Victim Support (https://www.victimsupport.org.uk ) Peer Support team. Two themes and three sub themes were the result of analysis; Theme one ‘Peer support; Belonging, Empowerment and Hope’ and theme two ‘Isolation and Time; 1) `isolation felt by homicide bereavement, 2) social expectation of grief, 3) Homicides impact on sense of time and benefits of peer support. These themes were concurrent with existing research regarding traumatic grief PS as were impacts of positive wellbeing. Results differed from previous research in alleviation of isolation; however, homicide PS was seen to help individuals manage such feelings. The research highlights the need for more mixed method analysis into effects of homicide PS on traumatic grief as results indicate the occurrence of hope held mitigating factors against traumatic grief symptoms. Overall, the study was successful as it elucidated how PS impacts traumatic grief in those bereaved by homicide.",

          "abstract": "As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns have emerged about growing dependency on AI and its potential psychological and behavioral consequences. The present research develops and validates the Generative AI Dependency Scale, a multidimensional tool developed to assess individual differences in dependency on generative AI systems. Across six studies involving 1333 participants from the United States and Singapore, the Generative AI Dependency Scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including a stable three-factor structure (cognitive preoccupation, negative consequences, withdrawal), good internal consistency (α = .92–.93), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = .87). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a higher-order dependency construct, and scalar measurement invariance was established across sex and cultures. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated through associations with an existing AI addiction scale and the Big Five personality traits respectively. Generative AI dependency was also significantly associated with a range of motivational (e.g., lower basic psychological need satisfaction, greater fear of missing out), behavioral (e.g., increased procrastination and cognitive failures, lower task performance and critical thinking), and psychological (e.g., reduced self-concept clarity, greater loneliness) outcomes. Framed within Goodman's behavioral dependency framework and self-determination theory, these findings suggest that generative AI dependency reflects not merely excessive technology use, but a deeper misalignment between psychological needs and the strategies employed to meet them. The Generative AI Dependency Scale offers a psychometrically robust foundation for future research into the impacts of generative AI, with implications for responsible AI design and use.",

The findings indicate that students possess the capacity to differentiate between the measured dimensions and correctly interpret the questionnaire items. However, the severity of their responses exhibits considerable variability.

Without observable consequences, the affective rewards of giving are muted, limiting their potential to reinforce the donor's generosity and encourage additional donations. Building on the theoretical advances that conceptualize moral learning as a reinforcement learning process, we tested whether and how the presentation of impact information about previous donations influences the affective experience of the previous donation and the effectiveness of the person's subsequent charitable giving. Our results showed that providing impact feedback increased subsequent donations by 14% and modestly increased warm glow. These findings suggest that making the consequences of giving more visible can help reinforce generosity in ways that sustain support for effective programs. In this context, donors' feelings of satisfaction of making an impact can both signal and reinforce shifts in future moral motivation.",

          "abstract": "The niche-picking principle has been proposed to explain stabilization in personality development and personality continuity of adult. The niche-picking principle posits that the reciprocal exchange between people and their environments -- person-environment transaction -- serve to maintain trait continuity, thereby preserving rank-order stability of trait differences. To date, however, no longitudinal twin study has directly tested whether reciprocal effects between people and their environments contribute to trait continuity in middle and older adulthood. Using a sample of twins from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), we tested whether the niche-picking principle explained stability of longitudinal within-family differences in neuroticism, extraversion, and openness across two stages of adulthood development. Genetic simplex models that include a reciprocal effects (i.e., phenotype-environment covariance) parameter were fit to twins' longitudinal data. Results suggest that the niche-picking principle partly explains continuity of neuroticism and openness in middle adulthood whereas it partly explains continuity of neuroticism and extraversion in older adulthood. Stable genetic and unique environmental variance also explained continuity of each trait. Findings partially support lifespan developmental theories that posit that people adapt to and possibly optimize behaviors to sustain existing traits. We discuss the importance of the reciprocal exchange between people and their environments across the lifespan and how these exchanges might shift to support trait continuity.",

This study investigates the feasibility of developing a Real-Time Adaptive Procedure System that uses machine learning to understand procedural deviations and adapt procedures dynamically in high-risk industrial settings.\nData were collected from eight workers performing three tasks at a high-fidelity petrochemical facility. Using the Skip-Order-Action framework, researchers documented procedural deviations by comparing observed behavior against prescribed procedures across 507 procedural steps. A logistic regression model was developed using features from the Multi-disciplinary Interactive Behavior Triad framework, including participant characteristics, step-level attributes derived from abstraction hierarchy levels and cognitive performance modeling, and real-time indicators such as timestamps and eye-tracking data.\nThe model using step-level and participant-level features achieved relatively better performance (F1 = 0.49, AUC = 0.82), outperforming baseline models (F1 = 0.14-0.23). Adding real-time indicators reduced performance (F1 = 0.38), suggesting challenges in integrating real-time behavioral data.\nThis proof-of-concept demonstrates that procedural deviations follow patterns based on task characteristics and worker attributes. The study establishes empirical foundations for machine learning-driven procedural adaptation and proposes a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between prescribed and actual work through adaptive systems rather than compliance monitoring, representing a paradigm shift toward learning-oriented procedural systems in high-risk industries.",

          "abstract": "Background\nClinical evaluation of language abilities is central to diagnosing impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions, such as brain injuries, Parkinson’s disease, or schizophrenia. However, assessment tools predominantly target structural and semantic aspects of language, while pragmatic and communicative abilities remain underrepresented, despite consistent evidence of their vulnerability across clinical populations. This gap is largely due to the scarcity of standardized and rapid tools for pragmatic assessment and the inherent difficulty of measuring context-dependent communicative abilities\n\nAim\nThis study aimed to develop and validate the German adaptation of the Assessment of Pragmatic Abilities and Cognitive Substrates Brief (APACS Brief-De), a 10-minute screening tool originally created in Italian, assessing discourse production and comprehension of non-literal language, to enable reliable and time-efficient evaluation of pragmatics in German-speaking contexts.\n\nMethods\nAdopting a culturally sensitive translation approach, a standard and a multiple choice APACS Brief-De were developed, each with an alternate form to allow for repeated assessments, which were administered remotely in a sample of healthy German-speaking adults.\n\nResults\nThe APACS Brief-De Multiple Choice showed good consistency, reliability, validity, and equivalence between forms. Age and global cognitive performance significantly influenced pragmatic scores. The comparisons with the Italian standard form confirmed statistical equivalence, underscoring the robustness of the tool across languages. Age- and education-adjusted normative cut-off scores are provided for clinical interpretation.\n\nConclusions\nAPACS Brief-De offers a rapid and valid tool for assessing the global pragmatic profile, well-suited for integration into routine clinical practice, and represents a significant step toward crosslinguistic standardization of pragmatic assessment.",

          "abstract": "Ruminative brooding is marked by its perseverative nature. Existing mechanistic theories attribute this to cognitive control deficits linked to elevated functional connectivity within the default mode network and abnormal prefrontal activity. Here, we conceptualize ruminative brooding as an emergent property of a neural attractor state within the default mode network. Stable attractors are mathematically defined by two key properties: 1) convergence over time (assessing attractivity), and 2) resistance to perturbation (assessing stability). We tested whether brain states associated with brooding exhibited these properties in healthy volunteers using EEG during a task-switching protocol that interleaved cued rumination, working memory, and autobiographical memory tasks. Since cued rumination and working memory are thought to engage anticorrelated networks (default mode vs. central executive), switching from cued rumination to working memory effectively “perturbs” this system. Cued rumination was associated with beta power in the posterior cingulate cortex, with rumination disengagement marked by a reduction in beta power in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices. Moreover, high trait rumination was associated with impaired disengagement of these rumination-related dynamics and reduced recruitment of the dlPFC when transitioning from cued rumination to the working memory task, consistent with the “resistance to perturbation” criterion of a stable attractor. Furthermore, trait brooding was positively associated with a reduction in variance in posterior parietal and cingulate cortices time series over the course of cued rumination trials, consistent with the “convergence” criterion. These results provide support for framing brooding-related neural dynamics as pathological attractor states, providing a mechanistic account of rumination’s perseverative quality.",

          "abstract": "Sustained attention is notoriously difficult to maintain over time, with attentional lapses emerging rapidly during prolonged tasks. Motivation has been identified as a key factor in reducing these lapses and enhancing task engagement. According to recent accounts such as the goal competition hypothesis, the perceived benefit associated with a goal helps sustain its active representation in working memory. These benefits can arise from the prospect of gaining a reward, avoiding a penalty, or both. However, it remains unclear whether avoiding a penalty—or the combination of penalty and reward— improved sustained goal maintenance to the same extent as pursuing a reward alone. To address this question, we recruited 30 participants to complete a Continuous Performance Task (CPT) in which the type of benefit associated with the goal varied every 20 trials (reward, penalty, both, or no benefit). Replicating prior findings, we observed that rewards reduced attentional lapses compared to a no-benefit baseline. Avoiding penalties and combining both incentives also improved sustained attention, though the penalty condition was less effective than the combined condition. This suggests that while any perceived benefit can support goal maintenance, the motivational mechanisms may differ depending on the type of benefit—particularly when avoiding penalties alone.",

          "abstract": "Preclinical studies suggest that fasting may attenuate spontaneous pain and pain-related behaviors, such as licking and paw withdrawal, during inflammation in animals; however, evidence of the analgesic effects of fasting in patients suffering from chronic pain remains inconclusive. In two studies, we investigated the potentially protective effects of fasting on the development of mechanical hypersensitivity in healthy human volunteers following experimentally induced sensitization of nociceptive fibers through painful cutaneous electrical stimulation. In the first experiment (N = 33), participants underwent the painful electrical stimulation protocol twice: once after a 12-hour fast and once after consuming a standard breakfast. In a follow-up experiment (N = 52), participants were randomized to receive either the painful electrical stimulation protocol after a 16-hour fast or after their usual morning meal. In both experiments, we assessed the intensity, unpleasantness, and spatial extent of secondary mechanical hypersensitivity, as well as emotional state and hunger levels. Fasting increased hunger and negative affect in both studies. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, participants in the fasted condition reported significantly less mechanical hypersensitivity compared to the breakfast condition. In both experiments, fasting did not reduce the pain intensity reported during the painful electrical stimulation. These findings provide behavioral evidence that a 16-hour fast may reduce the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. These results in humans align with preclinical evidence showing that fasting affects mechanical hypersensitivity, without necessarily affecting the perceived intensity of acute painful stimuli. Our findings suggest that metabolic state may modulate mechanical hypersensitivity in humans.",

          "abstract": "Fluid intelligence, often assessed through abstract reasoning tasks, is typically assumed to rely on deliberative, effortful problem solving. However, recent findings within the dual-process framework of reasoning suggest an alternative possibility: individuals with higher intelligence may generate correct responses intuitively, without engaging in deliberation. To test this “smart intuitor” hypothesis, we conducted two studies using a two-response paradigm. Participants solved abstract reasoning matrices, first providing an initial response under time pressure and concurrent cognitive load to minimize deliberation, followed by a final response without such constraints. Results consistently showed that although correct final responses were primarily achieved through corrective deliberation, a substantial number of correct answers were already produced during the initial intuitive stage. Notably, over 20% of sound reasoners produced consistently correct intuitive responses and qualified as “smart intuitors.” These findings suggest that while deliberation remains the dominant route to correct abstract reasoning, it is not the only one. Intuition can also support successful performance on abstract reasoning tasks, at least for a subset of individuals. Our results call for a broader conception of fluid intelligence—one that recognizes the contributions of both reflective and intuitive processes.",

Investigating individual attitudes and responses to organized crime poses ethical and methodological challenges, especially in real-world settings. In this Perspective article, we argue that immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers a promising tool to overcome these challenges and promote positive changes in civic attitudes and behaviors. We suggest that exposing participants to mafia-related scenarios in IVR environments—while recording psychophysiological and brain data—can reveal both implicit and explicit markers of cognitive and emotional responses to criminal activity. Additionally, we discuss the Proteus effect, i.e., the behavioral change an individual undergoes based on the characteristics of their avatar and illustrate how embodying virtual characters with morally salient traits may foster civic resistance. IVR can thus serve both as a means to understand the psychophysiological underpinnings of responses to organized crime and as a tool to build resilience, supporting the development of targeted, evidence-based strategies that enhance public engagement and ethical action.",

To assess how perceived realism and explicit recall affect juror decisions, jury-eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock criminal cases, rating the strength of each case. Participants also reported their ability to recall a similar case (autobiographical recall), their knowledge of similar cases (factual recall), and the perceived realism of the case. Perceived realism was the most influential component of mock-juror decisions. Additional analyses identified two contributions of perceived realism: a common factor combining realism with memory recall and an independent factor.

Data were analyzed using a three-level mixed-effects meta-regression model, accounting for effect non-independence and key moderators such as retention intervals, warnings, overall test performance, and study characteristics. \nResults. \nAnalyzing data from 432 studies and 1,764 effect sizes across 51,845 participants, the average size of the misinformation effect was substantial, g = 0.659, 95% [0.196, 1.122], indicating a robust overall effect across studies. There was considerable variation across different conditions (total σ2 = 0.723, I2 = 91.78%). Consistent with previous findings, accuracy for the control condition was strongly positively associated with the size of the misinformation effect. Post-misinformation warnings were found to reduce the misinformation effect. Additionally, post-event testing, contrary to previous findings on retrieval-enhanced suggestibility, did not significantly moderate the misinformation effect.\nDiscussion. \nThe present analysis supports the conclusion that the misinformation effect is a reliable phenomenon, driven by a mixture of memory-related mechanisms as well as mechanism related to how participants strategize when responding to tests of different formats. Additionally, given the substantial heterogeneity we observed, we argue that the misinformation effect might be usefully conceptualized as a constellation of related phenomena, rather than a single coherent effect.",

This article reviews the existing literature on why predictability in educational settings, marked by stability and rhythm, supports learning and development. Previous research shows that young children develop an understanding of the world through interactions with their environment; based on what they already know or believe, they then make predictions about what will happen next. This allows for allostasis, which involves proactive changes to stress-response systems to meet anticipated future demands. At a fine-grained level, brains operate by generating and testing predictions. We learn best at an intermediate level of predictability – known as the Goldilocks zone. But for younger brains, with little prior experience, even simple, structured environments can appear unpredictable. Exposure to unpredictable environments triggers a stress response within the sympathoadrenal-medullary axis. Children who experience unpredictable home environments can often have an overactive stress response.

However, there are no validated measures to assess vystopia. In this study, we developed and validated an 8-item Vystopia Scale in a sample of 997 vegan participants. The model fit a single factor, had high internal consistency values (α = .93, ω = .94), and converged well with several measures of negative affect and concerns about animal rights. Strict measurement invariance was established across genders (men and women), and women reported significantly higher levels of vystopia compared to men. The Vystopia Scale offers a valuable tool for further research on vystopia and its impact on the well-being of vegans.",

          "abstract": "Episodes of extreme alcohol binge-drinking can result in memory loss, transient anterograde amnesic experiences known as memory blackouts (MBO). The current study investigates whether recognition memory is impacted by frequency of blackout experiences, and if false memories are more likely for those who regularly experience blackouts (n = 29) in comparison to a control group (n = 24) who had never experienced an MBO. Participants completed a recognition memory paradigm (a modified DRM task: Roediger &amp; McDermott, (1995)), with a follow-up remember/know/guess judgement, before-alcohol and after-alcohol in the same testing session, while the MBO group (n = 23) additionally completed the task in a subsequent testing session within 20-hours of a blackout, but when sober again. Both groups displayed reduced discrimination (d’) between old and new words and a more conservative response strategy after-alcohol, which remained for MBO participants after-MBO. Critical lure words elicited more false-alarms than weakly related or unrelated words, yet the overall frequency of false-alarms dropped after-alcohol and remained depressed after blackout for the MBO group. Critically, decile analysis revealed significant shifts in d’ for early deciles (1st-6th), suggesting impairment to recognition memory after-MBO; severity of individual MBO experiences may impact these results, although it is not possible to attribute them solely to blackout events. Future work should investigate whether adults with a longer history of alcohol-induced memory blackout experiences display an impairment in recollection and familiarity, or show atypical false memory acceptance rates.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing attention to metacognition in education, little is known about how in-service teachers monitor the reliability of their own professional knowledge. This study investigates teachers’ metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency in evaluating educational claims. Drawing on a large-scale dataset of confidence-rated responses to a questionnaire on educational misconceptions, we estimated metacognitive metrics based on Signal Detection Theory, including meta-d′ and M-ratio. At the group level, teachers showed moderate ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect items (d′ = 0.62) and some insight into the accuracy of their judgments (meta-d′ = 0.53), but their metacognitive efficiency was suboptimal (M-ratio = 0.62). Generalized linear mixed models revealed that metacognitive calibration varied systematically by gender and educational stage. These findings suggest that metacognitive monitoring is shaped by contextual and professional factors, rather than being uniformly distributed across the teaching population. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the persistence of educational misconceptions.",

          "authors": "Andrew MacAskill",
          "abstract": "Many of the most important variables guiding behaviour, such as reward contingency, spatial location or contextual state, cannot be measured directly. Animals must instead infer them from noisy, incomplete information, a process termed ‘hidden state inference’. This requires combining internally generated estimates with incoming evidence to produce accurate beliefs about the world that guide behaviour. While computational frameworks can describe this process in formal terms, its implementation in the brain remains unclear. Here, we propose that the compartmentalised dendritic architecture of CA1 pyramidal neurons provides a biophysically grounded mechanism for performing the core operations of hidden state inference. In this framework, apical dendrites encode internally generated state estimates, tuft dendrites encode evidence from sensory and contextual inputs, and their nonlinear interaction produces an updated state estimate. Structured heterogeneity in dendritic properties across neurons would naturally generate a population code capable of representing graded belief strength, uncertainty, and multiple competing hypotheses. We illustrate how this scheme can account for CA1 function in both reversal learning and spatial navigation, and suggest that similar dendritic principles may operate more widely across brain regions. This perspective links cellular physiology to high level cognitive computation, and yields concrete, testable predictions for how dendritic integration supports adaptive behaviour in dynamic environments.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

Analyses of psychometric functions indicated that participants accepted shorter gaps and made riskier crossing decisions when the vehicle source intensity was lower compared to higher. This effect of source intensity occurred in both an auditory-only and an audio-visual condition, though it was stronger when only auditory information was available. Analyses of the trial-by-trial data showed that the vehicle sound intensity at the moment of the crossing decision was the most important predictor of the decisions in the auditory-only condition. In the audio-visual condition, sound intensity also was significantly associated with the crossing decision, but visual cues dominated. Implications for road traffic safety are discussed, specifically in relation to interactions between pedestrians and electric vehicles.",

Here, we examined whether memory palace valence influences neutral information recall. We found that participants who applied MOL using a negatively valenced palace (N=33) outperformed participants who applied MOL using a positively valenced palace (N=34) and participants in a non-MOL control group (N=31) on a free-response semantic memory recall test. Furthermore, participants who perceived the negative palace more negatively or positive palace more positively exhibited greater recall accuracy, but overall, the negative group outperformed the positive group. These findings highlight that memory palaces can be constructed to optimize loci-dependent memory accuracy, providing new evidence-based strategies to improve memorization.",

Quantitative survey data came from Dutch bi+ youth aged 16-22 years old (M age = 18.71, SD = 1.83). We conducted logistic regression on lifetime suicidal ideation (N = 1275) and attempts (N = 1274), including risk and protective factors, as well as interaction effects between sexual orientation, gender identity and risk/protective factors. To contextualize the quantitative findings, 15 interviews with bi+ youth with a history of suicidality were conducted and thematically analyzed. Quantitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Enhanced social support, support-seeking coping, and resilience were linked with a lower likelihood of suicidal ideation. Associations between erasure, binegativity, distraction-seeking, and bi+ community connectedness and suicidality varied by sexual identity. Qualitatively, experienced stigmatization and binegativity-related prejudice involved peers perceiving bi+ youth as ‘strange,’ sexualizing their identities, and assuming an incapability of having stable relationships. Findings highlight the need for inclusive mental health interventions that address the challenging experiences of bi+ youth, and improve protective factors such as social support, coping strategies, and resilience.\nKeywords: bi+ youth, LGBT, minority stress, protective factors, suicidality",

While classical economic games have provided important insights into cooperation and competition, they typically rely on discrete, turn-based decisions that fail to capture the fluid and reciprocal nature of real-world social interactions. The present study used a novel transparent Dyadic Interaction Platform and a novel Cooperation–Competition Foraging task to examine how the interpersonal personality traits agency and communion shape dynamic, real-time social behavior. In this task, pairs of participants (dyads) jointly or individually collected targets with variable payoffs, allowing cooperative and competitive strategies to emerge naturally as both partners continuously observed each other’s gaze, actions, and outcomes. Using a round-robin design, we assessed how interpersonal traits and partner-specific adaptations jointly predicted dyadic strategic outcomes. Within each session, dyads gradually converged toward stable interaction modes, with increasing cooperation across sessions. Higher mean communion within dyads predicted enhanced cooperation, indicating that shared affiliative tendencies promote jointly oriented behavior. Additionally, behavior in each session was significantly influenced by prior dyadic history, indicating experience-dependent adaptation. These findings demonstrate that continuous, transparent interaction paradigms reveal how stable personality traits and dynamic partner feedback jointly shape social strategies. By linking personality traits from the Interpersonal Circumplex to behavioral adaptations, this study contributes to bridging the gap between traditional game-theory approaches and ecologically valid models of real-world social decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Why do children sometimes include the pieces of broken things when asked to count (e.g., “Count the forks”)? In five experiments, we test two ideas: (1) that adults, but not children, exclude parts from counts by reasoning that speakers must only be interested in whole objects with functions that fulfill desired goals, and (2) that only adults exclude parts on the basis of a Gricean inference, on which it is assumed that if a speaker wanted parts to be counted, they would say so. In Experiments 1-3, we find that although children and adults are somewhat less likely to count pieces of objects when speaker goals are explicitly mentioned, large developmental differences remain unexplained. In Experiments 4-5, we provide evidence that children differ most from adults when pieces are presented in the presence of complementary parts (with which they together would form a whole), and that these pieces are significantly more likely to be conceptualized and labeled as “parts”, especially by adults. Together, these findings suggest that adults – but not children – are more likely to exclude broken parts from their counts in response to requests like “Count the forks!” when they are also able to understand that more informative requests could have been made (e.g., “Count the pieces of fork!”).",

          "abstract": "This study explores how religious and spiritual leaders across different faith factions in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic, and Traditional) understand, interpret, and respond to mental illness. While mental illness is increasingly recognized as a global health concern, in Nigeria it is often perceived through spiritual and moral frameworks that shape how communities explain and treat psychological distress. Using a qualitative design grounded in Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, five spiritual leaders were interviewed to capture their beliefs about the nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness.\nFindings revealed that all participants viewed mental illness as both a spiritual and psychological condition. Although they acknowledged biological and social causes such as trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual explanations including demonic attack, ancestral curses were dominant. Healing was described as a holistic process combining prayer, fasting, ritual purification, and, increasingly, medical treatment. This integration of faith and science challenges the misconception that African religious leaders reject psychiatry. However, moral interpretations often reinforce stigma, linking mental illness to sin or spiritual weakness.\nThe study concludes that religious leaders occupy a critical position in Nigeria’s mental health space, serving as both gatekeepers and potential collaborators. It recommends faith–health partnerships, interfaith education programs, and the inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological training. Overall, the research highlights that improving mental health outcomes in Nigeria requires a culturally grounded approach that bridges spirituality and science, recognizing faith not as an obstacle but as a vital resource in promoting psychological well-being.\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing",

We introduce a novel, online cognitive intervention—rooted in Dialectical Behavior Therapy—to reduce psychological reactivity and promote resilient cooperation. In a randomized controlled online trial (N = 318), participants played a Repeated Trust Game against an HMM-based adaptive agent trained on human data, ensuring dynamic, human-like responses under full experimental control. Compared to an active control, the cognitive intervention prevented retaliation following programmed trust violations and yielded significantly higher cooperative returns. Mixed-effects analysis revealed that while control participants became increasingly reciprocal over time (approaching tit-for-tat strategies), intervention participants maintained more stable cooperative behavior that was less contingent on partner investment levels. This change did not generalize to Prisoner's Dilemma, underscoring the intervention's specificity. These results validate HMM agents as a powerful experimental tool and suggest that targeted cognitive strategies may help support cooperative behavior; clinical efficacy and real-world deployment remain to be established.",

Participants were asked to make social predictions (whether they expected Likes or Dislikes from peers), received social feedback (Likes or Dislikes from peers) and repeatedly reported their momentary self-esteem. The sample included 55 adolescents and emerging adults with BPD symptoms and 67 matched non-clinical controls (NCC, ages 13-25). Computational reinforcement learning modeling was used to analyze their behavior. \nResults: Compared to NCC, BPD showed strongly biased negative expectations of not being liked by others. Besides, computational modeling revealed significant group differences in social learning: individuals with BPD symptoms failed to learn from frequent positive social feedback (Likes) but overweighted rare negative social feedback (Dislikes) received from generally benevolent peers. Moreover, their self-esteem was disproportionately reactive to positive feedback from critical raters, a pattern partly explained by individual differences in self-reported adverse family experiences.\nConclusions: These findings highlight fundamental disruptions in how young people with BPD symptoms learn from social feedback and how they use it to inform their self-esteem.",

In Italy, despite free access, vaccine coverage among adolescents remains low. Psychological factors and cognitive biases can influence vaccine decisions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy (VH). While social media offer new avenues for health communication, their effectiveness in reducing VH is uncertain. This study investigates the impact of Instagram-based communication strategies on adolescents’ HPV knowledge and VH.\n\nMethods A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in 22 high school classes in Tuscany, Italy, involving 526 students. Classes were assigned to one of three Instagram accounts: a neutral control, an information-based, or a bias-aware information. After three weeks (T2), students completed a follow-up survey, followed by an in-class lesson. Surveys were administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3).\n\nResults The final analysis included 301 students (mean age 15.2, 74% female). At T1, VH and knowledge scores were low (mean VH = 40%; knowledge score = 27%), and 47.9% reported likely seeking information from sexual and reproductive services. No significant changes in VH or knowledge were found at T2 overall. However, in students with low information avoidance (IA), the info-based page reduced VH significantly compared to the control (-6.9%, p = 0.009). In contrast, among high-IA students, the same intervention increased VH (estimate: +8.9%, p = 0.002). Willingness to seek information increased in the info group among low-IA students (+1.639 vs. control, p = 0.034). At T3, we measured the impact of an in-person lecture on students’ HPV and HPV vaccination literacy. A significant increase of knowledge compared to T1 is observed despite the smaller sample collected.\n\nConclusion Social media campaigns alone may not effectively reduce VH in adolescents and can even backfire among high-IA individuals. Future strategies should incorporate personalized, bias-aware messaging and interactive tools to address VH and improve HPV vaccine uptake more effectively.",

Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "Background: Migration and integration are complex processes that impact the mental health of immigrant populations. This study focuses on the mental health challenges faced by first-generation Iranian immigrants in Germany, specifically examining the role of depression, discrimination, and social integration.\nMethods: A cross-sectional, online survey was administered to 401 Iranian immigrants across 122 cities in Germany. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9, while perceived discrimination, social support, and integration were measured with custom scales. Multivariable statistical analyses were employed to identify significant predictors of depression and re-migration intent.\nResults: About 60% of participants reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Perceived discrimination (b = 1.246, p = 0.001) and unemployment (b = 2.571, p = 0.007) were positively linked to depression, while self-employment (b = −3.052, p = 0.029) had a protective effect. The strongest predictor of depression was the comparison of happiness between Germany and Iran (b = −2.457, p &lt; 0.001), with lower happiness in Germany correlating with higher depressive scores. Social support showed a trend toward buffering the effects of discrimination (b = −0.596, p = 0.085). Additionally, 63.6% of participants expressed intent to re-migrate.\nConclusions: The findings highlight the significant mental health burden experienced by Iranian immigrants in Germany, with discrimination, unemployment and lack of social support being key contributors to depressive symptoms. The high re-migration intent underscores the need for interventions addressing discrimination, enhancing social support, and improving integration pathways to reduce mental health disparities and promote social cohesion.\nKeywords: Iranian immigrants, Germany, depression, discrimination, mental health, integration",

          "authors": "Holmes Finch",
          "abstract": "The comparison of means between two or more groups for two or more dependent variables is a very common problem in psychology and other social sciences.  Most frequently, such comparisons are made using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which rests upon assumptions about the population data distribution, including multivariate normality of the residuals and homoscedasticity of group variances on the response variables.  When these assumptions are not met, the performance of the standard MANOVA test statistics can be degraded resulting in inflated Type I error rates and/or diminished power.  Recently, authors in the biomedical sciences have described approaches for multivariate mean comparisons that are based on metrics such as the Euclidean distance, which describe how separated individuals are from one another.  The ratio of the sum of squares of these distance measures between and within groups can serve as a test of the null hypothesis of no difference in the groups’ locations on the set of response variables.  The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of these distance based approaches with standard MANOVA and an approach based on multilevel modeling for heteroscedastic and nonnormal outcome variables.  In addition, the distance based techniques were also compared with the multilevel method and a log-linear model for a scenario with binary outcomes.  The results of the simulation study revealed that the distance based methods maintained the nominal Type I error rate in nearly all conditions and exhibited comparable or higher power with the other methods included in the study.  A major implication of this work is that the distance based approaches can prove useful in comparison of group location for a wide variety of data distributions including skewed, heteroscedastic, and binary.",

          "abstract": "“List as many words as you can that start with M.” The verbal fluency (VF) task is simple, yet even a typical university student only manages to produce about 15 words within one minute, and there is substantial variability around this mean. We investigated the individual differences in linguistic and domain-general skills that support verbal fluency and lead to this variability. In particular, we focused on the role of linguistic knowledge, which was calculated through six tests capturing vocabulary, amount of reading, and knowledge of grammar rules. We compared this to the role of three key domain-general skills: working memory (WM), processing speed, and nonverbal reasoning (IQ). 571 young native Dutch speakers completed semantic (category) and phonemic (letter) VF tasks, along with an individual differences test battery. We assessed the VF trials for the total number of correct words as well as two temporal variables, the time to first response and the time by which half of the responses have been produced. Linear mixed effects models revealed that linguistic knowledge was the strongest predictor of performance across all scores, and it had a larger effect than the domain-general skills. We discuss the role of linguistic knowledge and how it shapes the mental lexicon, concluding that better language skills lead to more efficient and detailed associative links between words that share semantic or phonological/orthographic features. We also provide updated norms for VF performance in Dutch and practical suggestions for using the task.",

          "abstract": "Eye gaze synchrony, the temporal coordination of eye gaze between individuals, is a key feature of social engagement and interpersonal bonding. Whereas dyadic eye gaze synchrony has been widely studied, its operationalization remains inconsistent, and methods extending beyond dyads are scarce. This proof-of-concept study introduces a reproducible pipeline for capturing eye gaze synchrony in a triadic interaction using mobile eye tracking. Three participants each wore Tobii Pro Glasses 3 during a 7-minute naturalistic conversation. Independent recordings were synchronized via a router-based setup, and gaze points were spatially aligned within a shared coordinate system anchored by a fiducial marker. We compared two analytical frameworks: a correlation-based approach using Surrogate Synchrony methods (SUSY and its multivariate extension mv-SUSY) to quantify temporal alignment of gaze, and an event-based approach assessing occurrences of mutual gaze and joint attention. The study demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing eye gaze synchrony among multiple participants. Results indicated that correlation-based and event-based measures capture distinct but complementary aspects of triadic coordination. This work provides a foundation for reproducible quantitative analyses of gaze coordination in complex social settings.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is associated with negative social behaviors impairing social relationships. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigated whether paranoid thoughts affect lonely individuals’ willingness to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity during trusting interactions in individuals with and without psychosis. We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

          "abstract": "Time-varying coefficient modeling (TVCM), which represents regression coefficients as smooth functions of continuous time, provides a flexible framework for uncovering complex patterns of change in the levels and associations among variables measured in intensive longitudinal data. However, conventional TVCM remains limited to investigating directional effects that are aggregated across individuals. The present study broadens the applicability of TVCM  in two ways. First, we introduce a TVCM formulation of the multivariate normal distribution to explore temporal dynamics in both undirected associations (or couplings) and the variability of variables of interest. Second, we integrate TVCM with hierarchical modeling, thereby extending inference from average coefficient functions across persons to their individual-level counterparts. Specifically, we explore (a) the inclusion of person-specific intercepts in time-varying coefficient functions to investigate interindividual differences at the onset of the period of interest, and (b) modeling fully person-specific coefficient functions to capture heterogeneity across the entire period, with partial pooling stabilizing individual-level estimates. To illustrate the model extensions, we apply them to six weeks of intensive longitudinal data from 16 patients with anxiety disorders participating in an attention training intervention, examining interindividual differences in changes in both the level and volatility of nervousness and threat monitoring, as well as in the temporal dynamics of their coupling. Finally, we discuss model extensions that incorporate person-level characteristics to explain interindividual differences in temporal dynamics and use these differences to predict outcomes of interest.",

          "abstract": "Taking phenomenal consciousness as explanandum, we first circumscribe it using five hallmarks. Fundamentally, conscious experience corresponds to generating a best-guess representation of what the sensory inputs the wakeful brain receives are about. This process can be computationally approached with predictive processing (PP): the brain constantly generates inferential, predictive representations to ‘explain away’ its sensory inputs. Empirical evidence supports the use of PP by the brain, yet it is not deemed sufficient to explain consciousness. We review two theories of consciousness using PP as building block: active inference theory and neurorepresentationalism. When witnessing computer simulations of PP and other computational models, they remain strikingly unconvincing as instances that might emulate consciousness. Considered in the context of computational functionalism, we argue that computational models suffer, by definition, from the ‘Problem of Numbers’: it does lie within the purview of mathematics to study numerical operations, but not to reveal all qualitative properties characteristic of consciousness. We argue that low-level neural phenomena, e.g. spike trains, can be captured by mathematics, but we need different descriptors and tools to study their emergent correspondence to high-level, conscious phenomena. These considerations also lead us to outline Indicators of Consciousness as applicable to AIs and robots.",

          "abstract": "Background: Young autistic people experience disproportionately high rates of mental health challenges, yet little is known about factors associated with suicidality in this group. This study leveraged anonymous self-report data to identify correlates of suicidal thoughts.\nMethods: Secondary analysis was performed on data for 365 young (age 11-19+ years) users of a mental health app in the UK with an autism diagnosis or self-identifying as autistic. The presence of suicidal thoughts was assessed as a binary item. Binary logistic regression was used to explore correlates of suicidal thoughts across three domains: mental health-related symptoms, autism-related factors, and adverse life events/experiences. The final model included all significant correlates from domain models and demographic factors.\nResults: Suicidal thoughts were reported by 63% of participants, with similar rates across age groups. The final model accounted for nearly 50% of variability in the presence of suicidal thoughts (R²Nagelkerke = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Self-harm and depression showed the strongest positive associations with suicidal thoughts (odds ratio (OR) and [95% confidence interval] = 6.41 [3.62, 11.35] and 4.58 [2.51, 8.35], respectively), followed by history of physical abuse (OR = 3.01 [1.20, 7.56]) and a transgender/gender-diverse identity (OR = 2.13 [1.11, 4.10]). Use of the term “neurodiversity”—reflecting a neurodiversity-affirming identity—was associated with lower likelihood of suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.45 [0.24, 0.83]). \nConclusion: This study contributes to evidence of high rates of suicidal thoughts among young autistic people and associations with self-harm, depression, a history of abuse, and a gender minority identity. Self-identification with the term neurodiversity emerged as a potential protective factor against suicidal thoughts. These findings highlight the importance of access to autism-adapted mental health care, addressing trauma and identity-related stressors, and fostering belonging and connection through neurodiversity-affirming approaches as part of comprehensive suicide prevention strategies. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether identity-affirming, connection-building interventions can support autistic youth experiencing suicidality.",

We introduce SPICE (Sparse, Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework that automates the discovery of mechanistically interpretable cognitive models directly from behavioral data. SPICE fits recurrent neural networks to capture latent cognitive dynamics and then applies sparse equation discovery to extract concise mathematical expressions describing those dynamics. Theory-guided priors make the approach data- and compute-efficient, while a hierarchical design reveals individual differences in the algorithmic structure of cognitive dynamics rather than in parameters alone. In simulations, SPICE accurately recovered the structure and parameters of known reinforcement learning models. Applied to human behavior in a two-armed bandit task, it uncovered new equations that outperformed existing models and revealed structural alterations in reinforcement learning mechanisms among participants with depression, such as a loss of nonlinear exploration dynamics regulating behavioral flexibility. This approach provides systematic insights into structural individual differences in cognitive mechanisms and establishes a foundation for automated discovery of interpretable behavioral models.",

          "authors": "Nicolás Sánchez-Fuenzalida; Simon van Gaal; Zazie van den Hurk; Timo Stein; Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort",
          "abstract": "Although many studies have claimed the existence of unconscious priming, a valid statistical procedure for substantiating such claims is often lacking. For instance, the absence of prime awareness is often erroneously inferred from non-significant p-values, and priming and awareness are typically tested by comparing the outcomes of two separate t-tests. In a classic study by Vorberg (2003), observers were slower to identify the direction of an arrow mask when it followed an arrow prime pointing in the opposite direction (priming effect), despite being unable to identify the direction of the arrow prime (prime awareness). Using that observation as a starting point, we address several methodological shortcomings that we identified in that study (as in many other studies in the field). To overcome these shortcomings, we implemented three critical changes. First, we employed a Bayesian methodological-statistical framework to test priming effects and prime awareness at the single-subject level over multiple experimental sessions. Second, participants underwent extensive training in the prime awareness task to ensure they understood and executed the task as intended. Third, we directly compared prime awareness and the priming effect. By using this approach, we show unconscious processing at short prime-mask stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) in three out of six participants, replicating Vorberg et al. (2003). However, we also show that – unlike in the original study – unconscious priming was not consistently present across all SOAs, and awareness increased with increasing prime-mask SOA. Notably, priming effects were highly consistent across participants, whereas awareness showed substantial variability across participants.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs) link number magnitude to spatial dimensions, typically yielding faster left-side responses to small numbers and right-side responses to large numbers, the SNARC effect. Although widely replicated, the SNARC effect varies across contexts, indicating that it is influenced by situational and embodied factors. The present study examined whether visual hand primes can modulate the SNARC effect in a magnitude classification task. Participants classified digits as smaller or larger than five after viewing schematic images of a left or right hand. The hand primes were task-irrelevant and centrally displayed before each digit, allowing assessment of whether visual cues associated with specific hands bias spatial-numerical mapping. Consistent with previous studies using Turkish samples, the present data revealed no reliable SNARC effect (a non-significant magnitude × side interaction) in the baseline pattern. However, a significant three-way interaction emerged among hand prime, numerical magnitude, and response side: right-hand responses were faster to large digits after right-hand primes, reflecting a partial prime-congruent modulation of spatial-numerical mapping. The effect was not influenced by participants’ habitual finger-counting direction, suggesting that the observed modulation arises from immediate perceptual context rather than long-term embodied routines. Overall, the findings indicate that SNAs are flexible and dynamically shaped by transient embodied cues, even in the absence of a typical SNARC pattern at baseline.",

This\npreregistered study1 employed a digital meeting format to examine how target individuals’\n(n=119) maladaptive personality traits (i.e., detachment, antagonistic traits, agentic traits) shape\ntrustworthiness and likability ratings made by perceivers (n=120).

          "abstract": "Disagreement about the rights and protections owed to different individuals underpins many important historical and current debates (e.g., on the abolishment of slavery, the feminist movement, abortion, and environmental protection). Recent work on moral concern (i.e., the subjectively felt moral obligation to consider an individual’s welfare and interests) has uncovered a seemingly robust hierarchy. For example, people extend most moral concern toward family and friends, followed by ingroup members (e.g., a co-worker), outgroup members (e.g., a foreign citizen), the environment (e.g., a coral reef), and, lastly, criminals (e.g., a murderer). However, these studies were all conducted in a few countries from the Anglosphere, raising doubt about the cross-cultural generalizability of the results. We analyzed a data set with 6,665 participants recruited from 41 cultural groups to explore cultural and individual variation in the hierarchy of moral concern. We find that (1) on average, across the 41 cultural groups, 11 of the 13 rankings in the typical hierarchy of moral concern replicated, pointing to substantial cultural similarities; (2) countries that are culturally more similar to the reference sample from the initial U.S. study showed a more similar hierarchy; (3) some rankings (e.g., prioritizing family and friends over human ingroups) replicated more often than others (e.g., prioritizing human outgroups over the environment) across countries; and (4) both cultural and individual differences were largest most pronounced examining people’s concern for non-human animals and the environment.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

          "abstract": "Individuals displaying cues of higher mate value (e.g., attractive characteristics) are thought to represent a greater threat to pair bonds and, consequently, elicit greater jealousy. Previous studies reporting that more feminine potential rivals elicit greater jealousy in women used stimuli in which feminine characteristics were experimentally manipulated and assessed jealousy using forced-choice methods. However, this method for assessing perceptions has recently been criticised for lacking ecological validity. Consequently, in the current study, women rated how jealous they would feel if rivals depicted in natural (i.e., unmanipulated) face photographs were flirting with their romantic partner. Facial femininity was assessed using objective analyses of shape and via third-party ratings of facial femininity. For heterosexual participants, women reported significantly greater jealousy when imagining more feminine women flirting with their romantic partner. This pattern of results was also seen for lesbian participants, although the correlation between rival femininity and jealousy was significantly weaker for lesbian participants than it was for heterosexual participants. Collectively, these results present further evidence that facial femininity of potential rivals influences women’s reported jealousy, particularly in heterosexual women, and is further evidence for the proposal that putative markers of the mate value of rivals play a role in women’s jealousy.

Using deep image synthesis, we generate input-specific target templates and compare their search guidance to conventional fixed templates. Generative templates yield more accurate target localization in naturalistic search arrays and better capture key patterns in human behavior, including search efficiency, fixation probability, and attentional guidance toward structurally similar non-targets.

          "abstract": "Theories of early numeracy assume that the logical concepts which enable formal definitions of numbers (e.g., cardinality, one-to-one correspondence, successor function) play key roles in ontogenesis, but empirical support is lacking. These concepts may not be suitable targets for theory because such definitions are reconstructions of numbers in formal language, but not explanatory of what numbers are. We propose that there should be a correspondence between those formal ideas that are generative for the natural numbers and those realized in children’s early learning. Building on our account of foundations of arithmetic (Grice et al., 2024, Psychological Review), we give a new explanatory construction of the natural numbers and a theory of early numeracy analogous to it. We show that numbers can be derived from linear order, monotonicity and convexity – principles of perceptual organization that are evolutionarily based. A key step in our construction is the ℕ-chain, the limit of finite linear orders, which we show is equivalent to the successor function but preferable as a target for psychological theory because it can be approximated in finite terms. In our theory, building blocks of early numeracy are linear orders - the number word sequence, object play schemas - and how they are related in the count routine by structure mapping (order embeddings). The number word sequence develops gradually, giving a representation analogous to an ℕ-chain when the child realizes that numbers can be generated without limit. Ordinality is prior to cardinality as the basis for numeracy, one-to-one correspondence results from convexity, and the natural numbers and arithmetic emerge jointly as a common structure. Our theory reconciles constructivist and nativist accounts because it shows that numeracy is both culturally mediated and biologically-based, although ‘core number systems’ do not play a role. The dawning of numeracy in a child’s mind is both a reinvention and rediscovery of mathematics itself.",

          "abstract": "Background\nMany theories of gambling harm propose that interactive design features of sports-betting platforms confer risk of harm by enabling cyclical patterns of repeated gambling engagement. This exploratory study investigated whether such features were used more frequently by people at higher risk of gambling harm relative to a demographically matched lower-risk control group.\nMethods\nThis study used a case-control design to compare a group of 85 people at higher risk of gambling harm (PGSI 5+) with an age- and gender-matched control group at lower risk of harm (n = 84, PGSI 0-4). We compared the frequency with which groups self-reported using in-play betting, instant cash-out, multi and micro bets, social betting, and viewing live-streamed events within a betting app.\nResults\nThe higher-risk group reported more frequent use of in-play betting and instant cash-out and were more likely to report streaming live sporting events within a betting app. Higher-risk participants were also more likely to make an immediate deposit to qualify for a marketing offer, and both groups reported being more likely to make risky bets when using bonus funds. We observed no group differences in the frequency of use of multis, micro-bets, or social betting.\nConclusions\nOur findings were broadly consistent with the theory that design features of modern betting platforms contribute to gambling harm by facilitating continuous engagement. A notable finding was that in-app streaming of live events was more common among people at higher risk of gambling harm, consistent with a novel prediction made by the motivating theory.",

          "abstract": "The developmental English Lexicon Project (d-ELP) is a database comprising word reading data for 9,961 of the most frequently printed English words for children, including continuous IRT-based estimates of word reading difficulty, accompanying word characteristics, and raw trial-level data. Data on isolated word reading accuracy were collected from 1,907 children in grades 1-5 across multiple US sites. Each child read a list of words ranging from 250 to 500 items depending on reading skill (less proficient children were often unable to finish the entire list of words), with each list representing the full distribution of word difficulties oversampled for words at the child’s reading level. Each child also attempted 99 linking items representing the full distribution of word difficulties. A total of 631,322 total responses were collected with the average child providing 336. For the final sample of words, the average number of responses per word for the 9,862 non-linking items was 47.14 (range of 10-592) and for the 99 linking items the average was 1681.42 (range of 1083-1907). A Rasch model, with planned missing design, was fit to children’s responses on the word list and linking item responses. This introduction describes the motivation for this project; the methods used for data collecting; the analytic framework used to establish a continuous measure of word reading difficulty across words; descriptive statistics of the relational database and initial behavioral results; and a publicly available search engine providing searchable access to the word difficulty ratings and associated word-level statistics.",

These behaviors do not reflect a mere dismissal of scientific authority, but rather a specific reconfiguration of epistemic trust, where selective scepticism is applied, marked by exaggerated doubt towards evidence-based authority and simultaneous uncritical acceptance of pseudoscientific claims. We review key psychological drivers of these behaviors - i.e. irrational beliefs - and different ways they interact with science. We then examine communication strategies that divert trust from unreliable sources and encourage trust in reliable ones.

          "abstract": "The divide between political liberals and conservatives is rapidly growing. Several influential theories contend that this divide hinges on orientations towards social groups, such that conservatives (versus liberals) show a greater tendency to favor their “ingroups” and discriminate against “outgroups”. However, other theories contend that liberals and conservatives do not differ in their degree of intergroup bias. Both perspectives have received empirical support, and the debate has reached a standstill. We argue that this theoretical and empirical stalemate stems from inherent limitations of examining attitudes towards real-world social groups—a strategy used by both sides of the debate. Drawing on social identity theory, we conducted a series of four studies (Total N = 4389) using “minimal groups” (i.e., experimentally constructed groups) to determine whether and why ideological differences in intergroup bias may exist. We found robust evidence of ideological differences in intergroup bias, with conservatives favoring their own social groups over others. These ideological differences were relatively small but statistically robust across most contexts we examined. Importantly, however, when groups were based on shared moral and political values, liberals showed as much intergroup bias as conservatives. These results help resolve this long-standing debate and deepen our understanding of the psychological underpinnings of political ideology.",

Generative learning helps construct meaningful mental representations, while retrieval practice supports consolidation and long-term retention. Combining both strategies may foster learning; however, research remains scarce.\nAims: We investigated how combining generative activities and retrieval practice affects students’ conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy in authentic school settings for immediate and lasting learning. Additionally, we explored associations between generation, retrieval, and explanation quality (i.e., completeness, elaboration, correctness).\nSample: The classroom experiment was conducted in authentic physics lessons with N = 344 secondary students.\nMethods: Students participated in a physics teaching unit about converging lenses and were randomly assigned within each class to one of four combinations of sequential learning activities crossing two factors (non-generation vs. generation; non-retrieval vs. retrieval). Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy were measured immediately and after eight weeks.\nResults: Conceptual knowledge and monitoring accuracy did not significantly differ between generation, retrieval, or their sequential combination at either test. However, exploratory analyses revealed that retrieval practice supported lasting learning only when prior generative processing was of low quality—that is, when students’ explanations were incomplete, less elaborated, or inaccurate.\nConclusions: Combining generation and retrieval does not universally enhance learning. Its effectiveness appears to depend on the quality of prior generative processing. In this sense, retrieval practice may serve a happy role—compensating fragile knowledge—or a redundant one, offering no added benefit when prior understanding is already strong.",

          "authors": "Arthur Hamilton",
          "abstract": "The relationship between schizophrenia and psychedelic drug states has long attracted scholarly interest and psychedelics have sometimes been described as psychotomimetic. Sense of self can be understood as the feeling of “mineness” that normally characterizes all experiences. In both schizophrenia and psychedelic experiences, alterations to sense of self are present and correlate with clinical measures. The phenomenology of altered sense of self in schizophrenia, often conceptualized as self disorder, and psychedelic experiences, often described as ego dissolution, has been noted since early twentieth-century descriptions and more recently been measured by psychometric scales. Both self disorder in schizophrenia and psychedelic states involve subjective alteration to the ordinary boundary between self and world. At the neural level, a limited number of neuroimaging studies have directly tested the associations of altered sense of self in schizophrenia and psychedelics; they have linked altered sense of self to differences in event-related potentials, regional cortical volumes, and functional connectivity. While one potential convergence was observed in EEG findings between schizophrenia and psychedelics, most results remain difficult to compare due to methodological differences. To address these challenges, the paper suggests development of a combined psychometric instrument that incorporates items from both schizophrenia- and psychedelic-focused scales, to be administered across schizophrenia, psychedelic, and control groups. This approach, supplemented by neuroimaging comparisons, could clarify the similarities and differences between these two forms of altered sense of self and their clinical relevance.",

          "abstract": "Explicit mental imagery (i.e. voluntary and conscious) can enhance learning in declarative memory. In the present work, we assessed whether implicit imagery task also enhances memory, and whether specific imagery modalities (motor, visual) selectively benefit the learning of related material. Seventy-two young adults completed a recognition task in which they learned action and non-action verbs presented after an implicit motor imagery task (i.e., hand mental rotation) or an implicit visual imagery task (i.e., number mental rotation). Results from both frequentist and Bayesian generalized mixed-effects models revealed a significant interaction between verb type and imagery modality. Congruent imagery modality (i.e. motor for action verbs, visual for non-action verbs) enhanced subsequent recognition compared to incongruent modality (i.e. motor for non-action verbs, visual for action verbs). These findings provide novel evidence that the effectiveness of mental imagery for learning is influenced by the congruence between imagery modality and the sensorimotor features of the learned items. They also suggest that mental imagery does not need to be fully voluntary or fully conscious to improve learning.",

          "abstract": "How does lexical knowledge enter the decision process? We develop a framework that links learned lexical representations directly to the evidence accumulation process, allowing explicit tests of how lexical information shapes evidence strength (drift) in lexical decision. Words and nonwords are represented with word embeddings (FastText or BERT) and passed through a compact classifier; its outputs are mapped, via psychologically interpretable functions, to evidence strength, with an additional term capturing the independent influence of lexical frequency. Hierarchical Bayesian models were fitted to the English Lexicon Project and compared using standard information criteria; posterior predictive checks and a parameter-recovery study assessed adequacy and identifiability. Across eight integrated models, diffusion-based variants (one diffusion process per response) outperformed otherwise identical ballistic race variants, and explicitly modeling frequency reliably improved fit. The best integrated model (FastText + diffusion + frequency) made more accurate held-out predictions than the benchmark models and matched--sometimes slightly surpassed--their ability to reproduce key features of the RT distribution. These results suggest that distributional lexical information, augmented by frequency, is best captured as modulation of evidence quality within standard accumulation dynamics. The approach preserves interpretability, reproduces canonical RT/accuracy patterns, and can be extended to other recognition decisions by swapping encoders or the accumulation module without changing the estimation workflow.",

Here, we aim to extend the comparative scope of decision-making analyses to consider more phylogenetically diverse organisms. To do so, we introduce the Continual Decision Making Dynamics (CDMD) framework, which characterises decision-making as a temporally extended, history-sensitive process that is sustained by self-organising and self-regulating interactions. In particular, drawing on empirical examples, we demonstrate how CDMD can accommodate the organisation of control architectures that support more distributed and decentralised modes of decision-making, and facilitate a comparative approach to decision-making strategies across phylogenetic and organisational scales. We discuss how our model can be situated among other related approaches to decision-making, capturing a distinctive subset of decision strategies that can be modelled in the absence of explicit representational structures. By foregrounding regulatory control and organisational constraints, the CDMD framework aims to provide an integrative basis for studying how diverse biological systems sustain ongoing choice in changing environments.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a multidimensional experience comprising social and emotional facets. While previous research shows that loneliness exhibits both stable and dynamic patterns across the life span, little is known about how these trajectories unfold at the facet-level. The present study investigates stability and change in social and emotional loneliness across the adult life span using two longitudinal, nationally representative datasets from the Netherlands (N = 16,732, Mage = 43.79 years, age range = 16-100 years) and Germany (N = 12,167, Mage = 63.05 years, age range = 40-97 years). We applied local structural equation modeling with second-order latent growth curve models to examine rank-order stability and mean-level change across adulthood. Measurement invariance tests supported the psychometric comparability of social and emotional loneliness items across age groups and time points. Overall, results indicated relatively high rank-order stability and little mean-level change of both facets, with nuanced, largely non-significant age-related patterns. Specifically, rank-order stability of both facets tended to increase in young adulthood and remained stable thereafter, while mean levels were highest in young adulthood and decreased thereafter, with a secondary rise in social loneliness during midlife. Beyond these general patterns, nuanced differences between both facets emerged: social loneliness showed higher baseline levels, greater mean-level change, and somewhat lower rank-order stability—suggesting higher intraindividual variability. These findings highlight young adulthood as a sensitive period for loneliness interventions and underscore the value of distinguishing between social and emotional loneliness to capture the nuanced developmental dynamics of loneliness across the adult life span.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. Slot-based lexical manipulation experiments revealed that cross-category substitutions increased K(G) by 51 bytes in abstract contexts but only 27 bytes in concrete contexts, demonstrating a 1.9:1 directional asymmetry. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Although rapid automatized naming (RAN) is typically measured by the total time to name an array of items, more precise methods may be needed to capture the full range of processes underlying RAN—including pause time, a component of total time that reflects response preparation before the articulation of each item. This study investigated whether two underexplored aspects of RAN—pause time variability (PTV) and task length—can improve or streamline the prediction of future reading difficulties. Using mixed-effects location scale models (MELSMs), which capture item-by-item variability rather than aggregating data, we were able to uncover nuanced patterns in item-level RAN responses.\n\nMethod: We utilized a longitudinal sample of 142 English-speaking kindergarteners (47.9% girls) oversampled for dyslexia risk. Item-by-item variability and change in RAN pause times were modeled using MELSMs. We then compared model fit between models with PTV and/or total time from kindergarten RAN as the predictor(s) of second grade reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension. \n\nResults: Although higher PTV significantly predicted subsequent lower reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension, PTV did not significantly improve prediction beyond total time. RAN tasks with fewer total items were worse at predicting all three reading measures compared to the longer (~40-50 item) formats.\n\nConclusions: The current practice of measuring total time instead of PTV is a robust and more parsimonious way to predict reading rate, accuracy, and comprehension in kindergarteners. RAN tasks must be sufficiently long to challenge the limits of automaticity, given the increasing cognitive demands throughout the task.",

          "abstract": "The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is central to criminal adjudication in the United States. Yet, courts continue to grapple with how best to communicate this standard to jurors. In 2022, Colorado significantly revised its model reasonable doubt jury instruction, adding language that refers to a “real possibility” the defendant is not guilty. Critics argue that this phrasing may inadvertently lower the prosecution’s burden of proof. The present study empirically examined the impact of Colorado’s 2023 model instruction on juror decision-making, comparing it to both constitutionally upheld and judicially invalidated instructions. Using a simulated mock jury paradigm and a sample of 896 U.S. participants, we examined verdicts, confidence in guilt, and perceived evidentiary burdens across five jury instruction conditions (including the Colorado 2023 model instruction). The Colorado 2023 model instruction descriptively yielded the highest proportion of guilty verdicts and significantly increased juror confidence in guilt relative to an otherwise identical instruction lacking the “real possibility” statement. Examination of hypothetical jurors’ interpretation of the “real possibility” instruction indicated that over one-third interpreted the language as assigning some burden of proof to the defense. These findings suggest that Colorado’s 2023 model instruction—particularly the inclusion of “real possibility” language—may reduce clarity of the reasonable doubt standard and potentially lower the threshold for perception of guilt and conviction. The results have immediate relevance for pending litigation before the Colorado Supreme Court and broader implications for ensuring constitutional safeguards in jury instructions nationwide.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we generalize the multidimensional discrimination (MDISC) and difficulty (MID) parameters in the Multidimensional 2-Parameter Logistic model to account for non-identity latent covariances and negatively-keyed items. We apply Reckase’s maximum discrimination point method to define them in an arbitrary algebraic basis. Then, we define that basis to be a geometrical representation of the measured construct. This results in three different versions of the parameters: The original one, based on the item parameters solely, one that incorporates the covariance structure of the latent space, and one that uses the correlation structure instead. Importantly, we find that the items should be properly represented in a test space, distinct from the latent space. We also provide a procedure for the geometrical representation of the items in the test space, and apply our results to examples from the literature to get a more accurate representation of the measurement properties of the items. We recommend using the covariance structure version for describing the properties of the parameters, and the correlation structure version for graphical representation. Finally, we discuss the implications of this generalization for other multidimensional IRT models and the parallels of our results in common factor model theory.",

          "abstract": "Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) is a subtype of anxiety. It is common in daily life and is associated with various negative effects. While previous research has explored how interpretation bias impacts anxiety, studies specifically on FoMO are limited. The present study recruited 61 participants, including 31 participants with high FoMO and 30 with low FoMO. All participants completed a modified Sentence Word Association Paradigm (SWAP) with combined behavioral data and event-related potential (ERP) recordings. We analyzed the endorsement rate and reaction time for different interpretations, along with the N400 and P600 components. Results showed that compared to the low FoMO group, individuals with high FoMO were less likely to endorse positive interpretations. They also responded more quickly when endorsing negative interpretations and rejecting positive interpretations. Furthermore, the high FoMO group exhibited a stronger N400 amplitude when processing positive interpretations. These findings suggest that individuals with high FoMO exhibit an implicit bias toward negative interpretations and a relative deficiency in both implicit and explicit positive interpretation biases, and they may have greater expectations and acceptance of negative information. This study offers important insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying FoMO and provides a valuable foundation for future intervention research.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that a brief episodic memory training, known as the Episodic Specificity Induction (ESI), in which participants recall specific details from a video, can enhance the generation of creative ideas in divergent thinking tasks such as the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). However, recent findings have questioned the robustness of this effect. To address these discrepancies, the present study reports two experiments aimed at replicating this phenomenon. In Experiment 1, young adults recalled details from cartoon clips, whereas Experiment 2 replicated the procedure of Madore et al. (2015) to examine the effect of ESI on AUT performance. Across both experiments, results provided no evidence supporting the effectiveness of ESI in enhancing creative idea generation. One possible explanation for these contrasting findings concerns the role of cultural context, as the present studies were conducted with Spanish participants, in contrast to previous research carried out in the United States. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of further research to clarify the conditions under which ESI may facilitate divergent thinking.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, consciousness science has advanced from descriptive correlations to\nmechanistic predictions. Core requirements for conscious states have been clarified, and new\ndiagnostic tools—most notably the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) derived from TMS–\nEEG—are moving toward clinical use. PCI indicates about a 95% probability of detecting\nconsciousness in non-communicative patients when purposeful behavior is present. Recent\nstudies in neurotypical individuals and communicative patients have adopted refined statistical\nmethods accounting for regression-to-the-mean effects, along with rigorous awareness scales\ndirectly validated by subjective reports. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, these approaches\nconsistently suggest that some degree of stimulus awareness is necessary for above-chance\nperformance. Consciousness thus emerges not as an epiphenomenon but as a prerequisite for\nmost purposeful behaviors in humans. This methodological progress opens new opportunities to\nbridge the long-standing divide between consciousness and cognitive sciences. At the same time,\nconsciousness, intelligence and cognitive abilities are not identical: they can dissociate in\nrevealing ways. Subjective experience exceeds its behavioral expression and remains accessible\nonly to the experiencer. These observations motivate Integrated Information Theory, an\nexplanatory framework that generate testable predictions about conscious states and qualitative\ncontents independently of behavior, while also predicting that energy efficiency requirements\nmay give rise to a tight link between consciousness and cognition in biological systems.

          "abstract": "Text complexity, an important factor of text-based learning, is typically operationalized through measures of readability and cohesion. However, cognitive load theory assumes that in addition to these measures the number of idea units that need to be held in working memory simultaneously to understand the text’s content substantially influences text complexity. This factor termed element interactivity can impact both intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. However, assessing element interactivity for texts is challenging and its influence is mostly investigated by comparing entirely different learning materials. In this study, we developed two versions of an expository text that differed only in terms of element interactivity, by making changes to argumentative structure, adherence to the given-new principle, inference explication and the amount of subordinate information. We controlled for readability, cohesion, and text length. In Experiment 1, participants who studied the text high in element interactivity demonstrated significantly poorer comprehension on a short-answer-test compared to those who studied the text low in element interactivity. However, there were no significant differences in participants’ cognitive load ratings. In Experiment 2, we presented both texts to raters which allowed for a more accurate comparison of the texts. Under these conditions, we found significant differences in judgments of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load. Our results indicate that element interactivity of a text can be manipulated systematically and that this manipulation impacts both text comprehension and cognitive load. This adds an important dimension to the conceptualization of text complexity, extending traditional measures like readability and cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Cloze tests have a long history and have been used to measure various abilities, including intelligence, reading comprehension, and language proficiency. To locate cloze tests within a nomological network of cognitive abilities, we conducted a multi-level random effects meta-analysis covering 110 years of research. Studies were eligible if they provided a measure of association between a cognitive fill-in-the-gap test and any cognitive ability test. We synthesized manifest correlations from 89 studies (N = 37,912, k = 634) and found an average correlation of r = .54 (95% CI [.49, .59], k = 485) with crystallized intelligence, r = .48 (95% CI [.42, .54], k = 69) with fluid intelligence and r =.61 (95% CI [.46, .77], \nk = 32) with general intelligence. While today's application of the typical cloze is to measure reading comprehension, our results revealed a similarly strong association with a broad range of crystallized abilities. None of the key moderators we investigated—text base, administration mode, deletion pattern, and response type—showed a significant effect. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. We conclude by revisiting the origin of the cloze test and highlighting the need for systematic studies on how different cloze test designs affect construct validity. Whereas the meta-analytic database predominantly originates from language research, where cloze tests are entrenched as markers of language proficiency, we propose reframing cloze tests as a versatile intelligence test format—just like multiple-choice tests constitute a testing method—that can be tailored to assess various specific cognitive abilities.",

Despite high rates of psychological distress among mothers, Zambia’s healthcare system currently can offer only limited support. This study aimed to understand the impact of the Problem Management Plus for Moms (PM4M) psychosocial intervention on mothers of young children and also explored strategies for systemic implementation.\nMethods: This is a qualitative study nested within a larger clinical trial aiming to qualitatively assess the feasibility, acceptability, and barriers for implementation of the PM4M intervention through feedback from 53 women caring for children under 2 years old who received the intervention from providers in community settings in Lusaka during May to August 2023. \nResults: Beyond improving mental health symptoms, PM4M was credited with expanding support networks, enhancing financial wellbeing, and fostering empowerment among participants. Providers noted personal growth resulting from training and intervention delivery. Both providers and participants stressed the importance of knowledge sharing and involving romantic partners for maximum effectiveness. Identified concerns included the need for neutral spaces during intervention delivery and addressing suicidal behaviors in women and the community.\nWhile highlighting the potential of PM4M to boost economic independence and coping skills, the study recognized obstacles to scaling up the intervention. Challenges included raising mental health awareness, combating stigma, and adapting the program culturally. Conclusions: The study underscores the program's potential impact on CMD in Zambian mothers and calls for sustained efforts in program dissemination and cultural adaptation.",

We compared computational models to test how social feedback, expectations, and PEs related to momentary affect. Results showed that social feedback and PEs best explained affective fluctuations. Social PEs predicted anxiety more strongly than social feedback; the opposite pattern was observed for mood. Further analyses indicated that higher social anxiety symptoms heightened affective responses to social feedback, whereas depressive symptoms increased sensitivity to negative PEs for mood and to social feedback for anxiety.

          "abstract": "Background. Prior studies suggest that loneliness during the school years may impair later academic performance, yet this association may be confounded by early-life socioenvironmental conditions. We examine (1) whether three early-life socioenvironmental factors (material hardship, neighbourhood conditions, and child maltreatment) and child’s verbal ability at age of 5 are associated with childhood loneliness and its persistence from ages 5 to 9; and (2) whether childhood loneliness is associated with three educational achievement indicators (low high school grades, out-of-school suspension, and educational attainment) at age 22 after adjusting for early-life socioenvironmental factors. Methods. We used data from a U.S. birth-cohort study, the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (original sample collected in 1998, n = 4,898; study sample n = 2,456). Loneliness was measured using the item “Child complains of loneliness,” reported by the primary caregiver. We applied binomial logistic regression to address the first research question and generalized propensity score weighting and weighted g-computation to explore the second question. Results. Among the children in our sample, 24.6% experienced transient loneliness, while 6.8% experienced persistent loneliness. Higher material hardship (OR= 1.17, 95% CI= 1.07-1.28) and child maltreatment (OR=1.19, 95% CI= 1.08-1.30) early in life were associated with higher odds of childhood loneliness. Moreover, higher material hardship was associated with higher odds of persistent loneliness (OR= 1.39, 95% CI= 1.21-1.60). Childhood loneliness was not associated with high-school grades, out-of-school suspension, or educational attainment in young adulthood. Conclusions. Early-life adversities are associated with childhood loneliness and its persistence. However, there was no evidence of an association between childhood loneliness and educational achievement in young adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that Episodic Specificity Induction (ESI) improves the recall of episodic details and facilitates transfer to other cognitive tasks requiring episodic thinking (i.e. divergent thinking). However, the only study examining an adapted future-oriented ESI in children has failed to show benefits in subsequent cognitive tasks. To investigate this, two experiments were conducted using the standard ESI protocol with children. Experiment 1 tested second graders, fifth graders, and young adults using children-adapted materials (i.e. TV cartoons), while Experiment 2 tested fifth graders using non-adapted materials. Both experiments confirmed that ESI improved the recall of episodic details compared to a control condition. Additionally, developmental differences in episodic recall in Experiment 1 disappeared after controlling for total verbal production, suggesting that children’s episodic memory benefits when recalling materials that are child-friendly. Conversely, unexpected findings regarding transfer effect to divergent thinking revealed no transfer effects in Experiment 2 (non-adapted materials) and a significant increase in idea fluency and flexibility following the control condition in Experiment 1 (children-adapted materials). This result may be explained by a positive mood induction, as general questions accompanied by child-friendly videos could enhance creative performance following the control condition. These findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting and adapting ESI materials to children population in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Background: A series of studies suggests that Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) can enhance perspective-taking and behavioral change by simulating real-world scenarios that people can experience from different points of view. Moreover, the use of IVR for the prevention of gender-based violence offers a promising approach to addressing issues such as sexual harassment. Despite the growing interest in IVR as a preventive tool, research on its effectiveness in fostering empathy and changing attitudes toward gender-based violence through first-person perspective-taking and embodiment remains limited, distinguishing this approach from others that may merely present harassment scenarios without altering the participant’s visual perspective. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of REVISE (REalidad Virtual Inmersiva y SExualidad, in Spanish), an IVR intervention designed to promote empathy and reduce sexual harassment behaviors in heterosexual cisgender men. By experiencing sexual harassment from the victim's perspective, REVISE seeks to encourage  behavioral changes and modify attitudes related to gender roles.\nMethods: Ninety heterosexual cisgender couples will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: 1) IVR with identity exchange in a sexual harassment scenario, 2) IVR with identity exchange in a non-harassment scenario, or 3) observation of a third-person harassment scene. The intervention will consist of a single virtual reality session followed by post-intervention assessments and a three-month follow-up. Multimodal data will be collected using self-report questionnaires, physiological measures (eye-tracking and pupillometry), and semi-structured interviews. The primary outcome will be changes in empathy, while secondary outcomes will assess attitudes toward gender roles and harassment.\nDiscussion: The REVISE trial will contribute to the growing field of virtual interventions for the prevention of gender-based violence. By integrating real-time embodiment, behavioral simulation, and multimodal assessment, the study is expected to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of perspective-taking via IVR. Findings will inform the development of future gender-transformative interventions that aim to address sexual harassment and promote prosocial behavior in men within intimate relationships.\nTrial Registration: This trial was registered under the title: “A virtual reality couples’ intervention for sexual victimization prevention: A gender-swapping transformative approach (REVISE)” which is available at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number NCT06839937 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06839937).

Here, we test how algorithms with and without prescribed social preferences, shape social decision-making and explore delegating further decisions. In an incentivized online experiment (n = 1290), participants provided social preferences for outcomes favoring oneself or an anonymous other, Social Value Orientation (SVO), as input to a decision-making algorithm. We manipulated whether for each SVO money division question, participants saw no default options (representing providing training data) or proself/prosocial default options (representing oversight of algorithms with prescribed selfish/prosocial preferences). Default options were either from an algorithm or not. Results showed that participants’ social preferences were not significantly impacted by providing input to an algorithm without prescribed preferences (vs no defaults) nor by an algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences (vs the same defaults without an algorithm and vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences). Only providing input for an algorithm with prescribed proself preferences resulted in more selfish social preferences (vs the algorithm without prescribed preferences and vs the algorithm with prescribed prosocial preferences). Moreover, counter to this, participants perceived being less influenced by proself than prosocial defaults. Most people delegated a second social decision-making task to the algorithm they were exposed to. These findings suggest that human oversight could be insufficient to address algorithmic biases, as individuals act more selfishly when exposed to pre-existing selfish tendencies in algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Living organisms constantly balance exploration and exploitation to adapt to changing environments.\nWhile the neuromodulator noradrenaline (NA) is known to regulate arousal, attention, and information\nseeking, its precise computational function remains elusive. Here, we propose an integrative theory of\nthe noradrenergic system, suggesting that it encodes expected information gain (EIG), a measure of how\ninformative the environment is over time, and that it uses this quantity for the meta-control of adaptive\nbehavior. We illustrate this theory using a hierarchical active inference model in which the NA system\nacts as a higher-level meta-controller that dynamically adjusts a set of parameters (η) of a lower-level\nbehavioral controller, modulating exploration rate, the balance between deliberative and habitual control,\nperceptual precision, learning rate, and cognitive flexibility. Simulations demonstrate that NA-based\nEIG estimation and meta-control enhance performance in volatile environments by promoting directed\nexploration, facilitating rapid shifts away from maladaptive habits, sharpening sensory evidence, and\naccelerating learning following context changes. These results unify multiple facets of noradrenergic\nfunction under a single computational objective, providing a novel perspective to explain tonic and\nphasic NA activity in estimating EIG and meta-controlling behavior. Summing up, this framework\nprovides a principled link between neuromodulation, exploration, and adaptive behavior, suggesting\nthat the noradrenergic system implements a fundamental mechanism for inferring and exploiting the\ninformational richness of the environment.",

This study examined whether, and how, Brain in Hand (BiH)—a hybrid human–digital support tool—is associated with reduced anxiety in neurodivergent and neurotypical students. \n\nDesign/methodology/approach: Seventy-two university students (60 autistic and/or with ADHD) completed baseline and 6-month surveys assessing anxiety and hypothesised pathways: coping (ability to manage overwhelm; ability to cope with day-to-day stressors), cognitive challenges, and social participation. Within-person change in anxiety was modelled as a function of change in these candidate mechanisms. Reflexive thematic analysis of 6-month semi-structured interviews elaborated pathways and the perceived contribution of BiH. \n\nFindings: Across the sample, anxiety and all candidate mechanisms improved over six months. Greater improvements in coping, reductions in cognitive challenges, and reduced participation-related difficulties were each associated with greater anxiety improvement. Qualitative themes clarified these pathways: (1) reactive in-the-moment coping and developing awareness of long-term patterns; (2) planning/structuring daily life and scaffolding anxiety management (e.g., reminders, solution prompts); and (3) increased participation/reduced isolation and earlier, more effective help-seeking.\n\nPractical implications: Findings support integrating guided digital supports like BiH as scalable complements to university provision, particularly where designs reduce cognitive burden, scaffold participation, and are responsive to neurodivergent needs. \n\nOriginality/value: In a largely neurodivergent cohort, BiH use was associated with anxiety improvement, and mixed-methods integration illuminated plausible emotional, cognitive, and social mechanisms of change. The study advances a mechanism-focused, neuroinclusive evaluation of hybrid digital support in higher education.",

          "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, synchronizing automatic and controlled behaviors is essential for successful adaptation. Yet, the relationship between these behaviors is often debated, partly due to the diverse approaches used to investigate it. The current study set out to untangle how statistical learning of environmental regularities – a process that facilitates automatic behaviors – and inhibitory control interact when both operate concurrently. Participants completed a visual four-choice reaction time paradigm that combined a statistical learning task with the Eriksen flanker task. In this novel paradigm, a central target stimulus, surrounded by flanker stimuli, was either predictable or unpredictable based on the statistical regularities induced by the sequence of target stimuli. Statistical learning was indexed by the performance difference between predictable and unpredictable trials. Inhibitory control was reflected by the flanker congruency effect, i.e., the performance difference between congruent and incongruent trials. According to our results, statistical learning and inhibitory control interacted in a cooperative way: Statistical learning was improved in the incongruent condition, and the flanker congruency effect was reduced on predictable relative to unpredictable trials. Altogether, our results suggest that reliance on environmental regularities can ease control demands, while conflict-driven control processes may, in turn, enhance the acquisition of predictive regularities.",

While cognitive-behavioral models suggest body-related cognitions and self-schemas contribute to body dissatisfaction, these mechanisms remain understudied in children.

          "authors": "Verena Heidrich; Roland Imhoff; Felicitas Flade",
          "abstract": "Humans readily categorize their social environment based on visible features regarded as diagnostic for group membership (e.g., skin color, hair color, body morphology) along lines of various social dimensions, including gender, race, age, to name just a few. Despite overwhelming evidence for the notion that these dimensions can be used to bring categorical order into the world, psychologists know surprisingly little about what determines which of these lenses is active in a given moment. The present research examines whether ecological meta-contrast provides an affordance to social categorization and selective category use. Across seven studies (N = 1,234), we manipulated meta-contrast ratios by varying the dispersion of race- and gender-related facial features to examine their effects on spontaneous social categorization. Categorization was assessed using the “Who Said What?” paradigm (Taylor et al., 1978), with categorization parameters estimated via multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Klauer &amp; Wegener, 1998), and a Speeded Categorization task (Thomas et al., 2014). Participants consistently categorized faces by race (Studies 1a, 2a) and gender (Studies 1b, 2b), regardless of meta-contrast ratio. However, when race and gender were crossed (Studies 3, 4, 5), significant interaction effects emerged: categorization along the low meta-contrast dimension decreased, while it increased along the high-meta-contrast dimension. These findings provide initial evidence that meta-contrast modulates the relative accessibility of social categorizations. The distribution of category-related features within a social information ecology thus provides affordance to some categorizations more readily than others. Study-specific patterns related to stimuli and task constraints are discussed to inform future research.",

          "authors": "David James Greeno; Candice Coker Morey; Vencislav Popov",
          "abstract": "When people encode items into working memory, the time taken to complete a secondary task slows as the memory load increases but becomes faster during retention intervals. The findings are best explained by either a reconfiguration process needed only during encoding, or by a resource-depletion model in which encoding of each item drains cognitive resource that recovers during retention. We tested diverging predictions of these accounts with a running span complex span task. List-length was unpredictable, and participants had to recall only the most recently presented N memory items. According to the reconfiguration account, after N items are presented, response times for the secondary task should stabilize. This should occur because the amount of updating required at each memory item beyond N should be equivalent. According to the resource-depletion account, each new encoding event beyond N should continue to deplete a limited resource. This depletion results in a continued slowing of response times for the secondary task. Across four experiments, secondary task response times increased with each new memory item, even after the required memory load was reached. The only exception was with memory loads of 2 where secondary task response times plateaued after 2 items. These findings place limits on reconfiguration as a comprehensive explanation for short-term memory but are mostly in line with a modified resource-depletion account.",

          "abstract": "Synchronous behaviour is widespread across social species and is a common feature of human social interaction. Prior research shows that synchrony can alter self–other processing, yet findings are inconsistent, potentially due to task differences and individual variability. In this preregistered study (54 dyads), we examined whether synchronous finger tapping influences self–other cognition across three domains: episodic memory, source memory, and emotion. Synchrony increased source memory performance but did not affect item memory. In contrast, synchrony heightened emotional egocentric bias, suggesting that synchrony can sharpen self–other differentiation in memory while increasing reliance on one’s own affective state when inferring others’ emotions. Social dominance moderated these effects. Dyads with higher combined dominance synchronized more strongly, and dominant individuals showed greater egocentric responding in memory tasks and retained egocentric bias in source memory even after synchrony. These findings highlight domain-specific consequences of synchrony and the importance of interpersonal traits in shaping synchrony outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The evidence for the structure of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model relies heavily on analyses of correlations among DSM diagnoses, which entrenches some of their limitations. In this study, we deconstructed the mental disorders covered in HiTOP into individual symptoms—with personality disorders represented via item-level assessment of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders facets—and rebuilt the HiTOP model from the ground up. Participants self-selected into an online mental health study and were randomly split into primary (n = 11,762) and hold-out (n = 3,000) samples to identify a robust hierarchy of empirically derived constructs in the results, ranging from symptoms and syndromes to very broad ‘superspectra’ of psychopathology. In each sample, both hierarchical clustering and hierarchical principal components analyses were used; the final hierarchical structure was derived based on points of cross-sample and cross-method agreement. The resulting model was remarkably similar to the HiTOP model, including nearly all of the same subfactors, spectra, and superspectra—albeit with some reorganisation in the structure. The inclusion of broad hypomania/disinhibition and pathological introversion dimensions represented the most prominent differences compared to the current higher-order structure of HiTOP. The detailed lower-order constructs found here also mirrored many of the existing components and traits in HiTOP, as well as indicating some potential areas for revision. Finally, we re-mapped the disorders included in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 onto the new model. Overall, the results suggest that the structural foundations of the HiTOP model are largely sound.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is often praised for its ecological validity, under the assumption that change observed in EMA data reflects change in the underlying constructs, independent of study participation. However, participation itself may threaten ecological validity as participants’ involvement in an EMA study may already alter their experiences, behavior or responses. Existing research on such participation effects has primarily documented their occurrence rather than explained the mechanisms through which they arise. To advance this understanding, we developed a taxonomy of potential sources of (measurement-induced) change in EMA data. This taxonomy includes increased reflection on assessed constructs (i.e., measurement reactivity), alterations to daily routines (i.e., measurement interference), shifts in how participants interpret items or response scales (i.e., reconceptualization or recalibration), practice in gauging internal states (i.e., improved introspection), and declining participant engagement (i.e., heightened careless responding or reduced compliance). Identifying these distinct sources of change highlights the need for systematic investigation of their impact and the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We therefore outline a research agenda focusing on assessing and experimentally manipulating each source of measurement-induced change in isolation. In sum, this paper aims to initiate a collective effort among EMA researchers to clarify the mechanisms by which study participation shapes data, and to safeguard EMA’s promise of ecological validity. \n\nKeywords: experience sampling methodology, measurement reactivity, (ecological) validity, response shifts, careless or insufficient effort responding",

We administered six tasks to N = 48 individuals from four species, spanning 10 sessions over 1.5 years. Task performance was most strongly predicted by stable, individual-specific characteristics rather than transient or group-level variables. Using additional data from the same individuals in other tasks, we found substantial positive correlations between non-social tasks. In contrast, tasks measuring social cognition were neither correlated with each other nor with non-social measures. Future studies should work towards mechanistic models of great apes’ cognitive processes to build an understanding of the evolution of cognition based on process-level commonalities across species.",

          "authors": "William Meese",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Modern Constructivist Model of Motivated Self-Protection (MCM-MSP), an integrative and novel theoretical account of two distinguishable forms of self-protection motivation that are underlain by diverging patterns in psychophysiological processes: (1) defensive arousal, which opposes self-threats and their implied conceptual representations to prevent self-concept instability and related consequences and (2) intrapsychic conflict, which compels restoration of self-concept stability and self-evaluative equanimity after one accepts the personal implications of a self-threat. The MCM-MSP locates each motivational orientation within a process model that describes when, how, and to what effect it uniquely compels one to strategically prevent self-concept instability or resolve it. This new explanation of self-protection motivation provides generative avenues for future research, including new ways to synthesize research examining defensive responses, new experimental approaches to testing self-protection strategies’ total causal effect, and stronger descriptions of self-protection motivation’s psychological construction using mixed-methods research and large language models.",

          "abstract": "Background: Early adolescence (ages 10–14) is a critical developmental stage marked by rapid psychosocial changes. Understanding how depressive symptoms interact with both intrapersonal and interpersonal factors during this period is essential for effective prevention and intervention.\nMethods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 2,185 adolescents aged 10–14, assessing depressive symptoms, intrapersonal factors (academic stress and self-compassion), and interpersonal factors (attachment style, family functioning, and multidimensional perceived social support). A Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) were employed to identify: (1) bridge constructs linking symptoms with intra- and interpersonal domains; and (2) potential directional pathways among variables.\nResults: Three key bridge nodes emerged: motor retardation/restlessness, academic stress, and attachment anxiety. These nodes served as critical connectors between depressive symptoms and their associated domains. The DAG analysis indicated that perceived family support acted as an upstream ancestor node, influencing depressive symptoms indirectly through self-compassion, academic stress, and attachment anxiety. Furthermore, feedback loops revealed that affective symptoms could intensify academic stress and attachment anxiety, thereby triggering downstream symptoms.\nConclusion: Findings underscore the distinct clinical manifestation of depression in early adolescence. For the early identification of adolescent depression, efforts should take into account not only emotional indicators but also behavioral withdrawal and energy-related signs, rather than relying solely on overall symptom severity scores. Interventions for this age group are likely to be most effective when deployed across multiple levels, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, and symptom-focused domains, rather than being confined to a single area.",

          "authors": "Nevia Dolcini",
          "abstract": "Hallucinations sit at the crossroads of philosophy and the empirical sciences, but are often approached with divergent aims. In philosophy, they are mainly treated stipulatively as experiences subjectively indistinguishable from veridical perception and used to probe theories of perception, justification, and consciousness. Empirical research, by contrast, investigates heterogeneous, clinically embedded hallucinatory phenomena, many of which differ phenomenologically from ordinary perception. This paper diagnoses the conceptual misalignment that follows from this divergence and offers a preliminary framework to narrow it through conceptual analysis. Rather than advancing a single unifying theory, I clarify key distinctions, including indistinguishability, insight, sense of reality, agency, and ownership, and sketch points of contact with constructs in the sciences. First, I examine leading empirical models—bottom-up, top-down, and predictive processing—highlighting what each explains and where each is limited. Second, I re-situate hallucinations within core philosophical debates on perception, mental imagery, and phenomenology, showing how empirical findings both inform and complicate current accounts. Third, I assess interdisciplinary developments that challenge unitary models and support pluralist, integrative approaches. Hallucinations are thus recast as a family of related phenomena, and the analysis provides theoretical coordinates for more productive interaction between philosophy and science",

          "abstract": "This paper leverages a variation in sensorimotor skills to explain the absorption of Neanderthals into Homo sapiens population. The paper leans on the evidence that Neanderthal DNA is implicated in Autism susceptibility and on the Neanderthal extinction theory of lack of division of labor between the sexes of the Neanderthal population. The variation in the action perception and action control meant a difference in execution capabilities between the Neanderthal and Homosapien men as well as a variation in the female evaluation skills of the male in the population for mating. Given the evidence of Neanderthal’s autism link, lack of projectile based tools, but greater stone tool innovation and ingenuity, leads me in proposing hypotheses that outline the synergy of Neanderthal innovation and early Homo sapiens superior execution during the period of coexistence. Numerical constraint on Neanderthal population is intrinsic to the evolution of an asocial innovation mind versus an execution focused mind with a bent towards socially acquired innovation requiring a greater number of individuals for transmission of information. Crucial innovations in Neanderthal era may have kickstarted the theoretical mind at the expense of fine-tuned sensorimotor skills of action perception and action control.",

          "authors": "Hendrik Meyer",
          "abstract": "This study investigates degrees of polarization in political climate protest debates on TikTok. Drawing on a dataset of automatically transcribed TikTok videos posted by German politicians between 2022 and 2025 (N ≈ 1,700), alongside associated user comments (N ≈ 53,000), this study compares discussions on general climate activism, reformist activism (Fridays for Future), and disruptive activism (Letzte Generation). Using a mixed-method approach that combines Large Language Model–based frame classification, stance detection, and network analysis, this study operationalizes Discursive Polarization across ideological, affective, and interactional dimensions. Findings reveal that while all protest debates on TikTok are polarized, disruptive protests trigger particularly intense attacks, diverting attention away from policy-oriented climate discussions. However, politicians from conservative and far-right parties consistently frame all activists as extremists, criminals, or threats to public order, with far-right accounts dominating both content production and audience support. Network analyses demonstrate that far-right politicians and their supporters form coordinated and highly connected clusters in which both emotionally positive and hostile user engagement reinforces elite-driven antagonism. Even moderate and supportive posts by centrist or left-wing politicians attract disproportionate backlash, illustrating asymmetric polarization dynamics driven by partisan user networks. Overall, the study shows that political TikTok debates around climate protest are consistently polarized along ideological lines, but that disruptiveness intensifies antagonistic engagement and weakens Connective Action among supporters. Most crucially, far-right politicians emerge as the clear beneficiaries of TikTok’s algorithmic affordances, which—coupled with connected outrage that mobilizes their supporters—enable them to dominate debates and entrench Discursive Polarization through Connective Counteraction.",

VENPRES-A consists of three main datasets: a polling station-level dataset with 77,737 observations, a municipal-level dataset with 1,668 observations, and a long-format party-level dataset for the 2024 election with 953,800 observations, providing granular insights into spatial dynamics of political competition, voting behavior, and subnational electoral trends. The dataset leverages a combination of sources: official releases from electoral authorities, official data archives collected by civil society and opposition actors, and secondary sources. Combining these sources was crucial to compensate for the withdrawal of all official records since July 2024. This empirical contribution enhances the study of subnational electoral dynamics in authoritarian environments.",

Participants were aged 26–58 years and represented the fields of psychology, psychiatry, social work, counselling, and occupational therapy across both public and private settings. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. \nResults: Practitioners described profound joy, reward, and fulfilment in their work, articulated across five themes: (i) affirmation and authenticity of trans youth in practice, (ii) trans youth transformation and hope, (iii) familial love, bonds, and support, (iv) professional collegiality and co-learning, and (v) personal and professional growth and impact. Trans joy was experienced as “contagious,” generating hope and a sense of shared humanity. By reframing trans-affirming mental health practice through the lens of joy, this study shows how such work can be a powerful source of meaning, fulfilment, and growth. Recognising these affective dimensions of practice offers a more balanced understanding of gender-affirming care and underscores the importance of supporting those who deliver it within an increasingly politicised context.",

          "abstract": "We propose a unified microeconomic theory that takes the behavioral rules of firms in real markets as the endogenous mechanism through which market structures are generated, replacing the standard practice of imposing perfect competition, monopoly, and other market forms as exogenous assumptions. Under a set of minimal axioms (consumer utility maximization, firm profit maximization, firm entry/exit mechanisms, and market clearing) and by introducing realistic cost and demand structures (firm-level cost heterogeneity, fixed costs, and demand elasticity, among others), pricing behavior and market structures long treated as exogenous (such as perfect competition and monopoly) are derived endogenously as equilibrium outcomes of firms' profit-maximizing behavior. Within a single framework, the theory nests traditional cost and marginal analysis, game-theoretic approaches to imperfect competition, and the Walrasian general equilibrium model; different regions of the parameter space naturally yield equilibrium outcomes corresponding to perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and competitive-fringe structures. Our analysis shows that perfect competition is only a highly symmetric and intrinsically unstable equilibrium point: even small cost differences suffice to push the system toward more common monopoly or oligopoly configurations, while positive feedback mechanisms render these structures stable, helping to explain why market power is not easily competed away. Under empirically observable premises, the theory coherently derives the principal market forms and, in doing so, clarifies the domains of applicability of various classic models. It can also be used to predict which market structures industries will evolve toward under given conditions, providing a unified and operational theoretical foundation for empirical research, industrial policy, and firms' business and competitive strategy decision-making.",

Drawing on sociologist Robert Merton’s concept of the “Matthew effect”—by which prominent scholars accrue still more recognition—I argue that these AI tools risk reinforcing existing biases along lines of gender, geography, and institutional prestige. The problem is twofold: the models are trained on historically biased scholarship, and their filtering logic is inscrutable. My claim is that these tools are performative, not merely descriptive, as they may help enact the scholarly landscape they purport merely to represent.

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Loss-Cutting Equation under JX Theory, a transdisciplinary framework that formalizes withdrawal behavior in decision-making as a structural equilibrium. The model expresses payoff dynamics as\nLₒₚₜ(x) = R(x) − S(x) − E(x) − λσ²(x) + φΔF(x),\nwhere R denotes reward, S social cost, E internal exhaustion, λσ² perceived uncertainty, and φΔF cognitive correction.\nThis formulation redefines loss-cutting not as an emotional failure but as a rational equilibrium transition occurring when internal and social costs exceed reward expectation. The paper illustrates two principal diagrams: the static equilibrium boundary on the E–S plane and the dynamic tolerance-band crossing governed by ΔA(t). Together they describe how agents shift from inertia to decisive action under bounded cognition.",

This paper utilizes two primary datasets, the Populist Leaders and the Economy and the World Values Survey in Wave 7, covering more than 34,498 respondents in 32 countries. Logistic regression with marginal effects shows that the independent variable of epistemic overconfidence stands out as the strongest and most positive explanatory variable for populist support besides economic, institutional, and media trust-related variables. This result is robust to nonlinearities in media use and trust, indicating that excessive use of digital media increases populist support. Because the PTI substantially improves model fit, it is essential to the understanding of contemporary populism.",

          "abstract": "The present study focuses on persistence in research productivity over the course of an individual’s entire scientific career. We track “late-career” scientists—scientists with at least 25 years of publishing experience (N=320,564)—in 16 STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) and social science disciplines from 38 OECD countries for up to five decades. Our OECD sample includes 79.42% of late-career scientists globally. We examine the details of their mobility patterns as early-career, mid-career, and late-career scientists between decile-based productivity classes, from the bottom 10% to top 10% of the productivity distribution. Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less). Our regression analyses show that productivity classes are highly path dependent: there is a single most important predictor of being a top performer, which is being a top performer at an earlier career stage.",

Instead, this phenomenon increases support for the ruling JDP by 5.8% through social media, while exposure to or use of news decreases support for the main opposition RPP by 4.5%. These results suggest that post-truth impacts are context-dependent and that social media use and news exposure may reinforce people's voting behaviour in Türkiye.",

          "abstract": "This study examines biologists leaving science in 38 OECD countries in the past two decades. We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time.",

          "abstract": "Informal political conversations are vital for the functioning of liberal democracies, especially when they involve individuals with differing political views. While prior research suggests that incidental and non-political factors may guide individuals’ choice of discussion partners and outweigh strictly political ones, this article argues that these dynamics may shift depending on the topic of discussion. Drawing on original personal network data from the highly polarized context of Catalonia, Spain (65 citizens reporting on 663 social relationships), we compare discussion partner selection across three topics: general politics, Catalan independence (high polarization), and climate change (low polarization). We examine: (1) the extent to which political and non-political interpersonal factors facilitate or inhibit political discussion, and (2) whether their influence varies by issue polarization. Contrasting previous findings, our results reveal that opinion similarity is the strongest predictor of discussion partner selection across all topics, even when controlling for interaction opportunities, highlighting the role of purposeful partner selection. Selection on non-political factors such as tie strength, structural proximity, and socio-demographic similarity also occurs, but their influence varies depending on the issue being discussed. Tie strength and network centrality were more powerful predictors for discussion on the more polarized issue. Overall, the findings reveal that individuals selectively activate ties for political talk, and that issue polarization amplifies this selectivity, thus linking topic-alter dependence in informal political discussion networks with the growing literature on affective polarization.",

          "abstract": "With roughly 40% of new couples meeting online, dating platforms have become commonplace. Yet, they share a common pitfall: a skewed gender ratio, with men substantially outnumbering women. Combined with prevailing gender norms—where men are expected to make the first move—this creates market congestion. Women are overwhelmed by messages and often face harassment, while many men struggle to receive any attention. We use computational experiments to examine how dating-platform designs affect individuals’ mating choices. We replicate popular app designs using a self-built web application and generate artificial profiles by combining images with socio-demographic data. Building on past research, we compare a “control” design with two interventions that reveal profiles’ popularity and capacity. Based on 66.132 profile ratings from participants in four countries, we find that the experimental conditions alone do not significantly shift user choices. We then analyze treatment heterogeneity using our large sample. Results show that visual and textual capacity indicators reduce the number of likes for highly attractive profiles, particularly when rated by men. However, these interventions do not increase engagement with less attractive profiles. These findings suggest that instead of redirecting attention to less attractive users, the intervention mostly benefits those who are already popular.",

This commentary brings together such evidence from outside psychology: quasi-experimental studies of military conscription, longitudinal research on fraternity hazing, and new archival work on When Prophecy Fails and other prophetic movements. Across democratic, authoritarian, and small-group settings, coerced or effortful participation fails to generate the attitudinal justification predicted by induced compliance. Across fraternities, hazing does not predict greater group solidarity. Cults do not tend to survive failed prophecies. Together, these findings suggest that the effect is fragile and context-dependent, and that its privileged status in social psychology warrants re-examination",

The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement, a pattern visible much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization.

          "abstract": "The accessibility of scholarly research plays a crucial role in shaping academic impact and societal engagement. This study examines how Open Access (OA) models - Gold, Hybrid-Gold, Green, and Bronze - as well as Closed Access are associated with bibliometric and altmetric indicators in publications authored by Israeli researchers from 2013 to 2023. By integrating Scopus and PlumX data, the study analyzes variations in academic impact (citations, captures, and usage) and societal engagement (social media and mentions) across access models and over time. The findings show that Bronze OA is associated with higher levels of bibliometric and altmetric indicators. Hybrid-Gold OA demonstrated citation and altmetric gains that closely approached those of Bronze OA, with the highest levels of mentions. In contrast, Closed Access exhibits the highest usage metrics. Additionally, a greater number of authors corresponds with higher bibliometric and altmetric values. The relationship between academic impact and societal engagement has strengthened in recent years, particularly for Open Access publications, suggesting an increasing alignment between public attention and academic recognition. Furthermore, publications with high academic impact, strong societal engagement, and multiple authors are more commonly associated with Open Access status. The association between societal engagement and academic impact appears strongest among high-impact publications, whereas author count shows greater explanatory power among lower-impact work. These patterns offer valuable insights for researchers, institutions, policymakers, and publishers seeking to better understand scholarly dissemination. They also contribute to ongoing discussions on Open Access policies by describing patterns of access, engagement, and impact in an evolving academic landscape.",

This tutorial addresses these challenges by offering a format for audit trailing enabling researchers to make the research process open. The format is grounded in key concepts such as transparency, reproducibility, traceability, auditability, reflexivity, and positionality. Supplementary materials, including guiding questions and a blank template, are provided to support implementation. A pilot application illustrates how the audit trail offers a feasible pathway for integrating open science practices into qualitative research while safeguarding participant confidentiality.",

This review evaluates the key mechanisms by which emerging digital technologies are reshaping humanitarian practice and posing new challenges to patients, practitioners and policy-makers in low-resource environments.\n\nFirst, we examine emergent physical and psychological harms stemming from digital technologies at the individual patient level, summarising the latest evidence on injuries from drone-induced trauma, multi-robotic systems (MRS) and electromagnetic (EM) weapons. Second, we discuss population-level risks in global health settings, detailing the clinical harms associated with hospital cyberattacks in hybrid warfare and the novel challenges of AI-enhanced technologies for non-profit agencies attempting to deliver care (e.g., misinformation and “Deepfakes”). Further, we illustrate the new vulnerabilities that emerge as humanitarian agencies transition to electronic and biometric databases, highlighting the associated privacy risks for asylum seekers and refugees. Drawing together the latest insights from frontline practitioners, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), we showcase specific technological threats affecting vulnerable patient groups, such as the deployment of GPS trackers and implants by sex trafficking groups, and the use of social media by modern slavery networks. \n\nThis article introduces global health and humanitarian practitioners to essential digital concepts that are increasingly relevant to their work in the field, including Swarm Intelligence technologies, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), Large Language Models (LLMs), Cyberwar, Netwar and electromagnetic (EM) warfare.

Fricker’s ethico-epistemic notion of epistemic injustice, which focuses on harms to knowers rather than the truth of claims, struggles to apply in empirical fields where error can have material health consequences. In global health, the usage tends to conflate moral recognition with epistemic warrant. It encourages the levelling of credibility across competing claims irrespective of evidence. I trace how decolonial and pluriversal rhetoric—drawing on Quijano, Grosfoguel, Mignolo, and Lugones—extends this conflation into ontological pluralism, dissolving truth into perspective while retaining universalist health ambitions. Through cases of spirit children, umbilical cord care, and snakebite treatment, I show how these frameworks can licence harmful practices and obscure structural analyses of power independent of coloniality. I conclude by sketching a modest alternative: epistemic humility, realist standards of evidence, and procedural justice in access to the means of inquiry.",

This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

          "abstract": "Background: The debate over the impact of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) structural adjustment programs on borrowing countries has been a central topic in political economy for decades. The empirical evidence is profoundly heterogeneous and often contradictory.\nObjective: This systematic review with narrative synthesis synthesizes and critically analyzes the literature to assess the effects of such programs on key indicators like poverty, income inequality, social spending (health and education), health outcomes (mortality, infectious diseases), the labor market, and informality.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in five academic databases and grey literature, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 53 studies and empirical contributions that met predefined selection criteria were included. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, paying special attention to the control of endogeneity and selection bias. Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the results were synthesized narratively.\nResults: A minority of studies, often employing methodologies with a higher risk of bias such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), find no significant negative effects. In contrast, a robust body of research, using quasi-experimental designs with a low risk of bias like Instrumental Variables (IV), documents an increase in inequality, a deterioration of health outcomes (especially in tuberculosis and child mortality), and a rise in the informal economy as a consequence of IMF conditionalities.\nConclusion: The differences in findings are largely attributed to the diversity of methodologies and the rigor with which they address causal inference. Higher-quality evidence suggests that IMF programs, particularly those with austerity conditionalities and structural reforms, impose significant social costs. These impacts call for a redesign of conditionality that prioritizes social protection to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.",

          "abstract": "The growing interest in sustainability has generated a vast academic literature on the intersection of climate change, green finance, and financial markets. However, heterogeneity in methodologies and results often makes it difficult to draw unified conclusions. This paper presents a review of meta-analyses and systematic literature reviews to synthesize the current state of knowledge. By analyzing a corpus of 22 reviews, we assess the consensus on three key areas: 1) the impact of climate risk (physical and transition) on asset valuation, 2) the existence and magnitude of a green financing premium (the \"greenium\"), and 3) the effects of green finance practices on corporate and banking profitability. Our findings indicate an emerging consensus on the pricing of physical climate risk in the real estate market and a modest but persistent negative premium for green bonds. However, the impact of sustainable finance on financial profitability remains ambiguous and highly dependent on the methodological context. This synthesis consolidates quantitative findings, evaluates prevailing methodologies, identifies research gaps, and proposes an integration theory with an agenda for future research, highlighting the need for greater standardization in metrics and analytical approaches to strengthen the robustness of empirical conclusions.",

I will then investigate how AI infrastructure’s need for massive amounts of electricity, water and rare earth minerals is transforming the playing field of international law, noting that the consolidation of Big Tech corporations has already impacted the political economy of law.  Finally, I will discuss the ideology of artificial general intelligence (AGI),  and propose that the European approach to legislating, governing and judging artificial intelligence (AI) as ‘a normal technology’ is a viable though contested alternative that must be consolidated, defended and further developed to survive geopolitical power grabs by the US, Russia and China.",

          "authors": "Isabelle DeSisto; Elizabeth R. Nugent",
          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile should deescalate conflict, recent empirical studies find that exile fuels political instability. We extend this finding by investigating the conditions under which exile exacerbates domestic contention. Drawing on an original database of exile participation in revolutions, we show that revolutionary situations with an exiled challenger tend to last longer and generate more violence than those with domestically-based challengers. Additional analyses illuminate the mechanisms behind this finding. First, exiles have a greater influence on revolutionary duration and violence when they take refuge in a geographically proximate location or maintain a meaningful presence abroad throughout the revolutionary situation. Second, exiles escalate contention by providing direct leadership, securing international support, or maintaining a government-in-exile. Finally, exiles have a stronger escalatory effect on revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our research unpacks a widespread and highly consequential -- but hereto understudied -- feature of revolutionary contention and outlines a research agenda on exile and domestic contentious politics.",

          "authors": "Andrew David Eaton; Megan Rowe; Leyna Lowe; Allannah Nguyen; Claire Ryder; Amanda Mathew",
          "abstract": "Alternative crisis mental health responses are models that differ from the default, policy-only model of responding to emergency reports of acute psychological distress in the community. The two prevalent alternative models are co-response, pairing police with a civilian (such as a nurse or social worker) and civilian response, whereby first responders are not police. Two scoping reviews have been completed that synthesize key processes from the literature that underpin co-response and civilian response. Informed by transformative justice and the principle of the collective, this protocol details a knowledge-to-action (KTA) study whereby summaries of those scoping reviews will be used as prompts for semi-structured interviews with interest-holders (frontline service providers, people with lived experience of mental health crises, policymakers, and mental health scholars and advocates) across the United States and Canada. Interviews will focus on participants’ experiences with and perceptions of crisis response, as well as their opinions about the accuracy and relevance of the scoping reviews. The analytic plan incorporates content analysis and interpretive phenomenology to capture both the patterns that emerge and the meanings that participants attach to their experiences, producing a more layered and comprehensive analysis than either method could achieve alone. This protocol represents one of the first research plans to apply the KTA cycle and the first known study to propose that a team of researchers first synthesize the literature and then interview key informants about the accuracy and applicability of those knowledge syntheses. Findings may highlight discrepancies between the literature and the field, with a focus on alternative crisis mental health response.",

          "abstract": "Asset tests are widely employed to ensure that welfare resources are targeted efficiently and equitably to people that do not have the resources to be self-sufficient. This paper looks at how asset testing in social welfare programs works in the European Union and the United States and reviews the evidence on the consequences of asset testing for eligibility and behavior. For that purpose, we follow the PRISMA guidelines for study selection and synthesis, systematically reviewing 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, covering the United States and European Union, to assess the impact of asset testing.\n\nOur review finds that the real-world implementation of asset tests often undermines their stated goal of poverty reduction. While asset tests can improve targeting, they frequently discourage savings, perpetuate financial insecurity, and create administrative barriers that reduce participation among the most vulnerable. Hard thresholds incentivize dissaving and trap households in precariousness and long-term dependency, while administrative complexity often offsets any efficiency gains. Recent policy reforms-including higher thresholds, inflation-indexing, and asset exemptions-offer promising alternatives, but a persistent tension remains between targeting efficiency and poverty alleviation. We conclude that graduated approaches rather than straight disqualification better align welfare eligibility with the goals of financial resilience and poverty reduction.

This survey study aimed to map the current ecosystem of behavioural research across UK sectors to identify priorities for its application, capability needs, and opportunities for strategic integration to effectively address these challenges. Invitations were distributed via mailing list, website, social media channels, and snowball sampling. We received 657 responses by people who conduct or use behavioural research in public, private and voluntary sectors. Respondents reported conducting applied (93 per cent) and/or pure (27 per cent) research across the UK. Current priorities for the application of behavioural research centred on climate action, health, methodological advances, and use of artificial intelligence. Perceived capability gaps include technological abilities, and knowledge relating to intervention design, implementation and evaluation. Broader barriers to conducting behavioural research include lack of confidence, limited funding and training, access to 'experts', and lack of acceptance of behavioural research. Findings highlight a need to increase capability through addressing skills and knowledge gaps, leadership engagement, and increasing resources for collaborative translation of behavioural research into practice. Approaches to addressing findings are being explored through sector-specific workshops and will inform future survey waves.",

To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).",

          "abstract": "As news organisations adopt artificial intelligence (AI), they face growing pressure to be transparent about when and how it is used – yet practical approaches remain uneven. This paper examines AI transparency through an in-depth case study of the Financial Times (FT). Drawing on 13 semi-structured interviews with 12 senior managers across editorial, product, data science, and communications, together with internal documents, we show that the FT approaches transparency as a hybrid of policy, process, and practice, framed by a desire to safeguard both internal and external trust. Transparency is calibrated to context: internally, AI use is signposted in tools and reinforced through training and personal accountability; externally, the prominence of disclosure scales with system autonomy and editorial oversight, with stronger labelling for no-human-in-the-loop features than for AI-assisted, journalist-edited outputs. We identify nine factors that shape audience-facing disclosure – legal/provider requirements, industry benchmarking, nature of the task, human oversight, system novelty, audience expectations, perceived risk, commercial sensitivities, and design constraints – and five crosscutting challenges, including site-wide consistency (especially on mobile) and potential “transparency backfire.” Conceptually, our analysis links AI transparency to isomorphic pressures and to intersecting institutional logics. We argue that AI transparency in news is best understood as a spectrum, evolving with technological advancements, commercial, professional and ethical considerations and shifting audience attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Differences, such as gaps or contrasts, are crucial to theories in the social sciences. However, modeling these differences in structural equation modeling (SEM) remains challenging. Existing approaches have limitations that prevent researchers from modeling and testing differences flexibly. This paper introduces the H–O specification for modeling differences, a flexible SEM specification that overcomes these limitations. Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions. Using an empirical example from marketing research, we demonstrate that the H–O specification can reproduce the results of existing approaches while offering greater modeling flexibility and more opportunities to test differences.",

This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.",

A case study is conducted using a phenomenological and interpretive approach to compare two delivery models in the local cultural sector: one based on direct delivery (B2C) and the other on a third-party delivery (collaborative platform). This research uses interviews, participatory observation, and visual analysis. The findings show that artisanal bread and hipiles go beyond being mere economic goods; they are cultural stories that strengthen social unity, knowledge transmission, and the local economy, especially when women play a key role in knowledge management. The semiotic examination highlights that these products represent cultural signs with symbolic value, which affect how consumers perceive them and foster the sustainability of identity. The discussion underscores the relevance of cultural heritage as a source of competitive advantage and the role of inclusive cultural public policies. It follows that incorporating organizational strategies focused on gender and interculturality makes it possible to strengthen the relationship between tradition and innovation. This contributes to the well-being of Indigenous communities.",

Critics of this view argue that it is incompatible with estimated treatment effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which tend to be small. I argue that these RCTs provide little evidence against the social media hypothesis: the causal effect identified by RCTs fundamentally differs from the causal effect invoked by the social media hypothesis in at least three ways. First, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of joining social media, whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of quitting social media. Second, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of using social media for many years, whereas RCTs typically identify the effect of quitting social media for several weeks. Third, and most overlooked, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of altering the behavior of large swaths of the population—a global intervention—whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of local interventions. In such local interventions, a person may be encouraged to quit social media, but both her immediate peers and the general public continue to use social media in large numbers. In this commentary, I discuss the local–global distinction at length and explain why the global intervention plausibly had much larger effects than experimental local interventions.",

          "abstract": "Big data and computational methods have generated great excitement and enthusiasm among scholars across the social sciences. In the form of government records and digital traces collected by companies, big data are abundant, constantly updated, and inexpensive to collect, giving researchers an unprecedented window into everyday behavior. For sociologists interested in solving social problems, big data likewise seem like an attractive source of evidence for developing policies and interventions. In this paper, we draw on lessons from our research on online fundraising and social welfare provision, which uses both big data analyses as well as conventional methods, to consider how big data can be used to solve unsolved social problems. We introduce the smokescreen analogy to characterize how big data can obscure rather than clarify social problems. Digital traces often serve as a veneer over longstanding issues, leading researchers into a \"description trap\" where they generate detailed accounts at the expense of identifying causes and solutions. However, behind every smokescreen is a smoke machine. We argue that analyzing the platforms generating digital traces can reveal their causal role in shaping social problems. Big data's relationship to problem-solving is ultimately ambivalent: it can both enable new solutions and distract from enduring causes.",

We focus on this earlier and often hidden step and argue that partisan perspectives shape which evidence politicians attend to in the first place. We test this claim in a real-world field setting during the 2024 Austrian parliamentary election campaign. Three weeks before election day, we emailed 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration policy reform: one emphasizing how benefit cuts reduce migrant inflows, the other that such cuts increase poverty among immigrants. By tracking click behavior, we measured which type of evidence each candidate selected. Our analysis shows that selection of ideologically aligned evidence is concentrated among extreme parties: candidates from the far-right Freedom Party of Austria disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrist candidates show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of 1,428 citizens indicates that far-right supporters approve of elites' selective attention to evidence, suggesting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences at the political fringes. These results identify evidence selection as an important stage in policymaking and imply that rising far-right electoral strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, potentially increasing the risk of ill-informed policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "In this examination of gender differences in financial expectations in academia, we used survey data (N = 11,315 scientists and scholars, 19 academic disciplines) integrated with individual-level bibliometric and demographic data from Scopus. We studied what Polish scientists and scholars with various demographic characteristics, academic attitudes, and bibliometric profiles considered their dream salary. Top dreamers were defined as the upper 10% of scientists in terms of self-reported level of their dream salary. Gender differences are much weaker than expected: Women generally tend to have almost equal dream salaries compared to men across age groups, academic positions, and disciplines. Although men are 56% overrepresented in the group of top dreamers, their financial expectations are similar compared to women. Among top dreamers, the median dream salary for men is only 5% higher than the median dream salary for women. Across all STEM disciplines combined, men on average expect salaries 19% higher than women (in non-STEM 15%, and in MED only 11%). Strongly research-oriented men expect higher median salaries than strongly research-oriented women; male top performers (the upper 10%) expect higher salaries than female top performers; and male internationalists in research expect higher salaries than female internationalists. Finally, as logistic regression shows, men with a strong research orientation, working in STEM disciplines, and with strong international research collaborations are most likely to be top dreamers.",

          "title": "On Outsourcing: An Integrated Framework on Process Phases, Core Know‐How Retention, and Organizational Knowledge Transformation",
          "authors": "Matthias Hümmer",
          "abstract": "Outsourcing has emerged as a strategic approach that allows organizations to improve efficiency, access specialized expertise, and focus on their core business functions. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the potential erosion of internal organizational knowledge and core competencies that are central to a firm's competitive advantage. This article synthesizes literature on outsourcing processes, core competence theory, dynamic capabilities, and knowledge management to propose a comprehensive integrated framework spanning the entire lifecycle of outsourcing arrangements. The framework encompasses four critical phases that are strategic preparation, vendor selection and contracting, transition and integration, and post-transition governance, with particular emphasis on protecting and reinforcing internal knowledge resources. Drawing on empirical evidence and theoretical contributions from leading scholars in the field, we demonstrate how firms can effectively balance outsourcing efficiencies with the imperative to retain essential know-how. The article concludes with theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research, providing both scholars and practitioners with a robust model for preserving critical organizational knowledge while capitalizing on external efficiencies.",

          "authors": "Bryce Petofi Towne",
          "abstract": "This paper orthogonalizes information symmetry (who holds information) from information completeness (whether available information suffices for a target decision or inference). We formalize two dimensions of completeness: static (relative to a finite time window) and dynamic (absolute, intertemporal). Static incompleteness arises when currently admissible signals are insufficient to identify the target; dynamic incompleteness arises when further, in-scope and decision-relevant information is foreseeably forthcoming. Within a measurable \"scope\" and an information filtration, we define probabilistic relevance as primitive, relate it to decision relevance via Blackwell monotonicity, and characterize static completeness as (approximate) point identification while dynamic completeness requires the absence of any future relevant arrivals. We distinguish institutional regimes—closed versus expandable scope—and show non-confirmability results in expandable scopes: finite evidence cannot certify either the absence of omitted relevant variables (static) or the absence of future relevant information (dynamic). We provide audit-style certificates (sufficient conditions) and falsifiers (stop-tests) for both notions, and connect the framework to partial identification, robust decision-making, rational inattention, and optimal stopping. The key implication is normative and methodological: in open environments, \"best\" actions are conditional and time-indexed rather than absolutely correct, so governance and empirical practice should report identification-set diameters, treat scope as a policy lever, and prefer falsifiable, continuous disclosure over once-and-for-all attestations.",

          "abstract": "The Internet irrevocably changed global communication, building networks among global publics and providing them with a platform for their views and exposure to others. Social media platforms may serve as modern public spheres, offering spaces for publics to engage in rational and critical discourse. The affordances of social media platforms are crucial in providing such opportunities for dialogue and exchange. In the broader context of mediatization, we examine how platform socio-technological affordances, such as anonymity, reward systems, and moderation guidelines, coupled with user practices, co-shape the way information is produced, framed, and consumed within online communities. This study employs digital ethnography as a method to observe selected subreddits and interviews with their users, focusing on their experiences and perceptions of these digital spaces. Our preliminary findings indicate that, alongside external influences, inherent tensions between social and technological mechanisms simultaneously hinder and contribute to the nature of online deliberation, highlighting fundamental ambivalence as a structural element of online deliberative spaces. Ethical implications of socio-technological affordances are also briefly discussed.",

          "abstract": "What kinds of societal factors facilitate agricultural recovery and damage mitigation?\nMany previous studies have demonstrated that the three forms of capital—social capital, economic capital, and human capital—contribute to various aspects of post-disaster recovery.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether these forms of capital are also linked to the recovery of industries and land use.\nTherefore, this study examined the effects of these three forms of capital on agricultural recovery.\nAgriculture is a key sector for achieving a sustainable society, and it is desirable that farmland continues to be properly utilized even after disasters. \nClarifying the characteristics of regions where farmland is appropriately maintained after a disaster is thus essential for realizing sustainability.\nIn this study, we employed satellite remote sensing and causal inference methods to investigate changes in paddy utilization in areas affected by the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan. We then examined the relationships between fluctuations in paddy field use and village-level social, economic, and human capital.\nThe results suggest that in severely affected areas, after controlling for other regional characteristics, social capital had a positive effect on agricultural resilience. \nBy contrast, in areas with relatively minor disaster damage, economic capital had a positive effect, whereas human capital exhibited a negative effect.\nThese findings imply that the effects of different forms of capital are not consistent, and that their impacts on agricultural resilience may vary depending on severity of the physical damage. \nThis study contributes new insights to the fields of social science and disaster research, while also offering methodological advances to these disciplines.",

          "title": "Rebuilding Trust in Medical Science: A Narrative Review and Structural Reform Framework",
          "authors": "Alex Tarnava",
          "abstract": "Background: Public trust in medical science has eroded substantially over the past decade, not merely because of misinformation but due to deeper structural failures embedded within the pharmaceutical, regulatory, and academic ecosystems. Profit-oriented incentives, revolving-door politics, and misaligned academic reward systems have collectively undermined transparency and accountability. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these longstanding weaknesses, exposing how institutional opacity and commercial influence can distort evidence, policy, and ultimately, public confidence.\nMain body: This narrative review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence from peer-reviewed literature, national surveys, regulatory audits, and governmental investigations to identify systemic determinants of declining trust in medical science. Three domains were examined: (1) commercial practices within the pharmaceutical industry that prioritize shareholder value over patient outcomes; (2) regulatory frameworks compromised by lobbying, capture, and outdated oversight models; and (3) academic systems distorted by publication bias, funding pressures, and privatization of publicly financed discoveries. From this synthesis, a six-point roadmap is proposed to restore institutional credibility, grounded in the principles of transparency, ethics, and accountability. The framework includes independent oversight bodies, reformed approval pathways, enforceable conflict-of-interest standards, equitable funding distribution, open-access academic infrastructures, and a centralized public feedback architecture. Collectively, these measures aim to recalibrate the social contract between science and society, ensuring that biomedical progress is both ethically grounded and publicly accountable.\nConclusion: Restoring trust in medical science requires more than countering misinformation. It demands structural transformation. By embedding transparency into corporate, regulatory, and academic governance, and by aligning scientific enterprise with the public interest rather than private gain, medical science can reclaim its moral authority. It offers an integrated reform blueprint to guide future policy and institutional renewal, reaffirming the ethical foundations upon which scientific credibility must rest.",

          "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno; Isobel Kemp",
          "abstract": "How do governments in minority regions with strong self-determination demands respond to assimilation efforts from the central state? National symbols, such as mandatory flag displays, are common tools used by states to assert authority and foster integration. This paper investigates non-compliance with such obligations in Catalonia, where many municipalities do not display the Spanish flag on town hall facades despite legal requirements. Drawing on original data from nearly one thousand municipalities between 2021 and 2024, we explore the drivers of this symbolic resistance. Contrary to expectations centred on elite strategy or state enforcement capacity, neither judicial orders nor contemporary party affiliation retain explanatory power once we control for voter preferences. Instead, the most robust drivers are localised, bottom-up, and historic. Most interestingly, we find that flag absence is overwhelmingly predicted by informal local independence referendums organised a decade earlier. After eliminating alternative mechanisms -- institutionalised path dependency, voter segmentation and current activist presence -- we hypothesise that this effect captures entrenched and enduring resistance norms within the local independence communities, which shift mayors' cost-benefit calculations. Notably, these effects are present for both secessionist and non-secessionist mayors, and for the latter, appear to override legal threats and amplify their sensitivity to local pro-independence support. These findings underscore that in deeply contested regions like Catalonia, the effectiveness of symbolic assimilation policies hinges less on formal authority or short-term elite manoeuvring, but rather localised social ecosystems.",

Drawing on research that connects political trust to democratic legitimacy, highlights its attitudinal and behavioral consequences, and underscores its contextual character as a form of political support, we hypothesize that political trust exerts a positive effect on subsequent changes in democratic quality, but only in countries that have already reached some level of democracy. We test this hypothesis with cross-lagged models fit to political trust estimates from 62 countries over 30 years, combined with democratic quality scores from the Varieties of Democracy project. We find little evidence of an overall effect of trust on democracy, and stronger evidence for a conditional effect: based on our results, political trust has a positive effect on democracy, but only in countries that have already achieved high quality of democracy.",

However, these estimates are difficult to obtain in small populations, in which data on births classified by maternal and paternal ages may be lacking or inadequate. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian model tailored to estimate the Total Fertility Rates (TFR) for both men and women at a subnational level. The model relies on population counts from age-sex pyramids and jointly models mortality and fertility patterns while accounting for uncertainty and spatio-temporal dependencies. Testing the model with simulated data that mimic Australian regions, as well as with real data from US counties, demonstrates its ability to generate reasonable TFR estimates. The estimates produced have straightforward applications to the study of subregional reproductive disparities within the US, and the proposed modeling framework can be extended to investigate subnational fertility patterns across other countries with limited birth data.",

          "abstract": "Content moderation navigates tensions between efficiency, consistency, and contextual understanding, yet theoretical foundations explaining user perceptions of moderation practices remain underdeveloped, particularly across diverse cultural contexts. Through a pre-registered survey experiment with TikTok users in Indonesia (n=304) and Pakistan (n=303), this study examines how moderation source, procedural contestability, and outcome alignment with user preferences individually and jointly influence perceived legitimacy of content moderation for morally, emotionally, and politically charged content. Results reveal that outcome alignment with users’ moderation preferences most consistently and significantly enhances perceived legitimacy across both countries. Moderation source (algorithmic systems, human moderators, governmental agencies, or civil society organizations) and procedural contestability showed limited direct effects, with only marginal benefits observed in Indonesia. Critically, when algorithmic moderation decisions are contestable and align with user preferences, perceived legitimacy peaks; however, when contestable algorithmic decisions contradict user preferences, legitimacy perceptions drop significantly. Individual differences in support for moral restrictions on free speech also influence user perceptions of content moderation. As algorithmic content moderation systems continue expanding globally, understanding these legitimation dynamics, especially in these understudied morally conservative contexts, proves essential for designing approaches that effectively govern online speech while maintaining user trust across diverse cultural communities.",

          "abstract": "Sustained fertility decline in high-income societies increasingly reflects not just smaller family sizes but rising rates of childlessness. While economic uncertainty and institutional factors receive much attention, the role of value orientations and subjective motivations remains underexplored. This paper examines how the perceived self-fulfillment relevance of childbearing mediates the relationship between postmaterialist values and fertility intentions, and how this interplay is moderated by expectations of welfare-state childcare support. Drawing on the Rapporto Giovani 2022 survey across Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, we analyze a sample of childless adults aged 25-34. We first model the determinants of self-fulfillment valuation of parenthood by postmaterialism and welfare expectations. Next, we estimate a moderated mediation model - through generalized structural equation modelling with nonparametric bootstrap - to decompose the direct and indirect pathways linking values, perceived support, and fertility intentions. Our analysis reveals that welfare support may strengthen fertility intentions when it aligns with postmaterialist values by enhancing the meaning of parenthood, while in the absence of support the appeal of childbearing erodes. These findings underscore the importance of integrating motivational and institutional perspectives: policy effectiveness may depend not only on reducing structural constraints, but also on resonating with individuals’ value systems.",

          "abstract": "For a variety of reasons, including a need to save time and a desire to reduce biases in outcomes, some funders of research have started to use partial randomisation in their funding decision processes. The effect that randomisation interventions have on the reliability of those processes should, it is argued, be a consideration in their use, but this key aspect of their implementation remains under-appreciated. Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations. The simple yet apparently effective specification of the simulation of reviewer scores implemented here may also provide insights into the distribution of merit across research funding proposals, and of assessment of them.",

This study uses a naturally occurring experiment with a Regression Discontinuity (RD) Design and administrative data to measure the impact of Sure Start on health and social services as well as child and maternal health at birth. We find no evidence of an impact on health outcomes at birth. However, we do find that Sure Start reduces the rate of child social services referrals and assessments for a child in need as well as the number of children who become a ‘child in need’. These reductions are most substantial in the first five years of life with no evidence of a rebound after school entry. We also find some evidence these effects are higher for mothers aged 21 and younger.

          "abstract": "Segregation is a pervasive social phenomenon, separating individuals of different categories or groups across social foci. Workplaces are hubs of the labor market and central to economic outcomes, but may also facilitate cross-cutting social ties. Workplace segregation might exacerbate social inequality and decrease social cohesion. Most work on segregation focuses on salient categories like race and ethnicity, and we know little about segregation by more subtle statuses. Social class background is a case in point, because it is imperfectly observed by individuals involved in social interaction, and is more difficult to measure for total populations. In this paper, we analyze workplace segregation by social class background. We document substantial segregation by social background, over and above counterfactual segregation under random allocation of employees across workplaces. Moreover, we observe segregation levels over and above what would be expected under random allocation conditional on individual and workplace characteristics, including e.g. human capital, occupation, and workplace county. Also, when accounting for our richest set of covariates, employees are somewhat overexposed to coworkers who share their own class background. The excess segregation is the smallest for groups at the bottom of the class origin distribution, and larger at the top.",

Our specification enables differences to be modeled as both independent and dependent variables, allows for differences between latent variables, and facilitates testing of the equal importance and full transmission assumptions.

This paper uses a case study approach to examine how historical stigma intersects with present-day exclusion for communities such as the Pardhis and Ramoshis. Drawing on key policy documents, including the Renke Commission (2008), and in-depth interviews with TANDA’s (Towards Advocacy, Networking and Developmental Action) organisational staff and field workers, the study explores the practical barriers faced by DNT/NT groups, ranging from persistent illiteracy and lack of identity documentation to discriminatory policing and exclusion from basic services.\n\nFindings highlight the complexity of marginalisation: policies intended for rehabilitation often fall short at the ground level, while community-led efforts struggle against bureaucratic hurdles and societal prejudice. Through the lens of TANDA’s grassroots interventions; such as education support, vocational training, and health initiatives, the paper details both the incremental gains and the stubborn challenges that define the landscape of social inclusion. The research also reflects on TANDA’s adaptive strategies in response to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting funding environments.\n\nDespite periodic government attention and the work of commissions, the study finds that data gaps, inconsistent recognition, and the lack of sustained state engagement perpetuate structural inequalities. The conclusion calls for targeted policy reform, direct resource allocation, and formal recognition of grassroots knowledge and leadership. Ultimately, the study argues that while organisations like TANDA play a vital bridging role, meaningful change for DNT/NT communities demands a much broader, long-term commitment to redress historical and ongoing injustices.",

          "abstract": "The warm glow of charitable and environmentally sustainable actions has received much attention in the academic literature. Some studies suggest the power of the feel-good effect of doing good is severely underrated as a driver of human behaviour. This study curbs the enthusiasm by evaluating whether different forms of warm glow change behaviour across online and field experimental studies. Second-hand clothes shopping is the setting of our investigation because multiple forms of warm glow apply. Behaviour change toward reuse is highly desirable to lower the negative environmental impact of the fashion industry. In line with prior research, we find promising evidence in survey studies that priming the warm glow effect of second-hand shopping could increase second-hand shopping by up to 16%. However, when tested in a field study involving second-hand charity shops, messages communicating the warm glows of second-hand shopping performed no better than a general attention-generating message. Our study shows that charitable and environmentally sustainable behaviour does generate warm glow, but that the perception of warm glow might not be enough to motivate purchasing behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Does the built environment shape political behavior, particularly voter participation in the democratic process? We use computer vision to learn how architecture and urban planning enter the “calculus of voting” in Mexico, where citizens are assigned to polling places with diverse characteristics. Applying a convolutional neural network to street-level and overhead imagery of polling places country-wide (N≈80,000), we show that building imagery is highly predictive of voter turnout. We then use explainable artificial intelligence approaches to explore what visual features correlate with turnout, identifying attributes that plausibly mitigate contextual barriers to civic participation (including heat, insecurity, and an ongoing pandemic). Finally, we leverage the quasi-random assignment of voters to polling places to test for effects of the built environment on turnout in a causal discovery framework. The findings suggest that the built environment shapes inequalities in civic participation and demonstrate a promising approach to inductive inference from image data.",

          "abstract": "This study challenges the universal assumption that a supportive school climate is the key to academic resilience for disadvantaged students. Using a methodologically rigorous analysis of PISA 2022 data (N = 29,728), we uncover a 'Resilience-Support Paradox': in many education systems, resilient students report lower levels of perceived school support than their struggling peers. Our findings reveal that the most powerful predictor of resilience is not external support, but a student’s internal Math Disposition: a combination of self-efficacy, interest, and low anxiety. These results suggest that one-size-fits-all support systems may be ineffective or even counterproductive. We argue for a paradigm shift toward differentiated interventions that cultivate students' internal psychological assets, a goal uniquely achievable through the design of modern adaptive educational technologies.",

          "abstract": "In diverse societies, how do individuals form views about different groups? We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another. Empirically, we study the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a moment that spurred reckoning with violence against Black Americans. Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how objective and subjectively perceived relative deprivation among door-to-door neighbors shape subjective well-being. Drawing on unique geocoded, longitudinal data from Switzerland, this paper introduces a novel, geographically informed measure of objective relative deprivation. Building on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), it explicitly tests the mechanisms that link objective and subjectively perceived relative deprivation to subjective well-being, measured as people's life satisfaction. Doing so, we find little evidence for a negative effect of objective relative deprivation. Meanwhile, subjectively perceived relative deprivation among neighbors decreases subjective well-being in a non-linear fashion, stressing the importance of perceived relative losses over relative gains. These results are then also confirmed in robustness analyses using, among others, spatial Durbin and SLX models. Overall, the results suggest that relative deprivation also works at a geographically small, well-defined level, although it does not seem to be a key determinant of subjective well-being in this context.",

          "abstract": "Background: Socioeconomic status (SES) is positively associated with health, but these benefits are not equally shared across groups. The Minorities’ Diminished Returns (MDRs) framework posits that marginalized groups derive weaker health returns from economic resources than majority populations. Extending this framework to a migration context, this study examines wealth- and debt–health gradients in Norway, comparing first-generation immigrants with native-born Norwegians, disaggregated by region of origin and reason for migration.\nMethods: Using full-population administrative data from Norway (2017) and Poisson regression models, we analyze 590,274 first-generation immigrants and 2,867,668 native-born individuals aged 27 and older. Gross wealth (real and financial assets) and debt are the main predictors, with physician-diagnosed morbidity as the outcome.\nFindings: Wealth is more strongly associated with better health among natives than immigrants, consistent with MDRs. Gradients are steepest at lower wealth levels, plateau at higher levels, and vary by subgroup. Higher debt often predicts lower morbidity, particularly among individuals with substantial debt, suggesting debt can function as a resource as well as a burden.\nConclusion: Migration background moderates the health returns to wealth and debt, underscoring the need for policies addressing economic inequality and institutional barriers limiting immigrants’ ability to convert resources into health benefits.",

In this work, we examine this relationship by carrying out an empirical study to measure the degree of narrativity present in contemporary songs, using a dataset of popular (Billboard Hot 100) and prestigious (Grammy-nominated) songs spanning 1960-2024. While we might expect the 1960s (with ballad-driven folk singers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Simon &amp; Garfunkel) to be a high-water mark for narrativity, we find the opposite: narrativity has been steadily increasing over this period, largely due to the rise of the strongly narrative genres of hip hop and rap. We also find that it is a marker of prestige for country music, with Grammy-award nominated \"Best Country\" songs displaying significantly higher narrativity rates than non-nominated songs from the same album.",

          "abstract": "Why are public institutions blamed for crises caused by private actors’ mismanagement? Building on accountability theory, this study investigates the mechanisms of blame attribution during crises, when public institutions fail to prevent systemic risks caused by private sector agents. Data from a survey experiment with 1,626 Swiss citizens reveals how perceived situational control, causal responsibility, normative accountability expectations, and accountability performance shape citizens’ attribution of blame. The findings reveal asymmetries in the responsibility-accountability logic, showing that citizens hold public institutions accountable for private sector failures if they strongly believe that public institutions had causal responsibility and situational control over the crisis. Citizens’ normative expectations of public institutions’ obligation to govern systemic risks are strongly correlated with blame, while public institutions’ accountability performance is not associated with citizens’ blame attribution. These novel findings provide critical insights for policy makers to manage perceptions, maintain trust, and safeguard legitimacy during crises. The study advances accountability theory by highlighting the dynamic nature of blame, which is particularly relevant for crisis governance.",

This study operationalizes Bourdieu’s symbolic capital theory through network analysis of 2,135 editorial positions across 30 sustainability science journals. Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power. This reproducible analytical framework enables systematic comparison of editorial governance structures across fields.",

This article examines how Italian social movements articulate alternative sociotechnical imaginaries of AI and emerging digital technologies. Drawing on participant observation, interviews, and activist documents collected between 2023 and 2024, we employ inductive thematic analysis to explore how activists critique existing AI systems and envision socially just futures. Our findings identify three co-existing imaginaries—AI Utopia, AI Dystopia, and Solarpunk AI—that both challenge prevailing governmental discourses and experiment with grassroots technological agency. By centering activist perspectives, the article contributes to scholarship on sociotechnical imaginaries and highlights how movements reimagine AI through lenses of justice, sustainability, and democratic participation.",

In parallel, we measure the convenience of U.S. Treasury bonds through CIP deviations between government bond yields. We find a pronounced divergence between the two convenience measures in recent years: while the U.S. dollar exhibits strong convenience post-Global Financial Crisis, the U.S. Treasury convenience has not only declined substantially but has turned negative, most strongly so at medium- to long-term maturities. We argue that the relative supply of government bonds between the US and other developed markets is a key driver of the U.S. Treasury convenience compared to other government bonds. Finally, we present a simple framework with a constrained global financial intermediary to link dollar and Treasury convenience.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. The proposed approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples, including an empirical human journey into web hacking as a proof-of-concept.",

Conservative voters have more children than liberal voters, allegedly due to more traditional values.

Few studies have directly explored the role of values or trust in the partisan fertility gap. Here we test both explanations using regional indicators of traditional values and trust in Finland, where support for the right-wing populist Finns Party has increased, and fertility declined, during the 2000s. Using national register and survey data covering four national elections in 2007–2019 and spatial panel models, we examined how municipality-level support for the Finns Party was associated with regional and temporal fertility differences, and whether differences in traditional values or generalized or institutional trust contributed to this association. Higher support for the right-wing populist party was associated with higher fertility rate, and this association was related to temporal changes in support but not with the average regional differences between municipalities. The associations were explained by traditional values but not by generalized or institutional trust. Our results show that the changes in right-wing populist party support are related to changes in fertility rates across Finnish municipalities and suggest that fertility decline is driven by changes in traditional values.",

          "abstract": "Understanding who benefits most from schooling is essential both for sociological stratification theories and for informing educational policy debates about the trade-off between equity and efficiency. Using an elaborate differential exposure model, we provide more precise and nuanced insights into this by studying (1) how school exposure affects gains in reading comprehension and mathematics, and (2) whether it adapts inequalities by parental education, migration background, gender, and initial achievement. Leveraging unique administrative data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education on almost 300k pupils over multiple grades (Grades 2-5), we exploit the quasi-random variation in test dates and calculate the exposure to schooling by the interval length between the mid-term and end-of-term tests in school weeks. We find that while school exposure substantially boosts achievement—by 0.015 S.D. in reading and 0.31 S.D. in mathematics per school week—these gains are not equally distributed. For reading, children with higher-educated parents and those without non-western migration backgrounds benefit more from schooling, amplifying inequality. For mathematics, we find small compensatory patterns. These findings show that the effects of schooling on inequality are domain-specific, which we explain by the multiplicative nature of skill acquisition in schools and homes – an interaction that particularly boosts reading development in resourceful families.",

While researchers have investigated the magnitude of measurement error in survey data, little is known about the consequences of measurement error in outcome variables for longitudinal analyses, such as first-difference and fixed-effects models. In this paper, we investigate this issue using the example of monthly earnings and Mincer-style regressions, which are applied to survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Assuming that administrative earnings information reflects true earnings, we show that individuals typically underreport short-term earnings changes in survey data, which can lead to increasing biases with shorter panel durations. We demonstrate that this problem is substantially mitigated when using fixed-effects models, particularly when longer panels are available. Our findings thus imply that measurement error in the dependent variable can bias estimates for models focusing on short-time changes, but has negligible impacts when using long-running data and adequate methods.",

          "abstract": "Why do people adopt new and different religious beliefs and practices, especially when it is often costly? Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data inconsistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, or infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes. We present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country, suggesting education and material conditions influence conversion. We test this hypothesis by analyzing longitudinal municipality level data from the Mexican Population Census (1950-2020). To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. However, we find effect heterogeneity of education on religious change driven by its interaction with distance to urban centers. These findings are consistent with previous cross-national studies on religious conversion.",
