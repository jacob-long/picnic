          "title": "Toward Loopback Cinema: A Conceptual Framework for Emotion-Adaptive Narrative Film Systems",
          "authors": "Velayutham S",
          "abstract": "Contemporary cinema is fundamentally passive; narrative progression remains fixed regardless of the viewer’s emotional state, attentional engagement, or cognitive response. While interactive media have introduced branching structures through explicit user choices, such systems rely on conscious decision-making rather than implicit emotional feedback. This white paper proposes a conceptual framework for Loopback Cinema, an emotion-adaptive narrative paradigm in which a film continuously reshapes its storytelling trajectory based on the inferred viewer affective state.\nLoopback Cinema is conceptualized as a closed feedback loop between viewer emotional response and narrative generation, where affective signals serve as implicit inputs to a dynamic scene-selection process. The framework introduces the notions of continuous affective sensing, narrative state spaces, and loopback-driven scene orchestration, positioning cinema as a responsive system rather than as a linear artifact. Importantly, the framework is non-diagnostic and non-deterministic, functioning as a storytelling orientation mechanism, rather than a psychological assessment tool.\nBy reframing cinema as a living narrative system that listens to its audience, this study outlines a foundation for future research in emotion-adaptive media, affective human–computer interaction, and next-generation cinematic experiences.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Onodynamics, the study of sustained load in human and civilizational systems. It observes that many failures commonly attributed to moral, psychological, political, or economic causes are more accurately understood as capacity failures arising from sustained compression. By isolating compression as a governing condition rather than a situational stressor, this work defines a distinct scientific object concerned with regime behavior under load. The paper does not propose interventions, prescriptions, or optimization strategies. It names a condition, delineates its properties, and establishes boundaries on interpretation and use.",

          "authors": "David Moher; Kelly Denise Cobey; David Thomas Mellor; Anna Catharina Vieira Armond; Janina Ramos; Annette Nicole Brown; Maximiliano Sergio Cenci; Michael Halas; Susan H. Fox; Iain Hrynaszkiewicz",
          "abstract": "This multi-interest holder consensus effort highlights the essential influence and responsibility of Research-Performing Organizations (RPOs) in shaping the quality, transparency, and trustworthiness of scientific research. Despite the use of metrics to assess transparency and openness by academic journals and funders, most RPOs do not yet have  metrics/indicators or monitoring that address deep-rooted shortcomings in research practice and assessment. These shortcomings manifest as restricted access to research outputs, poor availability of underlying data and materials, infrequent reproducibility checks and direct replications, and ongoing incidents of research misconduct all contributing to erosion of public trust in research. Such issues are exacerbated by institutional incentive structures that reward the number of publications and journal prestige, while neglecting research credibility, societal relevance, and transparent communication. To respond comprehensively to these challenges, our working group reached consensus on six core practices for RPOs to monitor: data, code, and material sharing; open access publishing; prospective study registration; reporting transparency; disclosures of interest and funding; and verification efforts.\nCollectively, these six practices offer a pragmatic and flexible framework that RPOs can tailor to their local context. The paper provides an implementation guide for these practices and calls for renewed leadership by RPOs in realigning research(er) assessment and incentives to reward quality, transparency, and trustworthiness in research, closing persistent gaps, and reinforcing science’s credibility and utility for society.",

          "title": "Results from Randomized Controlled Trials are Highly Sensitive to Data Preprocessing Decisions: A Multiverse Analysis of 97 Outcomes",
          "authors": "Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri; Joshua Gilbert",
          "abstract": "The sensitivity of statistical results to data preprocessing decisions is well known, but the influence of preprocessing on empirical data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less well quantified. We examine preprocessing sensitivity across 97 outcomes drawn from behavioral RCTs in the Item Response Warehouse. For each outcome, we apply a 4 × 3 × 3 grid of defensible preprocessing decisions (outlier handling, missing-data handling, and outcome transformation) and estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) in a fixed ANCOVA-style linear model. Across outcomes, the median within-outcome standard deviation (SD) of the ATE across pipelines is 0.045 and the median range is 0.116 (SD min–max: 0.005–0.355; range min–max: 0.013–0.787). Because one transformation option is standardization (an affine rescaling), we distinguish transformation-driven variation that is mechanical (unit changes) from non-mechanical variation due to nonlinear re-expression (shifted log transformation). In coefficient-scale decompositions, the transformation factor explains most of the dispersion in reported ATE magnitudes (median η²_transform = 0.811), but scale-free robustness analyses show a different pattern: decomposing variability in the treatment t-statistic (invariant to affine rescaling) reveals that outlier handling dominates changes in statistical evidence (median η²_outlier = 0.570) while the transformation component is small (median η²_transform = 0.014). A within-pipeline standardized effect-size decomposition (computed after all preprocessing steps, including the log branch) yields a similar pattern (median η²_outlier = 0.599; median η²_transform = 0.020). A linear-only, fixed-denominator effect-size analysis confirms that once unit changes are removed, remaining variability is driven primarily by outlier handling (median η²_outlier = 0.858), with missing-data handling contributing in some outcomes (median η²_missing = 0.094). These results imply that preprocessing decisions should be treated as an explicit component of the analytic model and routinely reported and stress-tested via multiverse-style sensitivity analyses.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To describe how medical journals identify and manage conflicts of interest of editors and peer reviewers, how policies are enforced, and whether practices are concordant with policies.\nStudy design and setting: Between April and September 2024, we contacted 250 medical journals, randomly sampled from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports. We sent a questionnaire related to the peer review process, practices for identifying and managing conflicts of interest of editors and peer reviewers, and enforcement of journal policies. We analysed open-ended responses using content analysis. In a subset of journals with conflict of interest policies, we assessed concordance between actual practice and policy content.\nResults: Of the 250 invited medical journals, 80 (32%) responded to the questionnaire (median completion of questions 94%). Seventy percent of respondents were editors, and 18% publisher representatives. Sixty-six percent of journals identified financial and non-financial interests of editors, 54% did not allow financial interests, and 46% did not allow non-financial interests. Peer reviewers with conflicts of interest were not invited by 66% of journals. Disclosures were required in peer review reports by 41% of journals, 22% verified all or some disclosure information, and 57% informed reviewers on how to handle conflicts of interest. If reviewers had conflicts of interest, 36% of journals would not use the review report. In cases where undisclosed conflicts of interest were identified before or after publication, more than one-third of journals either did not have procedures in place or respondents were unaware of their journal’s practices. For a subset of journals with public policies (N = 55 for editors and N = 54 for peer reviewers), some of the reported practices were discordant with the policy for editors in 45% and for peer reviewers in 50% of journals.\nConclusion: The majority of medical journals identify both financial and non-financial interests of editors, but not those of peer reviewers. Conflicts of interest are usually managed by disqualification, but journals often lack procedures, staff are unaware of practices, and practices are not aligned with policies, creating room for inconsistent management of conflicts of interest. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive policies and staff education to promote transparency and integrity in the editorial processes.",

          "authors": "Julia G. Bottesini; Priya Silverstein; Malgorzata Lagisz; Aoife O'Mahony; Simine Vazire; Sebastian Karcher",
          "abstract": "Journal editors play a key role in shaping research practices by deciding whether journals adopt policies related to open science and transparency. Despite sustained advocacy for open science, adoption of these policies remains highly variable across social science journals. This proposed qualitative study will use semi-structured interviews to examine how social science journal editors make decisions about adopting open science-related policies at their journals. Guided by the COM-B model of behaviour change, we will explore editors’ perceived capability, opportunity, and motivation to implement open science related policies at their journals. The study will investigate twelve open science policies and practices, with primary focus on data and code sharing and computational reproducibility, open content peer review, and naming the handling editor on published articles. Additional practices include open identities in peer review, materials sharing, preregistration, and publishing registered reports, null results, direct replications, and post-publication critique. Editors will be recruited through an international online community for social science journal editors, and purposely sampled to capture diverse disciplines, journal economic models, and perspectives. Interview data will be analysed using deductive content analysis informed by the COM-B model alongside inductive thematic analysis. By providing rich descriptive evidence on editors’ experiences, reservations, and constraints, this study aims to inform approaches to promoting open science policy adoption at journals.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Brook; Peter Rankin; Callyn Farrell; Sandy Houen; Karen Thorpe; Aisling Mulvihill",
          "abstract": "Children’s exposure to Mental state language (MSL) has implications for their social, emotional and cognitive developmental outcomes. Although parental MSL is found to vary as a function of child gender, gender differences in children’s MSL exposure are yet to be considered in the early childhood education and care (ECEC) context. This study examined whether changes in the gender composition of child-groups was associated with educators’ use of MSL during centre-scheduled playtime within toddler classrooms. We analysed educators’ MSL content types (perception, desires, emotion, cognition) across 182 interactional episodes with 13 educators. Results indicated that educators used more perception terms when the proportion of boys increased, and more desire terms when the proportion of girls increased. No significant associations were found for emotion, cognition, or overall MSL. Considering the developmental trajectory and functionality of children’s exposure to MSL content subtypes, these findings suggest that educators systematically change their language so that girls receive developmentally more advanced MSL content than boys at the same age. Given the established role of MSL in children’s social-emotional and cognitive outcomes, these findings have implications for ECEC policy and educator training. Addressing gender-related variation in children’s MSL exposure may help ensure equitable opportunity for language-mediated development in early childhood settings. \n\nKeywords: mental state language, early childhood education and care, toddlers, gender, socialisation",

          "abstract": "Children are adept statistical learners, capable of parsing streams of structured input into meaningful units, but the cognitive processes they engage during learning may differ from those of adults. To date, however, it is unclear how learners of different ages predict upcoming experience when navigating environments with complex structure, as well as how changes in predictive learning mechanisms influence structured knowledge acquisition. To address this question, we tested 106 children, adolescents, and adults, ages 8 - 22 years, on a predictive learning task, in which they experienced sequences of stimuli with a higher-order temporal structure. After an initial learning phase, participants’ explicit knowledge of the relations between stimuli was probed via two additional task measures. We used a recently introduced computational model to characterize participants’ response times during learning, and found that all participants relied on simple, recency-based prediction, anticipating that they would encounter stimuli they recently encountered in the past. With increasing age, however, participants demonstrated greater evidence of additionally relying on a more sophisticated learning mechanism, which captured a predictive representation of the conditional relations between stimuli. Though predictive learning changed with age, we found only weak evidence that these changes related to the acquisition of explicit knowledge of the environment. Our results suggest that the learning mechanisms through which people parse continuous streams of experience change with age, influencing their predictions about upcoming events.",

          "abstract": "Apathy is a multidimensional construct associated with functional impairments across neuropsychiatric disorders and the general population. While distinct apathy subtypes have been reported, its heterogeneity remains insufficiently understood, particularly in relation to psychosis-spectrum traits and functioning. Latent profile analysis was conducted in a representative community sample (N=1,200) using three apathy dimensions assessed by the Apathy Motivation Index (behavioral, social, emotional). Identified profiles were compared on social and occupational functioning, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), depression, and anhedonia, with additional analyses adjusting for affective symptoms. Demographic predictors of profile membership were examined using exploratory logistic regression. \nA two-profile solution provided the best fit, reflecting differences in overall apathy severity rather than qualitatively distinct subtypes. The elevated apathy profile (17.2% of the sample) showed significantly higher levels of PLEs (p&lt;.001) and poorer functioning in activities, work-related skills, and social appropriateness (all ps&lt;.001). Interpersonal relationship functioning was higher in this profile (p&lt;.001). Most profile differences remained significant after controlling for depressive symptoms and anhedonia. Younger age was robustly associated with elevated apathy profile membership (OR=0.98, 95% CI [0.95, 0.98]).\nOverall, apathy in the general population appears best understood as a severity-based motivational vulnerability with domain-specific functional consequences and relevance for psychosis-spectrum traits.",

          "authors": "Mike Hammes; Maleen Ritter; Timo Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "This study examines the relationships between mental toughness, sport satisfaction and job satisfaction, focusing on job satisfaction as the output-variable. We define mental toughness as a latent construct comprising grit and self-control, reflecting the psychological capacity to maintain goal pursuit and resilience across different life domains. Conservation of Resources Theory emphasizes that personal resources acquired in one domain, such as sport, can be transferred to another, such as work. Considering mental toughness as a personal resource, this framework suggests two competing mediational hypotheses: sports satisfaction transfers to job satisfaction through mental toughness (H1) or mental toughness promotes sport satisfaction, which in turn increases job satisfaction (H2). Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, self-reported data from N = 196 employed individuals were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Results supported hypothesis H1, showing a significant indirect effect (β = .20, p &lt; .01) of sport satisfaction on job satisfaction through mental toughness. In contrast, testing for hypothesis H2, we did not find an indirect effect between mental toughness and job satisfaction through sport satisfaction (β = .01, p = .85). The findings provide cross-sectional support for the resource-transfer mechanism proposed by COR, demonstrating how common variance of satisfaction in recreational sport and at work is statistically explained by mental toughness. Practically, the results highlight the value of promoting recreational sport participation first and mental training in organizations second to enhance employee satisfaction and resilience.",

          "authors": "Weicong Lyu; Mingya Huang",
          "abstract": "Response time and other forms of process data are increasingly incorporated into psychometric models. A frequently overlooked challenge is that response time is often treated as exogenous, even though time use plausibly depends on latent ability. This paper investigates how causal relationships among ability, response time, and response accuracy can bias parameter estimation when conditioning directly on observed time or accuracy without modeling how time is generated. Using causal graphs, we show that when response time depends on latent ability, conditioning on response time can bias both item and person parameter estimates, while conditioning on accuracy can induce spurious associations between time and ability. Simulation results under an explicit data-generating process demonstrate that naive one-step estimation treating response time as exogenous yields systematic distortion in item parameter estimates. To address this problem, we propose a two-step estimation strategy that first estimates ability from response accuracy alone and then fits a time-augmented item response model conditional on these estimates. This approach substantially reduces estimation bias. An empirical analysis of TIMSS data provides evidence of endogeneity in response times and illustrates both the risks of naive conditioning and the value of diagnostic analyses based on structured patterns of time use.",

          "abstract": "Spontaneous thought is often considered an unconstrained, internally generated mode of thinking that is independent of the present perceptual environment, making it difficult to study empirically. However, recent accounts have raised the possibility that the generation and content of spontaneous thought can be shaped by even weak perceptual constraints. We leveraged this new perspective to develop a novel approach using music, a ubiquitous stimulus that permeates our everyday environments, as a window into the mechanisms supporting spontaneous thought content. Adults spanning four age groups listened to music from ten different genres and completed the open-ended task of writing descriptions of any thoughts that arose. By applying natural language processing analysis to the spontaneous thought descriptions, we found that thoughts sustained while hearing music from the same genre shared greater semantic similarity than those sustained while hearing music from different genres, and participants from the same age group experienced more similar thoughts than those from different age groups. Properties that varied naturally with genre, including the music’s auditory features, expressed emotions, and contextual associations, all contributed significantly to explaining the greater semantic similarity of thoughts within genres. These results demonstrate that spontaneous thought is jointly shaped by perceptual and experiential constraints, opening new avenues for understanding when and why particular thoughts come to mind, with implications for creativity and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making depends on where attention is allocated and what information is sampled. Although attention plays a critical role in choice, its investigation has largely been limited to overt eye movements, leaving the contribution of covert attention unclear. Here, we combine an attentional probe with value-based choice to directly measure how covert attention is allocated to peripheral options during decision-making. We identify two fundamental features of the attention-choice relationship. First, attention and value interact bidirectionally: option value biases the allocation of covert attention, while covert attention in turn alters value representations and choice. Second, covert and overt attention exert dissociable – and competing – influences on choice behaviour. By demonstrating that attentional influences on decision-making extend beyond eye gaze, our findings challenge current gaze-based accounts of choice, and motivate decision-making models that incorporate covert attentional mechanisms alongside overt attentional dynamics.",

This case series comprises 17 consecutive patients previously diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia based on clinical and neurophysiological evaluations, all of whom underwent psychological and psychometric evaluations.\nResults: Two-thirds of patients met criteria for complex post-traumatic stress disorder. \nConclusions: This case series suggests that some cases of pathological hypersomnolence might be associated with traumatic disorders. Hypersomnolence may represent a response to traumatic memories, particularly in patients with complex traumatic histories, such as childhood abuse. The small sample size (n=17) limits the generalizability of the findings. This observation should be interpreted with caution, requires confirmation in a larger sample, but opens a potentially relevant line of research in the understanding of hypersomnias.",

          "abstract": "The triads task is a versatile method that allows for assessing beliefs as networks of\nconcepts through their perceived similarity. In the task, participants make judgements about the\nsimilarity of predefined concepts of interest which are presented in triads. Based on those\njudgements, a similarity score can be calculated for each pair of concepts. Adding more concepts\nto a triads task design quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion of trials, which can make the\ntriads task inefficient. In our study, we explore two ways of shortening the triads task: leaving out\nconcepts from the pool and balanced incomplete block designs. We employed a triads task with\nconcepts from the topical domains of Open Science and digitization and examined how well\nsimilarity scores calculated from the complete triads task design and from reduced designs were\ncorrelated as a marker of correspondence. Reducing the underlying concept pool and thereby the\nnumber of trials in the triads task led to highly correlated similarity scores but is less efficient in\nreducing the number of trials than balanced incomplete block designs. Similarity scores from the\nbalanced incomplete block designs were highly correlated with those from the complete designs\nand higher compared to the correlations of similarity scores from split-half designs and the\ncomplete designs. We additionally explored questions of employing rotated balanced incomplete\nblock designs and of sample homogeneity.

A total of 51 drivers were assigned to an experimental group (n = 24; 17 women; mean age = 21.13 years) or a control group (n = 27; 23 women; mean age = 21.04 years). The experimental group viewed videos depicting risky driving behaviors and traffic accidents, whereas the control group viewed videos that were emotionally neutral. Perceived risk was assessed both pre- and post-intervention using a behavioral risk perception task that featured naturalistic driving scenarios. Participants in the experimental group showed a significant increase in perceived risk following the intervention, but no significant change was observed in the control group. Signal Detection Theory analyses indicated that these changes resulted from a modification in the decision threshold. The results of this study provide empirical evidence that fear-based content can modify drivers’ risk perception and may inform the design of more effective road safety campaigns.",

In this study, we collected a novel dataset of 77 participants who completed three behavioral tasks under controlled laboratory conditions, designed to mirror the recording setup typically encountered in home-based online experiments. We validated four rPPG pipeline configurations against the electrocardiogram (ECG) ground truth, using a comprehensive set of measures capturing both signal quality and cardiac variability. Moreover, using data from an emotion anticipation task, we assessed whether, in a typical experimental setting, analyses based on rPPG data yielded statistical results comparable to those obtained from ECG. Our results indicate that rPPG is a promising tool for detecting HR and HRV at the group level, particularly in high-powered studies. At the individual level, rPPG reliably captures average HR, but the accuracy of individual-level HRV estimates remain limited. The findings underscore rPPG’s potential as a low-cost, non-invasive research tool, while highlighting the importance of managing its limitations such as sensitivity to excessive movement and poor illumination through thoughtful study planning and execution.",

          "authors": "Natalia Zarzeczna; Travis Proulx; Brian P. Meier; Eva Gutierrez-Sigut",
          "abstract": "Understanding abstract phenomena is a fundamental human need. Emerging evidence increasingly points to the multidimensionality of abstract knowledge representations, with theories emphasising the importance of both embodied and linguistic influences. In the present paper, we argue that the strength with which embodiment shapes the representation of abstract concepts is moderated by cultural beliefs about ontological meaning. Specifically, we predicted that self-identified spirituality—a belief system guided by experiential approach to understanding reality—contributes to greater sensorimotor grounding of abstract concepts. As hypothesised, across 4 studies (N = 729; in the US and UK), Western spiritual beliefs involved stronger sensorimotor associations for highly abstract compared to concrete concepts. Importantly, religious beliefs that conceptually overlap with spirituality did not contribute to these associations. Further, as spiritual beliefs often involve greater rejection of external forms of knowledge, we also explored whether sensorimotor grounding predicted science rejection. Yet, these results were inconclusive. Altogether, individual differences in belief systems guide the mental representation of abstract concepts, with spiritual individuals likely feeling the meaning of words through linking abstract thought with bodily experiences.",

Integrating work on intergroup similarity and psychological distance to science, we experimentally test whether highlighting similarities between scientists and perceivers promotes favourable perceptions and trust in scientists across three experiments (N = 1189). We predicted that matching (similarity) versus mismatching (dissimilarity) scientists’ socio-demographic profiles to those of participants would lead to more positive judgements and increased trust in scientists. We found support for these predictions when participants compared multiple scientist profiles (Studies 1 &amp; 3), but not when evaluating a single scientist profile (Study 2).

The study also aimed to assess the impact of internalizing aggression (anger and hostility) on externalizing aggression (physical aggression and verbal aggression) and vice versa.\nMethod: The study included 317 participants from Poland. Participants gave an average of 24.83 responses, resulting in a total of k = 7871 observations. Items from the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were used to measure the four dimensions of aggression. To examine the daily dynamics of aggression, we used dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM).\nResults: Externalizing aggression was found to be positively related to internalizing aggression at both the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. Our study also confirmed our hypothesis that an increase in internalizing aggression one day predicts higher levels of externalizing aggression the next day.\nConclusion: Our study provided unique insight into assessing the relationship between internalizing aggression (hostility and anger) and externalizing aggression (verbal aggression and physical aggression). Finally, the integration of our research with Wilkowski and Robinson's theory is pointed out.",

This response challenges that conclusion, arguing that mid twentieth century biomedical validation models are inadequate for evaluating a construct that regulates identity, relationality, and social deviance. Although BPD may satisfy traditional validators, this does not establish epistemic soundness, ethical defensibility, or clinical legitimacy. Drawing on feminist, decolonial, neurodiversity, and lived experience-led scholarship, this analysis highlights diagnostic circularity, structural harm, and the exclusion of lived experience evidence.

          "authors": "Chris Ludlow; Armita Zarnegar",
          "abstract": "Case formulation plays a central role in psychological therapy, yet its narrative form limits empirical analysis and digital integration. This paper develops a theoretical framework that treats formulation as a structured representation of causal cognition—a generative process linking clinical observations to explanatory hypotheses. Drawing on advances in large language models (LLMs) and graph-based methods, it outlines a conceptual workflow for converting clinical text into machine-readable causal graphs constrained by psychological ontologies. The paper is conceptual in nature and employs simple worked examples to demonstrate how LLMs can identify causal information within narrative formulations and convert it into structured graphs. Within this framework, deep-learning semantic-similarity methods and graph-comparison metrics such as the Jaccard index—implemented in R—serve as illustrative demonstrations of how researchers might begin exploring causal representations using accessible tools, with more advanced graph-learning techniques offering promising directions for future work. Given the stochastic nature of LLMs and the evolving character of clinical reasoning, the aim is not traditional reliability testing but the development of representational principles that approximate clinicians’ explanatory models. Future systems may implement this interactively, prompting clinicians to confirm whether their reasoning has been accurately represented diagrammatically, thereby maintaining alignment between human judgement and its computational depiction. The paper’s contribution is therefore conceptual rather than empirical, offering foundational representational principles and a roadmap for integrating LLMs, graph analytics, and visual interfaces to support clinical reasoning, digital formulation tools, and the development of computational theories of psychological formulation.",

          "abstract": "How does long-term memory (LTM) support working memory (WM) performance? Proposed mechanisms include boosting, where LTM enhances WM representations through additional activation, but does not reduce WM load; chunking, where WM holds references to LTM, reducing WM load; and offloading, where LTM substitutes active maintenance in WM. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we measured the contralateral delay activity (CDA) during an alternative forced-choice WM task, in which some trials (varying in memory array set size) included a pre-learnt color-object binding. The CDA is a well-established neural correlate that indexes the amount of information actively stored in WM, allowing us to test between the three accounts by examining whether including pre-learnt bindings in a memory set of a given size reduced its amplitude compared to maintaining entirely new bindings.\nOverall, our findings supported the boosting account. Pre-learnt bindings improved performance for matching items in WM, but the benefit did not extend to newly encoded items, indicating no reduction in WM load. CDA amplitude increased with set size irrespective of whether the items were pre-learnt or new, reflecting active maintenance of all the to-be-remembered items. Overall, these results show that pre-learnt associations in LTM can boost WM performance without substituting for WM storage, providing evidence against offloading or chunking accounts in this context.",

Drawing on lived experience research, analyses of epistemic injustice, and evidence of harm arising from standard treatments such as dialectical behaviour therapy, I argue that BPD functions as a credibility-damaging and identity-eroding diagnosis rather than a neutral clinical descriptor. I further situate BPD within psychiatry’s historical regulation of gender and sexual nonconformity, highlighting its disproportionate impact on marginalised populations. Any meaningful discussion of CPTSD–BPD differentiation must therefore move beyond symptom overlap to address power, harm, and whose knowledge is permitted to shape psychiatric classification.",

In this study, we used resting-state fMRI in 148 university students to identify intrinsic network signatures associated with PEB and to test self-regulation as a mechanistic pathway. Whole-brain functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping showed that individual differences in PEB were associated with FCD in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region implicated in inhibitory control. Follow-up seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses further indicated that functional coupling between the IFG and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was associated with PEB. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that trait self-regulation accounted for a substantial portion of both brain–PEB associations. Together, these findings provide a resting-state network account of PEB and highlight self-regulation as a central pathway through which intrinsic brain organization relates to PEB.",

We provide a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how {rix} can be used to define, build, and share isolated, project-specific software environments that precisely capture R versions, package dependencies, system libraries, and integrated development environments. We further illustrate this workflow by reproducing a complete manuscript using Quarto and the {apaquarto} extension, showing how analyses, figures, and text can be regenerated in a single, executable pipeline.

Critically, the attitude-behavior gap manifested primarily at the attitude-intention stage rather than the intention-behavior stage. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that neuroticism strongly predicted inconsistent profile membership, whereas conscientiousness, openness, extraversion, and agreeableness predicted membership in higher-consistency profiles.

In Study 1 (n = 224), adolescents completed a battery of six laboratory EF tasks; task-based EF showed little evidence of reliable associations with PEB, with only a small and non-robust link for trail-making performance. In Study 2 (n = 465), adolescents completed validated self-report measures of everyday EF; all three EF components correlated with PEB, but only inhibition and cognitive flexibility uniquely predicted PEB when modeled simultaneously, and these effects remained after controlling for demographics and the Big Five personality traits. Overall, typical everyday EF (especially inhibition and cognitive flexibility), as indexed by self-report, showed stronger and unique associations with everyday PEB than did optimal EF performance on laboratory tasks.

Unlike more traditional EEG-measures of attention, NET considers where attention is directed to by correlating the teacher’s voice with the EEG-decoded stimulus. EEG data were collected while participants (n = 30) watched a video lecture on neuromyths that included attention manipulations (e.g., distraction, enhancement). Participants also provided self-reported attention ratings and completed a performance test on its content.

          "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed a positive association between self-control (SC) and pro-environmental behaviors (PEB). However, most of these studies have relied primarily on cross-sectional designs, thus limiting knowledge regarding the dynamic relationship between SC and PEB over time. The present study addresses this gap by adopting a longitudinal approach. In Study 1, SC and PEB were measured across two waves among 221 Chinese high school students. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) revealed that SC predicted subsequent PEB. In Study 2, SC and PEB were measured across three waves among 1,286 Chinese university students. The CLPMs replicated the findings of Study 1, demonstrating rank-order cross-lagged effects of SC on PEB. More importantly, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) revealed that SC was positively associated with PEB at the between-person level, such that individuals with higher SC exhibited greater PEB. However, no cross-lagged effects emerged at the within-person level, suggesting that changes in an individual's SC do not directly alter their PEB. These findings indicate that while SC is a stable trait associated with individual differences in PEB, naturally occurring SC fluctuations may not drive short-term behavioral change, highlighting the potential value of exploring strategies that minimize reliance on SC capacity or resources and considering SC as a criterion for selecting individuals for key environmental roles.",

          "abstract": "Traits are the currency of personality psychology and social cognition, helping us understand and represent both real and perceived differences between people and groups. Here, we advance our understanding of trait language by revealing new insights into the content, structure, and evolution of trait words using large language models (LLM) and human raters. Across four studies, we: (a) introduce one of the most comprehensive trait lists to-date (2,847 trait words); (b) establish normative human ratings of these traits (from N = 3,070 English speakers) along 24 dimensions from past literature; (c) detect a four-factor structure of Fitness, Agency, Communion, and Traditionalism (FACT) from these dimensions; and (d) reveal systematic differences in the coherence, valence, and historical evolution of these dimensions and factors. Specifically, we find that the FACT model covers 96% of trait words. Moreover, these four factors differ in their coherence (e.g., Communion is the most semantic coherent while Traditionalism the least), valence (e.g., Communion and Agency show more alignment between their semantic direction and valence than Traditionalism and Fitness; Communion has more negative words while Agency and Traditionalism more positive ones); and historical usage (e.g., Fitness and Communion are older than Traditionalism; Communion is converging in semantic space while Agency diverging). These findings showcase new LLM-based methods for discovering and analyzing trait words. We close by motivating a functional constructivist view in which trait concepts are tools for social evaluation, shaped by the recurrent social interaction problems they help solve, and organized accordingly in semantic structure and use.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Kayser",
          "abstract": "Temporal principal components analysis (tPCA) is widely used to identify and quantify event-related potentials (ERPs). It is less commonly applied to single-trial EEG epochs, despite concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty about how single-trial components compare with those derived from averaged waveforms. Alternatively, averaged principal components (PCs) can be imposed on single trials via back-projection. This study evaluated the fidelity of single-trial and back-projected single-trial tPCA (covariance-based, unrestricted Varimax rotation) in representing meaningful averaged PCs by systematically comparing factor loadings and factor scores in two existing ERP datasets (72-channel, N=152; 67-channel, N=98), using both surface-referenced (infinity, nose) and reference-free current source density (CSD) transformations. In the 72-channel dataset with four balanced conditions (emotional hemifield paradigm), single-trial PCs closely matched those from averaged data, whereas in the 67-channel dataset with three imbalanced conditions (novelty oddball task), they did not. In contrast, across datasets and transformations, back-projected single-trial PCs consistently reproduced virtually identical averaged PCs. All single-trial tPCA solutions enabled full reconstruction of the original data matrix, confirming the methodological validity of back-projected decomposition, and critically, back-projection enabled reliable estimation of internal consistency for PCA-derived component measures at the single-trial level, with all component scores showing high or adequate reliability. These findings suggest that single-trial tPCA may approximate averaged solutions only when the variance structure is preserved, whereas back-projection provides a robust alternative by quantifying single-trial epochs relative to the averaged covariance structure, thereby maintaining component structure, integrity, and interpretability of trial-level component estimates in continuity with established ERP constructs.",

          "abstract": "Precision psychiatry aims to identify biomarkers and develop prediction models to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection. Despite extensive research, translating findings into clinically useful tools remains challenging. Here we argue that one key contributor to this translational gap is a pervasive misalignment between routine statistical analytic practices and the criteria for clinical utility. To address this, we introduce E2P (effect-to-prediction) Simulator, an interactive web tool for estimating the real-world predictive value and clinical utility of biomarkers and prediction models by accounting for real-world outcome base rates and measurement reliability – a procedure we term predictive utility analysis. Similar to how power analysis helps optimize research for statistical significance, predictive utility analysis can help optimize it for practical significance. The interactive nature of E2P Simulator makes this approach accessible to non-statistician researchers while also providing publication-ready figures to aid with transparency and standardization of reporting. We demonstrate its application in three key areas: diagnostic (depression, Alzheimer’s disease), treatment response (antidepressants), and risk (suicide attempts and psychosis onset) prediction, highlighting conditions under which we may expect clinically meaningful advances. While we focus on translational challenges in psychiatry, the framework and tools presented here address general statistical challenges and are broadly applicable across biomedical and behavioral sciences.",

          "authors": "Yeonho Choi; Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "Xiang, Dorst, and Gershman (2025) recently challenged previous research and theory regarding the gambler’s fallacy. They concluded that when sequences of events are truly random, the fallacy is observed for binary predictions but not probability judgments and that binary predictions cannot be reconstructed from probability judgments, in contrast to most theoretical accounts. This “disconnection” implies that new theories may be needed. However, a reanalysis of Xiang et al.’s data using their methods and very similar methods yields strong evidence for a gambler’s fallacy for probability judgments (although not for all participants) and indicates that the gap between probability judgments and binary predictions was overstated. A version of Rabin and Vayanos’s (2010) model accounts for responses to both question types reasonably well, suggesting that such theories are not seriously threatened. Finally, we propose stratified random sampling of sequences as a more efficient method for presenting participants with representative sequences of events.",

          "abstract": "A well-functioning reward system has been proposed to buffer the adverse effects of stress on mental health and thereby play a crucial role in stress resilience. However, empirical evidence linking reward processing to resilience remains indirect, as research to date has lacked prospective longitudinal mental health assessments and failed to control for interindividual variability in severity of stressor exposure. In a longitudinal study of at-risk individuals (N=230), we assessed reward system function at the neural level and in real life, while monitoring mental health and stressor exposure over time. Greater ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity during reward outcome and higher positive affect predicted higher stress resilience, whereas greater real-life positive affective reactivity predicted lower resilience. Crucially, blunted positive affective reactivity mediated the vmPFC association with higher resilience. These findings suggest that a well-functioning reward system buffers the negative impact of stress by promoting emotional stability in response to pleasant experiences.",

We argue that placebo effects and health mindsets are a product of continuous interaction between attention, beliefs, and expectations. We end by discussing novel predictions generated by the Embodied Models of Health framework and highlight opportunities to leverage the role of attention in mind-body dynamics to improve health and wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Heterogeneity in standardised effect sizes, such as Cohen’s d, provides evidence that a phenomenon varies across contexts or populations. One influential methodological explanation for such variation is that it arises from differences in measurement precision across studies. Such an explanation implies that correcting effect sizes for attenuation due to score unreliability should reduce between-study variability. We reanalyse data on a wide range of phenomena from large-scale collaborative projects, including the ManyLabs studies, Registered Replication Reports, and the Psychological Science Accelerator. Applying conventional attenuation correction procedures we find that differences in score reliability are small across data sets and can not explain effect size heterogeneity. Contrary to prevailing claims in the methodological literature on research synthesis, rather than decreasing heterogeneity, attenuation correction procedures increased heterogeneity for most phenomena. Therefore, we propose an alternative framework that treats standardised effect sizes as ratio variables to better understand how differences in score reliability relate to heterogeneity. Based on this framework we identify conditions under which attenuation procedures will necessarily increase effect size heterogeneity. Our re-analyses imply that between-study differences in underlying true score variances dominate the comparatively small variation in random measurement error. Such findings suggest that unreliability is unlikely to be a major driver of effect size heterogeneity for phenomena comparable to the ones reanalysed here. More broadly, the results suggest that meta-analysts should not expect that effect size heterogeneity can be reduced or explained by controlling for differences in measurement precision.",

          "abstract": "Responses to Likert-type behavioral frequency (LBF) questions often do not consistently map onto objective numerical estimates. Prior research suggests that social and other comparisons may underlie this divergence, but the relative influence of different comparison standards—and the cognitive processes supporting them—remains unclear. Across two studies, we examined how comparisons to peers, averages, experts, past selves, and conceptually irrelevant standards shape LBF responses for common health behaviors (e.g., hand washing, flossing). Participants provided LBF judgments, absolute frequency estimates, and comparative judgments for each behavior. Study 1 showed that direct comparisons predicted LBF judgments above and beyond participants’ own absolute frequency estimates, with comparisons to experts and average others being especially influential. Even when controlling for shared methodological variance, all comparison types explained unique variance in LBF responses. Study 2 replicated this pattern of results. Moreover, additional analyses in Study 2 suggest that participants were not making precise, pairwise comparisons between numeric estimates, but were instead relying on more abstract, gist-like impressions of how their behavior compared to others’. Together, these findings underscore the importance of considering the comparative and interpretive nature of self-report measures, particularly in contexts where behavioral frequency carries social, normative, or evaluative meaning.",

          "abstract": "Loot boxes are the focus of growing research and regulatory attention. While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: ​point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, a​nd salience​. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people experience poorer health outcomes and significant barriers to healthcare. Research has historically excluded autistic people from underserved backgrounds, such as those from racially minoritised communities, low-income households, individuals with co-occurring learning disabilities, or those who are non- or minimally speaking. Consequently, there is limited evidence on how healthcare systems can meet the needs of the most disadvantaged. This paper evaluates an innovative practice in autism research, combining co-production with Participatory Systems Mapping and creative methods to explore the healthcare experiences of underserved autistic adults. We co-designed workshops with a steering group of autistic adults from underserved groups (n= 6) using persona development, user journey mapping, and stakeholder prioritisation to evaluate and interrogate causal relationships in healthcare access. Thirty-one participants took part across four workshops from underserved community groups in South Yorkshire. The sample included representation from Somali and Black African communities (35.5%) and participants from areas of high deprivation according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (Mdn= 2, Range= 1–9). There was also some involvement of autistic people with co-occurring learning disabilities and those who were non- or minimally speaking. Feedback from the workshops demonstrated that participants felt able to share ideas and experiences. A validated causal loop diagram was produced with the steering group (\"Misalignment-Invalidation Cycle\"), illustrating how communication barriers and clinician invalidation generate reinforcing loops of misalignment in understanding and disengagement from healthcare. Ultimately, this approach provides a practical blueprint for engaging underserved autistic people and generating actionable insights to inform more inclusive healthcare interventions.",

          "authors": "Gabriel Rongyang Lau; Seow Min Koh; Andree Hartanto",
          "abstract": "The mainstreaming of generative AI tools has coincided with renewed attention to youth slang, exemplified by Oxford University Press’s 2024 Word of the Year “brain rot” and Dictionary.com’s 2025 Word of the Year “67”. These trends have intensified concerns about the spread of semantically opaque, deliberately nonsensical slang among Generation Alpha, often framed as evidence of mental or cognitive decline. We propose a socio-motivational framework that reframes brain rot slang in youths as a socially and psychologically meaningful form of everyday resistance to AI-shaped communication environments. Drawing on social identity theory, we argue that brain rot slang operates as a social creativity strategy that preserves human in-group distinctiveness against AI as a quasi out-group, shifting linguistic competition away from domains where AI excels and toward context-bound, rapidly evolving, absurd expressions. Integrating self-determination theory, engaging in the vernacular play of brain rot slang fulfils basic psychological needs by fostering relatedness through shared humour and peer recognition, supporting autonomy in self-expression, and building competence through mastery of rapidly changing interactional codes that maintain linguistic agency rather than offloading language generation to AI. Taken together, we outline a process model in which AI-shaped communication environments heighten threats to social identity motives and basic psychological needs, increasing brain rot slang use that may in turn buffer these threats. This perspective positions brain rot slang not as a deficit or pathology, but as a patterned form of AI resistance through which youths negotiate agency, competence, relatedness, and identity, in an increasingly AI-mediated communicative space.",

          "abstract": "Perception and decision-making are strongly influenced by previously presented information. Research on serial dependence has revealed significant attractive biases towards previous stimuli, suggesting that integrating information from both past and present stimuli is beneficial when representing information about the environment. Strong serial dependence is mainly found when consecutive stimuli are similar providing evidence that serial dependence supports continuity. Small changes in the stimulus are not perceived as meaningful stimulus changes and should hence be integrated. In the current study we examined the role of continuity further and presented sequences of Gabors which were similar in their orientation, but their spatial frequency was either constant or random. This created stable and unstable environments. \nWe consistently found serial dependence. Interestingly, serial dependence was stronger when the spatial frequency was random compared to constant. In stable contexts, predictive coding mechanisms might sharpen neural representations of the expected input, improve discrimination and reduce the need to integrate past information.\nAdditionally, a form of optimal integration was observed when the uncertainty of the final Gabor was low. Using similar orientations across longer sequences seemed to induce a form of optimal integration of past and present information, potentially creating the continuous perception of a single object when the current trial's uncertainty was low.",

          "abstract": "Past research suggests that smartphone use negatively impacts psychological well-being, but it has often overlooked the role of different smartphone use purposes. In two studies, we investigated how specific types of smartphone use – active and passive social use, news consumption, entertainment, and practical use – relate to psychological well-being. In Study 1, participants (N = 572) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing self-reported smartphone use and psychological well-being indicators. Multiple regression analyses revealed that passive social smartphone use was linked to lower psychological well-being, while the remaining use purposes were not significantly associated with well-being. In Study 2, participants (N = 496) took part in a 10-day daily diary study, reporting their smartphone use and psychological well-being at the end of the day. Multi-level analyses showed that, at a between-person level, active social use was associated with higher positive affect and stress, while passive social use was linked to worse scores on all indicators of psychological well-being. In contrast, news consumption was associated with better scores on all psychological well-being outcomes. Entertainment was linked to lower positive affect and higher negative affect. Lastly, practical use was linked to higher negative affect and higher stress. At a within-person level, analyses showed that increases in active social use and practical use were linked to higher stress. Collectively, findings from the two studies highlight the nuanced effects of smartphone use on psychological well-being, underscoring the need for a more granular approach to understanding smartphone use and well-being.",

This is in the spirit of the original puzzle raised by (Katzman et al., 1988), who identified individuals whose cognitive abilities had been well above average despite post mortem revealing neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. More commonly these days, the term is used by neurologists to describe people who show comparable atrophy on a clinical brain scan, yet differ markedly in their cognitive function. This “puzzle” is important, particularly if we can identify factors, such as lifestyle choices, that might boost this reserve, allowing individuals to maintain their cognitive abilities for longer, despite brain atrophy.",

          "abstract": "Many students in STEM programs experience motivational declines early in their studies, which predict later academic difficulties and dropout. The psychological processes that make some students more susceptible to motivational declines in achievement situations are still not well understood. Drawing on situated expectancy-value theory, this study examined the motivational beliefs of beginning STEM students in Germany (N = 3,213) who completed a low-stakes, statewide test of math prerequisites. Students rated their test-specific motivation four times during the test as they worked on different math content (e.g., basic arithmetic, geometry, calculus). Cross-classified variance decomposition analyses indicated that variation in students’ test-specific motivation and performance was primarily due to differences between individuals (person-level variance) and, to a lesser extent, differences between tested math content (content-level variance) and residual situation-specific variance. Cross-classified random effects models further showed that test performance and the difficulty of different content areas predicted students’ motivational beliefs after working on each test section. Importantly, even after controlling for differences in actual test performance, students with higher prior math achievement and higher-quality learning opportunities in high school reported higher test-specific motivation. Cross-level interactions indicated that positive prior experiences boosted students’ test-specific motivation independent of their test performance. Students’ test performance predicted their later performance in math-intensive STEM courses. These findings suggest that efforts to support STEM students’ motivation should consider the lasting impact of previous experiences with math, as these experiences shape students’ perceptions and engagement with new achievement situations within STEM—even in the absence of situation-specific performance differences.",

To break this ceiling, we need to better understand what causes these differences, and whether similar viewing tendencies are also reflected in similar cognitive profiles in observers. To this end, we tracked eye movements during an image-choice task in which subjects selected images varying in arousal. We then conducted first-person interviews (micro-phenomenological and cognitive analysis) to understand their decision process and identify individual cognitive strategies. We provide a proof-of-concept bridge between first-person elicitation and eye-tracking, demonstrating that structured experiential profiles align with objective oculomotor indices. Quantitative variables were derived from qualitative first-person interview verbatim, and then analyzed by   Principal Component Analysis. We identified gaze parameters stable across trials and correlated them with the first three Principal Components. For instance, the gaze of participants who were more emotionally engaged was more driven by bottom-up visual saliency, and was more scattered across their preferred image. Our method uses the idiosyncrasy of gaze patterns as a structured signal reflecting personal decision process. We argue that observer-level factors derived from cognitive interviews can be integrated with image features to create individualized models of attention.",

Common analysis approaches include analysis of variance (ANOVA) of choice proportions, signal detection theory (SDT) of choice frequencies, and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) of dichotomous judgments. For substantive researchers, it may be unclear how these three methods differ. Therefore, we explain how the methods relate to each other and highlight their advantages and limitations. Given that a systematic comparison using empirical datasets remains lacking, it is difficult to judge the practical relevance of choosing a specific method. To address this gap, we compared ANOVA, SDT, and GLMMs using 20 openly available datasets featuring the illusory truth effect, a robust phenomenon frequently examined with binary judgments. GLMMs with a moderately complex random-effects structure produced more stable and conservative effect size estimates than the other methods. Moreover, GLMMs can resolve assumption violations of ANOVA and enable a direct interpretation in terms of SDT while being less sensitive to missing data. Overall, GLMMs are a theoretically sound and practically robust method and thus superior for analyzing binary judgments in social and cognitive psychology.",

Across four experiments (total N=206, with Experiment 4 pre-registered), we tested this question using a random generation paradigm, in which participants mentally simulated gamble outcomes and said them out loud. Then we compared these responses with probability judgments and predictions. While we identified individual differences, the majority of participants exhibited neutrality, with no systematic impact of utility on their sampling distributions. Nevertheless, an optimism subgroup emerged, with a larger proportion of optimistic participants when the monetary context was more salient. Additionally, outcome utilities have similar effects on probability judgments, predictions, and random generation tasks, consistent with the proposal that these tasks are related to each other and may all rely on mental simulation. These findings indicate that utility does not uniformly distort mental simulation, but can do so for a stable subgroup under particular motivational contexts, and they motivate cognitive models that capture both unbiased and optimistic forms of mental sampling.",

The German MRS (GMRS) was developed within the German National Monitoring of Discrimination and Racism and is intended to capture racist attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities. Methods: In two cross-sectional studies, we tested the GMRS in its factor structure and measurement invariance across non-racialized, racialized, and non-racialized individuals with a migration background, as well as gave initial evidence for convergent validity. Results: In Study 1 (N = 13.903), results from Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses using traditional fit indices indicated a one-factor and a two-factor solution consisting of the factors (1) denial of persistent discrimination and (2) perception of excessive demands and undeserved advantages. In Study 2 (N = 2.330), both factor solutions meet the traditional cutoffs, indicating an acceptable model fit as well. However, tailored dynamic fit indices, as a novel approach to evaluate model fit, were used to discuss potential misfits. In both studies, evidence for measurement invariance was provided on at least scalar level, and findings indicated initial evidence for convergent validity (e.g., including the propensity to make attributions to prejudice). Conclusions: The GMRS serves as a psychometrically sound instrument to measure modern racist attitudes towards ethnic and religious minorities in Germany. Limitations and practical recommendations of the scale are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Survey measures are common in intervention research, but may suffer from biases such as socially desirable responding (SDR). While previous work demonstrates how unaddressed SDR can affect study results in observational contexts, the degree to which SDR may affect treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less studied. To shed light on this issue, we examine empirical data from 10 RCTs from education, psychology, and health fields and compare estimated treatment effects from models that do and do not account for SDR. Results show that, with two exceptions, estimated treatment effects were mostly unaffected by SDR. We complement our empirical results with a simulation study to determine the degree of SDR necessary to bias treatment effects and find that severe SDR can bias treatment effects when not accounted for in the model. However, models accounting for SDR are more complex and produce estimates that are slightly downwardly biased despite being the data-generating model.

          "abstract": "Women involved in the criminal justice system experience disproportionately high levels of trauma, with risk profiles distinct from those observed in men. This study examined the prevalence of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD) and risk factors extending beyond discrete “index” traumas among CJ-involved women. 91 women (mean age = 36, SD = 11) accessing women’s centers in England following prison release or probation referral were assessed with the International Trauma Questionnaire and the Women’s Risk Needs Assessment. Non-Negative Elastic Net Regression identified predictors of cPTSD. 83%met diagnostic criteria for cPTSD, with a further 10% meeting criteria for PTSD. Strongest predictors included homelessness, childhood abuse, residential care and child removal. Findings indicate trauma exposure is characterized by cumulative adversity and prolonged unsafe conditions rather than isolated events. Current diagnostic frameworks may inadequately capture these experiences, underscoring the need for trauma-informed approaches that recognize structural harm and exclusion from statutory support.",

          "abstract": "Item removal decisions in exploratory factor analysis (EFA) are often only loosely documented in methods sections, which limits transparency and makes results difficult to reproduce. This paper introduces EFA-Boosting, an iterative optimization algorithm designed to systematically identify and eliminate problematic items (e.g., cross-loadings, weak primary loadings, and Heywood cases) using configurable rules that produce a complete audit trail of every elimination decision. The algorithm follows a hierarchical logic in which structural violations are addressed before fit refinement, and it evaluates candidate solutions using a composite loss function that integrates RMSEA, SRMR, and CFI through adaptive weights. Because RMSEA can be spuriously inflated when degrees of freedom are very small, the RMSEA weight is automatically recalibrated when degrees of freedom fall below five; preliminary calibration studies indicated this threshold as appropriate for preventing spurious RMSEA inflation from driving elimination decisions. Monte Carlo simulations encompassing 27,000 replications across 54 experimental conditions demonstrated that specificity ranged from 95% to 100% in multifactorial models and from 85% to 92% in unidimensional models, while sensitivity averaged between 73% and 80% overall and exceeded 90% when models contained three factors with sample sizes of at least 500 observations. Comparative analyses against a threshold-based baseline procedure revealed that conventional loading-magnitude criteria achieved zero percent sensitivity because items with cross-loadings typically maintain high primary loadings that exceed standard\ncutoffs, whereas EFA-Boosting achieved 77.5% sensitivity with a Youden index of 0.74, representing a substantial improvement in detecting structurally problematic items. Although the algorithm does not eliminate researcher judgment regarding threshold selection, factor enumeration, or the balance between statistical and substantive criteria, it provides documented traceability that enables other researchers to examine and replicate the sequence of decisions that shaped the final factor solution.",

          "abstract": "Sensation seeking (SS) is the drive to pursue novel and intense experiences, often despite associated risks. Thus, it is commonly assumed to reflect a heightened valuation of stimulation. Yet, intense experiences are also highly informative, raising a key question: Does SS reflect a preference for intensity or for information/uncertainty? We address this in two studies. In Experiment 1, we fit learning-based choice models to a prior dataset and found that an uncertainty-weighted account explained behaviour better than a purely intensity-weighted account, with higher SS linked to reduced uncertainty aversion. In a preregistered Experiment 2, we investigated the joint contribution of intensity and uncertainty. We demonstrate that SS contributions are context-dependent: when stimulation was valued less, higher SS predicted greater uncertainty-tolerance (i.e., higher information-seeking). In contrast, when stimulation was highly valued, higher SS shifted toward uncertainty avoidance. By contrast, impulsivity (IP) showed a distinct profile consistent with uncertainty aversion when stimulation was valued less. These results reveal SS as a joint, context-dependent function of value and uncertainty processing, rather than a single process. This framework reconciles how SS can support adaptive exploration in some settings yet promote maladaptive risk in others, and it provides a mechanistic dissociation from impulsivity with implications for targeted intervention and developmental theory.",

          "abstract": "Longitudinal research on crowdsourced platforms faces substantial attrition, yet there remains little experimental evidence to guide design decisions. We conducted an experiment (N = 1,798) on Prolific, orthogonally manipulating payment rate (£6, £9, or £9/hour plus completion bonus) and session interval (1, 2, or 4 weeks) across five sessions. We also measured habitual tendencies using the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS) and recorded participants’ prior platform experience. Session interval strongly predicted retention: participants in the one-week condition were 1.6x as likely to complete all sessions as those in the four-week condition (80% vs. 50%). Payment rate, by contrast, had no significant effect on retention or response speed. At the individual level, prior platform experience was the strongest predictor of retention, with more experienced participants significantly more likely to complete all sessions. The two COHS subscales showed divergent effects: routine modestly predicted higher retention, whereas automaticity predicted lower retention, challenging the assumption that habit functions as a unitary construct. These findings suggest that researchers designing longitudinal studies on crowdsourced platforms may benefit more from shorter inter-session intervals than from incremental increases in compensation, and that individual differences in habitual tendencies shape attrition in ways that may affect sample composition over time.",

However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions.

Using a reinforcement learning model, we simulate three different theorized strategies in an adversarial reward learning environment that requires very high variability. These mechanisms are (1) relying on a stochastic generator, (2) increasing one’s learning rate, or (3) upvaluing unchosen actions. A systematic parameter search and a policy gradient meta-learning algorithm both show that agents can adaptively increase variability with each of those strategies. Next, we fitted our model on existing datasets with humans, pigeons, and rats as subjects in adversarial environments. While all three species can engage in highly variable behavior, we find that only humans upvalue unchosen actions as a strategy to achieve variability.",

          "abstract": "The availability of real-world object stimuli that meet researchers’ requirements is an ongoing challenge in visual cognition research. While numerous manually curated object stimuli sets exist, stimuli features such as size, colour and orientation tend to vary widely within a given set, and may not be suitable for studies with specific requirements regarding these parameters. However, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate the generation of custom-made, highly realistic stimuli. Building on these developments, the present aim was to share a set of 200 AI-generated everyday object images for use in research. The objects were oriented as though ‘placed’ on a flat surface, such that they could be naturally embedded in virtual scenes. Moreover, they were created in greyscale and suitable for rendering in different colours. Here, we report the method used to efficiently generate the stimuli, as well as the results from a validation study in which we assessed the nameability, perceived realism and familiarity of the stimuli in a sample of 45 younger (18-35) and 45 older (65-85) adults. As anticipated, the majority of the stimuli were rated highly across all three measures, and no significant age differences were observed. The results thus validated most of the stimuli for future research. The stimuli, each in seven colours, and the corresponding validation scores are openly available for future use. To our knowledge, the current work is the first to develop an openly available AI-generated real-world object stimuli set with corresponding validation measures of nameability, realism and familiarity.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most used substances globally, but motives for use vary and may shift across the lifespan. Drinking motives are commonly divided between 1) coping: to alleviate negative affect, 2) enhancement: because the feeling is nice, 3) social: to enhance social interactions, and 4) conformity: to fit in a group; and measured using the Drinking Motives Questionnaire Revised (DMQ-R). Given that social expectations and the neurological processes underlying alcohol use do not follow linear trajectories, the present study investigates how motives for alcohol use and their associations with use change across the lifespan without assuming linearity. Alcohol users (N = 908; 16-81yrs) completed the DMQ-R and measures of alcohol use severity. Generalized additive models assessed non-linear associations between, drinking motives, age, and alcohol use severity, including age-by-motive interactions to assess changes across age. Positive non-linear associations between each of the DMQ subscales and alcohol use severity were observed. Inverted U-shaped non-linear associations were found between age and coping and to a lesser extent with conformity, and negative, near-linear associations between age, and social and enhancement motives. The associations between motives and alcohol use severity followed non-linear age-sensitive trajectories: across age, coping and enhancement motives consistently predicted alcohol use severity, while social and conformity motives were predictive only in younger individuals. Our findings highlight the potential of a non-linear approach, showing that coping and enhancement motives are most consistently linked to alcohol use severity, their predictive value remains stable across the lifespan, despite an overall decrease in motive endorsement.",

Measurement invariance is crucial for cross-cultural research, yet identifying specific sources of non-invariance in multidimensional constructs remains methodologically challenging.

We tested for non-invariance across countries and person characteristics (age, gender) using spike-and-slab priors. Critically, we simultaneously modeled measurement non-invariance and impact on the full latent structure, including factor correlations—a first for multidimensional (6-factor) models.\nResults. The six-factor structure was largely invariant across groups. Age moderated item intercepts (5/12 items), residual variances (6/12 items), and factor correlations. At least one dummy-coded respondent country identifier moderated at least one parameter for each item. Factor correlations were also moderated. \nConclusion. Results support partial invariance of the SFI and demonstrate how moderated factor analysis can reveal measurement heterogeneity unavailable from traditional approaches.",

In Studies 1 (N=667) and 2 (N=432), field surveys of people with leadership responsibility, revealed that leader identity predicted more strongly leaders’ motivation to build their personal identity around themselves as a leader than their motivation to engage in identity leadership (building a social identity around team members). Conversely, team identity more strongly predicted motivation to engage in identity leadership than motivation to build a personal identity as a leader. Team identity also predicted greater, whereas leader identity predicted less, team member-oriented organisational citizenship behaviour and resource-sharing with team members. Study 3 (N=60 leaders; 120 team members), a laboratory experiment with student groups, replicated these findings and examined resource-sharing behaviour in interacting teams. Studies 2 and 3 also examined brief self-reflection as a leadership development tool. Self-reflection on leader distinctiveness strengthened leader identity among new-group leaders, while reflection on team distinctiveness strengthened team identity among established-group leaders. Overall, leader identity and team identity provide distinct bases for leadership, with team identity being a stronger driver of leaders’ motivation to build a sense of ‘us’ and support team members.",

          "abstract": "Scientific consensus messaging is among the most widely studied and cited approaches in climate change communication. Research consistently shows that scientific consensus messages (“97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening”) reduce misperceptions and enable climate change attitudes that reflect the scientific evidence. A concern, however, is that the effects of this and similar consensus messages may reflect memory and experimenter demand effects rather than genuine misperception correction. In this brief empirical note, we outline several theoretical arguments and reanalyze two large-scale secondary datasets from the United States (n = 6,301; van der Linden et al., 2019) and 27 countries (n = 7,000; Većkalov, Geiger et al., 2024), providing evidence that misperception correction following scientific consensus messages is unlikely to be driven by memory and experimenter demand effects alone. First, we show that consensus messaging reduces misperceptions compared to a control condition, even in the highly unlikely scenario that every post-test response at or near 97% reflects memory or experimenter demand effects. Second, we demonstrate that participants report being more persuaded by the scientific consensus message and update their personal beliefs slightly more when they indicate consensus estimates of 97% (vs. a different number) in the post-test. If the ‘97%’ responses were primarily driven by memory effects, we would expect the opposite pattern. Overall, scientific consensus messaging recalibrates scientific consensus perceptions and important attitudes, regardless of whether individuals report exactly 97% at post-test–reinforcing the importance of perceived scientific consensus as a ‘gateway’ belief to evidence-based climate change attitudes.",

Supporting this possibility, we observed that (a) contact with Black people explained racial group differences in stereotyping and, crucially, (b) exposing participants to counterstereotypic (Black–rich and White–poor) exemplars decreased the degree of stereotyping across a number of procedural variations and to similar degrees across racial groups.

For instance, the conditional, “If you eat your broccoli, you’ll get a candy” can be interpreted literally, meaning eating broccoli is one way to get a candy, or pragmatically, implying it is the only way. Past studies find school-aged children (ages 7-12) struggle to arrive at literal meanings but, interestingly, compute adult-like, pragmatic interpretations at this age. An important limitation of past research is the lack of testing in contexts that support literal meanings. We conducted two studies to examine whether children can derive literal interpretations when supported by context. We found that preschoolers as young as 4 years old are adult-like in computing literal meanings when they are able to judge that the antecedent is not the only way to bring about the consequent, either because discourse introduces salient alternatives (Exp 1) or because the stated antecedent is not causally related to the consequent (Exp 2). These findings suggest that preschoolers have the logical ability and processing resources required to make conditional inferences when provided with contextual support.",

          "abstract": "The 2016 U.S. Presidential election heralded the beginning of a political realignment in American politics. A key question for understanding this realignment is whether the Republican party’s shift towards right-wing populism was driven by Donald Trump’s candidacy, versus Trump’s political success being driven by dynamics in the electorate that predated his political rise. To address this question, we examined a corpus of Twitter posts written between July 2009 and February 2015, aggregated by U.S. county. The geographic distribution of psychological traits (personality, empathy, and moral foundations) was estimated by applying to the aggregated Twitter data lexica quantifying how strongly individual words predict psychological traits. The aggregate personality measures were then used to predict Donald Trump’s vote share in 2016, 2020, and 2024, as compared to Mitt Romney’s 2012 vote share, while controlling statistically for the 2000-2008 Republican vote share. Low agreeableness predicts support for Trump but not Romney, a novel result relative to other geographically aggregated data but consistent with prior survey findings relating this trait to right-wing populism. Low empathic concern also predicts vote share for Trump but not Romney. Finally, the degree to which tweets tend to reference unfairness and defilement exclusively predicts shifts towards Trump. Our analysis suggests that people in geographic regions that shifted rightward beginning in 2016 were already expressing emotions consistent with Donald Trump’s messaging in their social media postings before his political rise. Our analysis also provides novel evidence for the high value of aggregated social media data in elucidating voter psychology.",

Computational accounts emphasize aberrant precision-weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, but most empirical work has used simplified laboratory stimuli. It remains unclear whether these mechanistic accounts generalize to more naturalistic perceptual contexts. \n\nMethods\nWe developed virtual reality (VR) tasks simulating VDs in photorealistic scenes and explored associations between VD perception and psychosis-relevant traits in a non-clinical sample. 120 healthy adults completed three tasks designed to probe complementary aspects of perceptual inference: (1) a naïve detection task (NDT) assessing expectation-driven false percepts of unspecified visual changes; (2) a perceptual uncertainty task (PUT) testing how detection under ambiguous sensory evidence is shaped by recent trial history; and (3) an adaptive two-interval forced-choice task (2-IFC) quantifying bottom-up sensitivity to psychosis-like VDs. Psychosis-relevant traits were assessed using validated questionnaires of delusional ideation, anomalous perceptual experiences, and schizotypal traits. \n\nResults\nHigher levels of delusional ideation and schizotypy were associated with stronger expectation effects, reflected in increased false percepts in the NDT trial without changes and enhanced detection of near-threshold distortions when these trials followed distortion-present trials in the PUT. These traits were also linked to reduced 2-IFC perceptual sensitivity to VDs, particularly brightness changes.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR-based VD assessment and provide initial evidence that individual differences in VD perception relate to psychosis-relevant traits.

          "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop an RDoC-aligned precision psychiatry framework and multi-modal model for the implementation of precision psychiatry; by combining findings and theories from the fields of neurobiology, genetics, and psychology. Modern research has greatly advanced our knowledge of how disruptions in brain networks involve emotion, cognition, and behavior regulation in underlying mental disorders. However, research in these fields have yet to form a standardized framework for psychiatric disorders, limiting their effective application in clinical practice. Therefore, the secondary goal is to explain how interventions from these fields can support a more precise diagnosis and treatment planning framework, as well as identify the biological and neural pathways implicated in stress-related disorders. The integration of these methods allows for the identification of psychological profiles associated with differential responsiveness to interventions, such as psychotherapy and pharmacology. This responsiveness can be influenced by epigenetic regulation through molecular pathways associated with stress-related biological dysfunctions, learning, and neural plasticity. We also address common ethical, clinical, and implementation concerns surrounding precision psychiatry, including risks of stigmatization, limited generalizability, and discuss ways to reduce barriers to real-world clinical adoption. By combining epigenetic, neural circuit, and behavioral measures, this approach provides a framework for understanding how early life adversity, attachment, and individual differences interact to shape treatment response, offering a pathway toward more individualized and effective care.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: When listening to acoustically challenging speech, listeners may strategically shift neural resources across multiple language-related cognitive processes in order to compensate for the additional demands. In the current study, we examined the impact of acoustic challenge (via speech-shaped background noise) on three language-related event-related brain potentials (ERPs): the N400 (linked to semantic retrieval), the P600 (linked to syntactic integration) and a late frontal response (linked to predictive processing).\n\nMethod: Young normal-hearing adults (N = 48) listened in quiet and in noise to contextually constraining sentences that ended in an expected word, an unexpected word, or a morphosyntactic violation of the expected word while EEG data were collected.\n\nResults: Replicating prior work, we showed that an N400 expectancy effect was both reduced in amplitude and delayed in onset latency in noise. We found that a P600 syntax effect was reduced in amplitude by the presence of background noise. We additionally observed that the P600 response was only present for trials in which the listener successfully identified syntactic violations (irrespective of noise). In contrast to the reductions in the N400 and P600, the late frontal response was not reduced in noise.\n\nConclusions: Collectively, this suggests that while semantic retrieval and syntactic integration may be impaired by acoustic challenge, listeners may still prioritize neural resources towards prediction-related processes to help compensate for increased perceptual demands.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Category learning involves learning group items based on their common features, and it is a key ability that allows us to acquire new concepts and skills throughout our lives. Yet we know little about the traits and situational factors that facilitate category learning and how those differ in older age. Here, we test the relationship between categorization performance and individual differences in a variety of cognitive abilities and aspects of state of mind and how those relationships differ in older age.\nMethod: Seventy-six young adults (18-29 years old) and 73 older adults (60-83 years old) underwent a cognitive assessment testing processing speed, working memory, verbal comprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Two experimental sessions followed where participants completed a categorization task and state of mind questionnaires assessing stress, motivation, mood, and sleep.  \nResults: Verbal comprehension and processing speed were significant positive predictors of categorization performance. This effect was not moderated by age groups. None of the state of mind variables was a significant predictor of categorization performance, and there were no significant age moderation effects on state of mind. \nDiscussion: We show that baseline cognitive abilities had stronger influence on category learning than state of mind variables regardless of age. Thus, interventions aimed at supporting learning new concepts in later life may be more effective to strengthen stable traits rather than attempt to directly manipulate transient states of mind.",

          "abstract": "Background: The Pavlovian go/no-go task is commonly used to measure individual differences in Pavlovian biases and their interaction with instrumental learning. However, prior research has found suboptimal reliability for computational model-based performance measures for this task, limiting its usefulness in individual-differences research. These studies did not make use of several strategies previously shown to enhance task-measure reliability (e.g., task gamification, hierarchical Bayesian modeling for model estimation). Here we investigated if such approaches could improve the task’s reliability. Methods: Across two experiments, we recruited two independent samples of adult participants (N=103, N=110) to complete a novel, gamified version of the Pavlovian go/no-go task multiple times over several weeks. We used hierarchical Bayesian modeling to derive reinforcement learning model-based indices of participants' task performance, and additionally to estimate the reliability of these measures. Results: In Experiment 1, we observed considerable and unexpected practice effects, with most participants reaching near-ceiling levels of performance with repeat testing. Consequently, the test-retest reliability of some model parameters was unacceptable (range: 0.379–0.973). In Experiment 2, participants completed a modified version of the task designed to lessen these practice effects. We observed greatly reduced practice effects and improved estimates of the test-retest reliability (range: 0.696–0.989). Conclusion: The results demonstrate that model-based measures of performance on the Pavlovian go/no-go task can reach levels of reliability sufficient for use in individual- differences research. However, additional investigation is necessary to validate the modified version of the task in other populations and settings.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate evidence of the effectiveness of diverse interventions that aimed to reduce social bias towards visible facial differences. \n\nMethods: Ovid Medline, APA PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed online databases were used to identify eligible studies published between inception and December 2025. A narrative synthesis of the selected studies was performed.\n\nResults: Four studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomized controlled trials and one nonrandomized quasi-experimental study. Interventions included self-reflection, feedback, education, and direct or indirect contact, targeting conditions such as cleft lip and palate, psoriasis, facial paralysis, and facial disfigurement. Education-only interventions showed limited impact, whereas education combined with direct or narrative-based contact produced significant improvements in attitudes. Indirect contact through online narratives also demonstrated promising effects, suggesting scalable, media-delivered approaches can reduce bias.\n\nConclusion: Findings highlight the limited effectiveness of education alone and the greater potential of contact-based strategies. These insights can inform the development of educational tools for healthcare, educational, and workplace contexts, supporting professionals who regularly interact with individuals with visible differences. Over time, such approaches could be integrated into wider disability awareness campaigns aimed at reducing stigma in the general population. Future research should assess the durability of these interventions and their impact on real-world behavior. Longitudinal studies and evaluations in everyday settings are needed to strengthen the evidence base and guide effective stigma-reduction practice.",

Using the Cultural Fixation Index (CFST) on World Values Survey data (more than 260,000 participants; 95 countries; 2005–2022), we quantified within-country cultural distances between regions, ethnicities, religious groups, education levels, and social classes, to predict various measures of social mobility, democracy, and civil conflict. A pre-registered multiverse analysis (54,600 model specifications; 100 model families; 6 demographic groupings; 6 outcome measures) showed only one robust pattern of negative societal outcomes: larger cultural distance between geographic regions is associated with higher corruption, weaker democracy, lower social mobility, and greater risk of civil conflict. Distances between ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were mostly benign, and educational distance was often associated with better outcomes. The results imply that what matters is not diversity per se, but whether culturally distinct groups are geographically segregated and therefore less likely to regularly interact to negotiate the cultural traits needed for cooperation and coordination.",

          "abstract": "The measurement of associative memory often relies on verbal paired-associate learning tasks, yet existing implementations remain highly heterogeneous, lack standardized parallel forms, and frequently suffer from uncontrolled semantic and psycholinguistic variability. To address these limitations, we developed and validated the Word-Pseudoword Associative Learning (WPAL) task, a fully self-administered, web-based paradigm designed to provide a controlled and replicable assessment of declarative associative learning in Italian populations. Two parallel 40-item forms were constructed through a rigorous multistep procedure balancing real nouns and pseudowords across lexical, affective, and neighborhood metrics. \nNinety healthy adults completed the two parallel task forms one week apart in a counterbalanced within-subject design, with a 12-hour retention interval including either nocturnal sleep (SLEEP group, n = 52) or daytime wakefulness (WAKE group, n = 38). Psychometric properties, item characteristics, parallel-forms reliability, and sensitivity to time- and sleep-dependent changes in memory were evaluated.\nConvergent evidence supported statistical interchangeability between parallel forms. Learning trajectories and immediate recall performance were virtually identical across forms, and internal consistency was excellent for both versions. As expected, recall declined over the 12-hour interval in the overall sample. However, the reduction was significantly attenuated in the SLEEP compared with the WAKE group, demonstrating robust task sensitivity to time- and sleep-dependent memory stabilization.\nOverall, the WPAL offers a psychometrically validated, remotely deployable, open-access tool for assessing verbal associative memory in Italian adults. Its standardized construction, parallel-form equivalence, and demonstrated sensitivity to consolidation processes make it suitable for reliable and replicable within-subjects investigations in real-world settings.",

Drawing on allostatic load theory and systems neuroscience, I argue that this concept can be extended from individuals to political and institutional systems in a way that provides a mechanistic vocabulary for how structural stress destabilises population mental health. Using Iran as a case study, I outline how recurrent political crises, environmental degradation, prolonged sanctions, and scientific isolation interact to produce a state of national allostatic load (NAL). In this state, regulatory hubs weaken, defensive responses become chronically hyperactivated, and evidence-based functions including mental health research and care are progressively eroded. I propose model-based predictions linking features of NAL to rising psychiatric morbidity, service fragmentation and clinician burnout in Iran and arguably in other structurally stressed settings.",

          "abstract": "The modulation of cognitive control by threat of punishment has been under-characterized relative to examinations of reward, with mixed findings reported in the literature. Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",

We aimed to characterize the temporal trajectories of perceived stress, affect, and vagally mediat-ed heart rate variability (vmHRV; measure of cardiac vagal activity) surrounding eating events in daily life. \nMethods: We conducted two intensive longitudinal studies with healthy university students (Study 1: N = 67, days = 4, eating events analyzed = 139) and adults with a history of obesity actively engaged in weight loss maintenance (Study 2: N = 76, days = 6, eating events analyzed = 637). We used mixed-effects models to capture trends in stress and affect in the hours before and after the eating events. We additionally examined interindividual and contextual moderators.\nResults: Perceived stress did not show significant trajectories surrounding eating events. Be-fore unhealthy eating events, positive affect increased (Study 1), with curvilinear patterns indi-cating a reversal close to the event (Study 2). vmHRV decreased prior to unhealthy snacking (Study 1). After dietary lapses, negative affect decreased, and positive affect declined after eating events (Study 2). vmHRV decreased after unhealthy snacking (Study 1) or showed curvilinear patterns (Study 2). Trajectories were moderated by emotional eating style, unhealthy snacking habits, and social support.\nConclusions: These descriptive findings improve our understanding of stress- and affect-related trajectories surrounding eating events. The moderation results suggest that vulnerability to and recovery from unhealthy eating events is characterized by person-specific and context-dependent changes.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychopathology. Besides CM types and severity, the timing of exposure is an important modulating factor in this association, as childhood and adolescence comprise sensitive developmental periods for brain maturation and socio-emotional development. Nevertheless, previously reported associations between the severity of subtypes and timing of CM and psychopathology have been heterogeneous and have hardly considered vulnerable groups broadly exposed to CM, such as out-of-home-placed youth. Thus, we investigated the association between CM types and timing and psychopathology in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults (N = 185; 32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49 years). CM was assessed using the Maltreatment of Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale and general, internalizing and, externalizing problems were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. We employed conditional random forest regression to estimate the importance of CM types (abuse, neglect, peer victimization, and sexual abuse), timings (ages 3–18) as well as CM severity, multiplicity, and duration on adult general, internalizing, and externalizing problems. We validated the results using diagnoses of mental disorders assessed in clinical interviews, which were classified under general, internalizing, and externalizing clusters based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model. We found that CM severity and multiplicity were stronger predictors of internalizing problems than timing-specific effects of CM types. Abuse in early childhood and peer violence in late adolescence were stronger predictors of externalizing problems compared to global CM measures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering CM type and timing when testing CM-associated risks for psychopathology. This might further be valuable in therapeutic settings to guide maltreatment-informed interventions. Reducing violent caregiving environments in early childhood and preventing peer victimization in adolescence may be especially important in counteracting CM-associated risks of externalizing behaviors.",

Across three studies (N = 2124 participants), the present research explored whether White Americans’ misperceptions of racial economic inequality are explained, in part, by a general lack of exposure to information about structural racism. In Study 1, we measured the extent to which participants conceptualized racism in terms of structural factors. In Studies 2 and 3, we experimentally manipulated exposure to information about structural racism. Specifically, participants listened to an audio clip discussing structural roots of racial discrimination, a comparable audio clip on implicit racial bias, or no clip at all. In both studies, participants made estimates of Black-White economic inequality in income and wealth, then indicated their support for reparative public policies (e.g., affirmative action in hiring). Across studies, holding a structural understanding of racism, whether measured or manipulated, was associated with holding more accurate estimates of contemporary Black-White economic inequality (Studies 1 and 2) and greater support for racial equity-enhancing policies (Studies 1-3).",

The law presumes that we judge victimhood objectively, but science shows that victimhood relies more on biased perceptions than impartial facts. The disconnect between victimhood in the law versus victimhood in our minds undermines the quest for justice. In this review, we outline three psychological principles of victimhood and the trouble they cause in the judicial system, before proposing solutions to correct biases in victim perception. Principle One: Victimhood is subjective—legal judgments hinge on who seems like a victim. Principle Two: Victimhood is stereotypical—who seems like a victim is biased, people easily accept the victimization of the vulnerable (e.g., child abuse) but not the more powerful (e.g., spousal abuse towards men). Principle Three: Victimhood is sticky—once we identify the victim (or victimizer) in a situation, it is hard to change our minds. Failing to appreciate these principles leads to distrust of the law, denials of true suffering, and continued condemnation of the exonerated. Potential solutions involve victim impact statements, restorative justice, and acknowledgments of legal errors. Understanding the true nature of victimhood is essential for a fair legal system.",

          "abstract": "In high-income countries, psychiatric treatment prevalence has been increasing for many years. In recent years, developments in autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder have received considerable attention in both health policy and research. At the same time, the epidemiological prevalence of mental disorders is not increasing, with the exception of adolescents and young adults. In this contribution, we explore how the difference between epidemiological disorder prevalence and treatment prevalence can be better understood. To this end, we first provide an overview of the different types of prevalence and their methodological backgrounds. In this regard, we propose the thesis that the disorder prevalence is only partially related to the increase in treatment prevalence. The treatment prevalence is largely determined by sociocultural factors and only secondarily by medical aspects. We then present a theoretical model that addresses the sociocultural characteristics that exist on both the supply side (service providers) and the demand side (patients, service users). In this context, we distinguish between conceptual issues, characteristics of the healthcare system, and macrosocial and microsocial characteristics.",

In this study, we reanalyzed data from a previous experiment showing that gradiency, or sensitivity to within-category variation, predicts speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish but not in L2 English. Gradiency did not predict initial lexical activation in either language. In contrast, the present analyses revealed a different pattern for consistency: listeners with higher consistency exhibited higher initial lexical activation for acoustically compatible patterns for both /b/ and /p/ in L1 Spanish and for /p/ in L2 English, but showed no corresponding advantage in speech perception flexibility. Taken together, these findings indicate that speech perception consistency facilitates initial lexical activation to a large extent across languages, while playing a limited role in speech perception flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Cybersickness, or sickness caused by virtual reality (VR), represents a significant threat to the usability of VR applications. Repeated exposure to the same VR stimulus causes a reduction in cybersickness, referred to as Cybersickness Abatement from Repeated Exposure (CARE). This study examined whether the benefits of CARE generalize across distinct VR contexts, which was operationalized as three distinct games (a climbing game, a puzzle game, and a stealth survival game). Participants played a VR game for up to 20 minutes. Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness.",

          "abstract": "A big part of intervention development is testing before implementation. Bridging the gap between observational findings gained from interviews, focus groups, and correlational studies, theoretical science-focused evidence from experiments, and the gold-standard in intervention testing in large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remains a challenge in behaviour change intervention development. \nThis article introduces Proof-of-Principle RCTs (PoP-RCTs) as an intermediate step in bridging this gap. PoP-RCT are designed to test whether the intervention changes specific targeted mechanisms of action (MoAs), thus having the potential to change the behaviours targeted, before instigating larger trials. By focusing on the MoAs, PoP-RCTs offer a critical step that ensures theoretical assumptions are validated using experimental methodology, improving the overall rigor of intervention development. \nPractical case studies are included to illustrate real-world application of PoP-RCTs in health psychology. Highlighting their role in refining interventions before full-scale RCT testing, in work on recovery of activity after stroke. Following interview studies, evidence was obtained that greater perceived control predicted better and faster recovery. These studies were followed by experimental testing of interventions to enhance perceived control, in studies we now term PoP-RCTs. Having demonstrated that the interventions could change perceived control, a full trial found that they were effective in increasing activity.\nTaken together, we think PoP-RCTs are already an implicit part of intervention development. Proposing this as an explicitly labelled step between experiments and RCTs, could improve effectiveness/efficacy and increase intervention success.",

          "abstract": "Background: Early detection of colorectal cancer can save lives, yet screening uptake is suboptimal. Several determinants increase uptake, including modifiable theoretical determinants (i.e., self-efficacy), and non-modifiable determinants (i.e., past behaviour). \nPurpose: To develop theory-based public health messages and test their effects on target mechanisms of action (MoAs, self-efficacy and intentions) in an experimental Proof-of-Principle Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).\nMethods: Messages were developed systematically linking determinants, MoAs, and behaviour change techniques and four were selected for testing. Participants were randomly allocated to receive an online message (targeting self-efficacy, emotion, automatic influences, and self-image) or no-message. Participants (N=404) were over 50 years old (M=59.85, SD=7.31), female (N=248, 61.7%), white (N=384, 95.3%). Participants reported past behaviour, negative beliefs, and the outcomes self-efficacy and intentions. \nResults: There was a 3-way interaction between past behaviour, negative beliefs, and messages on self-efficacy F(14, 370)=2.94, p&lt;.001, pη2=.100, and intentions F(14, 370)=4.29, p&lt;.001, pη2=.14. Messages did not affect prior-testers. The self-efficacy, emotion, and automatic messages increased self-efficacy amongst never-testers with negative beliefs. The self-image message reduced intentions in never-testers, F(4,384)=3.88, p&lt;.001, pη2=.004. The self-efficacy and emotion messages increased intentions for non-responders with negative beliefs. \nConclusions: The messages worked conditionally to increase self-efficacy and intentions. However, their impact varied across context, with one message even producing  detrimental effects. Thus, even theory-based interventions benefit from pre-testing effects on outcomes, before selecting which messages to implement, evaluating their impact on screening behaviour, and ultimately on colorectal cancer detection.",

Results showed that individuals high in self-control experienced fewer desire-goal conflicts (conflict minimization) and pursued desires selectively (strategic indulgence), with both conflict minimization and strategic indulgence being associated with significantly better hedonic well-being. These findings challenge the notion of self-control as mere restraint, emphasizing its role in optimizing both goal attainment and well-being by making strategic choices about when it is beneficial to indulge in desires without undermining long-term goals.

          "abstract": "Transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals face significant psychosocial stressors, notably discrimination and violence, which substantially increase their susceptibility to mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies link direct discrimination, victimization, and internalized stigma to heightened psychopathology, highlighting how these stressors challenge psychological needs and mimic traumatic stress effects. Resilience factors such as strong community connections and supportive family relationships are essential in mitigating these negative impacts. Additionally, gender affirmation practices are crucial for enhancing mental health outcomes. This study aims to synthesize existing literature and identify risk and protective factors linked to trauma-related psychopathology in TGNC populations. Culturally competent interventions that validate TGNC identities are imperative. Integrating Minority Stress Theory (MST) and intersectionality enriches the understanding of how societal stigma interacts with health outcomes across diverse identities. However, there is a critical gap in longitudinal research exploring the causative factors behind mental health disparities. Such research is essential for developing focused interventions that incorporate resilience-enhancing and gender-affirming strategies. Future strategies should create inclusive environments that promote acceptance and reduce stigma. Beyond clinical interventions, systematic measures such as inclusive policy-making, educational reforms, and enhanced access to gender-affirming healthcare are necessary to comprehensively support the mental health of TGNC individuals. These measures aim to dismantle systemic barriers and foster a societal shift towards greater acceptance and understanding, providing the essential support needed for the well-being of TGNC communities.",

          "abstract": "Armed conflicts are associated with profound and long-lasting mental health consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been linked to alterations in neural processing in both affective and non-affective domains. While numerous studies have documented such alterations shortly after traumatic events, far less is known about their long-term persistence, their intergenerational transmission, and potential differences between victims and perpetrators of mass violence. Addressing these gaps, the present pre-registered study examined neural and psychological correlates of trauma among civilian survivors and civilian former perpetrators of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda, as well as one of their offspring. Participants completed questionnaires assessing traumatic exposure and PTSD symptomatology, alongside four electrophysiological tasks targeting affective (threat processing, emotion recognition) and non-affective (sensory gating, auditory oddball) processes. Thirty years after the genocide, survivors exhibited higher PTSD symptom severity than former perpetrators, particularly for re-experiencing, hyperarousal, and avoidance. In affective tasks, survivors showed enhanced neural responses to threat and emotional stimuli, with some alterations persisting into the next generation. These effects were less pronounced or absent in former perpetrators and their offspring. In contrast, non-affective tasks revealed robust sensory and oddball effects but no consistent associations with PTSD in either group. Overall, the findings suggest that long-term neural alterations following genocide are more prominent in affective processing and are especially evident among survivors, the primary targets of the violence. The study further highlights selective intergenerational transmission of trauma-related symptomatology and demonstrates the feasibility of conducting electrophysiological research in post-conflict, non-Western contexts.",

It is unclear, however, how internal working models influence actual peer encounters in real-time. In this preregistered study, N = 133 adolescents and young adults (n = 65 maltreated; 11–24 years) from a longitudinal cohort played Cyberball ostensibly with two peers, both introduced before the game via descriptive statements: The Target peer was constructed to implicitly resemble participant’s one of the parents, and the Control peer resembled someone else’s parent. We recorded event-related cardiac slowing during my-turn (micro-inclusion) and not-my-turn (micro-exclusion) events. We observed differential cardiac responses to the two peers, which further varied by maltreatment status and age. During micro-exclusion, nonmaltreated participants showed greater cardiac slowing to Target, whereas maltreated participants showed greater cardiac slowing to Control, suggesting that participants selectively generalized their expectations. Cardiac slowing to Target was most pronounced in younger participants and diminished with age, suggesting that parental cues exert a stronger influence on peer interactions at younger ages. Together, our findings suggest that cardiac slowing can index rapid processing of representation-based expectations during social interactions and may thus constitute a mechanism by which internal models impact social functioning.",

          "authors": "Jet Lageman; Johannes Jacobus Fahrenfort; Heleen A Slagter",
          "abstract": "Active inference has emerged as an influential theoretical framework in cognitive neuroscience, offering a unifying account of perception, action, and cognition under the single principle of sensory prediction error minimization. Yet, despite its growing prominence, the framework is often criticized for the difficulty of extracting qualitatively distinct, falsifiable predictions and its lack of clear empirical grounding. This review addresses these concerns by systematically outlining and evaluating key predictions of active inference across four domains that span the action-perception cycle: action planning, decision-making, motor control, and sensorimotor adaptation. For each domain, we contrast active inference with leading alternative accounts, including optimal (feedback) control theories, utility-based theories, reinforcement learning, equilibrium point hypothesis, and motor command theories. We show that active inference uniquely predicts reliance of goal-directed action on optimistically biased prior beliefs, maximization of information gain when options have equal utility, scaling of random exploration with the precision of policy beliefs, context sensitive encoding of sensory predictions in motor cortex, early and non specific sensory attenuation necessary for movement initiation, and precision weighted scaling of motor output. Overall, we find that while existing work is broadly consistent with some of these predictions, empirical support overall remains fragmentary, as most studies were not designed to distinguish between active inference and competing theories. We highlight key areas where findings are promising, while emphasizing the need for theory-driven experiments that can adjudicate between accounts. In this way, active inference can move beyond a formal mathematical framework toward an empirically grounded theory of brain function.",

          "abstract": "Screening records for a systematic review or meta-analysis (SRMA) can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Wang et al. (2020) estimated that humans misclassify about 10.76% of records during abstract screening, relative to the gold-standard full-text decision, as false inclusions or false exclusions. Errors at the full-text level are rarely evaluated, as are errors in AI-assisted screening methods for SRMAs, which are becoming more common. We applied Wang et al. (2020)’s approach to determine error rates for human-only, human-AI, and AI-only screening at both the title-abstract and full-text stages. This analysis used data from collaborative projects focused on SRMA screening, including Synergy, IMPROVE, FORAS, and MetaPsy. Our overall weighted error rate was 3.51% (95% CI 0.42%-6.60%), likely influenced by lower error rates at the full-text level (0.15%, 95% CI 0.00%-2.61%) and for AI-assisted methods (1.13%, 95% CI 0.00%-9.38%). False exclusions, which can significantly affect SRMA outcomes, had the highest error rate at 10.89% (95% CI 4.43%-17.35%). Because gold standards are not perfect, they may include even more false exclusions due to incomplete assessment at the full-text level. AI techniques such as the noisy label filter (NLF) and large language models (LLMs) are well suited to identifying these false exclusions and reducing human workload. Furthermore, we propose a screening error origin model (SEOM) with potential error threats (PETs), highlighting the importance of clearer communication between human and AI agents, for instance, regarding label uncertainty. Future research could focus on specific PETs to minimize their impact and thereby decrease overall error rates.",

          "abstract": "Humans have idiosyncratic and stable eye-scanning tendencies when exploring visual scenes. For instance, some people are more drawn to semantic objects while others are more drawn to emotional content. These individual variations are usually considered as a \"noise ceiling\" for fixation predictability. To break this ceiling, we need to better understand what causes these differences, and whether similar viewing tendencies are also reflected in similar cognitive profiles in observers. To this end, we tracked eye movements during an image-choice task in which subjects selected images varying in arousal. We then conducted first-person interviews (micro-phenomenological and cognitive analysis) to understand their decision process and identify individual cognitive strategies. We provide a proof-of-concept bridge between first-person elicitation and eye-tracking, demonstrating that structured experiential profiles align with objective oculomotor indices. Quantitative variables were derived from qualitative first-person interview verbatim, and then analyzed by   Principal Component Analysis. We identified gaze parameters stable across trials and correlated them with the first three Principal Components. For instance, the gaze of participants who were more emotionally engaged was more driven by bottom-up visual saliency, and was more scattered across their preferred image. Our method uses the idiosyncrasy of gaze patterns as a structured signal reflecting personal decision process. We argue that observer-level factors derived from cognitive interviews can be integrated with image features to create individualized models of attention.",

In this study, the Climate Mitigation Behaviour Scale (CLIMBS) was developed, adapted from the General Ecological Behaviour framework to capture everyday climate-relevant behaviours across key domains.\n\nMethods: An initial 30-item pool including mobility, food, consumption, and engagement themes was refined through expert review and administered to adults participating in an intervention study in Sweden (N = 694). Items used five-point response formats aligned to behavioural frequency. Dimensionality was tested using bifactor item factor analysis (graded response model). Reliability was evaluated via ordinal α and McDonald’s ω. Associations with related constructs, including sustainability interest, knowledge, lifestyle, climate importance, and worry, assessed external validity.\n\nResults: A bifactor model with one general factor and four orthogonal domains showed the best fit (RMSEA = .045, CFI = .92, TLI = .91). After removing seven weak items, the final 23-item scale showed a strong general dimension (ω_total = .83, Ω_H = .69). Subscale reliability was acceptable (α = .68–.85). The general factor showed moderate to strong associations with related constructs (r = .39–.55, all p &lt; .001), with negligible age and gender effects. A reduction of the full scale resulted into an 8-item short form (CLIMBS-8), which correlated highly with the general factor (r = .91). \n\nConclusions: CLIMBS is a psychometrically supported measure of climate change mitigation behaviour with a dominant general factor and interpretable domains. The CLIMBS-8 provides a brief alternative with minimal loss of information.",

          "abstract": "Measuring how well an individual can imagine performing movements is of considerable interest to researchers, clinicians, and practitioners. However, quantifying movement imagery ability is a remarkable challenge due to its covert and multidimensional nature. While self-report questionnaires and measurements of neural activity have been proposed as tools to quantify movement imagery ability, these approaches face significant limitations. In the present manuscript, we propose that objective behavioral measurements (i.e., specific tasks) provide a promising avenue for the assessment of movement imagery ability. To this aim, we have developed an online platform (https://movementimageryability.github.io/) for the archiving and sharing of free, open-source tasks to examine movement imagery ability, alongside self-report questionnaires. This tutorial introduces the first behavioral tasks included, assessing aspects of generation, maintenance, manipulation and inspection of movement imagery (i.e., Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task, Imagined Finger Sequence Task, Hand Laterality Judgement Task, Mental Body Rotation Task, Final Position Judgement Task). Further, we provide guidelines on the use of the tasks and the platform, and on contributing to the expansion of the platform and the collection of reference norms. The platform aims to enable valid and reliable assessments of individual movement imagery abilities in a standardized, open-source, and efficient way.",

          "abstract": "This study offers an empirical investigation of selflessness conceptualized across three core dimensions (connectedness, impermanence, and disidentification) within the framework of the SelfCenteredness/Selflessness Happiness Model (SSHM; Dambrun &amp; Ricard, 2011). We examined whether these dimension predicts non-attachment, which in turn predicts authentic happiness, and explored alternative sequencing among the components. A sample of 214 regular meditation practitioners completed validated self-report measures, and five structural equation models were tested. Two models met acceptable fit criteria and were retained for interpretation. Across retained models, all three selflessness dimensions were associated with non-attachment, which consistently emerged as a strong proximal predictor of authentic happiness. Model comparisons further indicated that positioning disidentification as an intermediary process linking impermanence (and to a lesser extent connectedness) to non-attachment provided the most coherent representation of the data. An alternative configuration also supported an indirect pathway from disidentification to authentic happiness through impermanence and non-attachment, whereas the corresponding pathway through connectedness did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, these findings support the SSHM and suggest that selflessness-related dimensions may be hierarchically organized, with disidentification operating as a key process linking self-related insights to non-attachment and well-being. These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying authentic happiness and have implications for meditationbased and therapeutic approaches targeting selflessness",

This becomes especially salient in adolescence, where gender plays a central role in shaping the physical, neuropsychological, and social factors underlying touch preferences. Here we explore how gendered touch preferences within friendships evolve from adolescence to adulthood. Using the HandsOn mobile App, 59 adolescents (from 10 to 18 years of age, Mage = 14.1) and 54 adults (Mage = 29.5) created heatmaps on full-body avatars to indicate body zones they found soothing or unpleasant to be touched by a female or male friend. Touch to intimate versus social body zones was more unpleasant for female vs male participants, and for adolescents vs adults. Gendered intergroup differences emerged during adolescence, with girls reporting a specific aversion to touch from male friends. Our App provides a safe environment for adolescents to reflect on physical aspects of their socio-affective identity that are often treated as taboo. We highlight the need to further examine the intra-personal, inter-personal and inter-group factors shaping adolescents’ touch norms and behaviours. Such insights can guide educational practices and interventions aimed at fostering socio-emotional learning and well-being of individuals and inclusive communities.",

          "abstract": "Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), a laboratory representation of risky foraging, serves as mainstay of pre-clinical anxiety disorder research, motivated by an impact of anxiolytic drugs on cautious behaviour. While cautiousness appears to be a stable behavioural trait, growing evidence suggests that it is not strongly related to self-reported anxiety. Here, we ask more broadly which psychiatric symptom dimensions relate to AAC behaviour, using a cross-sectional, data-driven, exploration-confirmation approach across two large online samples (N1 = 315; N2 = 690). In a previously validated task, participants chose whether, and when, to approach rewards under varying threat probability and magnitude. They then completed a comprehensive psychiatric questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure. A broad psychopathology factor, mainly related to impulsivity and OCD symptoms and not specifically linked with anxiety, showed the strongest relation to all behavioural readouts. Higher symptom scores related to decreased passive avoidance, increased behavioural inhibition, and reduced sensitivity to threat features. This factor was also associated with an altered subjective model of threat and reward relations in the environment. Broad and unspecific associations with same directional patterns but smaller magnitudes were found between individual questionnaire scores and behaviour, underscoring the status of transdiagnostic dimensions. Crucially, no associations were found between behaviour and transdiagnostic anxiety-depression, or with gender. This study highlights that cautiousness in AAC tasks is comprised of two components, which are independently associated with transdiagnostic psychopathology but not specifically or particularly strongly with self-reported trait anxiety.

          "abstract": "Understanding mental health as a complex system has motivated the adoption of time-varying network models to explore how the dynamics of psychological variables change over time. While existing time-varying network models assume gradual change, shifts in symptom dynamics such as transitions between healthy and disordered states may occur rapidly. This could manifest as abrupt, qualitative changes between distinct states, often labelled as regime switches. In this scoping review, we identified and synthesized statistical approaches for modeling such phase transitions in the behavioral sciences that could be applied to network models. Our review yielded 40 studies across different fields, featuring 56 statistical analyses in total. Most analyses (71.4%) were based on Hidden Markov Models, which can be extended flexibly to model unobserved, recurrent states in various scenarios. Other approaches included change point models (14.3%), which identify shifts directly in the observed time series, and threshold models (12.5%), which model regime switches triggered when a dedicated threshold variable is crossed. We describe these approaches, their applications, and their data requirements, and assess their strengths and limitations for modeling shifts in the dynamics of time series. Notably, several approaches already include multilevel or multivariate-extensions, making them promising candidates for modelling changes in network dynamics in mental health. In sum, our review highlights the broad potential of regime-switching models to enrich the understanding of dynamics of mental health processes.",

          "abstract": "Life satisfaction is a key construct in research and policymaking on wellbeing. However, the use of life satisfaction data relies on strong assumptions, including 1) linear scale use, 2) interpersonal comparability, and 3) intertemporal comparability. Each of these depend on the shape of the reporting function: the process by which individuals convert latent life evaluations to numerical responses on a bounded scale. To understand the properties of this reporting function, we conducted theory-informed cognitive interviews with 100 residents of the United Kingdom and explored first-person accounts of life satisfaction scale use. While our results confirm previous psychometric validations of life satisfaction scales, we also find systematic violations of all three assumptions. For example, many respondents do not use the top of the scale, major shocks appear to alter the meaning of the points on the scale, and respondents rarely describe their own scale use as linear.",

          "abstract": "Pathological health anxiety is characterized by persistent uncertainty about one’s own health state and by a dynamic oscillation between safety-seeking behaviors to reduce uncertainty and avoidance of information that trigger anxiety. Building on cognitive-behavioral models of pathological health anxiety we propose a computational model of pathological health anxiety within the Active Inference framework. In a series of simulations, we formalized and systematically tested several theoretical assumptions on core features of pathological health anxiety: a) difficulties maintaining a previously inferred health state; b) a pessimistic prior belief on one’s health state and impaired belief updating after checking and avoiding information; and c) altered assumptions and learning about the trustworthiness of internal and external information for inferring one’s health state. Across simulations, we demonstrate that these mechanisms might not only explain persistent misinferences of being seriously ill, but also several further core features of pathological health anxiety: the persistence of uncertainty about one’s health state, the transient and short-term relief by reassurance, and the intra- and interindividual waxing and waning of safety-seeking and avoidance behavior. We provide testable predictions about belief and behavior dynamics. Several implications for further empirical and clinical research are derived.",

          "abstract": "Effective communication about climate change, climate action, and their health impacts is central to the Planetary Health approach, which emphasizes the inseparable linkage between safeguarding human well-being and protecting ecological systems. Prior research indicates that trust shapes individuals’ readiness for climate action. Accordingly, the perceived credibility of communicators, particularly their trustworthiness, is a central driver of audiences’ acceptance of information and recommendations. Guided by Source Credibility Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this mixed-methods study examines which communicators are perceived as trustworthy in integrated climate–health communication and whether expert recommendations align with public trust.\nThe study combined qualitative interviews and an online survey with open-ended responses from experts across various fields, followed by a quota-representative survey of the German general public (N = 1,130). Experts nominated communicators across scientific, medical, institutional, educational, and community-based sectors and made stronger distinctions between communicators for climate action and health topics. In contrast, public trust patterns were highly consistent across both domains, largely independent of the communication topic. Scientists, medical professionals, and public health institutions received the highest trust ratings, whereas the federal government and public figures were trusted the least.\nOverall, the results highlight alignments and discrepancies between those who shape communication strategies and those who receive them. Aligning communication strategies with audience perceptions of credibility and integrating trusted professional and community-based communicators may strengthen Planetary Health communication and enhance readiness for climate action.",

Diagnostic classification models have been developed to assess students' learning status and provide remedial instruction. However, the impact of mastery or non-mastery of specific attributes on long-term learning development remains uncertain. If certain non-mastered attributes hinder the growth of mathematical ability, early intervention becomes essential. In this study, we developed a random-effects diagnostic classification for a multilevel growth curve (RDC–MGC) model to identify the specific effects of attribute mastery on individual-level mathematics ability growth. The model was applied to arithmetic test data from second- to sixth-grade elementary school students. Diagnosis was conducted in the second grade, and the effects of mastery on mathematics ability growth from the third to sixth grades were assessed. The results showed that attribute mastery in second grade influenced both the intercept and slope of individual ability growth, highlighting the importance of early-stage diagnosis in supporting mathematical development. Potential extensions of the proposed RDC–MGC model are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "In an aging population with limited standard pharmacological treatment methods for cognitive disorders, the importance of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques – particularly Transcranial Pulse Stimulation (TPS) – is ever increasing. Though research on TPS in the treatment of cognitive disorders is present, there are currently no systematic reviews that focus solely on the use of TPS in cognitive disorders of aging. The primary objective of this literature review is to determine what cognitive disorders of aging have been studied with TPS as a treatment, and to narratively summarize what is known about the effectiveness of TPS treatment on neurocognitive performance and neuroimaging metrics. The study protocol will follow PRISMA-P guidelines and the completed review will follow PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Scopus will be searched to find peer-reviewed primary literature. Included literature will focus on the use of TPS in the treatment of at least one cognitive disorder of aging, with the relevant population defined as adults 50 years old or older. Searching and screening will be organized in Covidence and both screening and data extraction will be completed by at least two independent reviewers. Data will be synthesized narratively, with a focus on general themes and patterns, accounting for expected heterogeneity. Primary outcomes will include cognitive disorder treated (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment, etc.), treatment protocol (number of sessions, length of treatment, etc.), outcome measures split into cognitive performance measures and neuroimaging measures, reported side effects/adverse events and relevant results. Any additionally relevant outcomes will be considered as part of narrative completeness. No ethics approval is needed, and findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal(s).

          "abstract": "The scientific study of five-factor model (FFM) personality traits began with the study of language. Now, language-based AI assessment of personality holds promise for the future. However, AI has a history of bias towards African-Americans, and modern language-based personality modeling should be examined for possible biases across Black and White research participants. To our knowledge, only one prior study has done so. The present study builds on Oltmanns et al.’s (2025) language-based personality models from N = 1,405 life narrative interviews with community older adults, this time examining the effects by race (Black and White American older adults). Personality was modeled using LIWC, BERTopic modeling, and fine-tuning of the RoBERTa language model (c.f., Oltmanns et al., 2025) for FFM personality traits. Results indicate significant differences in associations between personality and LIWC and BERTopic variables across race. Further, some fine-tuned RoBERTa language models for\npersonality maintain relatively strong predictive performance for both groups, while others demonstrate a drop in predictive performance for Black participants (e.g., extraversion). Moreover, several models show mean-level prediction differences across groups, at small-to-moderate effect sizes, and small calibration errors indicating differences in predicted variance across groups. The findings provide important perspective regarding the language modeling of personality across race in American older adults and indicate there is work to be done to ensure fair performance of language-based AI modeling of personality across race. Implications for advances of language-based AI modeling of personality are discussed.\nKeywords: language, natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), personality, five-factor model, big five, racial differences",

          "abstract": "Across three studies, we examined how outcome preferences shape predictions when prediction-relevant information must be actively acquired through search versus passively received. Participants in our studies predicted the color of randomly selected squares from grids that either were fully visible or required self-directed search to uncover. Consistent with prior work on confirmation bias and selective exposure, Study 1 found that outcome preferences biased search behavior: participants preferentially sampled evidence associated with preferred outcomes and adjusted how much information they gathered based on early evidence. Surprisingly, however, these search biases did not translate into stronger wishful thinking compared with a passive search context, in which all information was immediately available. At first glance, this appears inconsistent with theories of motivated reasoning (e.g., Kunda, 1990), which suggest that flexibility in search should amplify the impact of directional motives. Closer inspection, however, revealed a countervailing process: the magnitude of desirability bias in predictions decreased as participants searched more extensively. In other words, while outcome preferences shaped both the direction and extent of search, prolonged search also attenuated wishful thinking, producing comparable overall bias across active and passive search conditions. Follow-up Studies 2 and 3 suggest that mechanisms related to effort justification and selective stopping of search could account for this pattern of results. Together, these findings highlight a more nuanced view of motivated cognition, in which outcome preferences, search strategies, and effort jointly determine the expression of motivated bias in predictions.",

          "abstract": "Song et al. (2016) proposed a framework to build trainable excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural networks with user-specified biological mechanisms. These models allow researchers to simulate a miriad of neural, cognitive and behavioral hypothesis through neural circuits, making them one of the most powerful simulation tools for theoretical cognitive modeling nowadays. In the present study we find that using ReLU on weights (not nodes) to set the excitatory and inhibitory populations (Dale's principle) leads to a catastrophic loss of connections beyond user control, compromising its reproducibility and comparability. We explain the reasons behind this connectivity pruning and study its impact through a reproduction of a recent simulation study about activity-silent working memory based on Song et al. (2016)'s framework. We show that ReLU leads to a loss of up to 95% of connections, makes connectivity patterns dependent on the task and biological features of the model, impairs training and modifies neural dynamics in unpredictable ways. Moreover, we show it makes training substantially less efficient and prone to performance issues. As an alternative, we found that Absolute Value function to rectify weights is notably more efficient and avoids connectivity pruning.",

Yet, research demonstrates broadly shared misperceptions of others’ thoughts, feelings, and actions in a variety of contexts—a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. Despite a century of research and theory on pluralistic ignorance, limited work systematically considers possible drivers of these patterns of misperceptions, leaving us with a poor understanding of how to address the phenomenon. In the present work, we draw on theories from psychology and related social science disciplines to construct a systematic framework of the potential causes of pluralistic ignorance. Our framework proposes that pluralistic ignorance can emerge from three broad categories of psychological and contextual factors: a) information availability, b) heuristics, and c) directionally motivated reasoning. In each section, we discuss research and theory supporting possible explanations for pluralistic ignorance and promising directions for corrective interventions.",

          "authors": "Kamil Safader",
          "abstract": "Persistent differences between autistic and neurotypical cognition are widely documented across perception, reasoning, and social interaction, yet existing explanations remain fragmented across disciplinary levels. This paper proposes a unified account grounded in predictive processing, information theory, representational format, and phenomenology. It explains these differences as systematic consequences of how cognitive systems selectively attenuate information to explicit inference. We argue that the critical distinction does not concern the capacity for prediction as such, but the manner in which predictive systems attenuate low-probability, high-information signals. Informational attenuation is introduced as a common organizing mechanism linking multiple explanatory levels. At the computational level, it defines a principled trade-off between informational fidelity and computational efficiency, grounded in information-theoretic relations between probability and surprisal. At the algorithmic level, this trade-off is implemented through precision weighting and thresholding processes that determine which signals are propagated or suppressed. At the representational level, differential attenuation shapes predictive format itself, biasing cognition toward either compressed content or formal structure. At the phenomenological level, the same mechanisms account for systematic differences in experiential organization, explaining why some forms of cognition are characterized by transparency and immediacy, while others involve heightened explicitness and structural salience. At the social and interactional level, differential attenuation explains how inductively reinforcing norms support epistemic stability—and why structurally oriented agents may experience such normativity as opaque, underdetermined, or coercive. By linking these levels through a single mechanistic principle, the proposed framework avoids reductionism, deficit-based framing and explanatory fragmentation.",

          "abstract": "Encounter with supernatural agents and other drug-occasioned immaterial entities are a common aspect of psychedelic experiences. However, existing theories offer incomplete explanations for this phenomenon. This paper proposes a theoretical model of psychedelic supernatural agent experiences grounded in active inference. We review recent theoretical models of psychedelic neurological activity to explain how increased entropy under psychedelics alters precision weighting, creating the cognitive conditions under which supernatural agent inferences are recruited to generate perception. We relate this to predictive processing accounts of supernatural agency detection outside psychedelic contexts, emphasizing the role proximate and remote contexts play in strengthening priors of agency presence. To explain these phenomena absent strong pre-existing beliefs, we propose an integrationist approach– that SA inferences are uniquely capable of addressing altered sensory evidence arising across the brain’s modalities within a coherent perceptual model, restoring error minimization capacities via reorganization of phenomenal self-models and instantiation of alternative agency inferences. This model offers a potentially generalizable cognitive account of supernatural agent encounter across altered states, and forwards several theoretical consequences consistent with current evidence which can be further empirically validated.",

The first condition is irreproducibility, demonstrated  by one or more failed efforts at replication or conditions that make replication impossible. We offer a novel typology of four categories of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb for how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy, the scholarly literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to propose correction, retraction, or editorial note of concern for the article in question. Our first case concerns aerial shooting at coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the metaphor has heuristic value and utility.

These coping responses may be adaptive in the short-term while contributing to emotional distress in the long-term. Cultural adaptations, which validate extant environmental stressors while exploring flexibility in coping response style, may be critical to enhancing the usefulness and effectiveness of emotion regulation treatments for Black women. To date, there are no culturally-adapted treatments targeting transdiagnostic emotional challenges for African American women. This project combined Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) emotion regulation skills, a Single-Session Intervention (SSI) format, and community-based participatory methods, to develop the first culturally-adapted DBT emotion regulation skills SSI for Black women. The intervention was developed iteratively using literature review, expert consultation, and a series of two focus groups (n = 9) made up of Black women, 18-65, endorsing emotion dysregulation and race-based stress. The final 60-minute, virtual, clinician-led intervention focuses on 1) The Biopsychosocial Model Integrated with Gendered Racial Stress 2) Dialectics of Superwoman/Strong Black Woman Beliefs 3) Reducing Emotional Vulnerability by Addressing Bodily Needs and 4) Behavioral Strategies to Change Emotions and Increase Positive Emotions. Materials for therapists to administer the treatment are included as supplement. Findings indicated that participants found the intervention to be highly acceptable and culturally relevant. This project provides initial support for a novel culturally-adapted DBT emotion regulation skills SSI for African American women. It emphasizes the importance of taking a culturally-responsive approach to understanding emotional challenges and suggests that brief, adapted treatments have the potential to reach and support communities typically marginalized.",

However, the field faces challenges in clinical translation, replicability, and within-group designs are susceptible to visual confounding due to stimulus matching. A complementary approach is to examine case-control contrasts to identify SUD-specific neural architecture while mitigating effects of task-design variability. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify convergence effects in the contrast drug &gt; control cues between SUD and control groups. ALE results were supplemented by assessing behavioural domains, meta-analytic connectivity profiles, robustness to publication bias, and study-level modulators using penalised logistic regression. Results: The ALE analysis revealed one reliable convergence cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), associated with reward, reasoning, and social cognition. Penalised logistic regression indicated that contributions to this cluster were less likely in alcohol DCR studies and were sensitive to matching conditions for human content. vACC DCR effects contrasted with neutral control cues were invariant across abstinence periods, whereas DCR contrasted with natural reward cues declined with longer abstinence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis replicates context-sensitive SUD-specific DCR convergence in vACC regions intersecting reward pathways and the default-mode network yet limited support for striatal centredness. The review recapitulates these results by discussing current challenges in balancing personalisation and standardisation, the use of motivationally inert versus salient comparators, and argues for careful deliberation when inferring evidence for hyperreactive reward responses.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used for decision-making, but its perception compared to human decision-makers remains underexplored, especially in educational contexts. In this study, we investigated the influence of the decision-maker (AI vs. human) on fairness perception, trust, and emotional responses in participants (N = 329) who are allocated university course topics. While the allocation process was identical, participants were either told that a human lecturer or an AI made the decision based on the same pieces of information. Furthermore, we manipulated whether the corresponding decision-making process was explicitly communicated as fair or whether no comment was made regarding the process’ fairness. Finally, we assessed how favourable students rated the outcome of the allocation process. Against our hypotheses, Bayesian evidence indicated that neither the decision-maker nor whether the decision-making process was communicated as fair had an impact on students' fairness perception, trust, or emotional responses. Students’ evaluations of the university course topic allocation process were strongly associated with the favourability of the outcome.  Given that an AI can better optimize allocations according to students’ preferences than human decision-makers, these findings support a broader implementation of AI-based decision-making in the context of allocation decisions at university.",

In this study, we examined how individuals formed predictions amidst a severe national crisis, the October 7th attacks and ensuing war in Israel. Analyzing data from 1,029 Israeli participants, we find evidence for wishful thinking: at a group-level, participants tended to assign higher probabilities to outcomes they considered preferable, and  lower probabilities to outcomes they feared. These effects were more pronounced among optimists. These findings document the existence of optimistic distortions even in an environment where personal consequences were salient. The study’s implications extend to both individual judgment as well as institutional decision-making, emphasizing the need for strategies that counteract bias while recognizing the positive psychological functions of optimism during crisis.",

          "authors": "Lola Seyll; Pauline Joy Atete; Vincent Sezibera; Patrick Fery; Emilie A. Caspar",
          "abstract": "Over the past decades, clinical neuropsychology has expanded substantially worldwide, contributing to improved patient care and diagnostic accuracy. However, this development has progressed unevenly across regions. While advanced training programs, professional recognition, and standardized assessment tools are well established in North America, Europe, and Australia, neuropsychology remains emerging or largely nonexistent in many low- and middle-income countries. In these contexts, access to training, supervision, and culturally appropriate assessment tools remains limited. A central challenge concerns the widespread use of neuropsychological tests developed and normed in Western settings, which may not adequately account for differences in language, education, culture, and lived experience. When applied without appropriate adaptation, such tools risk misclassifying cognitive functioning and overestimating impairment. This methodological paper addresses these issues by presenting a framework for the selection, adaptation, and preliminary evaluation of neuropsychological measures in Rwanda, a country facing a growing need for cognitive assessment due to demographic aging and the high prevalence of neurological disorders, yet where neuropsychological tools are currently scarce. Drawing on cross-cultural neuropsychological principles and existing African initiatives, we developed a context-appropriate cognitive screening battery targeting core domains, including attention, executive functions, memory, and language. Task selection prioritized open-access measures, minimal logistical demands, and reduced cultural bias, while ensuring accessibility across diverse educational levels, socioeconomic backgrounds, and rural–urban contexts. Pilot data collected in Rwanda were used to assess the feasibility and relevance of the adapted battery. Most tasks elicited expected cognitive effects, supporting their suitability as screening tools. However, culturally unfamiliar stimuli in naming tasks highlighted the need for further adaptation. Overall, this work provides a practical, theory-driven approach to developing culturally fair neuropsychological assessments and offers a foundation for future norming efforts and similar initiatives in other settings.",

          "abstract": "Music is a cultural universal, yet the conceptual boundary between “music” and “non‑music” remains theoretically unsettled. This study used behavioral measures to examine the perceptual judgments of listeners from Brazil, China, and the United States as they classified short sound excerpts and rated their perceived musicality. Participants (N = 103) completed an online survey featuring 24 two‑second stimuli drawn from 11 sound categories, including traditional music from 130 societies and non‑musical sounds from established auditory taxonomies. Descriptively, the mean proportion of “music” classifications was 0.51, with substantial category‑level variation: traditional vocal and non‑vocal music received the highest endorsement rates, whereas speech and environmental sounds received the lowest. Musicality ratings showed a parallel pattern. Inter‑participant agreement, quantified using Krippendorff’s α, was moderate at the aggregate level (α = .73) but generally low within categories.\n\nTo complement these descriptive patterns, mixed‑effects models were used to assess whether sound category or country predicted responses while accounting for participant‑ and stimulus‑level variability. Both models revealed large, reliable effects of sound category: the two traditional music categories were far more likely to be judged as music and received substantially higher musicality ratings than all other categories. No other category differed significantly from the reference, and country effects were small or nonsignificant. Together, the descriptive and inferential results indicate that listeners share strong intuitions about prototypical musical sounds, but judgments become highly heterogeneous for ambiguous cases, suggesting that the concept of music may be graded and context‑dependent rather than sharply bounded.",

          "abstract": "Standard measures of abortion attitudes, such as the American National Election Survey’s four-point scale, do not capture public opinion on the dimensions that structure the post-Roe abortion policy landscape. While these traditional measures rely on broad, categorical distinctions, contemporary policy debates increasingly hinge on two specific factors: the reason for seeking an abortion and the gestational age of the fetus. To address this mismatch, I develop an original survey instrument that measures opinion along these dimensions. Using data from a large-scale survey (N = 69,752), I show that continuing to use the ANES scale introduces partisan-driven, nonrandom measurement error. Specifically, Democrats and Republicans who select the same ANES response hold systematically different policy preferences, and respondents with comparable policy preferences select different ANES answer choices depending on their partisanship—with Democrats anchoring their answers to a more permissive baseline. These findings underscore the risk of relying on broad-based attitudinal scales that do not evolve alongside the policy debates they are meant to capture.",

          "abstract": "Research on the psychology of divine forgiveness has expanded in recent years, yet most studies rely on cross-sectional designs and generalized measures that do not capture how forgiveness-related processes unfold following specific instances of personal wrongdoing. Guided by a Christian-sensitive relational spirituality model of personal sin, the present study used an incident-anchored longitudinal design to explore two central processes involved in experiencing reconciliation with God—engaging in repentance with God (ER) and experiencing absolution from God (EA)—over a 16-day period beginning within 24 hours of a self-identified wrongdoing. U.S. Christian adults (N = 175) who met the inclusion criteria completed assessments on days 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Multilevel growth model comparisons favored a logarithmic trajectory for both processes, indicating rapid early increases that tapered over time. Although these two processes unfolded in parallel, ER was higher on day 1 and EA increased more steeply over time. Baseline relational spirituality variables predicted individual differences in trajectories of change: ER increased more steeply among participants reporting lower day 1 divine struggles, whereas EA increased more steeply among those reporting higher day 1 communion with God and lower divine struggles. Prospective within-person associations suggested asymmetric temporal dynamics for ER and EA: positive within-person deviation in ER more clearly preceded higher subsequent EA than the inverse, and positive within-person deviation in EA (but not ER) modestly predicted higher subsequent communion with God. These findings further our understanding of how experiences of divine forgiveness unfold following specific incidents of personal wrongdoing.",

Although previous literature suggests that music and speech are easily separable categories, common experimental approaches may bias findings toward this distinction by relying on stimuli from different sound sources and predefined response labels. Here, we use stimulus material from the dùndún drum–a speech surrogate that can signal either speech-related or musical content. We first replicate standard speech-music categorization results (N=108). Then, we depart from the typical experimental procedure by asking new participants (N=180) to sort and label the stimulus material, without predefined categories. Hierarchical clustering of participants’ stimulus groupings reveals multiple organizing dimensions, with the speech–music distinction reliably present but secondary under label-free conditions. By reverse-engineering the relationship between sorting behavior, acoustic features, and semantic labels, we characterize how speech–music categorization relates to other salient perceptual dimensions and how its behavioral prominence depends on task constraints.",

          "abstract": "Background \nVisual distortions (VDs) are frequently reported but insufficiently characterized in early psychosis and may reflect alterations in perceptual processing. Computational accounts emphasize aberrant precision-weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, but most empirical work has used simplified laboratory stimuli. It remains unclear whether these mechanistic accounts generalize to more naturalistic perceptual contexts. \n\nMethods\nWe developed virtual reality (VR) tasks simulating VDs in photorealistic scenes and explored associations between VD perception and psychosis-relevant traits in a non-clinical sample. 120 healthy adults completed three tasks designed to probe complementary aspects of perceptual inference: (1) a naïve detection task (NDT) assessing expectation-driven false percepts of unspecified visual changes; (2) a perceptual uncertainty task (PUT) testing how detection under ambiguous sensory evidence is shaped by recent trial history; and (3) an adaptive two-interval forced-choice task (2-IFC) quantifying bottom-up sensitivity to psychosis-like VDs. Psychosis-relevant traits were assessed using validated questionnaires of delusional ideation, anomalous perceptual experiences, and schizotypal traits. \n\nResults\nHigher levels of delusional ideation and schizotypy were associated with stronger expectation effects, reflected in increased false percepts in the NDT trial without changes and enhanced detection of near-threshold distortions when these trials followed distortion-present trials in the PUT. These traits were also linked to reduced 2-IFC perceptual sensitivity to VDs, particularly brightness changes.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of VR-based VD assessment and provide initial evidence that individual differences in VD perception relate to psychosis-relevant traits. Results suggest contributions from both diminished sensory sensitivity and increased reliance on expectations in naturalistic perceptual contexts.",

Four consecutively sampled stroke survivors (mean chronicity=18 months, SD=10) with mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1) cognitive impairment received 35 hours of CICT. CICT combined two empirically supported approaches: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) and behavior change techniques from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) adapted to transfer gains from in-lab cognitive training to daily life. The latter featured IADL training following shaping principles and a suite of behavioral techniques, called the Transfer Package, to promote participation in cognitively-based functional activities outside of the lab. Outcome measures assessed cognitive processing speed (Useful Field of View, UFOV) and IADL performance outside the treatment setting (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM). All three participants with valid UFOV data displayed meaningful improvements after treatment in cognitive processing speed (M=64%, SD=40, d'=1.58). All three with COPM data reported meaningful improvements in satisfaction with IADL performance (M=2.87, SD=1.5, d'=1.91). Values of d' ≥0.57 are large. Per structured interviews developed for this study, the IADL improvements present after treatment lasted for at least a year. These promising findings warrant further study.",

In the current pre-registered study, we investigated whether non-autistic speakers similarly modified their speech in interactions with listeners who disclosed they were autistic. We used the Map Task paradigm; 33 participants (mean age = 36 years) gave verbal instructions to a confederate in two conditions: one in which the confederate disclosed being autistic and the other in which they did not. Participants did not show evidence of linguistic accommodation toward the autistic listener on any of the linguistic measures we coded for, including speech rate, syntactic complexity (e.g., MLU), semantic complexity (e.g., type-token ratio) and discourse features (e.g., repetitions). Although there was no average difference on these measures between the autistic and non-autistic listener conditions, exploratory analyses showed that more positive attitudes toward autism were associated with lower degree of accommodation to the autistic listener on one measure, MLU. No associations were found between level of contact and degree of accommodation. These findings suggest that an autism label alone does not cue linguistic accommodations, and that more positive attitudes towards autism may reduce the likelihood of linguistically accommodating autistic listeners.",

Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Most autistic children have language delays, which can result in challenges with comprehending narratives. We explored how unscripted narratives produced by parents might be tuned to support their child’s language comprehension, and how children visually follow along with their parents’ speech. Data from English-acquiring 18 autistic (48-78 months) and 18 language-matched non-autistic children (32-50 months) and one of their parents were analyzed (n = 36). We examined variables related to topic identification and maintenance, including how often parents mentioned the narrative’s topic, how they referred to it (e.g., “the pig” vs. “it”), and how much children looked at it. Results indicated many similarities between groups, but also some key differences: parents of autistic children produced shorter narratives and talked about the primary character proportionally more than parents of non-autistic children. In both groups, children looked at the primary character more than other characters, and the parent’s proportion of topic reference was positively associated with children’s proportion of looking at the primary character. Similar patterns arose with the full sample of autistic children, which includes children who had not been able to be matched on language (n = 32). These findings suggest that parent input to autistic children may be tuned to support challenges that autistic children might experience, such as slower language processing or distractibility by unrelated story elements, and, given this tuned input, autistic children were successful, at least in the sense of looking at the primary character, in following along with the narratives.",

          "abstract": "People with emetophobia (specific fear of vomiting) are prone to experience disgust and tend to interpret feelings of disgust as signs of imminent vomiting. Accordingly, they typically avoid situations they believe might increase the likelihood of vomiting or expose them to others vomiting. Because of this, vomit-related stimuli are often used as part of exposure exercises during treatment. To examine relationships between emetophobia symptoms, disgust, and avoidance behavior in more detail, the current study tested 126 participants (77% female) who completed self-report measures on emetophobia symptoms, disgust propensity, disgust sensitivity, and state disgust, and performed a behavioral approach test (BAT) involving a vomit-like substance in the laboratory. Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity but did not relate to disgust propensity. Both emetophobic symptomatology and disgust sensitivity—but not disgust propensity—related to higher state disgust before the BAT. In contrast, higher disgust propensity—but not emetophobic symptomatology or disgust sensitivity—related to larger increases in state disgust from before to after the BAT and to higher avoidance of the vomit-like substance. Results suggest that people with emetophobia may not be more easily disgusted by external stimuli than people without emetophobia but their subjective feelings of disgust are driven by their expectations and their tendency to evaluate the experience of disgust more negatively. This implies that the aim of exposure exercises should not be reducing vomit stimuli-induced disgust intensity but modifying patients’ expectations and interpretation of feelings of disgust.",

While the authors reported that the scale did not satisfy metric and scalar measurement invariance, their subsequent cross-national/regional comparisons and regressions were nonetheless conducted using weighted means of observed item scores, implicitly assuming cross-country/region comparability at the observed-score level. Using the publicly shared dataset, we re-evaluated these conclusions by systematically applying measurement alignment under four analytical paths: pooled-sample versus country/region-specific confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), each estimated with and without weights. Across all specifications, cross-national/regional CFA supported configural and metric invariance but failed to establish scalar or strict invariance. Importantly, under the analytical path most closely corresponding to the original study (pooled CFA with weights), only the competence and openness factors yielded admissible aligned solutions within the four-factor model. Using aligned latent scores for these two dimensions, country/region rankings changed for 62 of the 68 countries/regions. Substantive conclusions also differed: associations between perceived scientist trustworthiness and science-related populist attitudes or social dominance orientation were near zero or non-robust, whereas attitudes toward science remained strongly and positively related. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that cross-national/regional comparisons based on observed-score averages may be misleading when measurement equivalence is not established, and that latent-variable approaches such as alignment provide a more defensible basis for international inference.",

          "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with early, regionally selective neurodegenerative changes that may affect socioemotional functioning before atrophy becomes widespread. This study examined whether structural brain alterations in MCI relate to facial emotion recognition performance. Sixty adults (30 MCI, 30 healthy controls), aged 50-86 years, completed neuropsychological testing, the Facial emotion composite Task, and structural MRI. \nOur results revealed no significant gray matter volume differences between groups. Cortical thickness analyses identified two regions with reduced thickness in MCI: the right superior parietal lobule and the left posterior insula. Results revealed that greater regional volume predicted better sadness recognition in MCI, whereas this association was negative in healthy controls. These findings suggest that early MCI involves selective thinning in association cortices supporting attention and salience processing. The sadness-specific interaction indicates that patients with MCI may draw on structural reserve within the superior parietal lobule to support recognition of subtle negative expressions, highlighting early parietal involvement in socioemotional decline.",

          "abstract": "Political scandals can shape entire elections and political structures within society. Scholars have long pointed to different strategies politicians can use to respond to such scandals—finding strategies like denying may be more effective than apologizing. However, a recent trend suggests politicians increasingly respond to accusations of scandal by emphasizing how they (or their political in-group) have been victimized. These victimhood strategies may be highly effective by garnering sympathy and reducing blame, but have yet to be studied in political scandal research. Across 3 studies in the United States (N = 2,541), we show that when politicians respond to scandal accusations by emphasizing their own (or their political in-group’s) victimhood, participants see them as more moral and less responsible for the scandal. Additionally, people are more sympathetic to politicians emphasizing victimhood as compared to apologizing and control conditions. Victimhood strategies do not reduce competency evaluations—potentially making these strategies especially effective. While responding by highlighting victimhood is less effective than denial, victimhood strategies positively benefit reactions to scandalized politicians with people from across the ideological spectrum. Further these strategies work similarly well for male and female politicians. These findings underscore how responding to scandal with victimhood can significantly and positively influence the publics’ perceptions of a scandalized politician—highlighting the powerful influence of victimhood in political scandal research.",

          "abstract": "The constructs of emotion, affect, and emotion regulation are widely emphasized as central to psychological health and well-being. Although the conceptualization of emotion is a matter of much debate, two key features pervade affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the assumption of an innate and universal valence-determining process, and (b) a conceptual approach involving the grouping of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often viewed as genetically inherited patterns with situation-specific aims. These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination. I then demonstrate how they can obscure more critical and meaningful targets and foster unwarranted assumptions, potentially contributing to iatrogenic effects and limited treatment efficacy, suboptimal intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning, and concerns pertaining to social control and justice.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "There are unique challenges to recruiting and retaining couples in relationship research. This study used a mixed-methods approach to understand characteristics that predict participation in a dyadic relationship study. We recruited a racially diverse sample of 59 undergraduate students to complete a set of quantitative measures.  Of these participants, 26 completed a semi-structured qualitative interview, and 17 completed repeated-measures surveys. Of the 59 initial participants, 30 (51%) were willing for their partner to take part the study. We found evidence that both relationship perceptions and mental health symptoms influenced participation. Individuals who reported using domination during conflict with their partner were less likely to participate in the qualitative interview. Discrimination was negatively associated with likelihood of participation in the qualitative interview, but was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Relationship quality, separation during conflict, and anxiety symptoms were positively associated with one’s likelihood of willingness for their partner’s involvement in the study, and there was a negative association for depression symptoms. Interpersonal trauma exposure was negatively associated with willingness for partner involvement but was not statistically significant (p=0.07). Participants were asked to describe their thoughts about dyadic research participation. We found that an individual’s perceptions of their partner’s interest and availability to participate were additional factors that predicted willingness for their partner to be involved in the study. Despite the involved nature of repeated-measures research, participants identified few perceived barriers to survey completion. Our findings add nuance to the field’s understanding of who participates in relationship science research, but also why these individuals choose to take part. The results also highlight methodological implications for consideration when conducting relationship research.",

          "abstract": "Neurolinguistic research on syntactic processing has utilized Node Count, the number of structure-building steps executed at each word, to investigate how the effort invested in structure building affects brain activity. However, several recent studies cast doubt on the presumed link between Node Count and processing effort; they observe negative correlations between Node Count and reading times. Addressing this disagreement, we analyze information-theoretic measures and reading times using three large-scale naturalistic datasets in English across different grammar formalisms: phrase-structure grammar, dependency grammar, and combinatory categorial grammar. This study establishes a dual nature of Node Count: we conclude that it indexes two opposing forces—processing facilitation due to predictability in immediate regions and processing inhibition due to contextual semantic integration in spillover regions. We also demonstrate that Node Count has a unique psycholinguistic value as an index of human prediction, since its facilitatory effect explains reading time variance beyond that captured by a Transformer-based language model. These results highlight the role of structural representations in human language processing and underscore the need for a careful interpretation of the observed correlations between Node Count and brain activity in neurolinguistic studies.",

          "abstract": "Estimating the minimum sample size needed to reach a target performance in machine learning models is a recurring problem in applied research. Unlike many traditional statistical settings, where tools such as GPower can provide closed-form answers, machine learning rarely offers analytic formulas for sample-size planning. In this article, we propose a Monte Carlo simulation approach that uses empirical learning curves and power-law fitting to estimate the required sample size for a given, fixed modeling pipeline. The method uses a Monte Carlo resampling design with a fixed test set, evaluates several training sample sizes through repeated stochastic runs, then: (1) builds learning curves, (2) fits a power-law model to extrapolate, and (3) identifies the sample size that satisfies explicit criteria for mean performance, probability of success, and stability. We implement the procedure in R through the ml_sample_size() function in the easyML package, supporting both classification and regression with common algorithms (e.g.,Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, GLM) for tabular data typical in the social, health, and \nbehavioral sciences. A key limitation is that the recommended sample size n∗ is conditional on the chosen hyperparameter configuration. When hyperparameter tuning is planned, n∗ should be treated as a lower bound, and additional observations may be needed to reflect the added complexity tuning typically introduces. Finally, we provide applied examples using simulated and real datasets to show how the method can support prospective study planning.",

This research tests whether trust in neighbors plays a similar role. Methods: Analyses using data (N = 1,762) from the Midlife in the U.S. study tested whether SES (educational attainment, income, and assets) and trust in neighbors interacted to predict two indices of metabolic syndrome, a marker of cardiovascular and diabetes risk. These two metabolic syndrome indices were the number of dimensions on which participants met clinical risk cutoffs and a diagnosis. Results: SES interacted with neighborhood trust to predict the number of dimensions on which risk cutoffs were met (b = 0.08, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.14], p = 0.014). Lower, but not higher, SES participants met risk cutoffs on fewer dimensions when they had higher trust in their neighbors. The same pattern emerged for the diagnosis outcome, although in this case, the significance of the SES x trust in neighbors interaction depended on the covariates included. Conclusions: Living in neighborhoods where individuals trust each other may protect the health of individuals with lower SES, and investing in programs that build trust among neighbors may reduce health disparities.",

This vocal diversity was also reflected by the distinct acoustic features of typical versus atypical vocalizations. Finally, we demonstrate that co-occurring visual context has profound impact on the perception of real-life laughter and crying vocalizations, especially when vocal cues are ambiguous.

          "authors": "Kamil Safader",
          "abstract": "Persistent differences between autistic and neurotypical cognition are widely documented across perception, reasoning, communication, and social interaction, yet existing explanations remain fragmented across disciplinary levels. This paper proposes a unified account grounded in predictive processing, information theory, representational format, and phenomenology. It explains these differences as systematic consequences of how cognitive systems regulate and selectively attenuate information prior to explicit inference. We argue that the critical distinction does not concern the capacity for prediction as such, but the manner in which predictive systems attenuate low-probability, high-information signals. Informational attenuation is introduced as a common organizing mechanism linking multiple explanatory levels. At the computational level, it defines a principled trade-off between informational fidelity and predictive efficiency, grounded in information-theoretic relations between probability, surprisal, and compression. At the algorithmic level, this trade-off is implemented through precision weighting and thresholding processes that determine which signals are propagated, suppressed, or preserved. At the representational level, differential attenuation shapes predictive format itself, biasing cognition toward either inductively compressed content or explicitly maintained formal structure. At the phenomenological level, the same mechanisms account for systematic differences in experiential organization, explaining why some forms of cognition are characterized by transparency and immediacy, while others involve heightened explicitness and structural salience. At the social and interactional level, differential attenuation explains how inductively stabilized norms support epistemic stability—and why structurally oriented agents may experience such normativity as opaque, underdetermined, or coercive. By linking these levels through a single mechanistic principle, the proposed framework avoids both reductionism and explanatory fragmentation. Autism is thereby understood not as a localized cognitive deficit nor as a loose collection of symptoms, but as a coherent reconfiguration of predictive instantiation and informational priorities.",

We test this prediction in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1,949 Americans) by leveraging the ability of artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) to engage in evidence-based back-and-forth dialogues. Participants allocated $1 between their favorite charity and a highly effective charity (the Against Malaria Foundation), before and after a conversation with an LLM advocating for the effective charity, a static LLM-generated persuasive message, or a control conversation. The LLM conversation\nsignificantly increased effective donations (45.9%), a significantly larger increase than the static message or control, as well as shifting moral attitudes.

This review presents a new transdiagnostic preventative framework for conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC). The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours - including emotional awareness and regulation of distractions, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with adaptive patterns of connectivity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self, which are associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to adaptive connectivity patterns in mentalizing, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

Additionally, we investigated whether interpersonal values explain this relationship. The findings demonstrated that all Machiavellianism and psychopathy were positively correlated with dislikeability, mediated by the value of distance, whereas no significant negative association with likeability was observed. Uniquely, narcissism was positively related to popularity, with no mediating factors identified, and negatively associated with unpopularity, with this relationship mediated by dominance value. Given that values affecting peer social status are more malleable than traits, they may serve as promising targets for early intervention aimed at preventing social rejection and helping adolescents develop more adaptive strategies to gain peer attention and acceptance.\n\nKeywords:\nDark Triad, popularity, unpopularity, likeability, dislikeability, interpersonal values, sociometric network",

          "abstract": "Gender minority stress theory is the premier theoretical framework for understanding the health and well-being of transgender and non-binary people. However, a theoretical disconnect exists within this field: the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Measure (GMSRM), widely used to assess gender minority stress, is rooted in latent variable theory, assuming that different stressors (represented as items on the GMSRM) are statistically unrelated, once their given latent variable is accounted for. However, gender minority stress theory proposes that these stressors cause one another, specifically, that distal stressors cause proximal stressors. To address this inconsistency between theory and measurement, we interrogated the assumptions of latent variable models and considered a relatively new measurement framework psychometric network analysis. Our analysis of GMSRM data from 1006 trans* individuals revealed that the GMSRM is better represented by a psychometric network, rather than multiple latent variables, uncovering complex, direct associations among items across its subscales. These findings highlight the need to align measurement approaches with theoretical assumptions to better understand how social stressors impact transgender and non-binary populations.",

Extant youth AL research is hampered by reliance on developmentally-insensitive measurement conventions originating from adult AL studies. This study assessed the developmental utility of four AL measurement strategies with data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N=1303 early adolescents). The traditional count of out-of-range AL biomarkers and an alternative summation of biomarker z-scores had low internal consistencies and were weakly correlated with psychosocial variables. Exploratory factor analysis failed to identify AL factors. Latent profile analysis yielded one “Normative” (average biomarker levels) profile and three distinct AL profiles that were associated with different putative psychosocial risk factors and sequelae. These findings suggest that, instead of downward extension of adult AL conventions, alternate approaches capturing the heterogeneity of biopsychosocial development may most effectively identify accelerated biological aging among early adolescents.",

          "authors": "Christina Artemenko; Mine Avcil",
          "abstract": "Arithmetic processing is represented in a fronto-parietal network of the brain. However, activation within this network is thought to undergo a developmental shift from domain-general cognitive processing in the frontal cortex towards domain-specific magnitude processing in the parietal cortex. This assumption is primarily based on findings in children and young adults. In this registered report, we set out to replicate the proposed fronto-parietal activation shift in arithmetic processing and, for the first time, to explore how neural development of arithmetic continues during aging. This registered report focuses on the behavioral and neural correlates of arithmetic and arithmetic complexity across the lifespan, i.e., childhood, when arithmetic is first learned; young adulthood, when arithmetic skills are well established already, and old age, when individuals have lifelong arithmetic experience. Therefore, brain activation during mental arithmetic was measured in children, younger adults, and older adults using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Arithmetic complexity was manipulated via carry and borrow operations in two-digit addition and subtraction. The results provide evidence that increasing arithmetic complexity is associated with increased activation in the fronto-parietal network across all age groups. Even though behavioral carry and borrow effects decrease during development, suggesting improvements in place-value processing, the underlying categorical and continuous processing characteristics and brain activation remain relatively stable. Thus, this study provides evidence against a developmental fronto-parietal shift in arithmetic processing across the lifespan. While frontal activation may decrease from childhood to adulthood, parietal activation does not show a corresponding increase. Overall, these results suggest that arithmetic skills acquired in childhood are maintained throughout the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Song et al. (2016) proposed a framework to build trainable excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural networks with user-specified biological mechanisms. These models allow researchers to simulate a miriad of neural, cognitive and behavioral hypothesis through neural circuits, making them one of the most powerful simulation tools for theoretical cognitive modeling nowadays. In the present study we find that using ReLU on weights (not nodes) to set the excitatory and inhibitory populations (Dale's principle) leads to a catastrophic loss of connections beyond user control, compromising its reproducibility and comparability. We explain the reasons behind this connectivity pruning and study its impact through a reproduction of a recent simulation study about activity-silent working memory based on Song et al. (2016)'s framework. We show that ReLU leads to a loss of up to 95% of connections, makes connectivity patterns dependent on the task and biological features of the model, impairs training and modifies neural dynamics in unpredictable ways. Moreover, we show it makes training substantially less efficient and prone to performance issues. As an alternative, we found that Absolute Value function to rectify weights is notably more efficient and avoids connectivity pruning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Family history is a well-established transdiagnostic risk factor for psychiatric disorders, while perceived social support is a protective factor. However, it remains unclear whether social support reduces the associated risk conferred by family history across a range of psychiatric conditions within a single, large cohort.\n\nMethods: We used data from the NIH All of Us Research Program (N=276,261; age M=56.97, SD=16.97; 61.4% female). Logistic regression analyses examined associations between family history of five disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, schizophrenia), perceived social support, and electronic health record-based diagnoses (outcome variables). Models tested main and interaction effects, controlling for demographics.\n\nResults: Family history of a matched disorder was the strongest predictor for each diagnosis (ORs from 1.63 95% CI [1.59, 1.67] for depression to 3.53 95% CI [3.00, 4.13] for PTSD); significant cross-disorder effects supported a transdiagnostic model. Higher social support was associated with lower risk across all disorders (ORs from 0.942 95% CI [0.932, 0.953] for bipolar to 0.986 95% CI [0.980, 0.991] for anxiety). A statistically significant interaction between family history and social support was found for depression (OR=0.981 95% CI [0.965, 0.997]) and anxiety (OR=0.979 95% CI [0.960, 0.999]), where higher social support exhibited a higher estimated effect in those with family history.\n\nConclusions: While family history and low social support are cross-disorder risk factors, the moderating effect of social support on familial risk appears to be specific to depression and anxiety. Clinical assessments should incorporate family history, and interventions bolstering social support should be tested for their potential to reduce the risk of depression and anxiety in those with high familial risk.",

Reviewed articles were drawn from six journals notable for publishing pediatric EEG research between 2011-2023. We screened over 650 articles, resulting in 56 articles for further data extraction. Extracted information included: sample characteristics (e.g. age), data collection paradigm (e.g., resting paradigm), preprocessing and signal analysis steps (e.g., power spectra transformations, frequency band boundaries), and statistical analysis methods (e.g., multiple comparison corrections). Our results highlight substantial differences in data collection, preprocessing, and analytic steps that are largely not explained by sample age, publication year, or resting paradigm. Collectively, our findings emphasize the need for increased standardization in data collection, preprocessing, and analysis methods to ensure future developmental EEG research is reproducible and reliable.

Previous gaze-tracking research suggests body dissatisfaction is related to greater attentional bias towards lower-weight bodies. Here, we aimed to partially replicate and extend previous work to verify this association by using realistic body stimuli and a validated scale of body dissatisfaction. Sixty, mostly young, women from the general population underwent eye-tracking whilst viewing picture pairs of women’s bodies morphed to be lower- and higher-weight. Attentional bias was measured as percentage fixation duration, fixation count and first fixations on lower-weight compared to higher-weight bodies. There was weak evidence that all women fixated for longer on lower-weight bodies and that participants with higher body dissatisfaction spent less time fixating on lower-weight bodies, contrary to our hypotheses and to previous findings, but this effect was not robust to adjustment for age and BMI. This lack of replication suggests this association is not robust in non-clinical populations. Instead, an overall bias towards lower-weight bodies could contribute to higher levels of body dissatisfaction and risk of mental health problems in younger women. Future studies measuring attentional biases in realistic settings and in clinical populations with eating disorder symptoms are needed.",

We found prevalent under-reporting and wide-spread modifications of procedural details. We identified 244 distinct scores used to quantify IGT outcomes, 177 of which appeared only once in our sample. To quantify the potential impact of this flexibility, we performed a multiverse analysis using 205 scores on an open IGT dataset. Correlations among these ranged from rs = -0.942 to 0.998 with a median r = 0.022, suggesting that different scoring strategies can produce extremely different study outcomes.

This has led to tensions in the literature, variations of interpretation of extremism, and synonymously treated terminology. This raises the question of whether research, interventions and policy are truly examining and targeting extremism. To address the lacuna in literature and policy, an investigation of a definition of extremism representative of the variety of cultures is needed. A systematic search was undertaken to identify the definitions of extremism used in policy for each country in the United Nations. As definitions or descriptions were found, overarching categories were coded. The top 12 categories, out of the 24 found, were utilised to form an overarching definition of extremism. The categories found were then grouped by the researcher, into a behavioural component, a logistical component or a motivational component of the definitions of extremism. A cluster analysis was then undertaken on the three components, resulting in six clusters labelled for the behavioural component, two for the motivational, and five for the logistical. This resulted in a secondary consideration of cultural differences amongst countries interpretations of extremism. This review of policy definitions takes the first step into understanding extremism on an international level through the creation of a representative definition, whilst still accounting for cultural variations. \n\nKeywords: extremism, United Nations, definition, culture, review.",

However, these methods are not always feasible to use and have their own share of problems. In the current study, we systematically investigated how the choice of response scale for subjective reports affects the validity and reliability of participants’ responses. We designed a computer task in which we manipulated the degree of objective control that participants had across trials. Participants reported their experienced sense of control after each trial. Across five experiments, we compared responses on five scales: a linear visual analogue scale (VAS), a percentage VAS, a 7-point Likert, a 4-point Likert, and a binary scale. In two additional experiments, we compared the directionality of the linear scale. The results were remarkably similar for all except the binary scale: participants demonstrated the tendency to underestimate their level of control, especially for intermediate levels of objective control, and the between-block reliability of responses indicated a very high level of reliability. In addition, we propose that our task can be used as a measure of individual differences and developed metrics that can be extracted from participants’ responses. Our findings demonstrate that contrary to the dominant opinion, explicit reports are characterized by high reliability, and we provide practical recommendations for the choice of a scale for measuring sense of control.",

We find no impact on our primary preregistered outcome (an aggregated index of mid-to-high-frequency brain activity) or our secondary preregistered outcome frontal gamma power. In additional analyses that were part of our pre-registered analytic plan, we find that preschoolers in the high-cash gift group have higher alpha power than those in the low-cash gift group, but no differences in theta, beta, or gamma power.

          "abstract": "Psychologists are often asked to inform concrete actions (\"Should we ban social media?\") but tend to focus on vague questions (\"Does ‘time spent on social media’ predict well-being?\"). There is a mismatch between the causal effects researchers care about and the associations and correlations they compute. In this article, we highlight the consistency assumption as a foundational requirement for causal inference that can bridge this mismatch and make statistical estimations causally interpretable. Consistency shows how causal effects are interpretable only when (a) the causal effect of interest—the causal estimand—is described precisely enough that it does not bundle different versions of the treatment that have different effects, and (b) the way that the treatment variable changes in the data matches this effect of interest. We clarify these requirements and illustrate how to state and assess them in settings common in psychological research, with a focus on indirect experimental manipulations and multidimensional constructs. Making this step explicit helps researchers articulate their estimands more transparently and is a prerequisite for other concerns such as confounding and model specification.",

Addressing this “Toddler Data Desert,” we developed a touchscreen WM search task paired with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to characterize developmental change and early neural markers of ADHD risk. Methods. Participants were 190 children ages 2–6 years (M = 4.3; 86 at risk for ADHD based on SDQ Hyperactivity cutoff ≥7). Children completed the Treasure Chest Task, a self-ordered pointing WM search paradigm with stationary (spatially informative) and scrambled (featural/color informative) conditions across set sizes 3 and 6 (and set size 9 for a subset). fNIRS recorded hemodynamic responses across bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Mixed-effects models tested effects of age, condition, set size, and ADHD risk. Results.\nBehaviorally, children required fewer selections on spatially informative trials than featural trials at set sizes 3 and 6, with performance improving with age. Under super-capacity demand (set size 9), spatial–featural differences diminished and variability increased. Perseveration decreased robustly with age, indicating developmental gains in cognitive control and strategy updating. ADHD risk did not significantly predict behavioral efficiency. Neurally, spatial blocks showed age-related increases in frontal recruitment, consistent with a shift toward top-down control. During featural blocks, children engaged a left-lateralized frontotemporal-parietal network, while ADHD-risk children exhibited broader frontal recruitment, including additional right frontal engagement. Conclusions. This toddler-feasible touchscreen fNIRS paradigm dissociates spatial and featural attention within WM search and reveals early neural signatures of ADHD risk despite comparable behavioral performance.\n\nKeywords: fNIRS; working memory; dimensional attention; ADHD risk; early childhood",

          "abstract": "Cognitive science has historically evolved by incorporating new disciplines in response to advances in science and technology. We argue that the growing emphasis on naturalistic perception and cognition marks another such interdisciplinary moment, particularly in the auditory domain. Cognitive neuroscience and audio engineering share a common object of inquiry—sound—and a common receiver—the human auditory system—yet they have largely evolved in isolation. This separation now constrains progress in both fields. Auditory neuroscience often relies on simplified stimuli that weaken spatial and scene-level cues central to real-world hearing, while audio engineering frequently depends on industry conventions that lack grounding in neural and cognitive evidence. Building on classic work in auditory scene analysis, contemporary models of spatial hearing, and the broader rise of naturalistic paradigms in neuroscience, we propose that bridging these disciplines is not merely a technical improvement but a methodological and epistemological imperative. We introduce the sonic loop: a bidirectional framework in which spatial audio approaches, as implemented in contemporary immersive audio formats, enable technically rigorous yet ecologically valid neuroscience, while neural and behavioral data provide principled constraints for perceptually optimized audio engineering.",

          "abstract": "In the presence of pain, performance during imposed workload motor tasks may be maintained at the cost of a higher perceived effort (PE). This study investigated how experimentally induced thermal pain and naturally occurring muscle pain influence force production during a fixed PE task. Forty young adults performed intermittent isometric handgrip contractions at light (13/100) or hard (50/100) PE intensities across two visits. Each visit included an experimental condition, featuring thermal pain in block 1, and a control condition, with non-painful warm stimulation in block 2. Participants completed 10 blocks (five repetitions of block 1 and block 2), with force production and muscle electromyography continuously recorded. Participants rated thermal and muscle pain after each block. Force production was higher during thermal pain compared to control, with no interaction with PE intensity. Regression analysis showed that each one-unit increase in muscle pain (0–100 scale) corresponded to a reduction in peak force (0.37N), mean force (0.25N), and force integral (0.80N·s). During a fixed perceived effort task, thermal pain prompts an increase in force production, possibly reflecting attentional mechanisms related to exercise-induced hypoalgesia. In contrast, muscle pain is associated with reduced force output, likely because more force would perpetuate more muscle pain. Therefore, the type of pain has a varied effect on force production during voluntary motor tasks. This study questions the well-accepted inhibitory effect of pain on force production and encourages future research to use fixed PE tasks to fully appraise the effects of different type of pain on force production.",

          "abstract": "Syntactic priming paradigms are widely used to investigate language production, yet they are almost exclusively implemented in controlled laboratory settings. This limits scalability, inclusivity, and the study of language behavior in everyday contexts. Here, we present and validate a smartphone-based method for measuring syntactic priming. Our mobile application implements a picture description task commonly used in laboratory studies and incorporates automated speech transcription and syntactic classification. Using our app, we collected data on the production of active and passive sentence structures and evaluated short-term, cumulative, and long-term (across sessions) priming effects. To assess methodological validity, we compared the patterns observed in app-collected data with those obtained previously using an equivalent laboratory paradigm. Results demonstrate that the mobile app reliably elicits short-term syntactic priming, with increased production of passive structures following passive primes, replicating well-established laboratory effects. Within-session analyses further revealed cumulative priming, indicating gradual learning of infrequent syntactic structures. Long-term priming over a one-week interval was not observed in the app data, in contrast to laboratory findings. However, a follow-up experiment with a 24-hour interval between sessions yielded significant long-term priming effects, suggesting that retention of syntactic learning may decay more rapidly in uncontrolled, real-world environments. Together, these findings establish the mobile application as a valid and scalable method for studying syntactic priming outside the laboratory.

          "authors": "Melitta Schneider; Alphonce Omolo; Edgar Erdfelder",
          "abstract": "Background: The number of children and adolescents worldwide who experience complex trauma is increasing, while early interventions in this age group are largely absent. Past research has demonstrated that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) group treatments are effective in treating acute trauma in children. However, evidence for children suffering from complex trauma is lacking so far.\nObjective: The objective of our approach is to address this gap by providing a novel specialized EMDR protocol for group treatments of children and adolescents (maximum age range: 7–17 years) who have experienced complex trauma. A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in the remote areas of Kisumu, Kenya, to evaluate the EMDR Trauma Management Protocol (EMDR-TMP).\nMethods: The efficacy of EMDR-TMP was evaluated through a randomized treatment versus waiting-control group design in Kenya, based on 103 children (11–14 years) suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants were randomly assigned to either a treatment-first group or a waiting-control group. PTSD symptom severity was assessed using the Children and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS). Additional questionnaires were employed to assess depressive symptoms, anxiety, and behavioral problems.\nResults: After EMDR-TMP treatments, Subjective Unit of Distress (SUD) scores showed a marked reduction, approaching a score of almost zero after therapy. In the CATS, both the differences between pre- and post-tests and the comparison of treatment-first and waiting-control group demonstrated a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms to a non-clinical value after EMDR-TMP therapy. Behavioral symptoms were reduced significantly after two months follow-up.\nConclusion: Results indicate that EMDR-TMP can reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms and associated behavioral issues in children and adolescents to a nonclinical value. As this method provides for an individualized treatment of complex trauma in small group settings, it is an efficient means whenever there are many children in urgent need of treatment.",

Instead, the high-capacity generalist model (Gemini Pro 2.0) exhibited the highest performance (CCR = 0.722, 95% CI [0.590, 0.838]), significantly outperforming all other models (OR ≤ 0.19, p &lt; .001) and achieving parity with human benchmarks (CCR = 0.717).

However, the failed replication study by Foody et al. (2015) typically goes uncited. Given their importance, I critically re-evaluate the results of both articles. I found several issues, the most important of which was that the central claim does not correspond with the reported analyses. When I extracted summary statistics from both studies and used them to conducte a multiverse analysis, that mapped directly onto the original claim (i.e., that the hierarchy condition reduced distress more than the distinction condition), null results were found under every set of conditions.

          "authors": "Philipp Sterner; Eunsook Kim; David Goretzko",
          "abstract": "Psychology is increasingly interested in the prediction of constructs via machine learning (ML) models, for example, predicting a person’s personality or intelligence. To measure these constructs, psychologists often draw on questionnaires. In supervised ML, these measurements are then used as target variables (i.e., the “ground truth”) for model training. It is currently paid only little attention to psychometric issues and biases that might be carried over from measurements in the training data to the final model used for predictions. One potential bias is a lack of measurement invariance (MI) of the questionnaire data across groups that are used as target values for supervised learning. If non-invariant measrurements are used for model training, this might bias the predictions of the final ML model. Specifically, people from two different groups with the same true score on a construct might receive different predicted scores by the model. In this article, we assess the impact of a lack of MI in target variables on ML predictive performance and investigate approaches to counter this impact. We address this question by a comprehensive simulation study in which we derive target values from (a) single-group models (i.e., ignoring non-invariance) and (b) alignment optimization (i.e., handling non-invariance). Results show that single-group factor scores make ML models reproduce measurement bias in their predictions. Aligned factor scores can improve prediction performance if measurements are non-invariant, but only if certain conditions are met. We discuss implications for psychological applications of ML as well as directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how the brain operates in the context of the real-world is one of the main goals of neuroscience and smartphones may offer a path toward this aim. As ubiquitous, sensor-rich mobile devices, smartphones continuously and passively capture diverse real-world human behavior, from smartphone-derived behaviors (e.g, smartphone usage duration and touchscreen dynamics) to broader smartphone-inferred behaviors (e.g. social activity, daily routine, circadian rhythm, etc). Smartphones combined with neural measures have begun to reveal some amazing glimpses of brain functions. Evidence from neuroimaging, electrophysiological and behavior indicates that smartphone use is linked to structural and functional brain alterations across multiple neural processes, and the fluctuations in touchscreen interactions alone even serve as a sensitive indicator of brain following epileptic seizures. Together, these findings highlight the potential of smartphone behavior as a biomarker of brain function, analogous to heart-rate variability as an index of mental health and eye movements as indicators of neural information processing. Realizing this potential could enable continuous monitoring of brain health and support clinical applications such as early diagnosis, and recovery assessment. However, significant challenges remain, including measuring and quantifying smartphone behaviors alongside neural activity and establishing interpretable links between them. Longitudinal recording by pairing portable mobile imaging with smartphone behavior may help establish robust neuro-behavioral links, while experimental interventions, such as smartphone deprivation or behavioral modulation, could clarify causality. Additionally, dimensionality reduction approaches may further identify key neural features underlying specific smartphone behaviors. Ultimately, overcoming these challenges could enable smartphones to evolve from passive observers of daily behavior to active indicators of brain function, advancing a more integrated and ecologically grounded neuroscience of everyday behavior.",

          "abstract": "The “inequality paradox” highlights that greater economic inequality does not consistently trigger more demands for redistribution. We propose that support for redistribution may not only depend on the magnitude of inequality but also on how inequality is experienced in everyday life. Across three studies (N = 1,111), we examined whether different types of inequality help revise this paradox. In Study 1, participants described salient experiences of inequality. Content analysis revealed two distinct inequality types—Structural and Lifestyle—associated with different emotional responses. In Study 2, new participants rated these experiences, judging Structural Inequality as more unequal and unfair than Lifestyle Inequality. In Study 3, experimentally manipulating inequality type showed that Structural more than Lifestyle Inequality triggered support for redistribution through anger and perceived unfairness. These findings demonstrate that everyday experiences of inequality carry distinct emotional and political consequences, clarifying when inequality motivates support for redistribution, and when it does not.",

          "authors": "Niki Pennanen; Robin Welsch; Christian Guckelsberger",
          "abstract": "Generative AI tools for image creation are now mainstream, yet we know little about when and why observers judge them as “creative”. Previous human-robot interaction research suggests that revealing the creation process can raise perceived machine creativity and points that observer differences may moderate this effect. We take these observations from physical robots to the bigger domain of virtual text-to-image diffusion systems by manipulating perceptual evidence (PE), i.e., interface-visible cues about the generation process. We report two preregistered online experiments looking into PE and observer individual differences. Study 1 (N=298) used a within-subjects manipulation comparing Product (final image only) to Product+Process (adding a short animation of the denoising process). Study 2 (N=295) added a between-subjects tutorial (diffusion vs. control) in a 2x2 mixed design. The tutorial briefly explained how diffusion models generate images, intended to raise system-specific literacy. Contrary to previous work, confirmatory analyses found no average effect of showing Process on creativity, and no tutorial effect. Exploratory analyses revealed that general AI literacy moderated the PE contrast, i.e., at lower literacy, observing process tended to lower creativity ratings; at higher literacy, it tended to raise them. Moreover, attitudes toward AI and art interest were positively associated with creativity ratings. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses indicated potential reasons for the lack of overall PE effect. Taken together, these converging quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that individual differences systematically shape creativity judgments of text-to-image GenAI and, in our setting, exert stronger and more reliable influence than PE alone. For design, this implies that process visualizations could help some audiences more than others. Interfaces that adapt to literacy and attitudes, or that pair process views with contextual explanation calibrated to user background, could be more likely to shift judgments than one-size-fits-all depictions of generation.",

          "abstract": "People systematically deviate from rational Bayesian standards in belief updating, displaying biases such as base-rate neglect and conservatism. Two very different types of model aim to explain these biases: simple heuristics and stochastic sampling approximations of the Bayesian solution, like the Bayesian Sampler. However, neither approach alone accounts for the variety of responses. Here we explore a hybrid Heuristic-Anchored Bayesian Sampler (HABS) which integrates simple heuristics with a Bayesian sampler. In this framework, a simple heuristic provides an initial estimate, which may then be refined through a Bayesian sampling process to approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior. Behaviour thus depends on the size of the sample: if no samples are drawn, a heuristic response is produced, but adding samples will introduce noise while increasing average  judgment accuracy. Analyses of data from a new experiment (N=200) and re-analysis of data from Stengård et al., 2022  revealed that, in most conditions, this integrative approach outperformed purely heuristic or purely Bayesian models in explaining how people update their beliefs in the medical diagnosis task. Our findings suggest that people flexibly combine mental shortcuts and approximate Bayesian processes, illuminating why some responses appear purely heuristic while others reflect approximate Bayesian updating.",

Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total N = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals in both attitudes and related behaviour. Replicating existing findings, we demonstrate that adult men are more morally exclusive than women in both attitude and behaviour. Crucially, we identify adolescence (13–18 years) as the key window for development: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is an increase in social dominance orientation with age in males. We further find the onset of gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children.",

This study aimed to understand the extent to which pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain are associated with future parental perception of their infant’s response to injury.\nMethods. Participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) self-reported pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain at age 18.  When they became parents, they reported their infant’s responsivity to injury (N=84) and uncomfortable procedures (dirty nappy, N=73) at 6 months old. Logistic regression examined the association between pre-conception perceptions of pain and infant responsivity to injury and uncomfortable procedures, controlling for maternal pre-conception anxiety.\nResults. Analysis indicated an almost four-fold increase in parental perception of infant reactivity to injury where parents held perceptions of pain as harmful at age 18 (OR = 5.95, p = .001). There was no evidence that parental perceptions of pain at age 18 influenced the likelihood of reporting their infant could be calmed if fussing about a dirty nappy (OR = 1.34, p = .686). \nConclusions. This study indicates that pain schemas in young adults may pose a risk of parental reinforcement of, and attention to, pain, and greater perceived infant responsivity to pain.

          "abstract": "The congruency effect, characterized by faster and more accurate performance in congruent compared to incongruent trials, has been consistently observed in various conflict tasks. However, the search for common underlying attentional control processes reveals significant differences between conflict tasks, as evident from different time courses of the congruency effect (i.e., delta functions) and a lack of correlations in performance across different conflict tasks. To address these issues, the Diffusion Model for Conflict Tasks (DMC) has been employed to explicitly model congruency effects and explain different delta function shapes. However, estimating the parameters of the DMC using standard iterative methods faces computational challenges. In this study, we leverage Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) with deep learning to address these limitations. We use different prior distributions, levels of model complexity, and automated hyperparameter optimization within a principled workflow. ABI produces well-calibrated posteriors across a wide range of trial counts, estimating individual-level parameters as accurately as iterative methods, while requiring only a fraction of their runtime once the initial training phase is complete. Additionally, we selectively manipulated irrelevant information strength in a flanker task to assess the sensitivity of DMC parameters to experimental effects. As expected, the amplitude of the automatic process was influenced by stimulus spacing in a flanker paradigm. However, the effect on the peak latency parameter depended on the choice of model parameterization and prior hyperparameters. Taken together, we demonstrate the viability of ABI as a scalable, accurate alternative to conventional estimation techniques and provide a reproducible workflow for future cognitive modeling studies.",

At the scale level, the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity were assessed. Results: The measure demonstrated reasonable item sensitivity, non-redundance, construct validity, and convergent validity at the item level.

          "abstract": "This article examines how collective memories of historical victimization and present-day immigration threat perceptions are associated with public support for restrictive immigration policies. Focusing on Greece, a country scarred by legacies of war, forced displacement, and longstanding geopolitical rivalry with Turkey, we develop an interdisciplinary framework that integrates Securitization Theory with psychological research on collective victimhood and historical moral lessons. Drawing on original, representative survey data and OLS regression analysis, we show that while both present-day immigration threat perceptions and Perpetual Ingroup Victimhood Orientation (PIVO) are significantly associated with support for restrictive immigration policies, PIVO – the belief that one's group is perpetually a victim – emerges as the strongest statistical predictor. These findings challenge presentist biases in (de)securitization research, uncovering the relevance of symbolic structures and historical consciousness in how audiences evaluate security claims. In Greece, public support for restrictive policies is conditioned by a broader macrosecuritizing logic rooted in national trauma and civilizational struggle, where moral lessons of reciprocity and humanitarian obligation coexist with defensive scripts linked to historical grievance. This article advances a history-sensitive approach to (de)securitization research and highlights the role of psycho-cultural dispositions in the durability of migration securitization in contexts marked by unresolved historical tensions.",

          "abstract": "In dynamic environments, relying solely on simple stimulus–response associations is often insufficient because identical experiences rarely recur. Instead, we need internal models that allow us to flexibly generalize past knowledge and plan for future events. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in this process by constructing cognitive maps that guide adaptive, goal-directed behavior. However, in complex and ever-changing real-world situations, no single map can capture all the relevant information. The brain must therefore maintain multiple cognitive maps, each tied to its own latent context. Moreover, since uncertainty about the hidden context underlying the observations often exists, the brain must continually decide which map to rely on for guiding behavior and to what degree it should be updated or renewed. Here we review the role the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play in providing cognitive maps and signaling inferred contexts, and how prediction errors and neuromodulators drive their continual arbitration. Disruptions in these processes, such as altered map formation, distorted map content and disrupted map arbitration, may drive overgeneralization of fear and resulting avoidance behaviors common in anxiety.",

To understand how to achieve this, it is important to not only consider restrictive policies that enforce behaviour change but also consider voluntary responses to changes in pandemic severity and behavioural advice. \n\nAim:\nThe current study investigates to what extent change in protective behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands can be attributed to self-guided behaviour change (in response to changes in pandemic severity), adherence to government behavioural advice, or to compliance with restrictive policies.\n\nMethods:\nWe analysed survey and mobility data on 7 protective behaviours from 2020–2023. Using time-series and mixed-effects models, we examined associations between pandemic severity (hospitalisations), government behavioural advice, and restrictive policies with these behaviours. Control variables included seasonality, pandemic duration, and demographic characteristics. \n\nResults:\nPandemic severity was consistently found to be associated with increases in protective behaviour, while the impact of behavioural advice and restrictive policies varied. Moreover, the estimated impact of behavioural advice and restrictive policies was substantially reduced when including pandemic severity in the models.\n\nConclusion:\nThe consistent association between pandemic severity and protective behaviours indicates that people changed their behaviour in order to protect themselves and others, even without government advice or restrictive measures. Behaviour change could be further promoted through behavioural advice and/or restrictive policies, although the estimated impact of these approaches varied substantially between target behaviours. These results highlight the importance of voluntary behaviour change and accounting for type of behaviour change when designing and evaluating mitigation policies.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the use of response time (RT) data in type-2 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, a method traditionally used to examine the relationship between confidence and response correctness. Analyses of 16 perceptual decision-making datasets revealed that: (1) RT data contains roughly two-thirds as much information about response correctness as confidence; (2) RT carries unique predictive power for response correctness, independent of confidence; (3) RT and confidence interact synergistically, with confidence becoming a stronger predictor of response correctness when RT is short; (4) Despite these unique properties of RT, type-2 sensitivity (meta-d′) derived from RT and confidence showed a reasonably high correlation across subjects. These findings carry two key implications. First, in the absence of confidence data, RT can serve as a viable proxy, incurring minimal cognitive and logistical costs. This makes type-2 analysis feasible across various settings, potentially including infant and animal studies. Second, when both RT and confidence data are available, their combined use in type-2 analysis offers complementary insights into the processes underlying subjects’ behavior. To illustrate this, we present a simulation showing how the observed behavioral patterns align with the two-stage dynamic signal detection model. We propose that RT-based type-2 analysis is a valuable tool for researchers, helping to uncover previously underexplored aspects of decision-making behavior.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice reliably enhances long-term memory across many learning domains, yet little is known about how this effect generalizes to sign languages, which require complex visual–spatial processing and coordinated motor production. Across two experiments, we investigated the roles of retrieval practice, motor enactment, and iconicity in American Sign Language (ASL) vocabulary learning among hearing adults, using both holistic and fine-grained phonological scoring. Critically, we observe a selective interaction between retrieval practice and enactment in the handshape dimension: testing improved handshape accuracy only when learners physically enacted the signs, suggesting that motorically complex articulators require the combined support of retrieval-based reinforcement and procedural motor rehearsal. In contrast, dimensions with lower motoric complexity (e.g., location, movement, orientation) showed additive or independent contributions of retrieval and enactment. Together, these findings show that retrieval practice extends to visual–manual language learning, but its effectiveness varies by phonological complexity and motor demands. The results highlight the importance of considering embodied processes in theories of retrieval-based learning and offer practical implications for optimizing sign language pedagogy.",

(2025) built an image-computable model (RANCH) that predicts adults’ and infants’ looking behavior to a large stimulus set, including graded responses to changes in pose, animacy, and number. This model succeeded despite having only a perceptual embedding space of stimuli. However, looking may be influenced by non-perceptual considerations. Using the same data, we found that adults’ behaviors challenge a key assumption of a perceptual-only account: since the perceptual distance between two items is symmetrical, behavior guided only by perceptual space should also be symmetrical. Yet, adults did not treat changes in different directions as mere reciprocal transformations. For instance, adults looked longer at magical appearance than disappearance. We suggest that image-computable models of looking behavior would benefit from representations of objects, in addition to perceptual features of images.",

          "abstract": "The neural mechanisms supporting inhibitory control in toddlers remain poorly understood, particularly regarding how early cortical development shapes behavior. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a promising approach for addressing this “Toddler Data Desert” by capturing cortical activation during executive tasks. In this study, 196 children aged 2–5 years, with and without ADHD risk, completed a Minion go/no-go task while fNIRS measured bilateral frontal–temporal and parietal activity. Subject- and group-level analyses revealed that at-risk children showed stronger recruitment of bilateral frontal cortex and greater frontal–parietal integration than typically developing peers, suggesting increased reliance on these networks for inhibitory control. These findings underscore the importance of early identification of neural markers of cognitive control difficulties and support the use of go/no-go paradigms in early neurocognitive screening. Replication with multimodal methods and increased task difficulty for older toddlers is needed, as neural activation was low across groups during both high- and low-frequency trials.",

          "abstract": "Conflict adaptation refers to the adjustment of cognitive control to reduce interference on subsequent trials. Its neural mechanisms are often studied by assessing the congruence sequence effect (CSE) in face–word Stroop tasks during neuroimaging. The present study aimed to address two key methodological issues when using standard response conflict tasks in fMRI settings: Ensuring the involvement of cognitive control in the CSE and demonstrating its temporal stability across varying inter-trial intervals. In a set of five experiments, using an adapted version of the face–word Stroop task, participants performed either a gender categorization (Experiment 3) or responded to the learned identity of four faces while ignoring the printed name (all other experiments). We specifically incorporated recent advancements in confound minimization to exclude effects of feature integration and contingency learning, included a priming component to further increase the involvement of cognitive control, and used a variable range of inter-trial intervals to test for potential applicability in fMRI research. Although a robust Stroop effect was consistently observed in all experiments, a strong CSE emerged specifically in the gender categorization task. In the confound-minimized face–word Stroop variant, a significant CSE occurred only under specific conditions (e.g., sufficiently long target presentation, bi-manual responses) and was accompanied by substantial inter-individual variability. Therefore, while we observed a reliable CSE in a confound-minimized face–word Stroop task with long inter-trial intervals, the increased methodological rigor that improves precision and interpretability also adds complexity and yields smaller and more variable effects. This trade-off constitutes an important consideration for future fMRI adaptations of the Stroop task seeking to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the CSE.",

To investigate this, we examined how positive valence (i.e., the degree to which an experience is considered pleasant or positive) influences preference-based decisions between distinct positive emotional experiences elicited by short video clips. Across two studies (N = 220 and N = 388; university students), Brier Skill Scores showed that decisions were best explained by a model that treated positive valence as uniform across emotions (Study 1), and logistic regression showed that positive valence outperformed emotion-specific preferences in accounting for choice behaviour (Study 2). Together, these findings suggest that positive valence functions as a common evaluative currency for preference-based decisions between positive emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "Efficient use of visual working memory (VWM) is essential for storing and manipulating information to optimize moment-by-moment visual cognition under a capacity constraint. Yet, how such efficiency is achieved remains a vexing problem. For instance, when observers leverage perceptual organization to group multiple identical objects to retain more visual content, they can do so by grouping items proportional to the redundancy in perceptual inputs or by leveraging a separation-based strategy to maximize identical visual inputs from those that contain at least some discrepancy. Conventional evidence based on behavioral output or univariate event-related potentials (ERPs) could not distinguish these possibilities, motivating the current study to use a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approach based on a published dataset to address this issue. In a VWM change detection task with scalp EEG recording, participants tried to remember visual arrays containing all-same, partial-different, or all-different orientation bars. Time-resolved decoding revealed early neural differentiation, around 200 ms after stimulus onset, between the all-same condition and the other conditions, suggesting that perceptual grouping benefits emerge early and exhibit a separation-based pattern. Cross-condition decoding further confirmed that visual arrays containing partially-different arrays were represented more similarly to the all-different arrays than to the all-same ones. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual grouping in visual working memory operates through a separation-based neural differentiation, in which full perceptual redundancy enables early compression into compact neural codes while partial perceptual redundancy preserves separable representations to reduce interference.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence and health consequences of methamphetamine use disorder have risen across the United States, including methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MIP). A promising, novel approach to address MIP is the use of ‘chill packs’, a psychiatric harm reduction intervention for people using methamphetamine. Chill packs consist of several low-dose olanzapine tablets (an antipsychotic medication) that can be self-administered in the event of methamphetamine-induced insomnia, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, or other dysphoric symptoms. One recent study assessed the effectiveness of an implementation of chill packs by the San Francisco Department of Health and found that repeat psychiatric emergency visits dropped by 32% after two-months and 13% after six-months. While these findings are promising, more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy and generalizability of this intervention. Here we provide a narrative review of indirect evidence and contextual information for related dynamics, including: the epidemiology of MIP, clinical data supporting the use of olanzapine versus other antipsychotics for MIP, evidence supporting as-needed use of antipsychotics in the outpatient setting, as well as ethnographic and other data describing the potential for misuse of olanzapine and other antipsychotics. Overall, the literature supports that the prevalence of MIP is rising sharply, causing increased psychiatric burden. This is also linked to overdose risk among patients that use illicit fentanyl or other sedatives to “come down” after periods of heavy methamphetamine use. Olanzapine has demonstrated comparable efficacy for treating MIP to other antipsychotics with enhanced short-term sedative effects, despite a higher burden of long-term metabolic side effects. Olanzapine has very little documented misuse risk, although other agents in its class, especially quetiapine, have higher street value. Qualitative research highlights that some groups already self-administer olanzapine as a ‘trip killer’ to manage distressing psychiatric side effects from illicit drug use.  Overall, we find substantial indirect contextual evidence supporting further trials to evaluate chill packs as a harm-reduction intervention for MIP, and provide recommendations for research needed to fill gaps in the literature for this promising, albeit new and little-studied intervention.",

In this paper, we examine the theoretical and methodological assumptions underlying information seeking research in communication. To explore these assumptions empirically, we compare linked self-report and digital trace data on health information seeking (HIS) over two weeks in a sample of U.S. adults (N=999). Top-level estimates of HIS were similar (39% self-report; 34% digital trace), but there was minimal overlap in those estimates. Measurement correspondence increased for high-volume seekers (≥20 searches). The present study offers an initial attempt at connecting self-reported information seeking with digital trace behavioral observations. Identifying ways to optimize the correspondence between information seeking theory and measurement, while recognizing the unique affordances and limitations of different communication traditions in such studies, should be a priority moving forward.",

Research suggests that such mind-wandering to secrets can be problematic for well-being, yet the mechanisms behind this link are still unclear. To better understand what may underlie the harm of mind-wandering to secrets, we conducted two studies. First, in a 14-day daily diary study (Study 1, N = 240) we investigated what people think about when mind-wandering to their secrets, and how these thoughts come to mind in daily life—spontaneously or deliberately. Second, in a 7-day experience-sampling study (Study 2, N = 207) we probed the directionality of relationships between the two types of mind-wandering and affective experiences about secrets. Across studies, when secrets came to mind spontaneously, but not deliberately, people reported feeling greater negative emotion both in the moment (Study 1 and 2) and approximately 2 hours later (Study 2). Our findings point to spontaneous mind-wandering to secrets as a primary player in the well-being costs of secrecy. Further, we offer the first investigation into spontaneous and deliberate mind-wandering to the same target thought in daily life, capturing the temporal dynamics between mind-wandering and emotional well-being. By yielding insights into the way secrets weigh on people’s minds, this research suggests possible ways to manage the well-being costs of secrets, and perhaps other ongoing concerns, in everyday life.",

Here we introduce Digital Behaviourism, a functional approach grounded in operant conditioning that explains digital behaviour through the contingencies linking antecedents, behaviours, and consequences. Rather than classifying behaviour by its form (e.g., scrolling, posting), Digital Behaviourism identifies four functions: exploration, social esteem, entertainment, and escape, that describe the reinforcement processes maintaining behaviour in context. By shifting attention from the form of behaviour to its function, Digital Behaviourism can enable more precise analysis, generate testable hypotheses, and inform effective, contextually sensitive intervention. We argue that behaviourist tradition already possesses the conceptual tools to understand digital life and offer an approach for applying them to the engineered environments where behaviour increasingly unfolds.",

This paper argues that rather than converging on a shared answer, society is likely to enter a period of confusion, uncertainty, and deep disagreement. Drawing on recent empirical evidence, I show that both experts and the public are already divided on the possibility of AI consciousness and the moral status of digital minds. I argue that this division is driven by structural features of the issue, including the difficulty of conceptualizing and measuring consciousness, conflicting economic, political, and emotional incentives, and a disconnect between AI systems’ internal architectures and their outwardly human-like behavior. Such disagreement creates risks of political polarization, regulatory instability, geopolitical tension, and an increased risk of ultimately misattributing moral status. I conclude by outlining strategies for improving expert coordination, fostering constructive public discourse, designing AI systems to reduce moral confusion, and reducing exclusive reliance on consciousness in moral and policy decisions.",

          "abstract": "Research with adults has led to the proposal of a gating mechanism between long-term memory and working memory, with information from long-term memory entering working memory only when it is beneficial. Across three experiments, we examine functioning of the gating mechanism in children using a novel cross-modal working memory task. In Experiment 1, 7-11 year-old children and adults were presented with four images of animals paired with auditorily presented sounds. Image-sound combinations were congruent with existing knowledge (e.g. cow-moo), incongruent (e.g. cow-baa) or involved neutral pseudowords (e.g. cow-jad). After a short delay, participants were presented with a sound and asked to report the paired image. Replicating previous research, adults showed superior accuracy for congruent pairings, with evidence of no difference between neutral and incongruent pairings. Children’s performance was qualitatively distinct, exhibiting both a congruency boost (congruent &gt; neutral) and an incongruency cost (neutral &gt; incongruent). Effects were replicated in children when set size was varied (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 then increased the interstimulus interval to account for children’s slower processing speed. Here, a congruency boost was consistently observed, with some evidence that an incongruency cost emerged at the lower set size. Taken together, these findings provide clear evidence that long-term memory benefits working memory performance in children. Crucially, however, children appear more sensitive to incongruent information from long-term memory relative to adults. We argue, therefore, that any gating mechanism is not fully developed in 7-11 year old children.",

One-third of Americans answer yes to the first question; we venture to answer the second question here. Stories about the end of the world are historically and globally prevalent and come in many flavours. End of world beliefs have been hypothesized to shape processes of risk perception and social behaviour that have implications for how societies respond to existential threats. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along psychologically meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Aligning with sociological and historical analyses, we argue that belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how populations confront concrete risks, including those that threaten humanity today.",

These processes are typically studied separately in the motor or cognitive domain. Here, we tested the effect of cognitive demand on PE in two psychomotor tasks (experiment 1) and we examined the effect of prescribing a target level of PE intensity on performance (experiment 2).\nIn experiment 1 (n=20), we used fixed tempo during two upper-limb psychomotor tasks (Box and Block test and pointing task) with PE as dependent variable. In experiment 2 (n=20), we used fixed PE during a self-paced pointing task with PE as independent variable. In both experiments, heart rate, respiratory rate and electromyographic signal of biceps and triceps brachii were monitored. Cognitive demand was manipulated (low, moderate, high) via a Stroop task, determining which block to move or target to reach.\nResults showed that in experiment 1, PE increased with increased cognitive demand to maintain performance in both tasks. In experiment 2, higher cognitive demand during self-paced pointing at fixed PE led to decreased performance. Heart rate proved most sensitive to cognitive demand changes among physiological variables but failed to reflect the increase in cognitive demand from low to moderate in experiment 1.\nThese results confirm the possibility of using the PE to prescribe and monitor the intensity of a psychomotor task. This study opens perspectives to investigate the unicity of effort and challenge the assumed duality of cognitive vs motor effort.",

          "abstract": "The encoding of locations in world coordinates is often called spatiotopy; it captures how we experience the layout of things around us. The visual system, on the other hand, appears to rely on retinotopic representations. The search for some critical area of the brain that recovers locations in world coordinates from the sequence of fixations as a spatiotopic map, has not met with much success. Here we review earlier suggestions that replace spatiotopic maps with the tracking or remapping of a small number of attended targets to keep their positions updated on retinotopic maps (e.g., Wurtz, 2018; Golomb &amp; Mazer, 2021). This remapping process achieves a simulation of spatiotopy – the target locations are updated and motion responses to the shift of the retinal image are suppressed and discounted. Importantly, we propose that each attended target’s identity is connected to the locations of its features in early visual cortex through a steerable autoencoder network that shifts the feature activity to the target’s new location with each saccade, explaining the many reports of trans-saccadic integration. This autoencoder process is not limited to the remapping function but is part of the overall architecture of the visual system, acting to link target properties together, even as the target or the eyes move.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study addresses limitations in standardized mental health measures for assessing psychological distress among Latinx and African newcomers in the United States. \nMethods: Using a longitudinal mixed methods design, we collected quantitative data from 1,188 participants across seven timepoints and qualitative interviews with a subsample of 36 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial analyses of NIMH-required instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DSM-V Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure) revealed unexpectedly low distress scores, contrasting with qualitative narratives describing significant suffering. Through integrated analysis, we identified discrepancies between symptom endorsement and lived experiences, highlighting cultural and contextual factors influencing distress expression. Guided by transdiagnostic frameworks, we developed the Integrated Distress Score (IDS) by combining items from depression, anxiety, stress, and coping measures. \nResults: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a second-order model with strong fit indices (RMSEA = 0.046; CFI = 0.981; TLI = 0.979). External validity was demonstrated through associations with discrimination, social support, and economic insecurity. IDS scores differentiated subgroups qualitatively categorized as “Hidden Stressed and Distressed” versus “Stressed but not Distressed,” capturing heterogeneity in distress and resilience. \nConclusions: Findings underscore the insufficiency of universal symptom-based tools for newcomer populations and advocate for culturally responsive, transdiagnostic approaches that integrate qualitative insights. This work contributes a pragmatic measure for evaluating intervention outcomes and offers conceptual implications for moving beyond categorical diagnoses toward dimensional, context-sensitive models of mental health. Future research should refine and validate IDS across diverse newcomer groups and sociocultural settings.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

          "abstract": "Forming novel friendships is an important aspect of emerging adulthood, yet little is known about how emerging adults identify potential friends in contexts where behavioral information is limited. We propose that emerging adults use value congruence to guide friendship formation when observable behavioral cues are constrained. Using an experimental approach across two studies, we investigated whether friendship interest in an unfamiliar individual was dependent on value congruence. In Study 1 (N = 322 university students; Mage = 20.70, SD = 1.62; 50% female), we evaluated value-expressive self-descriptions of peers, while in Study 2 (N = 451 university students; Mage = 19.88, SD = 1.64; 52% female), we examined friendship interest in the context of meeting someone online for the first time. Across both studies, we found associations between value congruence and friendship interest for conservation, openness, and self-transcendence values, but not for self-enhancement values. Additionally, we found that vignettes expressing openness and self-transcendence values generated higher friendship interest overall compared to those expressing self-enhancement values. Study 2 also revealed evidence for value incongruence effects, with participants reporting lower friendship interest when exposed to opposing values. These findings suggest that value (in)congruence plays a meaningful role in friendship formation among emerging adults, particularly when observable behavioral information is limited, with effects being most pronounced for values emphasizing the contrast between novelty-seeking and self-restraint.",

A panel of researchers with diverse expertise delineates best practice, acceptable, and non-recommended methods across six areas: stressor operationalizations, assessment, longitudinal study design (including intensive longitudinal design), statistical analysis, openness/ transparency, and avoiding stigmatizing language. For example, the review covers modeling stressors as formative variables, statistically comparing effect sizes for predicting independent and dependent stress, and using life stress interviews versus questionnaires, among other methodological concerns pertinent to stress generation research.

While humans infer mental states and traits from specific facial regions and their expressions, such idiosyncratic gaze patterns may shape how individual features contribute to the overall impression of a face. We hypothesized that an individual’s habitual fixation behavior biases their impression of a face to be aligned more closely with the region they most often foveate. To test this idea, we analyzed fixation patterns on faces in a scene viewing task and independent perceptual judgments regarding valence, arousal, trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness for whole faces and face parts. A linear mixed-effects model confirmed that habitual fixation proximity to eyes, nose, and mouth explained individual differences in how well ratings for whole faces were aligned with those for the corresponding isolated feature. Building on this finding, we ran a second experiment to test whether individual differences in face fixations can predict diverging impressions of trustworthiness in appropriately manipulated images. Observers reported which of two consecutively presented versions of a subtly manipulated face they perceived to be more trustworthy. Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals who tend to fixate lower down or higher up were biased to prefer versions of the face with a more trustworthy bottom or top, respectively. Together, our findings indicate that individual differences in gaze systematically shape and explain our sometimes diverging impression of a face.",

          "abstract": "The formation of a subjective sense of confidence often requires the integration of signals from multiple sources of evidence. This is of particular relevance when one needs to determine with a high degree of certainty whether a multisensory stimulus is present or absent. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this ability to map evidence strength from multiple modalities into a single confidence value is therefore central to the study of  metacognition. To this end, we asked healthy adults to detect the presence or absence of near-threshold stimuli that could be visual, auditory, or both, and then rate their confidence. In two pre-registered experiments (N = 48 and N = 54), audiovisual stimuli were better detected than unimodal ones, but were not associated with better metacognitive performance. Surprisingly, participants were more confident in their absence than presence judgments. To explain these results, we fitted a Bayesian evidence accumulation model in which sensory evidence is available for presence only, rendering decisions about absence dependent on counterfactual inference. The model reproduced decision patterns by assuming that a stimulus was perceived if sensory evidence from either modality exceeded a threshold (a disjunctive integration rule). In contrast, it reproduced confidence judgments by assuming that high confidence requires that the two modalities align (conjunctive for presence, disjunctive for absence). Together, these findings reveal that distinct computational mechanisms drive perception and confidence when detecting near-threshold multisensory signals.",

Psychologists have long debated the nature of similarity, considering whether it is continuous and space-like or discrete and feature-like. Here, we argue that the idea that stimuli are similar to the extent that they are likely to have been generated by the same process unifies these spatial and featural accounts as special cases. We formulate this notion of generative similarity in terms of Bayesian inference over hierarchical generative processes and show how it can illuminate key ideas from the literature including the universal law of generalization, feature contrast models, exemplar and prototype theories, and metric violations in semantic organization. Moreover, just as previous work on similarity drew on connections to multi-dimensional scaling and additive clustering, generative similarity provides a new way to construct representations of stimuli by drawing on contrastive learning, a modern machine learning procedure for learning representations by pushing similar stimuli together and dissimilar stimuli apart. We show how this approach can provide a way to translate hierarchical generative processes into spatial representations that support human-like abstraction and generalization, even in complex domains that are parameterized by probabilistic programs.",

          "abstract": "Antisocial Personality traits (ASPT) are characterized by emotional detachment, impulsivity, and disregard for social norms, yet their neural underpinnings remain incompletely understood. The present study employed a multimodal neuroimaging approach to identify structural and functional brain patterns associated with antisocial personality traits in a large healthy sample to test the hypotheses that ASPT are associated with reduced default mode and affective networks functionality and structural integrity. Using joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA), we integrated fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) measures from 205 participants. Three independent components (IC5, IC7, and IC9) jointly predicted antisocial scores on the Personality Styles and Disorders Inventory (PSDI). Specifically, reduced fALFF–GM–WM expression in IC5 (Default Mode Network, DMN) and IC7 (affective network), as well as increased expression in IC9 (sensorimotor–reward network) were associated with higher antisocial traits. A supervised machine learning method known as Transformer-based foundation model pre-trained on millions of synthetic tabular datasets confirmed the generalizability of our findings. Correlation analyses further showed that antisociality was linked to low Agreeableness, low Conscientiousness, and high Trait Anger and Anger-Out, consistent with deficits in empathy, self-control, and emotional regulation. Together, these findings suggest that antisocial tendencies reflect a distributed dysfunction across self-referential, affective, and sensorimotor–reward systems, providing a network-level framework for understanding the neural architecture of ASPT.",

Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

This has been shown in many experiments that used the contingent attentional capture paradigm. Here, we employed this paradigm to investigate the nature of such preparatory target templates during search for conjunctively defined targets. A globally recruited sample of participants searched for targets defined by a single feature (a particular colour, orientation, shape, or size), or by a conjunction of two features from different dimensions. Search displays were preceded by cues with target-matching features, and spatial cueing effects triggered by these cues were measured to test whether a corresponding preparatory search template was active. Contingent attentional capture effects were found for all four dimensions during single-feature search. When targets were defined by a conjunction of colour and either orientation, size, or shape, capture effects were present only for the non-colour dimension, but were consistently absent for colour, suggesting that no preparatory colour templates were activated. In contrast, both shape and size cues triggered reliable and additive contingent capture effects during shape/size conjunction search. These results show that preparatory templates for target features from different dimensions can be activated independently and in parallel during conjunction search, but that colour templates may only be triggered reactively.",

          "abstract": "Serial dependence, a behavioral phenomenon where information from previous trials biases current trial reports, is pervasive in working memory tasks. There is growing interest in its mechanisms, and recent work has shown that individuals with schizophrenia and anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis exhibit reduced serial dependence in simple delayed-response tasks. Modeling and experimental evidence suggest that serial dependence stems from the interplay between persistent neural activity and short-term synaptic plasticity in cortical circuits, with neural reactivations in between trials increasing serial dependence. A computational model that implements this hypothesis showed that a reduction in short-term plasticity, potentially due to NMDAR dysfunction, can replicate the observed reduction of serial dependence in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and schizophrenia, compared with healthy subjects. Yet, its neurophysiological predictions remain untested. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test if these patient groups have reduced neural reactivations, as the model predicts. Our findings confirm the absence of memory reactivations in schizophrenia and anti-NMDAR encephalitis. We show that this result does not depend on motor-related activity. Further, while memory codes are specifically impaired in these patients, the perceptual component of the code is as robust as in healthy participants. Overall, we report empirical evidence supporting a mechanistic model of serial dependence, which links reduced neural reactivations with diminished serial dependence in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "The ideas about the origins and role of motor variability have been revised in recent years after realizing that a strictly peripheral origin is not sufficient to explain many observed aspects of brain function. Among these, time processing is emerging as one of the least studied functions where motor variability might have a critical role. Time processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds includes the phenomenon of sensorimotor synchronization (SMS), where both sensory and motor timing processes play in parallel, likely overlapping in time. The most common and simple task to study SMS is paced finger tapping, where a person taps in synchrony with a periodic sequence of brief stimuli as in keeping pace with music. The main observable is the asynchrony, that is the time difference between every response and the corresponding stimulus along the sequence. Here we report that the variability of asynchronies in a paced finger-tapping experiment (N = 44) is correlated with the variability of the tapping force such that participants with smaller force variability have a better timing precision—but only in the absence of auditory feedback from the taps. We explain our observation by describing a potential mechanism based on empirical and theoretical results that bridges the gap between timing variability and force variability. Our results suggest that the tactile feedback in the presence of auditory feedback is mostly irrelevant in the perceptual determination of the occurrence time of the tap.",

Among treatment-seeking adults with BPD (N = 121, Mage = 28.4; 76% female; 89% White; 57% sexual minority), we examined differential item functioning (DIF) and group differences in symptom severity using self-reported and clinician-administered BPD measures (ZAN-BPD-SR, ZAN-BPD-CR, SCID-5-PD). Although there was no evidence of DIF for any self-reported item, sexual minority participants endorsed self-injurious behaviors (B = .63, p = .01), stress-related paranoia or dissociation (B = .62, p = .01), efforts to avoid abandonment (B = .53, p = .02), and unstable relationships (B = .54, p = .03) more often than heterosexual participants on average, contributing to greater past-week total symptomatology (B = 3.88, p &lt; .01). Clinician-administered items assessing self-injurious behaviors exhibited uniform DIF and were “easier” to endorse for sexual minority participants. Further, assessors rated self-injurious behaviors for sexual minority participants more often over the past week (B = .51, p &lt; .01) and past two years (OR = 3.58, p &lt; .01) than heterosexual participants, and affective instability over the past two years (OR = 4.00, p &lt; .05).

However, research on the comparability of Likert and slider scales remains scarce, especially in the context of ambulatory assessment (i.e., intensive longitudinal data). To address this gap, we conducted a three-week ambulatory assessment study with four measurement occasions per day, in which we experimentally manipulated the response format (Likert vs. slider scales) between groups. Our final sample consisted of 21,730 measurement occasions nested in 406 participants. We tested for measurement invariance across response-format groups and compared their psychometric properties, including reliability, within-person variability, and validity. Results indicated measurement invariance across groups, with equal factor loadings at the within-person level and equal factor loadings, intercepts, and indicator-specific residual variances at the between-person level. In addition, we found no significant differences in reliability or validity and only minor differences in within-person variability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of ambulatory assessment studies and offer recommendations for future research.",

Critically, these differences correlate with statistically prominent and socially relevant features of cultural production, revealing how perceptual systems are tuned to their music-cultural environments. Yet, how can cross-cultural differences in perception be related back to the collective practices that produce the diversity of cultural environments in the first place? To bridge this gap, we propose perceptual niche construction as an evolutionary approach that positions culture as both a source and a product of perceptual plasticity. That is, cultural experience tunes individual perception, yielding culturally diverse perceptual processes. These processes, in turn, create selection pressures shaping cultural production across nested timescales, resulting in diverse cultural environments. This approach presents implications for research in psychology and neuroscience, notably in proposing to operationalize culture as communities of learning and practice. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of contextually situated research, in view of accounting for the dynamic nature of culture-driven perceptual plasticity.",

          "abstract": "How do observers’ facial expressions influence their conscious perception of emotional\nstimuli? Previous work using binocular rivalry has shown that manipulating participants’ facial\nmovements shapes visual awareness of rivalrous facial expressions, but the underlying\nmechanism remains unclear. Does facial muscle configuration selectively enhance perception\nof matching expressions, suggesting sensorimotor simulation, or does it more broadly affect\nemotional stimuli in general, consistent with the facial feedback hypothesis? To investigate\nthis, forty female participants from a Western university population held a chopstick\nhorizontally between their teeth (activating smile-associated muscles) or had their facial\nmovements unrestricted during binocular rivalry between competing images. We tested two\nrivalry conditions: one included face stimuli and the other included two non-facial objects,\nensuring that facial and non-facial stimulus pairs were matched for arousal and valence ratings.\nParticipants rated the smiling face (M=2.3) and flower (M=1.8) as more positive than the\nneutral face (M=0.2) and storage item (M=-0.3) on a -3 to +3 scale. We measured the duration\nof each stimulus’s dominance in visual awareness during 60-second rivalry periods. Notably,\nthe chopstick manipulation increased dominance duration for both facial and non-facial stimuli\nrated as positive—the smiling face (+2.5s, d=0.38) and flower (+2.1s, d=0.35)—while\nneutrally-rated stimuli showed no change. These results provide initial evidence that facial\nmuscle configuration can bias visual awareness for positive content across stimulus classes,\nsupporting the role of facial feedback. Although based on limited stimuli that require\nreplication, the findings suggest that embodied states may influence conscious perception more\nbroadly than previously recognized.",

          "abstract": "Of all the conceptual distinctions that humans can detect in their environment, only a limited set are encoded in grammars, with striking cross-linguistic consistency. Attributes such as numerosity,\nanimacy, and its subdivisions (e.g., sex) recur across languages, structuring grammatical systems in similar ways. This raises the question of whether human cognition is intrinsically biased toward\nlearning these contrasts and using them to organize grammar, or whether their presence can be explained by usage and cue frequency in experience. We address this question using categorization and artificial lexicon learning experiments that contrast animacy with color, a perceptually distinct attribute that is never grammaticalized. In a non-linguistic task (Exp 0), both attributes were spontaneously selected as categorization cues. Novel grammatical systems mapping exclusively onto animacy (Exp 1) or color (Exp 2) were learned equally well. In Exp 3, where cues to the two attributes were equally frequent and ambiguously related to learned words, participants selected either contrast with comparable frequency. Crucially, the two semantic oppositions interacted, with a tendency of color distinction to be encoded more robustly within the animate category. This pattern mirrors cross-linguistic tendencies, where higher-order animacy categories host richer grammatical specifications.\nThese observations reveal an implicit bias in emergent grammatical systems, in which animacy functions as a privileged organizing dimension. We suggest that this bias arises from the salience and\nreal-life frequency of animacy, which provide a reliable foundation for communicative and processing efficiency in grammar and in the broader architecture of language.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization is rising across democratic societies, prompting a growing body of research on interventions to reduce partisan animosity. Although these interventions demonstrate promise, their effectiveness often diminishes outside of controlled experimental settings, leaving open questions regarding their durability, scalability, and real-world impact. In this review, we introduce the SCOPE Barriers Framework, highlighting five key challenges facing affective polarization intervention research: Statistical, Cross-disciplinary, Overgeneralization from WEIRD samples, Practical, and Ethical barriers. We argue that these barriers systematically constrain the translation of promising interventions into meaningful societal change. By synthesizing insights across disciplines and evaluating intervention practices through the SCOPE lens, we identify limitations in measurement, generalizability, implementation, and ethical consideration. We conclude by offering recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and institutions to design, evaluate, and deploy interventions that are robust, context-sensitive, and socially responsible. Attending to the SCOPE barriers is essential for advancing polarization research from proof-of-concept to sustained real-world impact.",

This Comment introduces the agency frame (a-frame), a strategic framework that reconceptualizes behaviour as embedded in, and constitutive of, systems. Rather than focusing narrowly on consumer actions or relying solely on structural interventions, the a-frame highlights how individuals, acting within roles such as citizen, professional, investor, consumer, and role model, can influence institutions, norms, and infrastructure. We propose three priorities for behaviourally informed intervention design: (1) map behaviour by social role and institutional leverage; (2) prioritize high-impact, high-agency behaviours; and (3) map and expand agency by targeting those with the greatest influence and increasing agency for those who are constrained. This approach equips behavioural researchers and policymakers with a practical, equity-informed lens to design more impactful, context-sensitive interventions, clarifying how role-based agency can serve as a bridge between individual action and structural transformation.",

In fast-paced feeds, users often rely on quick cues when deciding what to attend to, believe, and share. One particularly consequential linguistic cue is confidence—widely treated as a signal of knowledge and credibility. Yet, we show that in social media news contexts, confidence is counterintuitively anti-diagnostic: it signals lower-quality information while also predicting greater diffusion. Using computational linguistics and machine learning, we analyze over 20 million posts across eight major online platforms. Posts expressed with greater confidence are more likely to link to lower-quality, more misinformative news domains, even controlling for user baselines, toxicity, and political lean. At the same time, confident posts also receive more engagement. Together, these findings show that confidence—often treated as a cue to knowledge—acts as an anti-diagnostic signal of information quality while simultaneously predicting the diffusion of misinformation.",

          "abstract": "The constructs of emotion, affect, and emotion regulation are widely emphasized as central to psychological health and well-being. Although the conceptualization of emotion is a matter of much debate, two key features pervade affective frameworks despite diversity in theories and disparate usage of terms: (a) the assumption of an innate and universal valence-determining process, and (b) a conceptual approach involving the grouping of multimodal responses into unitary emotion states, often viewed as genetically inherited patterns with situation-specific aims. These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination. I then demonstrate how they can obscure more critical and meaningful targets and foster unwarranted assumptions, potentially contributing to iatrogenic effects and limited treatment efficacy, suboptimal intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning, and concerns pertaining to social control and justice.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "Background: To counter increasing youth mental health problems, it has been suggested to invest in broadly accessible parenting programs. To date, few online parenting programs exist and the majority provide universal rather than personalized advice. This preregistered randomized controlled trial tested a novel digital parenting intervention, composed of self-monitoring of parenting, a data-driven parenting report, and 6 weeks of online parenting tips to stimulate need-supportive parenting.\nMethods: This preregistered study compared post-intervention parenting (proximal outcome) and adolescent affective well-being (distal outcome) of 321 families in a control condition (100 daily diaries), with 225 families in an intervention group who additionally received a feedback report and add-on parenting tips from day 50 onwards. The report and tips were either universal (n = 107) or personalized (n = 110). This trial was registered at the CCMO: NL-009451 on 19-02-2025 [https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/57487]\nResults: Throughout the study, parents became less need-supportive, but adolescents experienced their parents as more need-supportive. Both parents and adolescents observed decreased overparenting over time. Parents in the control group reported becoming less autonomy supportive and warm (pre-post intervention) which was not found in the intervention groups. Adolescents in the universal intervention group perceived an increase in structure over time and an increase in negative affect (mainly irritability). No significant group differences were detected however (p’s &gt; .06). Hence, an additional 6 weeks of parenting tips and a feedback report (our intervention) did not outperform the impact of 100 days of self-monitoring.\nConclusions: Digital self-monitoring of parenting, combined with data-driven feedback and online parenting tips, seems to make parents more critical of their own parenting, but leaves adolescents more satisfied with the need-supportiveness of their parents. Moreover, this online parenting intervention, designed to target need-supportiveness, might counter harmful overparenting practices.",

          "abstract": "Background: Most individuals who could benefit from psychological intervention remain untreated due to limited funding, workforce shortages, and the slow implementation of scalable, evidence-based short-term treatments. Even when effective single-session interventions (SSIs) are available, Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) training remains a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in Artificial Humans and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable AI-powered clinical simulators that offer standardized, repeatable practice with immediate feedback. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel AI-supported \"triadic\" training architecture for mental health professionals learning single-session Interpersonal Psychotherapy Intervention (IPT-SSI).\nMethod: In a single-group pre–post design, MHPs (N=72) completed a two-hour blended training comprising a didactic workshop (90 minutes) and an experiential, supervised text-based AI simulation (30 minutes). Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI. Post-training user experience ratings and open-ended qualitative feedback were also collected. \nResults: MHPs showed significant pre–post gains in IPT-SSI knowledge (baseline M = 1.13, SD = 0.96; post M = 3.37, SD = 0.92; t(71) = 18.38, p &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (baseline M = 2.27, SD = 1.13; post M = 3.49, SD = 0.95; t(71) = 8.90, p &lt; .001). Attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy improved (baseline M = 3.15, SD = 1.27; post M = 3.67, SD = 0.83; t(71) = 4.16, p &lt; .001, d = 0.49). Willingness to accept clients for IPT-SSI increased (baseline M = 3.22, SD = 1.48; post M = 3.60, SD = 1.08; t(71) = 2.40, p = .019, d = 0.28), whereas changes in apprehension did not reach to significance. User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

It is well established that those who are most vulnerable and most in need of mental health support are least likely to access services or take part in research. \n\nAims: Adopting an intersectional lens, this research aims to elicit the experience regarding mental health of young people who feel under represented \n\nMethod; People aged 16 – 24, living in England, who were currently experiencing or had experienced poor mental health in the preceding year were recruited from both NHS waiting lists (in Oxford, Sheffield, Cornwall and Liverpool) and nationally on social media and via charities. 248 people completed an online questionnaire, of which 117 took part in an initial screening call and 81 were interviewed. Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

          "abstract": "Psychology is frequently described as theoretically fragmented, yet the field lacks scalable tools for quantifying whether theories consolidate or remain contested over time. We introduce a discourse-based approach that tracks theory reception by classifying how published articles position themselves relative to a target theory—whether they explicitly support it, oppose it, rely on it tacitly, or engage ambiguously. Using structured literature retrieval and full-text processing, we apply this approach at scale with the aid of a large language model (LLM) used as an annotation support tool, while anchoring all classifications in expert-defined stance categories. As a case study, we analyze 472 articles engaging with memory-decay theory published between 1958 and 2023. LLM-assisted stance classifications show strong agreement with expert judgments using only the article abstracts (Cohen’s κ ≈ .80–.83). Across six decades of publications, stance distributions exhibit no systematic increase in tacit acceptance, no sustained decline in opposition, and no consistent drift toward consensus, suggesting theoretical stagnation. Taken together, this work provides a reusable workflow for tracking theory reception over time using features of scientific discourse. All materials required to reproduce and adapt the pipeline—including code, search strategies, screening criteria, and article-level stance labels—are openly available.",

We found that respondents classified as insincere according to either of these methods displayed substantially higher levels of conspiracy theory endorsement. Respondents who displayed signs of insincerity were also much more likely to endorse contradictory conspiracy theories. Furthermore, we found that the relationships between endorsement of conspiracy theories and well-established predictors (paranoia, belief in a dangerous world, cognitive reflection, and trust, but not anxiety) had significant interactions with insincerity. While some uncertainty remains about the validity of the methods that we used to detect insincerity, our findings suggest that insincere responses may distort empirical findings relating to belief in conspiracy theories.

Through an analysis of 52 semi-structured interviews with Argentine grassroots advocates and U.S. professional ones, this study reveals similar media assessments across cases yet with different intersectional emphases: class in Argentina and race in the U.S. Cross-case divergencies emerge in advocates’ positionality towards institutions and in their representational strategies: While grassroots advocates act as pragmatic agents of change and adopt a flexible communication style described as a “pedagogy of patience,” professional ones act as epistemic experts who offer a feminist critique of journalistic objectivity. I reflect on how these findings attend overlooked factors in CSC.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the GESIS AppKit, an app-based data collection infrastructure and research software. Modern social science research increasingly recognizes the potential of smartphones as both a subject of study and a research tool. The GESIS AppKit addresses critical gaps in mobile research infrastructure by providing an institutionally maintained platform that enables researchers to conduct intensive longitudinal studies such as the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) without requiring programming expertise. The platform facilitates flexible study design through an intuitive web-based interface and delivers questionnaires to participants via a cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android. A validation study during the 2024 European Parliament election campaign with 678 participants demonstrates the platform's effectiveness, achieving participation and compliance rates consistent with previous research. Released as open-source software and hosted as a free service for academic researchers, the GESIS AppKit removes technical barriers to mobile research and supports methodological advancement in social science research.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Despite growing evidence that Not in Employment, Education or Training youth (NEETs) are a heterogeneous population with diverse risks and resources, policy, research and practice have often treated them as a uniform group. Grounded in a life-course and developmental perspective, this study explores the heterogeneity within a group of Portuguese NEETs with three main objectives: (i) to characterise the psychological functioning of NEETs; (ii) to identify distinct psychological profiles; and (iii) to examine how these profiles relate to other variables with well-being and mental health.\nMethod: A sample of 241 NEETs (18-29 years) from the Porto Metropolitan Area completed standardised measures of stress, quality of life, perceived social support, resilience, and behavioural problems. \nResults: A cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Psychologically Adaptive (34.0%), Moderately Vulnerable (46.5%), and Psychosocially Vulnerable (19.5%). These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors. \nConclusion: Findings support the view that NEETs are not a psychologically homogeneous group, highlighting the cumulative effects of disadvantage and the protective role of psychosocial resources. Unpacking this heterogeneity provides new insights for research and strengthens the design of more tailored, developmentally sensitive interventions and policies.",

          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is often characterized as a lack of scientific literacy or as a consequence of anti-scientific thinking. To expand beyond the scope of these individual-level explanations, this article undertakes a more comprehensive examination of hesitancy as a rational response to the confluence of two factors: first the hegemonic ideology of neoliberal health, and second perceptions of diminished institutional reliability. The present study draws on focus groups conducted after the height of the COVD-19 pandemic to investigate the political and economic logics underpinning vaccine refusal. The analysis indicates that participants employ a sophisticated understanding of the health system and political economic beliefs when determining the reliability of individuals and the health decisions to be made. Participants cited the opioid crisis, the revolving door, and perceived disenfranchisement as evidence that public health is undermined by \"elite capture\" and corporate profiteering. It is argued that these perspectives align with prevailing neoliberal ideologies, culminating in the emergence of a \"biological consumer patient.\" This study posits that vaccine hesitancy functions not merely as anti-scientific refusal but as a strategic navigation technique through a healthcare system defined by neoliberal responsibilization and perceived institutional failure.",

          "abstract": "In any product whose evaluation involves taste factors, subjectivity is a determining factor. For this reason, a rating or evaluation system is sometimes proposed to help potential consumers navigate different decision-making alternatives. In recent decades, the wine sector has been characterized by the use of ratings issued by specialized critics. This access channel serves as a means of knowledge for potential customers who have not physically seen the product and who, upon seeing the ratings received by these critics, see them as an influential factor in their final decision-making. Making a decision based on the numerical rating given by a wine reviewer after tasting a wine, where the wine is awarded the maximum score (100 points), can have a positive influence on the consumer's decision. However, not all critics, and consequently their ratings, have the same relevance to the final buyer. This work designed a methodology and proposed a formulation that objectively assesses the real influence of a wine's highest rating by a critic, based on its increased online visibility, search volume, and references in digital media. Several indicators were designed to compare the influence of different critics' scores over a time horizon of one to four weeks after a wine received its highest rating. The study examined whether the highest rating awarded by a specialized wine reviewer has the same impact in all cases or whether it depends on the critic. It also determined the duration of its influence over time.",

Using longitudinal bibliometric data from Scopus covering more than 32 million researchers, this study provides a global assessment of how the pandemic disrupted international researcher mobility between 2020 and 2022. Pandemic-related “lost mobility” is estimated using counterfactual trend extrapolation based on pre-2020 trajectories. International researcher mobility fell short of expected levels by an estimated 14,703 movements (±2,791), corresponding to a 3.7% loss. Although observed mobility rebounded by 2022, it remained below counterfactual trends. Effects varied widely across countries and were asymmetric: losses in incoming mobility were strongly associated with destination-country COVID-19 policy stringency and political regime type, whereas outgoing mobility showed no comparable relationship. These findings underscore the institutionally mediated nature of scientific mobility during global crises.",

          "abstract": "Educational inequalities in childlessness have grown across cohorts. It remains unclear to what extent this development was driven by a decline in resources and abilities in groups with low education. Using high-quality Norwegian population registers (n=683,882 men born 1963-1991), we find that increasing educational inequalities in childlessness are mirrored by growing educational gaps in employment participation and income. Educational groups have diverged on resources (parental income rank) but converged on abilities (relative cognitive ability). Regression models show that changes in the composition of educational groups in terms of parental income explain 6%-7% of the growth in educational gaps in childlessness, employment participation and income. In contrast, gaps in life outcomes would have grown more than observed had educational groups not converged on cognitive abilities. We conclude that relative education-specific changes in financial resources and cognitive abilities explain little, if any, of the growing educational inequalities in the life outcomes studied.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nMedical Data Integration Centers (DIZ) have been established at German university hospitals to collect, transfer, consolidate, and process routine clinical data and make it available for health research. Consideration of sex and gender benefits research and enhances the quality of medical care. We therefore argue that DIZ staff members need to be well-informed and knowledgeable about sex and gender aspects in clinical data. Only then they can inform about research quality gain and advise researchers on thoughtful selection of study cohorts, appropriate encoding of sex and gender information, and the benefits of considering gender distributions.\n\nObjective: \nThis work systematically analyzes the awareness of sex and gender among technical and scientific staff members at DIZ. The  survey will guide  future recommendations for handling sex and gender aspects in clinical research. \n\nMethods: \nUsing an online survey, we assess how  knowledgeable DIZ staff currently are regarding sex, gender and gender scores. The survey  was distributed in February 2024 to all 38 DIZ in Germany via a national mailing list. It was structured into three topics: (1) perception of  sex and gender in medical research, (2) consideration of sex and gender during data collection, and (3) consideration of sex and gender in data use and reuse. We analyzed the collected data with descriptive statistics and checked for correlation within the dataset.\n\nResults: \nAfter a four-week response period, 74 current employees had fully completed the questionnaire and an additional 62 had partially completed it. The survey results show a lack of knowledge and awareness regarding sex and gender aspects among DIZ employees indicated by a high amount of ``No\" and ``I don't know\" answers, specifically regarding sex- and gender-specific training, official recommendations, and team policies.\n\nConclusion: \nAs essential links between clinics and researchers, DIZ employees need targeted training on sex and gender aspects to better support and advise research efforts. We provide first recommendations for the different levels of administration to improve knowledge and awareness of sex and gender aspects in medical research data.",

          "abstract": "Formal early childcare has a strong equalizing potential, yet access remains socioeconomically stratified. This study examines how these socioeconomic inequalities emerge and widen across three stages of the formal early childcare access process: intention to use early childcare during pregnancy, application, and actual access during the child’s first year. Using longitudinal data on approximately 2,000 families in France, collected during pregnancy and followed one year after birth, we document a progressive widening of gaps along the access pathway. Compared with high–socioeconomic status (SES) households, low–SES households are about 18% less likely to intend to use early childcare, 25% less likely to apply, and 46% less likely to obtain access. To identify the determinants of these gaps, we combine machine learning for variable selection with decomposition analyses that quantify the contribution of observable factors at each stage across a wide range of 39 predictors. At the intention stage, most of the SES gap is accounted for by differences in observable characteristics related to resources, constraints, and available alternatives, with norms contributing little. At subsequent stages, inequalities increasingly reflect institutional barriers. The largest disparities emerge at the access stage, where spot allocation-related factors favoring higher-income, working, and earlier-applying households, and knowledge of the childcare system, account for most of the gap. Overall, the results show that socioeconomic stratification in early childcare access is closely linked to the timing and design of access processes, even in systems intended to be universal.",

          "authors": "Aaron Gray",
          "abstract": "Much work in feminist social epistemology shares the basic assumption that ignorance generated by silencing (and related phenomena) is undesirable. While true in many contexts, I depart from that consensus, introducing and offering a philosophical account of a social epistemic practice that I term ‘hushing-up.’ This practice has emerged organically in response and in resistance to sectarian bigotry in Northern Ireland (NI), and contributes to post-conflict transitions away from social and political polarisation and its derivative harms to individuals and collectives. In spaces where hushing-up is deployed, ignorance of peoples’ community background is intentionally cultivated as a strategy in opposition to bigotry, while bigoted or sectarian displays incur social costs. Positioning hushing-up against existing accounts of political ignorance, and contributing to the idea of an epistemology of ignorance, I distinguish between performative partisanship (involving ignorance driven by social rewards for showing group allegiance) and pressured partisanship (involving ignorance driven by the avoidance of social sanctions for displaying indicators of disloyalty to a group). On the account I defend, shifts in social norms are central to addressing some forms of harmful ignorance. I argue that hushing-up succeeds in doing this in two ways: first, by reducing the rationality of pressured partisanship by providing alternative social support to that provided in polarised social spaces such that the cost of dissent is lowered; and secondly, by disincentivising performative partisanship through increasing the difficulty of identifying targets and ensuring that bigoted displays are met with disapproval in spaces where that norm is in force.",

While previous research has focused on organizational- and leadership-level factors that shape EORs, the influence of employees’ peer networks has not received much attention. Drawing from a social influence perspective, this study examines EORs as a product of normative influence within employees’ instrument and friendship networks—those networks composed of coworkers with whom employees share information or advice and those they consider friends. An egocentric online survey was conducted to examine the effects of EOR norms on employees’ EOR perceptions and how such normative influence is moderated by structural network characteristics (i.e., network size, relationship closeness, and network density). We found that employees’ EOR perceptions were highly consistent with the EORs of their instrument and friendship ties across all dimensions. Moreover, network size and relationship closeness were directly and positively associated with certain dimensions of EORs. Relationship closeness also played a moderator role for some dimensions of EOR. Our research findings suggest the importance of organizations creating a positive relationship environment and dynamics among employees.",

The empirical scope covers heat pumps, PV panels, printers, ICT equipment, and batteries. We report baseline material flows and circularity indicators for Europe (2010-2023), highlight differences between the EU27 and non-EU Europe (CH/NO/TR), and quantify a DPP scenario with confidence intervals. For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 14.8% and the DPP scenario implies 45.0% (95% CI: 28.6-61.4), corresponding to potential savings of 2.5 Mt and EUR 27.9 bn (95% CI: 1.1-3.8 Mt; EUR 12.7-43.1 bn).

          "abstract": "This study investigates continuing vocational education and training (CVET) in three institutional contexts: Germany, Sweden, and The United Kingdom. Drawing on the first wave of PIAAC survey data’s unique questions and data availability, we analyse linkages between institutional regimes and socio-economic gradients in CVET participation and barriers to participation including self-reported constraints and lack of intrinsic interest. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that differences in CVET participation reflect educational, labour market, and welfare state institutions. Results show that Sweden’s universal-collectivist regime fosters the highest participation with minimal disparities, while Germany’s corporatist regime shows lower participation and higher stratification. The UK’s liberal-individualist model exhibits moderate participation but sharp socio-economic inequalities, emphasizing financial and employer-related barriers. Resource constraints such as time and money emerge as prominent barriers across institutional contexts. We thus shed light on different skill formation institutions and the differences and similarities in human behaviours and perceptions across them. Our exploratory measurement of interest opens pathways for future research that was not thought possible with existing PIAAC data. These findings contribute to long-term institutional analysis and theory, and inform policy interventions to reduce barriers, increase interest, and support disadvantaged groups.",

We present a scenario-casting exercise illustrating four possible equilibria for the incorporation of LLMs into the publication ecosystem, and we discuss the various levers that academic journals have at their disposal to navigate the changing landscape.

How are local economic realities reflected in political representation amid polarization? Using original data on campaign commitments and legislative activity, we examine whether climate disaster risk and energy-sector composition are associated with greater pro-environmentalism among congressional politicians. We find asymmetric partisan effects. Republicans representing districts with higher baseline vulnerability to climate disasters are more likely to adopt pro-environmental campaign commitments and support pro-environmental legislation in Congress. Democrats from districts with high dependence on carbon-intensive industries for constituent employment are less likely to advocate for pro-environmental policies during campaigns, but they consistently maintain strong pro-environmental legislative records, regardless of district composition. These findings reveal that local economic pressures correspond with some Republicans' support for climate action while Democratic behavior remains largely stable, identifying promising opportunities for cross-party coalition building.",

          "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity \naffecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional \nasymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the \nsexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that \nasymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on \nnever-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated \nmeaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and \nrestricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in \nbroader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital \nselection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the \nshare of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) \nbetween 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category \n(exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. \nThe upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting \nconcentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. \nBecause this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme \nupper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to \nanalyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather \nthan upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes \nevenly into exclusion and concentration.",

          "abstract": "Research on team diversity increasingly adopts multitype and multidimensional designs, yet the measurement of diversity remains methodologically fragmented. Although existing frameworks distinguish theoretically meaningful diversity types, the indices used to operationalize them are expressed on heterogeneous and non-comparable scales. As a result, researchers face persistent difficulties in interpreting coefficients, comparing diversity between attributes or types, and integrating diversity measures into multivariate, longitudinal, or optimization-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a systematic normalization of multitype team diversity indices. Building directly on Dawson’s measurement framework, we derive the theoretical maximum of each diversity index according to its corresponding assumptions regarding diversity type, attribute scale, and team size. Using these maxima, all indices are rescaled to the unit interval [0-1], preserving their substantive meaning while making them directly comparable. This normalization completes an essential but previously implicit step in multitype diversity measurement and provides a unified, interpretable metric that strengthens the methodological foundations of cumulative research on team diversity.",

From a sustainable wellbeing perspective that emphasises intergenerational equity, we examine how wellbeing was reallocated across age groups in 28 OECD countries between 2008 and 2024. \nMethod: We analyse life evaluation (0–10 scale) data from the Gallup World Poll at four anchor years (2008, 2011, 2019, 2024), using country-specific models and two classification approaches (quadratic and confidence-interval-based). We assess cross-national heterogeneity, methodological sensitivity, and sustainable wellbeing implications through age-group reallocation patterns.\nResults: Age-wellbeing profiles varied greatly across countries, with classifications sensitive to functional form, age boundaries, and temporal pooling. We identified five patterns: (1) sustainable (8 countries including Eastern Europe, East Asia, Chile: broad-based gains across all age groups), (2) unsustainable (14 countries across North, Western and Southern Europe, North America, and New Zealand, characterised by early-adulthood decline alongside substantially better outcomes in late adulthood; Spain exemplified the starkest contrast (-1.34 point-change for ages 18-29, and +0.83 for ages 70-79)), (3) no significant age-based reallocation (Turkey, Israel), (4) reverse patterns (United Kingdom, Ireland: late adulthood fared worse than early adulthood), (5) mixed/unique patterns (Australia, Denmark).\nConclusion: Age-wellbeing profile classifications are sensitive to methodological choices, though reallocation patterns provide robust evidence about distributional dynamics. Half the sample showed unsustainable trajectories, raising profound intergenerational equity concerns. Eight countries achieved sustainable, broad-based gains, all starting from low baselines, which suggests that equitable trajectories may be more easily achievable when aggregate wellbeing is improving rather than declining. Addressing unsustainable patterns requires comprehensive policy attention and routine age-disaggregated monitoring.",

          "authors": "Mark Anthony Aryee",
          "abstract": "This paper explores verb-noun collocation in international news coverage of the 2025 Papal Conclave. 20 online news articles were gathered from the media. A total of 438 verb-noun collocations  were identified  using AntConc  version  3.5.9. The collocation  patterns were analysed in terms of their frequency, syntactic structure, and discourse using a qualitative approach. The findings reveal that verb-noun collocations such as elected pope, pope said, and cardinals held were the most frequent. The findings also reveal that pre-election coverage emphasises suspense  and  secrecy  while  post-election  coverage highlights institutional legitimacy, authority and continuity. Three main themes were also identified including “Papal Identity and Authority”, “Church Governance and Hierarchy” and “Ceremonial and Liturgical Roles”. The findings highlight that collocations are not just grammatical but ideological. The study demonstrates the reliability of corpus-based methods in revealing subtle ideologies in religious media discourse.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a new easy-to-use online browser app QuantWealth.eu for calculating prehistoric wealth display and inequality using count data (e.g. objects, construction features, etc.) from graves, hoards, or houses and physical measurement data from house/storage area, burial mound volume/area, or grave pit depth. For grave good/feature counts, the app builds on Nørtoft (2022) to estimate exclusivity (here called “prestige”) values of grave goods/features, or other count (hoard/house artefacts) as input in the app’s inequality measurements such as the Gini and Absolute Gini. For physical measures, inequality calculations are based directly on e.g. measured house floor areas. The results are presented in interactive plots, which can be downloaded. The app also features an interactive time atlas and simple and flexible tools to dynamically visualize trends and developments of wealth display and inequality for any drawn area of the atlas, based on results and data submitted by myself and (optionally) by users. Thus, as more people use the app and add their results, archaeologists collectively build an empirical overview of wealth display and inequality through time from multiple complementary modes of wealth expression with potentially global coverage, which can be dynamically combined and visualised in the QuantWealth’s wealth and inequality trendplot.",

          "abstract": "Exceptional architecture is widely recognized for its seeming impact on the cultural and economic trajectories of cities. However, the specific attractive potential of any given project and thus its impact on the regional economy is often contentious, and identifying measurable increases for outcomes of interest, such as visitor numbers, is empirically challenging. This study investigates the causal effects of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg on local tourism development. Employing the synthetic control method, we create a counterfactual scenario to estimate how Hamburg’s tourism trajectory might have unfolded without the construction of the Elbphilharmonie. Contrasting recent debates highlighting the often underwhelming nature of 'star architecture', our findings indicate that the concert hall has had a major effect on tourism: In the seven and a half years from its opening in January 2017 to the second quarter of 2024, the Elbphilharmonie is estimated to be responsible for 13 million additional overnight stays, despite the period covering the covid pandemic.",

          "authors": "Maria Sironi; elisa tambellini; Bruno Arpino",
          "abstract": "Loneliness poses significant health risks for older adults, comparable to smoking and obesity. While research has examined concurrent factors like partnership status and health conditions, few studies adopt a life course perspective to understand how family histories during adulthood shape loneliness in later life. This study addresses this gap by examining how partnership and parenthood trajectories relate to loneliness among older adults in the UK. Our analyses use prospective cohort data, which allow us to measure variables – including early-life confounders – at multiple phases of the life course, rather than relying on retrospective (and potentially biased) recall. Specifically, using cohort data from the National Child Development Study, we analyze adults born in 1958, employing sequence and cluster analysis to identify typologies of family trajectories, and regression models to assess associations between these trajectories and loneliness outcomes at ages 61-66. Additionally, we explore the role of current social connections in reducing loneliness. By accounting for the interplay of family-life experiences, this research provides novel insights into how the timing and sequencing of family transitions influence emotional well-being in older age, showing that those following less standard trajectories are at higher risk of perceiving loneliness. Current interactions with kins and friends contribute to reduce the negative association between specific family trajectories and loneliness later in life.",

          "abstract": "This paper shows how women’s short-term fertility intentions changed during the unfolding polycrisis between 2020 and 2022 in the Czech Republic and how this change was stratified by education and household income. We describe changes in short-term fertility intentions using predicted probabilities obtained from ordinal logistic regressions of short-term intentions on education level/income quartile over years, while controlling for age, parity, partnership status, and employment status. Data come from the second cycle of the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS-II), wave 1 from the Czech Republic, which was conducted between 2020 and 2022. Short-term fertility intentions declined in most education and income groups between 2020 and 2022. Only among women in the highest income quartile, there is no apparent decline in short-term intentions from 2020 to 2022. Among women with lower education, short-term fertility intentions declined more rapidly than among women with higher education. There apparently is a much stronger demographic resilience among women in the wealthiest households. Resilience among the rich was likely boosted by the tax reform of 2021, which reduced the tax rate of individuals in the highest income quintile by almost 5 % on average, while the tax rate in the lowest quintile dropped only by 2 %. This tax change could have weakened the sensitivity of the richest individuals to the unfolding polycrisis.",

          "abstract": "Rising political violence and affective polarization pose a pressing threat to democratic stability, challenging classic theories of state formation that emphasize the state’s monopoly on legitimate force. Reducing citizen support for violence against politicians is therefore crucial to safeguard democratic institutions. To examine how this can be addressed, we use two pre-registered survey experiments in France and Belgium that manipulate politician characteristics (gender, age, and party) and violence’s severity. We find that extreme violent attitudes remain rare, although support for verbal abuse online is substantial. Importantly, our results reveal that such attitudes are  largely unrelated to affective polarization. We then show that simple interventions (humanizing politicians through perspective-taking or stressing the importance of ideological pluralism for democracy) reduce support for political violence. These findings suggest that protecting institutions requires addressing underlying societal predispositions by promoting empathy and reinforcing norms of political tolerance.",

Second, we test the polygenic prediction of psychiatric diagnoses and psychotropic medication use applying the recently developed phenotype differences model, which estimates direct genetic effects free from environmental confounding and requires genotyping of only one sibling. Third, we assess whether the relationship between polygenic risk and mental illness varies by parental education. \nGroup differences in the PGSs were minimal. In within-family analyses, we found direct genetic effects in 7 of 12 outcome-PGS combinations. Results are contrasted with between-family analyses of unrelated individuals. Evidence that parental education moderates polygenic risk was weak and did not hold up under stringent statistical tests, highlighting challenges detecting gene-environment interactions in mental illness.",

Teachers describe a noticeable shift around 2022, coinciding with the rising visibility and popularity of the manosphere, when some boys’ misogyny became more explicit, emboldened, and unchecked. Building on Moloney and Love’s (2018) work on ‘virtual manhood acts’ (VMAs), we determine five normative manhood acts now visible offline: (1) backlash misogyny; (2) homosocial harassment; (3) humour-as-baiting; (4) sexualisation of women; and (5) disinvestment in schooling. Highlighting the inextricable relationship between online misogyny and gendered power dynamics in physical educational settings, we underscore how certain boys’ increasing disregard for consequences reflects a renewed model of masculinity rooted in backlash politics, manosphere ideologies, and a broader far-right, anti-establishment orientation toward selfhood, community, and society.",

          "abstract": "Students in compulsory education spend a considerable amount of time in the classroom interacting with peers and teachers, from whom they receive feedback and signals about their academic competencies. We develop a theoretical framework that integrates the role of teachers’ evaluations, the labeling effect, the categorical judgements model, the big-fish-in-little-pond, and the rational choice theory for understanding categorical inequalities generated within the school environment induced by classroom peer comparison. We argue that teachers, via attributing marks to students, create Teacher-Induced Student Hierarchy (TISH), and the perception of one’s position in this hierarchy affects\nsubsequent educational outcomes, but heterogeneously depending on students’ ascriptive characteristics. We exploit the idiosyncratic variation generated by differential teachers' grading standards across classrooms to identify the effect of TISH. The relative student's position in the classroom hierarchy, net of her absolute performance level, raises the probability of enrolling in the academic track, the expectation of university enrolment, and levels of academic competencies. We observed that boys and students from lower SES backgrounds, who typically have weaker academic standings, are more responsive to their placement in the TISH. Some of these effects seem to stem from the influence of TISH on some socio-emotional skills.",

          "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is often framed as marginally important to addressing climate change, and as socio-technically difficult and ineffectual. We combine theoretical and empirical analyses to show that adaptation—especially via economic development—is actually often the dominant driver of climate-sensitive societal outcomes, especially on smaller space and time scales. This aligns adaptation with markets and governance incentives. For these reasons, widely studied climate-sensitive outcomes such as crop yields, affluence, and damage and death rates from climate-related hazards have broadly and steadily improved over the past several decades, as have indirectly climate-sensitive outcomes such as mortality from violence and self-harm. These improvements provide important context to recent pessimistic studies of adaptation that focus on outcomes’ marginal sensitivities to climate. They also underscore the importance of economic development to human well-being, and they suggest that economically costly climate policies could harm climate-sensitive outcomes. Moreover, we show that the range of plausible greenhouse gas emissions scenarios has narrowed, providing greater clarity to the temperatures and types of impacts society must adapt to. Our analyses highlight where adaptation and development are currently underappreciated in climate change research and policy.",

The dataset covers 40 countries from their independence to the end of 2019 and provides monthly information on cabinet composition, ministerial appointments, dismissals, rearrangements, and individual ministers’ tenure in office. Offering comprehensive geographical and fine-grained temporal coverage as well as a Wikidata integration that provides extensive minister-level biographical information, the ACP dataset substantially extends existing data resources on cabinet politics. The paper illustrates the analytical value of the dataset through descriptive analyses and two empirical applications. First, it documents long-term trends in cabinet size and cabinet instability, showing a steady expansion of cabinets and volatility in cabinet changes over time. Second, it examines how political regimes affect the tenure of ministers, demonstrating that dominant-party regimes exhibit the most stable cabinets, while personalist dictatorships are characterized by high turnover, with military regimes and democracies displaying similar patterns. A further application revisits the evolution of female representation in African cabinets, showing distinct trajectories for democracies and autocracies that converge over time. Accordingly, the ACP dataset provides gives scholars a new opportunity to test and refine theories of elite management and executive governance in Africa.",

Contributing to levelling this understanding beyond Western liberal media spaces, the paper provides a panoramic snapshot of the state of public service fact-checking in the controlled media spaces of Southeast Asia (SEA): 31 qualitative interviews were conducted with fact-checkers and media professionals after the January 2025 US government turnaround on then existing foreign development programmes and while two major US Big Tech sponsors were reviewing their commitments to fact-checking. What stands out upon characterising the regional fact-checking movement, is the standardly accounted-for magnitude of this—until then—predominantly US-Euro pro-democracy and corporate support. That the regional free press and digital rights activist space has acted as the birthplace of the regional fact-checking movement is however often overshadowed. This misproportion supports the tacit but flawed assumption that fact-checking in SEA is a copy of the US newsroom model of fact-checking. In turn, this assumption, firstly, eclipses the regional movement’s foundational interest in safeguarding collective memory alongside its interest in countering populist politics, secondly, befogs a movement piggybacked by corporate interests, thirdly, fails to account for a fact-checking culture not originally centred around data for building quantitative objective truth.",

          "abstract": "Little causal evidence exists regarding the long-term impacts of natural disasters on crime. Using a balanced panel of county-level crime data spanning 1980–2020, this paper estimates the short- and long-run effects of hurricanes of varying intensities that affected U.S. counties between 1990 and 2010. Findings indicate that while minor hurricanes have little effect on crime, major hurricanes cause significant increases in property crime. In the decade following exposure to major hurricanes, property crime rates rise by 8.5% relative to the baseline mean, imposing an estimated per-capita social cost of $120 on treated counties. These effects are largely driven by evacuation orders and selective out-migration in the short run and by declining per-capita incomes in the long run. Furthermore, hurricane effects are disproportionately larger for counties with less disaster experience and lower incomes, which risk losing 1.4% and 2.2% of per capita GDP, respectively, due to hurricane-induced crime. Overall, the findings underscore the need for greater resource allocation toward vulnerable communities and increased investment in disaster resilience measures to mitigate the economic and social consequences of climate change.",

          "authors": "Punam Mehta",
          "abstract": "This review article explores body mapping as a community-based, participatory method to introduce Feminist-Informed Yoga (FIY) to marginalized mothers with addictions in a mid-sized Canadian city. Drawing on my graduate research and volunteer experience, the article situates “mother” broadly to include anyone who identifies as a mother and defines marginalized mothers as those facing systemic barriers related to race, gender, sexuality, class, and ability. The article contextualizes the intersecting impacts of trauma, colonization, and systemic violence on these mothers and highlights how body mapping functions as a therapeutic and advocacy tool enabling the reclamation of cultural identity and self-care. FIY integrates trauma-informed, feminist principles with Indigenous and South Asian spiritual teachings to support holistic healing and empowerment. The article also discusses the importance of culturally grounded, trauma-informed care, addressing the ongoing challenges marginalized mothers face within health and social systems. Through the blending of body mapping and FIY, this work advocates healing as a political praxis that re-centers marginalized voices and knowledge in pursuit of justice and wellness.",

Drawing on feminist, Indigenous, and arts-based methodologies, I reflect on my doctoral autoethnography as a marginalized mother healing from global displacement and transgenerational trauma. Using practices such as yoga, journaling, text spinning, and meditation, I examine how embodied and relational research methods generate critical insights and foster healing.\nGuided by thinkers like Audre Lorde, Loretta Ross, and Indigenous scholars, I argue that vulnerability is not only lived but methodologically vital. It challenges dominant academic norms, surfaces internalized oppression, and invites accountability and collective care. This work calls for academic spaces that support reflexive, embodied, and relational inquiry. Embracing vulnerability can catalyze transformation within researchers, institutions, and the communities we aim to serve.",

          "authors": "Nicolas Salerno; Olivier Vidal; Baptiste Andrieu",
          "abstract": "Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT) offers a systemic and long-term perspective that moves beyond circumstantial interpretations of political events. Rather than focusing on discrete episodes such as protests, reforms, or crises, it seeks to identify the underlying dynamics that shape how societies evolve over time. This approach enables a deeper understanding of political instability and how certain historical configurations repeatedly produce tensions between populations and institutions. This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations. Our findings suggest that contemporary France faces increasing demographic changes and institutional misadaptation. By aligning with long-term trends in electoral sociology, this analysis offers a reinterpretation of recent events as part of a broader trajectory of strain. It invites renewed attention to the systemic roots of instability and emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptation in periods of rising structural stress.",

          "authors": "Jonas Detemple; Katarina Weßling; Corinna Kleinert",
          "abstract": "Young people’s career aspirations are shaped by persistent gender divides, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which are in high demand and often associated with prestige and high wages. This study examines how the local prevalence of STEM occupations is associated with adolescents’ early aspirations for STEM careers. Drawing on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), linked with district-level information on local labor markets (NUTS-3), we apply logistic regression models to explore gendered patterns of STEM aspirations. Findings show that boys are more likely to aspire to STEM careers in local contexts with a high prevalence of STEM occupations, which is mainly due to increased aspirations for non-academic STEM careers. By contrast, girls’ career aspirations do not significantly vary with local STEM prevalence, even in local contexts with relatively high shares of women employed in STEM. These results suggest that STEM-intensive local labor markets reinforce gendered patterns of STEM aspirations, especially among adolescents oriented towards non-academic career paths. Efforts to promote gender equity in STEM (e.g., school interventions) would benefit from incorporating strategies that address the segregating impact of local labor market structures.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

          "authors": "Hiroshi Honda; Hitoshi Kakidani; Motonori Tomita; Tetsuo Nakano; Hideki Tohda",
          "abstract": "Industrial biotechnology plays a central role in contemporary innovation systems; however, the professional positioning of industrial bioengineers within international engineering qualification frameworks remains insufficiently clarified. This study presents a data-informed institutional analysis of how industrial bioengineering is recognized within professional qualification systems by combining a comparative review of international qualification frameworks with quantitative analysis of membership statistics from Japan’s Professional Engineer system. The review indicates that bioengineering is most often positioned primarily within biomedical engineering, while comprehensive qualification categories encompassing genetic engineering, cell engineering, and industrial bioprocess engineering, such as those institutionalized in Japan, are rarely explicitly articulated at the international level. Moreover, analysis of division-level data across 20 engineering disciplines in Japan further shows that organizational engagement, measured by organization rates, exhibits a negative but statistically non-significant association with division size. This trend suggests that in large divisions where holding the qualification itself provides practical advantages, such as preferential evaluation in public procurement, incentives for active participation in professional organizations may be relatively weaker. In contrast, smaller divisions display greater variability in organization rates and appear more sensitive to qualitative institutional factors. Within this context, the biotechnology division is distinctive, exhibiting both the highest organization rate (59.4%) and the highest female representation (13.4%) among all divisions. These characteristics are consistent with the nature of industrial biotechnology, a field characterized by rapid technological advances and persistent ethical, safety, and regulatory challenges that require continuous human interaction and collective professional governance. Using Japan’s Professional Engineer (Biotechnology and Bioengineering) system as an implemented reference, this study highlights the importance of institutionalizing industrial bioengineering through professional qualification frameworks and encourages economies to consider similar approaches to support sustained professional engagement.",

          "abstract": "Embodied and relational approaches to socio-emotional development increasingly emphasize lived experience, interaction, and situated awareness, yet few frameworks systematically integrate movement-based practices with established psychotherapeutic theory. This theoretical review examines the convergence between Argentine Tango (tango) and Gestalt Therapy (GT), proposing an embodied, relational framework for socio-emotional development and relational awareness. Tango is conceptualized as an improvisational, dyadic practice that operationalizes core GT principles, including contact, field regulation, phenomenological awareness, experiential cycling, and creative adjustment. Drawing on empirical findings from psychology, neuroscience, and movement science, the review synthesizes evidence indicating that tango participation supports emotional regulation, empathy, social bonding, embodied awareness, and motor-cognitive integration. Through this synthesis, tango is positioned as a structured somatic laboratory for experiential GT processes and relational learning, offering a concrete context in which therapeutic mechanisms unfold in vivo. Despite promising outcomes, existing research remains predominantly outcome-focused, and systematic, process-oriented investigation of tango’s specific mechanisms of change is limited. This framework establishes a foundation for future interdisciplinary research and applied exploration of tango-informed GT practice across therapeutic, educational, and movement-based contexts.",

Drawing from necropolitics, carceral geography, and political ecology, I\npropose carceral socio-ecological violence as a framework for analyzing how incarceration\nproduces environmental violence that extends beyond confinement. Prisons contaminate\necosystems, dismantle community knowledge systems, and undermine the social cohesion\nrequired for collective survival. EPA compliance data from 232 facilities across thirteen states\n(2019–2024) reveal sustained and extreme violations: wastewater discharges exceeded federal\ntoxicity thresholds by 2,400%, and radiological contamination persisted for twelve consecutive\nreporting cycles. Over 72% of these violations occurred in communities facing structural\npoverty, racial segregation, and political disenfranchisement—elements of a broader strategy of\nstate-sanctioned abandonment. The essay examines the 2025 rollback of environmental\nprotections, including the closure of environmental justice offices, deletion of compliance and\nviolation records, and mass exemption of industrial polluters from federal law. In response, I\npropose a community-based Environmental Justice Governance Framework rooted in collective\nautonomy, including independent monitoring networks, direct community control over\nenvironmental and public health decisions, and decentralized resource infrastructures. Carceral\nsocio-ecological violence exposes how mass incarceration, environmental degradation, and\nepistemic erasure function as interlocking systems of racial control.

          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",

          "abstract": "This study examined the characteristics of masculinity among Haitian immigrants in Brazil, identifying the challenges and opportunities for the expression of Haitian chivalrousness or kindness in a context of migratory subalternization. It focused on two objectives: to analyze the practice of masculinity of Haitian immigrant men in the Brazilian context, and to understand the role of experience reports in advancing the process of social integration of Haitian immigrants. The present research is a qualitative experience report involving 11 Haitian men living in the cities of Londrina- PR, Cascavel-PR, and Dourados-MS, as well as three immigrant wives. The theory of subaltern realism was used to critically ground the central theme of Subaltern Masculinity. The results reveal the importance of the concept of \"Haitian kindness\" in understanding Haitian masculinity, which is characterized by values such as respect for elders, honor, courtesy, and care for people. However, this kindness is often misinterpreted and contributes to the subordination of Haitian men in Brazil. It revealed the need for actions for social integration and cultural literacy that should be aligned with public policies to combat discrimination, subalternity and stereotypes in the Brazilian context. It is possible to conclude that teaching Haitian culture, mediated by Artificial Intelligence (AI), and implementing cultural training platforms can help to deconstruct prejudiced statements.",

          "abstract": "This paper traces the history of the U.S. behavioral sciences movement: a self-understood vanguard of U.S. social scientists—all the mainline disciplines except economics—forged in shared World War II service, maintained through funder-enabled networks of the early Cold War, and characterized by a mix of nomothetic confidence and aspirational scientism, until the movement’s decline in the mid-1960s. The behavioral sciences, the paper argues, were a social and intellectual formation with a mission—a movement, in other words. They were U.S. sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, and anthropologists, joined by a small number of like-minded economists. Most them had worked alongside one another in the World War II propaganda and morale bureaucracy, and were soon brought back together in the early Cold War by foundations and the military funders. They defined themselves against what they saw as a pre-scientific, speculative, meliorist social science, and—to a significant if lesser extent—against the emerging mainstream of postwar economics. Their aim was to promote an alternative vision for social science, one characterized by scientific rigor, nomothetic theory-building, and a broadly empiricist picture of knowledge accumulation. They aspired to fold mathematics into their methodological toolkits. They embraced the view that team-based interdisciplinary projects centered on applied problems could contribute to theoretical progress. They were a small, tight-knit community of American social scientists, clustered at elite institutions and in relative generational synchrony. Their movement, owing to shifts in patronage, the scale of the U.S. university system, and revelations about clandestine ties to the U.S. national security state, was in sharp decline by the mid-1960s.",

We examine the implementation of this model in a sociology course co-led by a faculty member, a community leader, and a staff member with project management expertise. The course equally emphasized academic learning, relationship building, and community-based work, balancing student outcomes with the community partner’s vision. Findings suggest enhanced student learning, deeper social justice engagement, and tangible community outcomes, although course organization, and continuity remained challenges. Nevertheless, this model offers a more ethical, reciprocal, and impactful framework for community-engaged learning.",

          "abstract": "This report was produced within COST Action CA21150 “Parental Leave Policies and Social Sustainability\n(Sustainability@Leave)”, Working Group 2, and provides a systematic assessment of knowledge gaps in\nEuropean research on parenting leave and social inequalities.\n\nParenting leave policies constitute a key pillar of social sustainability, with demonstrated relevance for\ngender equality, labour market participation, health, and child well-being. While European research on\nparenting leave has expanded significantly over recent decades, the available evidence remains\nfragmented and uneven. Drawing on a narrative review of more than 400 publications from 24 European\ncountries, this report maps which dimensions of inequality have been most extensively studied and\nidentifies where substantial blind spots persist across countries, social groups, and levels of analysis.\nThe review shows that research has focused predominantly on gender, particularly mothers’ employment\ntrajectories and fathers’ take-up of leave. By contrast, other crucial dimensions of inequality, including\nhealth, disability, well-being, citizenship, ethnicity, non-standard employment, and diverse family forms,\nremain marginal in the literature. In addition, most studies implicitly centre on parents in stable, standard\nemployment, resulting in limited evidence on the experiences of precarious workers, the self-employed,\nmigrants, and low-income families. These biases restrict the capacity of current research to evaluate\nwhether parenting leave policies reduce inequalities broadly or primarily benefit already advantaged\ngroups.\n\nThe report makes a central contribution by systematically linking policy design features (eligibility rules,\nbenefit levels, individualisation, flexibility) with policy outcomes (leave take-up and longer-term inequality\neffects) and by highlighting the need for more intersectional, multi-level, and comparative research. It\ndemonstrates that although a gender lens remains central to parental leave policies, future research\nshould adopt a broader perspective to examine how multiple inequalities intersect. Strengthening data\ninfrastructures, improving the measurement of leave use, and integrating qualitative and quantitative\napproaches are essential for advancing policy-relevant evidence.\n\nPolicy recommendations emphasise the importance of inclusive parenting leave designs that\naccommodate diverse employment trajectories, ensure adequate income replacement, and support\nindividual entitlements for both parents. The report also underlines the need for systematic monitoring\nof the EU Work–Life Balance Directive, not only in terms of legal compliance but with regard to its\ndistributional effects across social groups and countries. By identifying where evidence is missing, this\nreport provides a strategic agenda for future research aimed at improving the inequality-reducing\npotential of parenting leave policies in Europe.",

While previous research has used serious games mostly for targeted and relatively small groups, we assess whether serious gaming has the potential to serve as an effective information tool for the broader population. More specifically, we test whether serious games can influence individual opinion formation on complex issues, such as the energy transition, arguing that the immersive nature of a serious game may be more effective than conventional information treatments in triggering learning effects and ultimately influencing opinion formation. Based on our results, we show that playing the game did not, on a general level, produce any significant effects on either efficacy or policy support. However, the game led to varying reactions among players and influenced support for expanding specific energy sources in accordance with the game’s implications. In light of these nuanced results, we discuss implications for researches and stakeholders.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-origin individuals constitute a key group in assimilation theory, but their socioeconomic attainments are curiously under-researched in the quantitative assimilation literature. Drawing on population-wide Norwegian register data, we analyze how children of mixed origin fare in education compared to children of two immigrant parents, using their native majority peers as a reference. When it comes to educational achievements, we find that children of mixed origin are located between a disadvantaged second generation and the native majority. However, once parental SES is accounted for, the second generation exhibits significantly higher achievements, revealing an advantage that is absent among children of mixed origin. When it comes to educational ambitions, the second generation is advantaged in both absolute and relative terms and, once again, we find no such advantage among children of mixed origin. There are essential variations across country backgrounds. Still, the overall pattern suggests that while children of mixed origin ‘catch up’ to natives in terms of educational achievements, they lose their ‘edge’ vis-à-vis the second generation, particularly in terms of ambitions. This conclusion has important implications for theoretical models of how assimilation processes unfold and warrants further research into patterns of assimilation among the growing mixed-origin population.",

          "authors": "Barbara Binder; Sina Chen",
          "abstract": "Data donation studies are increasingly used to enrich survey data with digital behavioral data, but evidence on who participates - and who does not - remains mixed and difficult to generalize. This study explores the potential of enriching an election survey with donated Google Search data during the 2025 German federal election. Using a Bivariate Probit Model with Partial Observability, we model participation as a two-stage process, examining both willingness to participate and actual completion. We further test whether explicitly naming Google in the invitation affects participation.\nIn line with prior work, younger individuals were more likely to opt in and complete the study. Gender differences were limited to willingness, and no systematic variation by education was observed. Naming Google in the invitation affected willingness, but not completion. Notably, we examine participation by party vote, contributing to a better understanding of participation by political leaning. Voters of the Green Party were more willing to participate and together with FDP voters, also more likely to complete the donation, controlling for age, gender, and education. This may indicate a political skew in donated data, as these voter groups tend to be younger, more liberal, and possibly more trusting of science.",

          "abstract": "Robotic surgical systems have advanced from assisted devices to semi-autonomous platforms capable of independent procedural actions. Yet healthcare organizations continue to manage these systems as conventional capital equipment, creating a widening gap between technological capability and administrative readiness. This paper argues that the dominant bottleneck in realizing value from surgical robotics is not clinical capability but managerial unpreparedness. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory, high-reliability organization principles, and dynamic capabilities frameworks, we propose that surgical robotics should be conceptualized as a complex adaptive system requiring coordinated governance across six interdependent domains: strategic oversight, financial management, workforce configuration, operational integration, risk and liability structures, and data governance. We introduce the Robotic Surgical Administrative Readiness (RSAR) framework to guide organizational assessment and strategic planning. Synthesizing recent literature on surgical robotics integration, the paper concludes that failures in robotic surgery will increasingly be managerial failures, and that healthcare technology management must evolve from a support function to a strategic governance role. We outline a research agenda for empirical validation and discuss policy implications for accreditation and capital oversight.",

          "abstract": "Mountain tourism in Nepal has expanded rapidly, particularly in the Annapurna region, raising concerns about environmental pressure and the sustainability of trekking practices. While trekkers’ experience has often been linked to satisfaction and pro-environmental behaviour, empirical evidence from Himalayan contexts remains limited. This study investigates the relationship between trekkers’ experience, satisfaction, and sustainable behaviour, and examines the role of guiding practices within the framework of Nepal’s trekking policies.\nThis study examines the relationship between trekkers’ experience, satisfaction, and sustainable behaviour in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal, using empirical survey data. A quantitative, causal-comparative research design was employed, drawing on primary data collected from trekkers through a structured questionnaire administered in situ. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple regression, and mediation testing. \nFindings indicate that trekking experience is positively associated with both satisfaction and sustainable behaviour. However, satisfaction does not demonstrate a statistically significant mediating effect between experience and sustainable behaviour in this dataset (Sobel test, p = 0.1205). The results also reveal a notable gap between government policy advocating compulsory guiding and actual trekking practices, with majority (64%) of trekkers undertaking treks without guides where a low resource mountain tourism infrastructure is clearly identified for implication of rules.\nThe study contributes to debates on sustainable mountain tourism by highlighting the importance of experience quality and governance mechanisms rather than satisfaction alone in shaping responsible behaviour. Policy implications are discussed in relation to guiding regulation, visitor management, and sustainability in high-altitude destinations.\nKeywords: Trekking experience; Sustainable behaviour; Annapurna",

          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",

          "authors": "Mike McLeod",
          "abstract": "The UK grassroots music venue sector contracted by 16% between 2014 and 2025 (960 to 810 venues), with closures accelerating to 125 venues in 2023 alone. Existing research fragments this crisis across economic analyses, policy inquiries, and single-mechanism explanations (gentrification, licensing, financing), obscuring potential systemic dynamics. This paper explores whether Ostrom’s Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—developed for natural resource commons—can provide integrative analytical capacity for cultural infrastructure challenges. Drawing on longitudinal data from Music Venue Trust annual reports (2014–2025), parliamentary inquiries, and case studies, I operationalize the SES framework’s core subsystems (resource systems, resource units, governance structures, actors) for the music venue context. The analysis suggests two potentially reinforcing feedback mechanisms: (1) a gentrification dynamic where venues create cultural value captured by property owners, leading to displacement; and (2) a touring circuit collapse where venue loss reduces route viability, accelerating further closures. Preliminary threshold estimates suggest regional touring viability may collapse below approximately 700 venues, though substantial uncertainty surrounds these projections. Governance analysis using Ostrom’s design principles reveals critical apparent failures in proportional benefit-sharing (venues subsidize £162 million annually while receiving negligible returns from the £8 billion upper-tier industry) and rights recognition (93% operate as short-term tenants). Scenario modeling—calibrated to available data but subject to significant parameter uncertainty—suggests that financial interventions alone may delay but not reverse decline, while combined financial and structural reforms could potentially shift trajectories toward recovery. This paper makes three contributions: (1) it demonstrates that SES framework application to cultural systems is feasible and generates potentially policy-relevant insights; (2) it identifies significant methodological challenges requiring resolution before claiming validation, including measurement reliability, counterfactual reasoning, and stakeholder perspective integration; and (3) it provides strategic guidance for UK venue policy while acknowledging substantial uncertainty in quantitative projections. The analysis illustrates both the framework’s promise and the methodological development needed for rigorous cultural ecosystem research.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a formal methodological framework for diagnosing and addressing challenges within urban music ecosystems, with a focused application to small venue resilience. Building upon the integrated ecological framework for popular music studies established in Waxing Ecological (McLeod, 2024), this work translates ecological theory into a structured analytical protocol. I adapt and operationalise Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—including its core subsystems, multi-tiered variables, and design principles for commons governance—to model the complex interdependencies characterising urban music ecologies. The methodology integrates insights from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory to account for non-linear dynamics, emergence, and feedback. It provides researchers and policymakers with a replicable, stepwise process for system mapping, variable identification, resilience assessment, and the design of adaptive, polycentric governance strategies. While demonstrated through the critical problem of small venue sustainability, the framework is designed as a flexible diagnostic toolkit for a wide range of problem sets within cultural ecosystems, moving decisively from ecological metaphor to rigorous socio-ecological analysis.\n\nA companion paper (McLeod, 2026) demonstrates the full empirical application of this six-phase protocol to the UK's grassroots music venue ecosystem using Music Venue Trust longitudinal data (2014–2025).",

          "abstract": "The October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks against Israel (10/7) represented the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. However, almost immediately after the attacks, celebrations of the pogrom and protests against Israel broke out in cities around the Western world. The author argues that the upward sweep of antisemitism witnessed since 10/7 cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of radicalization or simplistic stage models. By definition, radicalization is an increase in extremist attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions relative to default societal norms. Thus, the radicalization hypothesis implies that the output of radicalization (in this case, antisemitism) is not normalized. This is unambiguously contradicted by evidence collected from Jewish victims of antisemitism before and after 10/7. Taken together, the evidence indicates that antisemitism has been renormalizing long before 10/7 and it is that process which set the preconditions for its explosive rise witnessed after 10/7. There is a danger in misattributing the current wave of antisemitism to radicalization as such explanations can inadvertently serve to minimize the breadth and severity of the problem.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

This Article introduces an analytical and diagnostic framework that distinguishes primary vulnerability, defined as observable care needs, from vicarious vulnerability, defined as the cumulative exposure borne by caregivers when care is weakly shared or institutionally buffered. Using harmonized cross‑national indicators, we construct transparent indices of primary vulnerability, vicarious vulnerability, and societal capacity to sustain care, and map their alignment across countries. The results reveal systematic mismatches between care needs, caregiver exposure, and institutional capacity, with caregiver burdens more frequently exceeding what existing systems absorb. The contribution is diagnostic rather than causal: by rendering caregiver exposure statistically visible, the framework provides tools for comparative research on productivity, inequality, and institutional design, and for identifying structural vulnerabilities that remain hidden in standard economic and development metrics.",

Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to explore sources and content of menstrual education, normalization of pain and irregularity, and pathways to symptom recognition and diagnosis.\n\nParticipants described learning about menstruation primarily through family and school-based education that prioritized management and concealment over biological understanding. Pain and irregular bleeding were commonly framed as routine, leading many participants to interpret persistent or severe symptoms as normal variation. For those with diagnosed gynecological conditions, this misrecognition delayed care-seeking and contributed to prolonged diagnostic timelines. Limited menstrual health knowledge also shaped early clinical encounters, reinforcing reassurance and dismissal.\n\nThese findings highlight menstrual education as an upstream social process that structures symptom interpretation before individuals enter healthcare settings. Reframing menstrual education to emphasize biological variability and symptom legitimacy may support earlier recognition of abnormal symptoms and reduce diagnostic delay.",

Mirroring real-world debates that pit stricter climate protection against economic prosperity, we assess mutual affect between individuals on either side of this division, and estimate polarization across the full attitudinal spectrum. Across all countries, we find significant affective polarization with a clear asymmetric pattern: pro-climate citizens express clear in-group warmth and out-group coldness, whereas pro-growth citizens show little affective opposition and in some cases even evaluate climate-oriented individuals more positively than their own group. Moreover, affective polarization among pro-climate respondents is not associated with reduced political tolerance. These findings suggest that mass affective polarization over climate action is less entrenched than elite discourse implies.",

          "authors": "Fabio Anobile; Alberto Costantiello; Carlo Drago; Massimo Arnone; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the connection between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and the risk of geopolitics, as defined by the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index. The concept of geopolitical risk is conventionally defined as the direct result of political incidents, war, and international tensions. The current study argues that the concept should be understood in a more structural and sustainable manner, relating to the underlying forces driving geopolitical risk. The main research question is whether and how the three pillars of the ESG factors contribute to the explanation and understanding of cross-country and over-time variations in geopolitical risk. In an effort to avoid the information losses associated with the aggregate nature of the ESG index, the three factors are considered separately and the three pillars are analyzed individually. The empirical context is a balanced cross-country panel data set including 42 countries over the 2000-2023 time period. The data for the three factors is obtained from the World Bank dataset in an effort to standardize and compare the data in a cross-country and cross-time manner. The GPR index is used to measure the level of geopolitical risk and is defined by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello. The GPR index captures the level of geopolitical tensions based on the analysis of media signals. The combination of the three sources allows for the direct connection and correlation between the three factors and the internationally recognized GPR index. The paper uses an integrated methodological approach that combines the results from three different approaches. The first method uses panel data analysis in an effort to identify the average marginal effects while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The second method uses the technique of clustering in an effort to identify structural patterns and divide the countries into groups based on their unique characteristics and risk profiles. The third method uses machine learning regressions and nonparametric analysis in an effort to capture the complex relationships and interactions in the data. The three-step method is used for each pillar in an effort to ensure consistency and comparability. The results suggest that the three factors contribute to the GPR index in a unique manner. The environment and energy structure contribute to the GPR index as a risk multiplier, the social factor is related to the exposure to instability, and the governance factor is a central stabilizing factor. The paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by defining the concept of the three factors and their relationship to the GPR index in a unique and sustainable manner.",

          "abstract": "Comparable questionnaire translation is essential for drawing valid conclusions in cross-cultural survey research. Sound translation methodology, including the use of adequate personnel, is seen as crucial for reaching this goal (Harkness 2003). Recommended methodology should be empirically backed and stay tuned to latest developments, such as machine translation. Against this backdrop, to investigate the potential effect of varied translators’ backgrounds and machine translation on the statistical properties of surveys, we conducted an experiment in which an English questionnaire was translated into German by 16 professional translators and 16 social scientists; translations were subsequently fielded in web surveys. We introduced two translation conditions: translation from scratch and post-editing (machine translation corrected by a human translator). To investigate the quality of the survey data from these 32 translation versions (approx. 250 responses each), we use standardized mean distance and Cohen’s d with the official translation as a benchmark. We have four key findings: First, the resulting statistical means of the survey items vary, sometimes substantially, across translations. Second, post-editing is associated with a reduced gap between the survey data from the experimental questionnaires and the official translation, and it also lowers the variability among different translations. Third, when translating from scratch, social scientists are more likely to produce translations leading to statistical outliers of survey data. Fourth, post-editing can lead to systematic bias for both social scientists and professional translators if translation errors made by the machine are not identified and corrected. This study highlights to what extent decisions concerning the choice of translators and the integration of machine translation can impact the statistical properties of survey data. We offer evidence to implement recommendations for good practices in translation protocols to enhance data comparability in cross-cultural studies.",

          "authors": "Ori Freiman; Cary Nelson",
          "abstract": "This study presents a structured taxonomy of 72 distinct arguments opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, organized into 9 categories and derived through a systematic, Large Language Model-assisted methodology. It distinguishes between substantive arguments, addressing moral and political claims, and institutional arguments, focused on governance, legality, and policy outcomes. Drawing primarily on Canadian academic case studies, the paper analyzes how different types of arguments influence success or failure in campus debates. The taxonomy offers researchers, policymakers, and advocates a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating anti-BDS reasoning in academic and organizational contexts.",

          "authors": "Irene Pañeda-Fernández",
          "abstract": "Whether natural hazards raise redistributive demands remains poorly understood. I argue that the distinction between taking from the rich and giving to the poor is essential to understand the impact of disasters. I expect natural disasters to not spark demands to “soak the rich” because their unfair advantage is less visible than is the case after other economic shocks. I theorize natural hazards raise demands to redistribute to the poor because these events force close experiences with socio-economic others. Combining variation in exposure to Japan’s 2011 devastating earthquake with representative panel data, results are consistent with my propositions. Even though beliefs in the role of luck increased across the board, demands to redistribute from the rich decreased after the disaster and demands for pro-poor redistribution increased in affected areas. These findings set natural hazards apart from other types of economic shocks such as job loss, financial crises, or mass warfare.",

          "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos",
          "abstract": "Prior studies of young adult sexlessness reached conflicting conclusions: GSS-based \nanalyses found rising male sexlessness, while NSFG-based studies found no male-specific trend. \nThis study reconciles these through three innovations: (1) distinguishing virginity (symmetric \nrise) from dry spells among experienced adults (gender-divergent); (2) identifying a 2017-2019 \nNSFG measurement anomaly via stock analysis; and (3) documenting male distributional \npolarization (moderate-middle collapse). Difference-in-differences show GSS sexlessness gap \nwidening 10.6 pp (p = .024) and NSFG dry spells 6.2 pp (p = .014) for 18-24 year-olds post\n2012. Stock measure analysis and digit heaping confirm reporting bias in the anomalous wave (p \n&lt; .001). CPS validation reveals parallel male singlehood acceleration (+0.49 pp/year slope \nchange, p = .003). Age falsification concentrates effects in app-exposed cohorts. Independent \nvalidation from CPS relationship-status data—free of sexual reporting bias—shows a parallel \npost-2012 acceleration in male singlehood.",

          "authors": "Lala Muradova; Katerina Michalaki; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how emotions shape the psychological processes underlying the correction of political misperceptions and how the source of corrective information interacts with these emotional dynamics. Using two scenario-based survey experiments conducted in the US and UK (N=3,610), we examine the effects of corrective information about the anthropogenic causes of climate change when delivered by either experts or citizens’ assemblies. We find that corrective information consistently elicits heightened negative emotions (e.g., anger, frustration, anxiety) and suppresses positive emotions (e.g., happiness, enthusiasm). Importantly, only two discrete emotions—anxiety and empathy—significantly predict greater willingness to revise misperceptions. Contrary to expectations, the source of corrective information does not produce differential emotional or behavioural effects. These findings advance understanding of the emotional mechanisms influencing misperception correction, highlight the nuanced role of specific emotions in shaping corrective behaviour, and contribute to the literature on citizen-centred political institutions and their public influence. Our results have broader implications for research on the emotional foundations of political beliefs and opinion formation in polarized contexts.",

          "abstract": "Default nudges are widely used, yet the mechanisms behind their effectiveness remain unclear. We examine three leading channels: ease, endowment, and endorsement. Our online behavioral experiment confirms the effects of default nudges and indicates that the endowment channel plays a central role. We then use fMRI-based physiological measures to validate that our interventions elicit the intended cognitions. Finally, using randomized assignments of treatments as instruments for cognitions, we identify the causal effects of cognitions on choice using a 2SLS approach. We show that endowment-driven valuation shifts explain default nudges, suggesting that policy designs should leverage this mechanism.",

          "title": "The Yugoslav War and the Dayton Peace Accords",
          "authors": "Axl Kokubun",
          "abstract": "The paper analyses the breakup of Yugoslavia, the escalation of the Bosnian war, and the evolution of international peace diplomacy, in order to clarify the political and military conditions that led to the 1995 Dayton Accords. It argues that Yugoslavia’s collapse stemmed not from a simple state breakup but from the interaction of complex ethnic configurations, deep economic crisis, and nationalist mobilisation by political elites, especially hardline Serbian nationalism which shattered federal cohesion and made Bosnia and Herzegovina’s multiethnic landscape a focal point of violent contestation and international concern. Comparing Slovenia and Croatia, where ethnic homogeneity, limited territorial objectives, and early international recognition facilitated relatively short conflicts, with Bosnia, where highly mixed populations and overlapping territorial claims produced protracted, all‑out war, the paper shows why Bosnia required full‑scale external intervention. Humanitarian and strategic crises such as the Sarajevo siege, the Srebrenica massacre, and mass displacement exposed the powerlessness of traditional UN peacekeeping and the ineffectiveness of diplomacy without credible force. The study then traces how fragmented and militarily unsupported early initiatives by the UN, EU, and the United States gradually gave way, under the pressure of changing battlefield dynamics, sanctions, domestic politics in Western states, and U.S. congressional pressure to a more unified Western strategy that combined military pressure with coercive diplomacy. It highlights the decisive role of active U.S. engagement, which shifted from conflict management to conflict resolution and leveraged the interests of Milošević, Tuđman, and Izetbegović to push negotiations forward. Overall, the thesis concludes that the Bosnian conflict was structurally produced by intertwined domestic and international factors, and that an effective peace settlement became possible only when military and diplomatic instruments were aligned under a strategy capable of exerting clear coercive leverage, offering broader lessons about the possibilities and limits of international intervention in civil wars.",

          "title": "Political Campaigners Under Attack: How Do Citizens Respond to Political Violence?",
          "authors": "Joep van Lit; Rozemarijn E. van Dijk",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the underexplored impact of violence against politicians on citizens’ acceptance of violence and their willingness to engage in politics. By focusing on citizens, it addresses a critical gap in research, which has largely emphasized how violence affects politicians rather than the public. While existing studies demonstrate that political violence influences politicians’ behavior and discourse, impacting representative elements of democracy, there is limited insight into how such incidents shape citizens’ engagement after learning about violence. Although citizens generally condemn violence against politicians in the abstract, it remains unclear whether their own political engagement is impacted and varies based on the target of the incident. We theorize that the impact of violence against political figures on political engagement varies by (1) partisanship; (2) political role (elite or activist) and (3) the gender of the victim. Additionally, we examine the potential mediating roles of fear and anger on political participation. Based on a survey experiment in both Belgium and the Netherlands (n = 3.139) we find no demobilizing effect of learning about political violence. In fact, we find a small mobilizing effect when the target belongs to the political in-group of the party. This mobilizing effect is likely to be mediated by anger.",
