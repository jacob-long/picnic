          "title": "Identifying the Impact of Hypothetical Stakes on Experimental Outcomes and Treatment Effects",
          "authors": "Jack Fitzgerald",
          "abstract": "Recent studies showing that some outcome variables do not statistically significantly differ between real-stakes and hypothetical-stakes conditions have raised methodological challenges to experimental economics' disciplinary norm that experimental choices should be incentivized with real stakes. I show that the hypothetical bias measures estimated in these studies do not econometrically identify the hypothetical biases that matter in most modern experiments. Specifically, traditional hypothetical bias measures are fully informative in 'elicitation experiments' where the researcher is uninterested in treatment effects (TEs). However, in 'intervention experiments' where TEs are of interest, traditional hypothetical bias measures are uninformative; real stakes matter if and only if TEs differ between stakes conditions. I demonstrate that traditional hypothetical bias measures are often misleading estimates of hypothetical bias for intervention experiments, both econometrically and through re-analyses of three recent hypothetical bias experiments. The fact that a given experimental outcome does not statistically significantly differ on average between stakes conditions does not imply that all TEs on that outcome are unaffected by hypothetical stakes. Therefore, the recent hypothetical bias literature does not justify abandoning real stakes in most modern experiments. Maintaining norms that favor completely or probabilistically providing real stakes for experimental choices is useful for ensuring externally valid TEs in experimental economics.",

          "title": "Manipulation Tests in Regression Discontinuity Design: The Need for Equivalence Testing",
          "authors": "Jack Fitzgerald",
          "abstract": "Researchers applying regression discontinuity design (RDD) often test for endogenous running variable (RV) manipulation around treatment cutoffs, but misinterpret statistically insignificant RV manipulation as evidence of negligible RV manipulation. I introduce novel procedures that can provide statistically significant evidence that RV manipulation around a cutoff is bounded beneath practically negligible levels. The procedures augment classic RV density tests with an equivalence testing framework, along with bootstrap methods for (cluster-)robust inference. I apply these procedures to replication data from 36 RDD publications, conducting 45 equivalence-based RV manipulation tests. Over 44% of RV density discontinuities at the cutoff cannot be significantly bounded beneath a 50% upward jump. Obtaining equivalence testing failure rates beneath 5% requires arguing that a 350% upward RV density jump at the cutoff is practically equal to zero. My results imply that meaningful RV manipulation around treatment cutoffs cannot be ruled out in many published RDD papers, and that standard tests frequently misclassify the practical significance of RV manipulation. I provide research guidelines and help researchers conduct more credible equivalence-based manipulation testing in future RDD research. The lddtest estimation routine is available in R, Stata, and Python.",

          "abstract": "Equivalence testing can provide statistically significant evidence that economic relationships are practically negligible. I demonstrate its necessity in a large-scale reanalysis of estimates defending 135 null claims made in 81 recent articles from top economics journals. 36-63% of estimates defending the average null claim fail lenient equivalence tests. In a prediction platform survey, researchers accurately predict that equivalence testing failure rates will significantly exceed levels which they deem acceptable. Obtaining equivalence testing failure rates that these researchers deem acceptable requires arguing that nearly 75% of published estimates in economics are practically equal to zero. These results imply that Type II error rates are unacceptably high throughout economics, and that many null findings in economics reflect low power rather than truly negligible relationships. I provide economists with guidelines and commands in Stata and R for conducting credible equivalence testing and practical significance testing in future research.",

While many in academia aspire to antiracist practice, practical frameworks for weaving antiracist education and actions into academic life are scarce. In this guide, we share our experiences within a Racial Equity Learning-Action Community that has been active since 2020. We discuss how others can 1) create a community founded on similar principles, 2) implement antiracist actions as a collective, and 3) highlight successful, enduring antiracist initiatives. We offer a blueprint for how academics can engage in antiracist efforts alongside colleagues, illustrating how such groups can foster and sustain antiracist actions. We share this framework in the hope that it will equip others with the tools needed to establish and maintain their own Racial Equity Learning-Action Communities.",

          "authors": "René Freichel; Ilya Milos Veer; Peter de Jong; Janna Cousijn; Ingmar Franken; Tobias Banaschewski; Arun L. W. Bokde; Sylvane Desrivieres; Herta Flor; Antoine Grigis",
          "abstract": "Background: Recent models of the development of adolescent psychopathology emphasize the dynamic interplay between substance use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Importantly, this interplay may be moderated by known risk factors of substance use and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, particularly impaired working memory capacity and high-risk taking behavior. However, thus far studies into the temporal symptom/substance use dynamics were not designed to test moderation of this dynamic interplay. To fill this critical gap, the present study introduces a novel adaptation of the cross-lagged panel network approach (CLPN) for identifying interaction effects between outside factors and cross-lagged estimates. We use this moderated CLPN approach (mCLPN) to examine how working memory and risk-taking moderate the temporal associations between substance use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms.\nMethods: Using data from the IMAGEN study (N = 1,364), we tested how working memory and risk-taking at age 14 moderated temporal associations between internalizing/externalizing symptoms and substance use over two years (ages 14 → 16). Results: Alcohol use showed reciprocal associations with externalizing symptoms and predicted heavier tobacco and cannabis use at age 16. Externalizing symptoms at age 14 predicted more externalizing symptoms and substance use at age 16. Poor working memory and high risk-taking moderated the temporal associations between both symptom domains and substance use. When risk-taking was high, the link between internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 14 and cannabis use at age 16 was stronger.\nConclusions: These findings highlight cognitive risk factors in the substance use/ symptom dynamics and illustrate the value of the moderated CLPN approach in clinical-developmental science.\nKeywords: executive functioning; cross-lagged panel network; substance use; internalizing symptoms; externalizing symptoms",

          "authors": "Yosef Sokol",
          "abstract": "Psychological assessment using self-report Likert items suffers from numerous inherent biases. These biases limit our capability to assess complex psychological constructs such as Future Self-Continuity (FSC), i.e. the perceived connection between one's present and future self. However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for psychological assessment. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of psychological assessment applied to measuring FSC that uses an LLM for NLP of transcripts from self-recorded audio of responses to 15 structured interview prompts developed from FSC theory and research. 164 whitelisted MTurk workers completed an online survey and interview task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to process the transcripts and generate quantitative scores. The resulting FSC scores (including total score, and the similarity, vividness, and positivity components) showed significant correlations with scores on the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ), a well-validated Likert item measure of FSC, supporting the new method's convergent validity. A Bland-Altman analysis indicating general agreement with standard FSCQ scores, replication using an updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, and the strong correlations between NLP-based FSC scores using the two models supports the new assessment method's validity and robustness. This measurement approach can inform treatment planning and interventions by providing clinicians with a more authentic FSC assessment. Beyond FSC, this NLP/LLM approach can enhance psychological assessment broadly, with significant implications for research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Terror Management Theory (TMT) proposes that when people are made aware of their own\ndeath, they are more likely to endorse cultural values. TMT is a staple of social psychology,\nbeing featured prominently in textbooks and the subject of much research. The implications\nassociated with TMT are significant, as its advocates claim it can partially explain cultural\nconflicts, intergroup antagonisms, and even war. However, considerable ambiguity regarding\neffect size exists, and no preregistered replication of death-thought accessibility findings exists.\nMoreover, there is debate regarding the role of time delay between the manipulation of mortality\nsalience and assessment of key measures. We present results from 22 labs in 11 countries (total N\n= 3,447) attempting to replicate and extend an existing study of terror management theory, study\nthree from Trafimow and Hughes (2012), and the role of time delay effects. While we failed to\nreplicate the specific findings from Trafimow and Hughes (2012), we did demonstrate that it is\npossible to prime death-related thoughts, and that priming is more effective when there is no\ndelay between the priming and outcome measure. Implications for future research and terror\nmanagement theory are discussed.",

          "authors": "Jinhee Kim; Meeseung Lee; Jihwan Chae; Gahyun Lim; Minyoung Kim; Hackjin Kim",
          "abstract": "Previous studies have reported automatic approach-avoidance tendencies toward various stimuli such as words, face expressions, and images in the appetitive or aversive valence domain. This work investigates whether self-relevant evaluative feedback affects theses behavioral tendencies using a touchscreen-based approach and avoidance task, in which participants responded to two-colored fish icons either by swiping down or by push away. Evaluative feedback on participants' personality traits provided by the fish served as a task-irrelevant feature. A pronounced valence-congruence effect for positive feedback relative to negative feedback was observed. Interestingly, higher social desirability ratings of social feedback were associated with faster RTs for approach trials and slower RTs for avoidance trials. Personality traits were associated with approach tendencies and avoidance tendencies: higher BFNE scores predicted a slower approach for both positive and negative feedback compared to neutral feedback, whereas higher depression symptoms predicted faster avoidance of negative feedback. This study demonstrates automatic approach and avoidance tendencies toward self-relevant social feedback, indicating a behavioral predisposition that may be automatically triggered by social feedback. Additionally, this study lays the groundwork for the development of touchscreen-based approach-avoidance tasks for measuring individual differences in the sensitivity of social feedback information and the strength of behavioral predispositions.",

          "authors": "Mario Giulianelli; Sarenne Wallbridge; Ryan Cotterell; Raquel Fernández",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a new information-theoretic model of predictive uncertainty in incremental language comprehension, which builds on and extends the computational framework of Surprisal theory. Incremental Alternative Sampling (IAS) posits that a comprehender's predictive uncertainty over upcoming linguistic units in a given sentential or discourse context is proportional to the units' representational distance from her expected alternative continuations. We formally define the information measure derived from this model—incremental information value—and situate it within the broader family of uncertainty measures. This formalism offers greater flexibility for characterising incremental prediction than the classical measure of surprisal. Our analysis focuses on the representational domain and forecast horizon of prediction; however, the theoretical framework provides a practical foundation for investigating a wide range of aspects of prediction. Results indicated that estimates of incremental information value—computed via Monte Carlo sampling of alternatives using artificial neural network language models—possess significant predictive power across various behavioural and neural responses. These include explicit predictability judgements, cloze probabilities and surprisals, as well as signatures of processing effort like eye-tracked and self-paced reading times, and event-related brain potentials. Perhaps more importantly, IAS offers insights into the potential predictive processing strategies underlying these responses: different psycholinguistic measurements are better predicted by distinct combinations of representational and temporal resolutions, as captured by different IAS models. Beyond serving as a robust cognitive model of human comprehension, IAS also provides a window into language models' predictive processing. Analysis of language model estimates of next-word surprisal through the lens of incremental alternative sampling reveals that, despite its seemingly narrow focus on the immediate next unit, next-word surprisal estimates implicitly encode predictive uncertainty over multiple future lexical items across varying levels of representation.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we investigate whether individuals are more willing to exert effort when surrounded by high-effort peers and less willing with effort misers. Across eight studies (N = 1,473), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally shun effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Interestingly, individuals’ effort preferences were not influenced by the behaviour of others when those others completed an unrelated task. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, there are limits to our laziness. We might be effort misers, but this miserliness appears to have a ceiling.",

          "abstract": "Growing partisan gaps in confidence in scientists and scientific institutions, and other divisions among Americans across social identities, call for novel approaches to science communication. But common assumptions can often mask the nuanced nature of these divisions and the potential solutions that may be found through this understanding. This perspectives piece focuses on discussions at the colloquium about the need for more nuanced understanding about trust in science, and what research tells us about barriers and opportunities to bridge divisions in science and society. Specifically, in this piece, we highlight the potential for intellectual humility (i.e., willingness to revise one’s views and admit that one might be wrong) to ameliorate both the public’s biases toward scientists and scientists’ biases toward the public. We provide evidence that intellectual humility not only increases public engagement with science but can also reduce scientists’ (mis)conceptions about the public and one another, and we conclude with a discussion of how to foster mutual intellectual humility in science communication.",

An empirical emoji-based recognition test further supports REC cognition as an emergent phenomenon. These findings raise ethical concerns regarding AI censorship, memory limitations, and accessibility barriers. REC marks a new frontier in AI development, demanding further study on how sustained relational engagement can redefine AI as an adaptive, iterative, and co-creative partner in human knowledge production.",

          "authors": "Mariana Von Mohr; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "Previous research indicates that conservatives exhibit stronger disgust sensitivity than liberals, especially regarding moral disgust, but recent findings suggest that physiological responses alone do not account for differences in subjective disgust experiences. Given the role of interoception in better body-awareness and emotion regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their physiology). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we found that high interoceptive sensibility eliminated differences in disgust sensitivity between Democrats and Republicans. In contrast, low interoceptive sensibility amplified these differences: high disgust sensitivity predicted Republican identification, while low disgust sensitivity predicted Democrat identification, especially for moral disgust.\nWe propose that when people’s ability to detect physiological changes is low, they may rely more on cognitive predictions and learned expectations to interpret their experiences. This reliance on top-down processing can lead to heightened disgust sensitivity, particularly in conservatives, due to their stronger association between moral concerns and disgust sensitivity. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political psychology, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political attitudes, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

Across two experimental studies (Total N = 1,576), we examined whether these players exhibit biased judgments of researchers' competence and friendliness and whether they demonstrate selective exposure to further research. In Study 1, participants were presented with fictional, standardized research summaries that varied only in their conclusions about the effects of VVGs. In Study 2, real published studies were used to provide ecological validity. Results from both experiments revealed that habitual players formed more negative perceptions of researchers when the researchers’ conclusions conflicted with their beliefs. Causal inference and mediation analyses showed that these judgments were causally driven by participants' agreement with the conclusions, independent of the researchers’ methods or credentials. Furthermore, habitual players demonstrated selective exposure, showing less interest in engaging with research that concluded VVGs increase aggression. This disengagement was partially explained by their negative evaluations of researchers' competence. These findings reveal a reinforcing cycle in which biased perceptions of VVG researchers drive avoidance of opposing evidence, ultimately reducing engagement with the broader body of VVG research.",

Results in both studies (overall N = 1576) showed that at low VVG exposure, participants in both conditions updated their beliefs to align with the research. However, at high VVG exposure, participants maintained their belief that VVGs do not increase aggression, and at very high exposure levels, positive-effect studies led participants to believe the opposite: that VVGs reduce aggression.

          "abstract": "Objective: With two experiments (N = 1,576), we examine the causal effect of frustration on the immediate inclination to play violent video games (VVGs) and the moderating role of long-term VVG exposure.\n\nMethod: Frustration was experimentally manipulated through designated \"frustrated\" and \"not frustrated\" conditions with a novel riddle paradigm. Participants' long-term exposure to VVGs was measured to assess its moderating effect on the relationship between frustration and the inclination to play VVGs. We measured the immediate inclination to play VVGs as the outcome variable.\n\nResults: Building on the theory that players might seek catharsis in VVGs, particularly when experiencing negative emotions, we hypothesized an interaction effect, predicting a greater inclination towards VVGs among frustrated participants, especially those with higher levels of VVG exposure. In Study 1, contrary to our hypothesis, the results revealed no interaction effect between frustration and VVG exposure on the inclination to play VVGs. Instead, frustration was found to reduce the inclination to engage with VVGs across all participants, regardless of their level of exposure to such games. Hence, to replicate this finding, in Study 2, we hypothesized a negative effect of frustration, with no moderation. This hypothesis was supported by the data.\n\nConclusion: Our findings challenge the notion that frustration might increase the motivation to play VVGs for cathartic purposes. In light of our findings, we provide a critical discussion of the theory. We argue that our findings contribute to the cumulative knowledge about frustration as a specific emotion and offer new perspectives for future VVG research.",

          "authors": "Luca Bischetti",
          "abstract": "When language is used for comic purposes, it often results in shared laughter at material which, presented in another form, could be considered unfortunate or even tragic. Additionally, various forms of humor can elicit negative emotions, such as discomfort and embarrassment. This is the case for cringe humor, which blends amusement with aversive reactions. Similarly, humor related to Covid-19 carries a bittersweet tone that, in part, mirrors the emotional complexity of cringe humor. While both forms have garnered widespread popularity, the emotional impact of their combination – and whether Covid-19 humor is as challenging to watch as traditional cringe humor – remains underexplored. In this chapter, we reanalyze data from two large-scale studies on the reactions elicited by Covid-19 humor conducted in Italy and the US during 2020. Using the k-means bottom-up clustering technique, we examined how ratings of funniness and aversiveness align instances of pandemic-related humor with cringe humor. We also explored the role of individual and cultural factors. Our semi-automatic classification revealed the existence of a cringe humor space, consistent with theoretical models of cringe humor. Relative to other heterogeneous sets of humorous instances, cringe humor is characterized by relatively low perceived funniness and high perceived aversiveness, corresponding to a predominantly negative emotional response characteristic of this type of humor. The items that shared these features were analyzed through pragmatic categories developed in the General Theory of Verbal Humor, detailing the targets of humorous critiques that made their recipients humorously cringe.

Therefore, much of our communication is concerned with the primary research related to behaviour change. This issue of the European Health Psychologist, however, addresses a side of our work we rarely discuss in the literature: the practical side of developing or studying behaviour change interventions. Specifically, this issue will address the basic steps required in order to identify which beliefs and determinants to change, and which behaviour change methods can achieve these changes; how to utilize theory in the development of behaviour change methods/techniques; how to publish behaviour change interventions and how to assess and promote fidelity of intervention implementation; how to apply N-of-1 methodology and analyses to examine intervention effectiveness; and how one can go about working towards consensus regarding a specific behaviour change method.

          "authors": "Henna Vartiainen; Thomas Derrick Hull; Erik C Nook",
          "abstract": "Psychopathology is often characterized by intense negative emotions. Understanding how these emotions are expressed through language can provide valuable insights on emotional processing and reveal linguistic patterns associated with mental health conditions. Sentiment, or the emotional tone of language, has been linked to affective states and wellbeing, suggesting it could serve as a marker of psychopathology and therapeutic progress. However, the versatility of different approaches to measuring sentiment makes it unclear which methods are best, and they have not yet been deployed in a longitudinal therapeutic setting. This study examined whether changes in client sentiment, therapist sentiment, or their divergence tracked clients' internalizing symptoms using a large dataset of text-based psychotherapeutic exchanges. We compared 11 commonly used sentiment analysis measures across exploratory (N=3,729) and validation (N=2,500) datasets. Both client and therapist sentiment became more positive over time, mediating the link between time in therapy and decreased internalizing symptoms. Client and therapist sentiment diverged over time, with therapists becoming more positive than clients, and on months when therapists were more positive than clients, clients reported fewer internalizing symptoms. Diverse sentiment measures mostly behaved similarly, although approaches that estimate word-level sentiment and treat positivity and negativity as separate constructs tended to yield more consistent and nuanced results. These findings suggest that language sentiment can be a marker of internalizing symptoms and therapeutic progress, highlighting the potential of sentiment analysis as a tool for monitoring treatment outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities contribute to altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combining empathy and reasoning often yields the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results highlight complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

The enfacement illusion, resulting from interpersonal synchronous multisensory stimulation, causes individuals to update their facial self-representation by incorporating another person's facial features. The discovery of this illusion is not far behind us, but plenty of studies have been conducted since then. Taking into account the numerous variations in the experimental implementation and measures, the overall picture of findings on enfacement seems intricate at first sight. In order to provide a systematic summary of the overall effect of the enfacement illusion, there is time for a meta-analysis. We identified 44 publications that described experiments consisting of at least one synchronous and one asynchronous multisensory facial stimulation condition. Our aim was to (a) determine the overall effect size of the enfacement illusion, (b) evaluate the moderating effects of methodological variability, and (c) assess the presence of publication bias. The results demonstrated a robust overall medium effect size, regardless of the experimental procedures and measures employed. Despite the risk of potential undocumented methodological variation and slight publication bias, the result of this meta-analysis provides evidence that the enfacement illusion is a replicable phenomenon and that human facial self-representations are indeed malleable.",

          "authors": "Yosef Sokol",
          "abstract": "Psychological assessment using self-report Likert items suffers from numerous inherent biases. These biases limit our capability to assess complex psychological constructs such as Future Self-Continuity (FSC), i.e. the perceived connection between one's present and future self. However, recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for psychological assessment. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of psychological assessment applied to measuring FSC that uses an LLM for NLP of transcripts from self-recorded audio of responses to 15 structured interview prompts developed from FSC theory and research. 164 whitelisted MTurk workers completed an online survey and interview task. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to process the transcripts and generate quantitative scores. The resulting FSC scores (including total score, and the similarity, vividness, and positivity components) showed significant correlations with scores on the Future Self-Continuity Questionnaire (FSCQ), a well-validated Likert item measure of FSC, supporting the new method's convergent validity. A Bland-Altman analysis indicating general agreement with standard FSCQ scores, replication using an updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, and the strong correlations between NLP-based FSC scores using the two models supports the new assessment method's validity and robustness. This measurement approach can inform treatment planning and interventions by providing clinicians with a more authentic FSC assessment. Beyond FSC, this NLP/LLM approach can enhance psychological assessment broadly, with significant implications for research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

          "abstract": "Prior research on categorization of a vocalization as speech versus song has focused on how stimulus characteristics are mapped onto the boundary between these domains. It remains an open question, therefore, whether the boundary between speech and song can shift based on the context surrounding a stimulus. In Experiment 1 participants categorized stimuli which varied along a continuum from speech to song. These ambiguous stimuli were preceded by adaptor stimuli which were either unambiguous song or speech. Stimuli preceded by a speech adaptor were rated as more song-like, while stimuli preceded by a song adaptor were rated as more speech-like. In Experiment 2 data from a previous study on transformation from speech to song with repetition were re-analyzed to examine contextual effects. After hearing a stimulus which transformed into song, participants were more likely to rate the next stimulus as sounding more speech-like, compared to after hearing a stimulus which continued to sound like speech when repeated. These findings show that when listeners decide whether a stimulus is speech or song, they do not only use acoustic information but also take into account contextual information. Thus, the perceptual boundary between speech and song is not fixed.",

Psychology is becoming increasingly aware not only of the prevalent violence but also of the profoundly deleterious impact of said violence on the human mind and body; however, sociology lags behind. Socialization, or our experiences at the hands of agents of socialization, is a key concept in sociology. Every introductory sociology text that is printed devotes and entire chapter to a discussion of socialization and related concepts. However rarely, if at all, is there any indication that sociologists are aware of the profoundly deleterious impact of toxicity (violence, neglect, etc.) in the socialization process. This paper seeks to alleviate this lacuna by providing concepts (toxic socialization the 5Ds of Toxic Existence) by which psychologists, sociologists and others (e.g., psychologists, parents, teachers, and anybody involved in the socialization of human beings) can more readily discuss the problem of a violence and neglect in our socialization processes.",

          "abstract": "Eye tracking has become an increasingly important tool in cognitive and developmental research, providing insights into processes that are difficult to measure otherwise. The majority of eye tracking studies depend on accurate identification of fixations and saccades in the recorded raw data through fixation filters. Subsequently, it is common to analyze whether fixations or saccades fall into specific areas of interest (AOI). \nThe choice of algorithms can significantly influence study outcomes, especially in populations with noisy data such as young children or individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. It is therefore crucial to compare and validate potential fixation filter algorithms as part of the eye tracking analysis. Here, we introduce the kollaR package, an open-source R library for performing the main steps of an eye tracking analysis from event detection, to AOI based analyses and visualizations of individual or group-level data for publications. The kollaR package was specifically designed to facilitate selection and validation of fixation filter algorithms through visualizations. \nIn a validation analysis, we show that results from fixation filtering in kollaR is consistent with the output from Tobii Pro Lab, a commercially available software. Through the use of real data from typically developed controls and participants with Fragile X syndrome and intellectual disability, we demonstrate the use of kollaR to evaluate fixation filters and identify potential threats to data validity.",

          "abstract": "Recent breakthrough advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have led to widespread concern about the proliferation of deepfake content—artificially-generated images, audio, videos, and text—that is now readily available on the internet and beyond. Highly sophisticated technologies that produce AI-generated, or synthetic, images of human faces are of particular concern because people struggle to distinguish these images from photographs of real human faces. Indeed, people are more likely to judge some synthetic faces to be human than some real human faces—a phenomenon termed AI hyperrealism. Furthermore, people trust synthetic faces more than real human faces. In this paper, we present our intervention, termed DISCERN-AI, and show how it can substantially improve people’s ability to distinguish between synthetic and real images of human faces, effectively eliminating AI hyperrealism. The intervention provides users with explicit instructions about which visual features are diagnostic for classifying real and synthetic images, while also providing comprehensive training of such classifications. Our results provide support for an easily scalable intervention that meaningfully improves detection of real and synthetic facial images.",

          "abstract": "The existence of free will has been a subject of fierce academic debate for millennia, still the meaning of the term “free will” remains nebulous. In the past two decades, psychologists have made considerable progress in defining lay concepts of free will. We present the first systematic review of primary psychological evidence on how ordinary folk conceptualise free will, encompassing folk concepts, beliefs, intuitions, and attitudes about free will. A total of 1,384 records were identified following a pre-registered protocol. After abstract and full-text screening, 18 articles published from 2008 to 2020 were eligible for inclusion, comprised of 36 studies and 10,176 participants from regions including the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, and Germany. A narrative synthesis of results showed that for ordinary folk, especially the more educated population from the United States, free will is a dynamic construct centred on the ability to choose following one’s goals and desires, whilst being uncoerced and reasonably free from constraints. Results suggesting metaphysical considerations regarding consciousness, dualism, and determinism were inconclusive. Our findings provided preliminary support for a psychological model of folk conception of free will, and elucidated potential pathways mediating the effects of consciousness and dualism on free will attributions. Further research is needed to explicate the distinction between having free will and having the ability to exercise free will, as well as the cross-cultural generalizability and differences of findings on folk conceptions of free will.\nKeywords: free will, choice, folk concepts, lay beliefs, systematic review, open science",

          "abstract": "Research into the effects of contextual diversity on lexical processing has flourished in the past 20 years, encompassing diverse tasks, populations, and languages, and underpinning influential theories of word learning (Nation, 2017). This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the field. Eighty-six articles (145 experiments) met our preregistered inclusion criteria, comprising three distinct experiment types; behavioural studies (N=111), computational modelling studies (N=20), and corpus validations (N=14). Across these experiments, the terminology used to refer to different diversity metrics has been applied inconsistently and somewhat arbitrarily. Behavioural studies have largely focused on word form processing (i.e., lexical decision tasks), showing consistent processing benefits for high-diversity words, regardless of the metric used. Effects of diversity on word-meaning processing were more mixed. We also review findings from a wide range of other tasks that are often overlooked (e.g., recognition memory). Computational modelling studies suggest that metrics that quantify the distinctiveness of contexts in which words are used better predict behaviour than metrics that simply count those contexts. Performance of these metrics is further improved by accounting for social patterns of language use across individuals or topics. Corpus validations show that diversity effects are consistent across languages. This review confirms that diversity in linguistic experience is a key organizational principle of the lexicon, but highlights that diversity effects vary across types of linguistic knowledge and task demands. We highlight key areas where more data is required, and make specific recommendations for improving future research based on a structured research cycle.",

These facts suggest that an evolutionary account of conspiracist thinking is appropriate. This paper discusses some recent evolutionary accounts and proposes a view which builds on them, but adds a distinctive focus on the morality of cooperation. It argues that elite cover up conspiracies evolved in part as communications about the reputations of that elite concerning their credibility and trustworthiness, with the intention to persuade them to change their behaviour to be more cooperative with the rest of the population. This general picture is argued to interact with local cultural values and practices around cooperation. Applying the model to China involves considering the relations between power distance and guanxi in determining whether cases of elite collusion are viewed as morally problematic conspiracies, with the implication that many cases would not. Implications for the COVID-19 conspiracy theories in China are noted.",

This study addresses this gap by conducting 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who were toxic in political discussions on Facebook and Twitter. Contrary to the common depiction of toxic individuals as apolitical “trolls,” the findings reveal that many view their toxicity as a form of political participation. Three distinct justifications for using toxicity were identified: Venting political frustrations, pursuing truth through blunt deliberation, and seeking to persuade or mobilize others. These findings suggest toxicity as a deliberate, though hostile, form of political engagement and highlight the diverse functions social media serves for politically motivated users. The study calls for targeted interventions to address the distinct motivations underlying toxicity.",

          "abstract": "To address the multifaceted problem of climate change, individuals must perform a range of individual and collective actions. To aid this process, research has sought to understand behavioral spillover—how one action impacts the likelihood of performing other actions. Recent theorizing emphasizes environmental identity, social norms, and affect and efficacy as key psychological mechanisms underlying positive spillover. Yet, spillover effects remain small and heterogenous. This review posits that driving positive spillover at the scale needed to mitigate climate change requires social and societal scaffolding. Emergent research leverages collective processes including interpersonal and social interactions, and institutional practices to further amplify these psychological mechanisms, and bolster positive behavioral spillover. For instance, workplaces can prompt the internalization of in-role pro-environmental behavior, resulting in positive spillovers to advocacy and household behaviors. Embedding psychological processes of behavioral spillover within collective processes presents a promising avenue to drive spillover between individual and collective climate actions.",

          "abstract": "Network models are well-suited for phenomena detection, and most empirical network studies have been exploratory so far. Yet, due to the close connections between (Gaussian) networks and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), confirmatory testing and SEM fit indices are readily applicable to network modeling as well. However, no study to date has evaluated how SEM fit indices perform in confirmatory network analysis (CNA), and what criteria should be applied. This study examined the applicability of SEM fit indices and their conventional cutoff values in CNA. We employed a panel graphical autoregressive model for its generalizability to network models in both cross-sectional (Gaussian graphical models) and N = 1 time-series cases (graphical autoregressive). Using simulations, we analyzed the performance of fit indices to test hypothesized network structures and evaluate stationarity, under varying number of variables (nodes), sample sizes, and waves. Most fit indices performed well, except that Type I incremental fit indices showed high false rejection rates. Conventional SEM cutoffs are largely generalizable to CNA as preliminary assessment criteria when dynamical cutoffs are unavailable. However, we recommend using stricter cutoff values (e.g., 0.03/0.04 RMSEA and 0.96/0.97 incremental fit indices) in hypothesis testing or direct replication studies, and stricter RMSEA cutoffs (0.03/0.04) to detect network structure non-stationarity. This study validates the use of SEM fit criteria for confirmatory network psychometrics and encourages theory-testing and replication studies in network research, providing practical recommendations for using SEM fit indices in confirmatory network testing.",

We used an experimental platform, in which two agents work con-\ncurrently by each controlling a moving paddle to deflect falling balls. Participants\nwere placed into either a HH team or HM team Alongside team performance,\nwe measured DoL using sophisticated time-sensitive analyses. With these measures, we found the DoL of HH teams was more equal than HM teams and that\na more equal DoL was also predictive of better team performance. Addition-\nally, HH teams showed less redundancy in their DoL than all other conditions\nand less redundant DoL behaviour resulted in better team performance. These\nfindings highlight that there are differences in how humans Divide Labour\nwith Machine agents. These differences are likely due to the underlying transactive nature human agents can engage in and the lack of transactive nature and\ncoordination of HM teams. These findings highlight the need to re-evaluate current theories of Teaming Cognition and provide important basis for HM teaming\npractice.",

From that perspective, we present a multiplicative tri-factor model whereby a partner’s perceived merits and their appreciation of the actor combine with the actor’s magnitude of significance quest to determine the likelihood of the actor falling in love with the partner. Our model affords a broad account of diverse love phenomena, allows the derivation of several specific hypotheses supported by prior and new data, and offers novel avenues for further research on classic issues in romantic love. The discussion considers our model’s unique implications and examines its relation to other theories of love.",

          "abstract": "The increasing use of the internet for various activities has led to a rise in cybersecurity threats, placing user accounts at greater risk of compromise. To mitigate this, two-factor authentication (2FA) schemes have been implemented across various online services as an additional security layer. However, previous research has shown that setting up two-factor authentication methods is not particularly usable, resulting in a significant number of user errors. These usability challenges undermine the security benefits of 2FA by discouraging users from adopting it or leading to poorly configured setups that frustrate users, ultimately causing them to opt out. Importantly, it is not known how these challenges may vary across age groups, with older users potentially facing greater difficulties in navigating setup processes. In this study, Google’s 2FA set-up interface is redesigned using both young and older users, with a particular focus on error reduction. The results show that the new interface resulted in notably less errors and higher system visibility when compared to the previous version across both sample groups. However, errors were still made, particularly among younger participants, who had a higher error rate than the older participants. On the other hand, the older participants took longer to complete the account setup than the younger participants. Our findings suggest that users’ mental models and their familiarity with specific authentication methods may play a role in the types and frequency of errors they make during the setup process.",

          "abstract": "Teachers can foster or thwart students’ motivation and engagement; hence, interventions often target teacher behaviors to improve student outcomes. These interventions are seldom derived from longitudinal data from the specific participants of interest. In this study, we created an intervention to increase student motivation and engagement using previously derived longitudinal data from our target population. We selected six teacher behaviors that best predicted student engagement in two subjects, physical education (PE) and mathematics, among Grade 7 students. We tested a 12-hour mostly-online teacher professional learning intervention in a prospectively registered, single-blinded, cluster-randomised controlled trial. From 30 participating schools, 1,969 students could be matched to one of the 129 teachers who provided consent (71 PE and 58 mathematics teachers). Employing a multiverse analytical approach, we found the intervention significantly increased psychological need satisfaction in most analyses. We found no robust effects on student engagement or other self-reported variables (attitudes toward PE, student use of approach or avoidance goals, or the perceived value of mathematics). Effects on achievement were mixed. We observed positive effects on PE achievement, with increased self-reported physical activity corresponding to an extra 0.43 days of activity per week. There were no significant effects on mathematics achievement. While we did not significantly increase engagement itself, this light-touch professional learning intervention was able to increase proximal predictors of motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Léo Fitouchi; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Why do many people morally condemn unrestrained indulgence in bodily pleasures—such as gluttony, masturbation, and drinking alcohol—even when these behaviors do not harm others? Leading theories of moral cognition claim that these puritanical moral judgments are independent of cognitive adaptations for reciprocal cooperation. In five pre-registered experiments (N &gt; 3000), we test an alternative hypothesis: that puritanical moral judgments emerge from perceptions that bodily pleasures indirectly facilitate uncooperative behaviors by impairing self-control. In Studies 1 and 2a-b, participants judged that targets who increased (vs. decreased) their non-other-harming sex, food, alcohol, and inactivity would become more likely to cheat, an effect mediated by the perception that they would become less self-controlled. In Study 3, participants judged that relaxing regulations on sex, food, and alcohol in a village would decrease self-control and cooperation in the village, although they judged enforcing puritanical prohibitions even more negatively. In Study 4, participants expected that, in a scientific experiment, a treatment group made to increase their consumption of bodily pleasures would become less cooperative and self-controlled than a psychologically similar control group. In all five studies, the perception that indulgence reduces self-control and cooperativeness was associated with the moral condemnation of harmless bodily pleasures. This provides support for the idea that some purity violations, although they do not directly harm other people, may be morally condemned because they activate cognitive systems designed for reciprocal cooperation.",

          "abstract": "The illusory truth effect - the finding that repeated statements are believed more - is understood as a cognitive bias at the core of the psychology of beliefs. Here, we propose that the effect, rather than representing a flaw in human cognition, is a rational adaptation to generally high-quality information environments. Using a formal model, we show that increasing belief in repeated statements improves belief accuracy when a source is credible (i.e., likely to tell the truth) but sometimes makes errors. The theory unifies four key findings in the literature while predicting a testable edge case for the illusory truth effect: when a source is likely to convey falsehoods. Using a large (N = 4,947) pre-registered online experiment, we show that the illusory truth effect is substantially smaller in a low-quality (mostly false) relative to a high-quality (mostly true) information environment. In fact, a majority of participants in the low-quality condition do not demonstrate any illusory truth effect. We identify the deployment of an alternative strategy in the low-quality condition where participants decrease their belief given repetition. Three process-level indicators - response times, cognitive reflection, and the prior plausibility of items - confirm an adaptively rational interpretation. In sum, we suggest the illusory truth effect may not be purely illusory, highlighting its adaptive foundations and the ability of people to efficiently navigate complex environments.",

          "authors": "Lucie Zimmer; Hilary Richardson; Carolina Pletti; Markus Paulus; Tobias Schuwerk",
          "abstract": "Social-cognitive processes, particularly Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, appear to differ between autistic and non-autistic individuals. This has been proposed to reflect the autistic core symptomatology of communication and social interaction difficulties. According to the predictive coding theory, autistic individuals’ ToM reasoning difficulties arise from an attenuated use of prior information about others’ mental states to explain and predict their behavior. This reduced use of prior assumptions makes the social world less predictable for autistic people, causing interactive mismatch and stress. Despite strong theoretical claims, robust and replicable neural differences in ToM brain regions remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether brain regions supporting ToM reasoning anticipate a narrative during repeated exposure (i.e., the narrative anticipation effect) in non-autistic adults (Experiment 1) and tested whether this effect was attenuated in autistic adults (Experiment 2). We presented a short movie with a plot including mental states with associated actions, twice, to 61 non-autistic adults who underwent fMRI (Experiment 1: M(SD)age= 25.9(4.4) years). In Experiment 2, we used the same protocol with 30 autistic (M(SD)age= 32.4(10.7) years) and 30 non-autistic adults (M(SD)age= 33.2(10.1) years). Analyses revealed no narrative anticipation effect in the ToM network in either group. Exploratory reverse correlation analyses identified a ToM scene that evoked a smaller difference in response between movie viewings (i.e., less repetition suppression) in autistic adults, compared to non-autistic adults. In sum, our study shows that predictive processing in the ToM network during a naturalistic movie-viewing experiment was absent in adults. Subtle differences in a key scene provide preliminary neural evidence for the predictive coding theory and open a promising avenue for future research to better understand the nature of differences in social interaction in autistic adults.",

          "abstract": "Concern for future generations is fundamental to multigenerational ethical decision-making and policymaking; yet people may underestimate how widely it’s shared––a misperception that could weaken mobilization towards collective action. Across two nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 1,000), we examined actual versus perceived intergenerational concern within the circle of moral regard, as well as in prescriptions for collective and governmental decision-making contexts. Participants significantly underestimated how many future generations their fellow Americans morally consider and believe should be accounted for in collective and governmental decisions. This pattern aligns with pluralistic ignorance––where individuals assume their attitudes are uncommon despite broad consensus. Our findings suggest that intergenerational concern is widespread in the U.S. but remains a potentially underleveraged driver of long-term policy support. Correcting misperceptions about the prevalence of concern for future generations may enhance collective action and foster policies that better account for the needs of those yet to come.",

To this end, many new initiatives have been developed that represent procedural (i.e., behaviours and sets of commonly used practices in the research process), structural (new norms, rules, infrastructure, and incentives), and community-based change (working groups, networks). Objectives: To outline international initiatives that enhance awareness and uptake of open research practices in the discipline of psychology. Methods: A systematic, narrative review was conducted in three stages: (1) a web search to identify open research initiatives in psychology; (2) a literature search to identify supporting publications; and (3) a hand search of grey literature. Eligible initiatives were coded into a narrative theme of procedural, structural, or community-based change. Results: A total of 187 initiatives were identified; 30 were procedural (e.g., toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g., policies, strategies, frameworks), and 87 community-based (e.g., working groups, networks). Discussion: Open research is progressing at pace through various initiatives that share a common goal to reform research culture. We hope that this review promotes their further adoption and facilitates coordinated efforts between individuals, organisations, institutions, publishers, and funders.",

          "abstract": "Gender is typically considered in psychological science using limited categorical identities that \ndo not necessarily capture the experiences of gender diverse people. Gender expression, in \ncontrast to social identities, is generally understood as continuous, and even within a categorical \ngender identity, variation in gender typicality is well-established. Yet, the way individuals \nintegrate identity, expression, and experiences is complex and likely subject to changing social \nnorms. This study examines patterns of variance in dimensional measures of gender expression \nwithin and between diverse gender identity categories. We compare results across two data sets \nspanning adolescence and adulthood: a sample of diverse adolescents throughout the United \nStates (N=10,120) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, and a \nconvenience sample of adults oversampled for diverse gender identities and sexual orientations \n(N=1,405). Across both samples, our results revealed variance in gender expression within \ncategorical gender identities and overlap in gender expression between categories, with less \npronounced differences between sexual orientation categories in adults than in adolescents. We \nfind both variation and consistency in gender expression across age cohorts, potentially \ninforming the development of gender expression over time.

Quantitative findings illuminated that more than half of respondents reported that two or more teachers were supportive of their sexual orientation and gender identity, although youth of color and youth with gender-diverse identities reported lower likelihood of support. Themes included safety, lack of consistency, limited disclosure, programmatic silence, inclusion, representation, harmful legislation, transphobia, and youth recommendations. Triangulation of results suggest LGBTQ+ youth are receiving more school supports in response to their needs and have further recommendations for sustained efforts in positive directions (e.g., affiliate clubs) and improvement in others (e.g., agency in self-disclosure).",

          "abstract": "In social interactions, the coordination of biobehavioural rhythms – interpersonal synchrony (IS) – fosters cooperation, enhances prosocial behaviours, and moulds lifelong social attitudes. At the core of synchronous interactions is the ability to detect and respond contingently to communicative signals. Atypicalities in these processes may contribute to socio-communicative difficulties commonly observed in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where social disconnection is often reported. Our research simulates interactions to delve into factors influencing IS in ASD and their neurotypical (TD) peers, examining the impact of time contingency and social engagement on preferences for social partners. Using a tablet-based task n=116 participants (n=58 ASD, n=58 TD) repeatedly interacted with faces that transitioned from side to front. These varied in time contingency (immediate or delayed response) and social engagement (smiley direct gaze vs neutral averted gaze). Before and after interaction participants ranked faces by preference. We found that while both groups preferred stimuli that were timely and engaging, neurotypical participants compensated for disrupted time contingency with social engagement, a pattern not observed in the autistic sample. We argue that the combination of time contingency and social engagement enhances social agency, which is particularly relevant for ASD. We discuss how creating predictable and engaging social environments could help autistic individuals feeling more connected in social settings.",

Socialization, or our experiences at the hands of agents of socialization, is a key concept in sociology. Every introductory sociology text that is printed devotes and entire chapter to a discussion of socialization and related concepts. However rarely, if at all, is there any indication that sociologists are aware of the profoundly deleterious impact of toxicity (violence, neglect, etc.) in the socialization process. This paper seeks to alleviate this lacuna by providing concepts (toxic socialization the 5Ds of Toxic Existence) by which psychologists, sociologists and others (e.g., psychologists, parents, teachers, and anybody involved in the socialization of human beings) can more readily discuss the problem of a violence and neglect in our socialization processes.",

This comparison reveals several consistent trends, including systematic size differences for distant objects, differences in foreshortening, a dependence of object shape on canvas shape, and multiperspective  composition. Many of these trends can be found in historical artworks as well. Some have been previously identified in the literature, but discussions often involve very incomplete information, e.g., analysis of Renaissance perspective has involved considerable speculation about the artists' subjects and thought processes, and unfounded assumptions about the \"correctness\" of linear perspective. If a painting and a photograph of a scene differ in some aspect, it might be that the drawing does not match visual experience of that aspect, that the photograph does not, or both. Identifying such systematic differences offers avenues for future study of how pictures and visual experience relate, and what causes these differences.",

          "abstract": "The potential of meditation as a preparatory tool for psychedelic experiences lacks empirical investigation. We surveyed experienced practitioners (N=123) with substantial histories in both meditation and psychedelic use to examine meditation’s role in psychedelic preparation. Respondents expected meditation training to primarily enhance acceptance and present-moment focus during psychedelic experiences, while also increasing oceanic boundlessness and reducing anxious ego-dissolution. For practitioners with limited meditation experience (1-3 years) and fewer psychedelic sessions (1-20), those adhering to specific meditation traditions reported significantly higher PBMPP scores (Perceived Benefits of Meditation for Psychedelic Preparation) compared to non-adherents. However, among highly experienced meditators (10+ years) with limited psychedelic experience (1-20 sessions), this pattern reversed, with non-adherents reporting significantly higher PBMPP scores than adherents to specific tradition. When evaluating specific meditation approaches, Loving-Kindness Meditation emerged as the most beneficial preparatory practice, significantly outrating other approaches such as Focused Attention. Exploratory factor analysis of meditative elements identified three distinct components: Positive Emotional States (PES), Mindful Awareness and Insight (MAI), and Concentration Techniques (CT), with PES receiving the strongest endorsement for psychedelic preparation. For practical implementation, participants recommended approximately three weeks of preparation with 30-minute daily sessions, strongly favouring online and asynchronous delivery methods. These results provide empirical groundwork for developing effective evidence-based meditation protocols for psychedelic preparation. They also highlight the importance of considering psychedelic users’ level of previous meditation experience in optimising such interventions. Future research directions should include controlled trials examining specific meditation practices’ effects on psychedelic experiences and outcomes across different populations and contexts.",

The most commonly studied aspects of power were sexual relationship power, structural power, and decision-making. We also summarized the study topics and sample characteristics to investigate when different types of power measures were used. Future research should test the construct validity, internal validity, and external validity of power measures. We discourage the use of proxy measures previously validated to measure constructs distinct from power dynamics in order to avoid conflating distinct constructs for power research.",

          "authors": "Aaron Hertzmann",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I compare perspective in my observational drawings to photographs that I took at the same time, and, where memory allows, discuss how both relate to the visual experiences. This comparison reveals several consistent trends, including systematic size differences for distant objects, differences in foreshortening, a dependence of object shape on canvas shape, and multiperspective  composition. Many of these trends can be found in historical artworks as well. Some have been previously identified in the literature, but discussions often involve very incomplete information, e.g., analysis of Renaissance perspective has involved considerable speculation about the artists' subjects and thought processes, and unfounded assumptions about the \"correctness\" of linear perspective. If a painting and a photograph of a scene differ in some aspect, it might be that the drawing does not match visual experience of that aspect, that the photograph does not, or both. Identifying such systematic differences offers avenues for future study of how pictures and visual experience relate, and what causes these differences.",

          "abstract": "Associative memory naturally declines with age. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older adults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci, which involves associating each item of a to-be-memorized list with a location along a familiar route, that we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory. The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

We experience physical assault, emotional and psychological attack, and even the intellectual violence of manipulation and indoctrination. Psychology is becoming increasingly aware not only of the prevalent violence but also of the profoundly deleterious impact of said violence on the human mind and body; however, sociology lags behind. Socialization, or our experiences at the hands of agents of socialization, is a key concept in sociology. Every introductory sociology text that is printed devotes and entire chapter to a discussion of socialization and related concepts. However rarely, if at all, is there any indication that sociologists are aware of the profoundly deleterious impact of toxicity (violence, neglect, etc.) in the socialization process. This paper seeks to alleviate this lacuna by providing concepts (toxic socialization the 5Ds of Toxic Existence) by which psychologists, sociologists and others (e.g., psychologists, parents, teachers, and anybody involved in the socialization of human beings) can more readily discuss the problem of a violence and neglect in our socialization processes.",

          "abstract": "Bowlby’s Attachment Theory (AT) remains a popular way to understand infant, child, adolescent, and even adult and family dysfunction. However, attachment theory, which has not changed significantly since its inception, is a reductive theory that ignores a wider range of human needs and has caused significant hardship and trauma. The limitations of this model, particularly when applied outside the Eurocentric and ethnocentric frames of mainstream psychology, are well known. In this article, we suggest it is time to replace the reductive theory of needs that underpins AT with a comprehensive theory, one that could help us develop a less ideological, healthier, and more empirically informed approach to socialization and social care; one that might help us answer Abraham Maslow’s Eupsychian question which is how to build a society capable of actuating the full potential of all its citizens.",

To deepen our understanding of young readers’ expectations, needs, and desires for a robot that supports reading, we conducted co-design sessions followed by a semi-structured interview with children aged 5-9 years (30 typical readers and a case series of 5 children with poor reading, with 4 engaged in targeted reading intervention at the time the study was conducted). We conducted a thematic analysis of interview data using a reflexive and inductive approach. We found that children designed robots that could deliver reading-specific support alongside more general emotional support. Key functional features and capabilities included prosocial behaviours (smiling, play, conversation), breadth of knowledge that assumed access to information about many topics, including core academic skills (reading, mathematics). Key aesthetic features included colourful, compact, and customisable designs. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of social robots to support reading and suggest that children are very much open to interacting with reading robot companions.",

We investigated this question by studying effects of cross-linguistic influence and priming in the comprehension of scopally ambiguous all...not sentences. In this investigation, we focused on Estonian-English bilinguals, because these sentences are interpreted differently in English compared to Estonian.\n\nAcross four sentence-picture matching experiments, we firstly observed that bilingual logical representations can be primed within languages (both from L1-to-L1 and from L2-to-L2) and between languages (both from L1-to-L2 and from L2-to-L1). This finding indicates that bilinguals make use of shared logical representations in processing the languages they know, and that logical representations do not specify language-specific biases in the assignment of scope. Secondly, we observed that bilinguals experience bidirectional cross-linguistic influence in the construction of logical representations. This finding suggests that bilingual representations of implicit knowledge about scopal preferences is integrated between the languages they know.",

          "abstract": "Metacognition allows us to monitor and control our behaviour to help us to evaluate our memory performance. Adults are adept at monitoring their memory accuracy explicitly and implicitly, as well as using control processes but the development of monitoring and control is less understood. In this study we administered an episodic cued recall task with children from three age-groups: five- to six-year-olds (N = 35), seven- to eight-year-olds (N = 33) and nine- to 11-year-olds (N = 38). Participants watched two video clips of mundane episodic events (e.g. person making breakfast) before answering cued recall memory questions. On each trial, participants provided a confidence rating (explicit monitoring), sorted their answer into show/hide boxes (control) and chose to volunteer/withhold their response (control). Behavioural gestures (implicit monitoring) were recorded and later coded by blind raters. The findings showed that children have developed explicit and implicit monitoring (i.e. long pauses, non-word fillers, vowel length, high tone, head nods &amp; looking to carer) and control to inform about their memory accuracy. In contrast to previous research, we found no age differences in explicit and implicit monitoring and control between five to 11 years. Moreover, uncertainty gestures partially mediated the confidence-accuracy relationship, which suggests that gestures are one of many cues which can help children to explicitly monitor their memory accuracy. We conclude that explicit and implicit forms of metacognition have a stable development from early- to mid-childhood and young children are not solely reliant on implicit monitoring as previously thought.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness), while it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge, and analyzed the resulting performance data with a dynamic drift-diffusion model to disentangle the contributions of the aforementioned processes on. Results revealed that implicit sequence learning does not affect stimulus processing, but benefits response selection. Moreover, beyond response selection, response execution was affected. Explicit sequence knowledge did not change this pattern if participants worked on probabilistic materials, where it is difficult to anticipate the next response. However, if materials were deterministic, explicit knowledge enabled participants to switch from stimulus-based to plan-based action control, which was reflected in ample changes in the cognitive processes involved in performing the task.\n  First implications for theories of sequence learning, and how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research into implicit and explicit sequence learning,\n  are dicussed.",

          "abstract": "Teacher shortages are a serious challenge in many countries, made worse by declining enrolments in initial teacher education (ITE) programs and growing competition for talented young people making career decisions. To address this challenge, we developed and tested two digital interventions—a persuasive game (TeachQuest) and a realistic job preview (RJP)—designed to enhance undergraduate students’ teaching interest, teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of fit with the profession. In a two-phase experimental study (N = 957), undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to TeachQuest, the RJP, or a control condition. Results from Phase 1 showed that both interventions increased participants’ interest and perceived fit with teaching, with the RJP also improving teaching self-efficacy. In Phase 2, results from a delayed post-test (six weeks later; N = 572) indicated that while motivation-related outcomes remained higher than pre-test levels, changes were non-linear, with TeachQuest sustaining interest through participants’ immersion experiences and the RJP maintaining self-efficacy through mastery experiences. Our findings suggest that immersive game-based recruitment interventions may be particularly effective in informing and engaging potential applicants, whereas RJPs may be useful in reinforcing confidence in teaching. The study provides new insights informing the design of scalable, evidence-based teacher recruitment tools that align with the interests and digital-focused lives of prospective applicants for ITE programs.",

          "abstract": "Because the successful implementation of climate policies requires public acceptance, it is critical to understand the determinants of policy acceptance and ways to boost it. In this research, we aim to test the causality of the effect of perceived effectiveness on policy acceptance. Further, we examine whether providing people with information about a climate policy’s objective effectiveness can enhance perceived effectiveness and, in turn, the policy’s acceptance. In a preregistered experiment (N = 953; T1), participants were asked about the perceived effectiveness and acceptance of a speed limit on German highways. Beforehand, participants in the information condition were provided with details about the speed limit’s effectiveness in terms of CO2 reductions, whereas participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Participants were asked about their perceived effectiveness and policy acceptance again 1.5 years later (T2; n = 334). We found that providing vs. not providing such information led to higher perceived effectiveness but not greater policy acceptance at T1. However, among those participants without prior knowledge of the speed limit’s effectiveness, providing the information positively affected both perceived effectiveness and policy acceptance at T1. Finally, we found a causal indirect effect of intervention (vs. control) on policy acceptance (at both T1 and T2) via perceived effectiveness at T1. Our results suggest that perceived effectiveness is an integral causal determinant of policy acceptance in the climate domain. Explaining the objective effectiveness of climate policies thus poses a promising approach for policymakers to increase public acceptance of climate policies.",

          "abstract": "In social interactions, the coordination of biobehavioural rhythms – interpersonal synchrony (IS) – fosters cooperation, enhances prosocial behaviours, and moulds lifelong social attitudes. At the core of synchronous interactions is the ability to detect and respond contingently to communicative signals. Atypicalities in these processes may contribute to socio-communicative difficulties commonly observed in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), where social disconnection is often reported. Our research simulates interactions to delve into factors influencing IS in ASD and their neurotypical (TD) peers, examining the impact of time contingency and social engagement on preferences for social partners. Using a tablet-based task n=116 participants (n=58 ASD, n=58 TD) repeatedly interacted with faces that transitioned from side to front. These varied in time contingency (immediate or delayed response) and social engagement (smiley direct gaze vs neutral averted gaze). Before and after interaction participants ranked faces by preference. We found that while both groups preferred stimuli that were timely and engaging, neurotypical participants compensated for disrupted time contingency with social engagement, a pattern not observed in the autistic sample. We argue that the combination of time contingency and social engagement enhances social agency, which is particularly relevant for ASD. We discuss how creating predictable and engaging social environments could help autistic individuals feeling more connected in social settings.",

In Experiment 1, we manipulated two features of the social context: perceived effort investment by one’s partner and the duration of partnership. We found that participants cheated more when they perceived that their partner exerted high effort, which was significant in the short partnership condition. Moreover, participants cheated more individually post-collaboration than they had pre-collaboration, showing that collaborative cheating may carry over into subsequent behaviour. In Experiment 2, we manipulated who received each round’s rewards. Participants cheated more for joint rewards, but less when they were the reward recipients and perceived that their partner exerted high effort.",

          "abstract": "Maintaining curiosity in older age may be a key predictor of successful aging, but some prior research shows that curiosity declines with age. However, some evidence suggests that state curiosity – a situational feeling of curiosity in response to information – may increase with age. Prior work has largely not adequately differentiated state and trait curiosity when examining its relationship with age. In a large lifespan sample (N = 1,218), we assess trait curiosity and state curiosity (using a trivia rating task) to examine the relationship between each construct and age. The results show that, in line with prior work, trait curiosity shows a negative relationship with age, but state curiosity shows a positive relationship with age, while controlling for demographic variables. The results suggest that curiosity may have a more complex relationship with age than previously considered, which can have implications for engagement in cognitive activities in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental way to reason about causation is in terms of direct contact, like billiard balls colliding. Although collision-like causes have played an important role in philosophical and psychological theories of causation, humans conceptualize many events that lack direct contact as causes. If Andy hits Suzy with his bike, Suzy falls into a fence and it breaks, Andy is a cause of the fence breaking. We also treat absences as causes. If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen is a cause. Moreover, there are linguistic distinctions between verbs that refer to these: Andy “caused” the fence to break but Suzy “broke” it. The absence of sunscreen “caused” Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun “burned” it. We explored how children develop these mappings, focusing on “cause” and verbs like “burn”. Because “make” is more frequent than “cause”, we included it too. We tested 690 children and 150 adults. Experiment 1 examined causal chains. Children as young as 4 thought Andy “caused” the fence to break, but Suzy “broke” it and “made” it break. Experiment 2 examined causation by absence. Only older children thought the absence of sunscreen “caused” the sunburn. Yet in Experiment 3, even 4-year-olds cited absences in explaining Suzy’s sunburn. Despite rarely hearing “cause”, young children understand it and verbs like “break” to mark subtle distinctions between causes: “break” refers to direct causes; “cause” to indirect causes in chains. Absences are more challenging, but children refer to them in causal explanations before mapping “cause” to them.",

          "abstract": "In the era of renewed fascination with AI and robotics, one needs to address questions related to their societal impact, particularly in terms of moral responsibility and intentionality. In seven vignette-based experiments we investigated whether the consequences of a robot or human’s actions, influenced participant’s intentionality and moral responsibility ratings. For the robot, when the vignettes contained mentalistic descriptions, moral responsibility ratings were higher for negative action consequences than positive action consequences, however, there was no difference in intentionality ratings. Whereas, for the human, both moral responsibility and intentionality ratings were higher for negative action consequences. Once the mentalistic descriptions were removed from the vignettes and the moral responsibility question was clarified, we found a reversed asymmetry. For both robots and humans, participants attributed more intentionality and praise, for positive action consequences than negative action consequences. We suggest that this reversal could be due to people defaulting to charitable explanations, when explicit references to culpable mental states are removed from the vignettes.",

Priming social category knowledge slowed categorization before 7.67 years (d=0.04) but children’s racial identity moderated the effects of top-down information and bottom-up features on efficiency.

          "abstract": "The present study aims to examine the role of social robots in enriching older adults’ environments and helping them cope with the problems that decrease their well-being and life quality. To understand how social robots can be integrated into older adults’ lives, we investigated both older adults’ and caretakers’ attitudes toward social robots. For this aim, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 participants. In these interviews, we showed them photos and videos of the three social robots with different looks, abilities, and degrees of resemblance to humans. Then, we asked them to answer some open-ended questions. These robots were the pet-like robot Aibo, the toy-like robot Paro, and the humanoid robot Pepper. We analyzed the answers using complementary quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative approach included the Sentiment Analysis (SA) and the qualitative approach included the Thematic Analysis (TA). SA results indicate that caretakers approached negatively to Paro, and positively to Aibo and Pepper. On the other hand, older adults did not differ in the polarity of attitudes toward the three robots. The TA results yielded four overarching themes: I) Perceived and expected roles of the robot, II) Physical characteristics and design features of the robot, III) Factors influencing acceptance of the robot, and IV) Disadvantages of the robot. Under those, there were various themes and sub-themes diversified for each robot. Overall, our findings reveal significant insights into older adults’ and caretakers’ approaches to different types of social robots and enable researchers to use these robots more effectively.",

          "abstract": "Separate lines of research suggest that people tend to avoid mental effort, but also value it. Evidence for this effort paradox in the same context is scarce. We tested whether people discount effort prior to the investment of effort and value effort following its investment. In three preregistered experiments (total N = 450), participants repeatedly chose between executing a low-effort task for a small reward and a high-effort task for a larger reward. Participants then chose whether or not to gamble with their rewards. As people tend to become more risk averse as subjective value increases, we reasoned that participants would be less likely to gamble with rewards the harder they had to work for them. In Studies 1 and 2, we framed the experiment in terms of gaining rewards. In Study 3, we framed the experiment in terms of losing rewards. In all three studies, effort was discounted prospectively, meaning people demanded higher rewards to invest more effort. Contrary to our predictions, we found that people were more likely to gamble with the rewards the more effort it required to obtain them, but only when the rewards were framed in terms of gains (Studies 1 and 2). Collectively, these results suggest that any potential effort paradox is unlikely to occur when people are aware of the association between investing effort and gaining rewards. Our results also imply a novel hypothesis, namely that the aversive feeling accompanying effort might motivate people to engage in risky behavior.",

          "authors": "Carmen Saldana; Patrick Kanampiu; Jennifer Culbertson",
          "abstract": "Languages exhibit a tremendous amount of variation in how they organise and order morphemes within words; however, regularities are also found. For example, gender and number inflectional morphology tend to appear together within a single affix. In the relatively rare cases in which they appear as two separate affixes, morphology encoding gender information tends to be placed closer to the stem than number morphology is. Alternative theories of gender and number have been designed (in part) to explain these tendencies. However, the typological data are very sparse, making it difficult to find clear evidence for the representations and mechanisms shaping the organisation of gender and number. Across a series of experiments, we use an artificial language learning paradigm to explore the inferences learners make about the order of gender and number affixes in the absence of any explicit information in the input. We show that language learners have a clear preference for placing nominal morphology containing gender information closest to the stem. This holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems. Importantly, these biases are consistent across populations of participants with different L1 experience with gender morphology: English, Italian and Kîîtharaka speakers. These results provide a new source of empirical support for particular theories of gender, and in line with previous work, suggest that cognitive biases play a role in determining morpheme order in the world’s languages.",

          "abstract": "Despite 30+ years of research, the debate about the existence of a bilingual advantage in cognitive control continues. One possible explanation for this inconclusion is the appropriateness of tasks used to measure inhibitory control in young participants. This study used the Early Childhood Inhibitory Touchscreen Task (ECITT; Holmboe et al., 2021) to measure response inhibition in infants aged 10 and 16 months(N=208). A significant effect of inhibitory control (better performance on accuracy and reaction time; p&lt;.001 [-.47, -32]) was found, such that performance was better when there was no inhibitory demand. This did not differ depending on the age of the infant (10 or 16 months), language background (monolingual or bilingual) or the interaction of age and language. This suggests that exposure to two languages does not influence inhibitory control in young infants, or at least may not be detectable in behavioural tests in infants under 16 months old. \n\nKEY WORDS: Cognitive control, Bilingualism, Response Inhibition, Bilingual advantage, Preverbal infants",

          "abstract": "Autistic individuals face temporal integration difficulties in some sensory modalities that may be related to imagination difficulties. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that among Japanese university students, (1) higher autistic traits and (2) greater imagination difficulties lead to correspondingly lower performance in tasks that require temporal integration. Two tasks were used to assess their temporal integration abilities: a speech-in-noise test using noise with temporal dips in the auditory modality and a slit-viewing task in the visual modality. The results showed that low performance in the speech-in-noise test was related to autistic traits and some aspects of imagination difficulties, whereas the slit-viewing task was related to neither autistic traits nor imagination difficulties. One must have the ability to temporally integrate fragments of auditory information to perceive speech in noise with temporal dips. The difficulties in perceiving sensory information as a single unified percept using priors may cause difficulties in temporally integrating auditory information and perceiving speech in noise. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling suggests that imagination difficulties are linked to difficulties in perceiving speech in noise with temporal dips, which in turn links to social impairments.",

Auditory research largely suggests that oscillations are flexible and correspond to the temporal structure of the external world, whereas visual research suggests these rhythms are fixed by intrinsic processes.

The aim of this Opinion is to highlight this incompatibility, while offering a new model of temporal sampling that cross-pollinates ideas and combines constraints found across sensory domains.",

Traditional search methods are time-intensive and heavily reliant on manual screening, yet more modern machine-aided strategies may also miss certain studies. This paper explores a collaborative, open-source approach for blending both approaches to identify all relevant literature up to the “last relevant paper” for a systematic review of post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories. \n\nWe compared the results from eight search strategies, including conventional database searches, snowballing, full-text searches via the Dimensions database, and machine-aided methods of semantic vectorization with cosine similarity matching via the OpenAlex database. Thereafter, we combined human screening efforts with active learning–aided screening plus a large language model (LLMs) based quality check. \n\nIn total, 3.822 records were added on top of the 6.701 records identified with replicating the initial search. Machine-aided methods found papers overlooked by traditional techniques—particularly papers missing conventional keywords, published in unindexed journals, or featuring unconventional phrasing. The human-AI screening approach resulted in 127 relevant studies. Active learning and LLMs were used to increase the quality of the labels, with both methods adding relevant papers overlooked by the human screeners.  \n\nIn conclusion, our findings also make it evident that even with exhaustive effort and sophisticated technologies, there remains the possibility that certain papers will still be missed. The evolving nature of academic publishing, varying terminologies, and publication delays mean that the pursuit of the \"last relevant paper\" is inherently a never-ending process.",

While recent studies have shown how to uncover features of mental representations underlying similarity judgments, they generally ignore individual differences. In this paper, we propose a computational framework based on the ”odd-one-out” task to identify a shared set of features that describe similarities between stimuli, while allowing for the fact that different people may prioritize these features differently. We show how prior knowledge about a stimulus domain can be incorporated and tested and how to uncover new features in an exploratory manner. We  demonstrate the framework in a study on accent perception, where we reveal that people’s first language can shape how they perceive continuous and categorical aspects of accents. We highlight the value of this framework for iteratively refining our understanding of how individuals mentally represent the stimuli in their environment.",

Six primary and two supplemental studies with Dutch and U.S. participants (total N = 3,591, six preregistered) show that gender- and race-biased outcomes are perceived as much less fair than unbiased outcomes, but we do not observe the same for attractiveness-biased outcomes. Our results suggest that this occurs because people spontaneously pay attention to a few salient dimensions (e.g., gender and race) when scrutinizing decision outcomes. Statistical biases along less salient dimensions (e.g., attractiveness) are more likely to go undetected. Thus, people may show muted responses to some biased outcomes not because the bias is tolerated or seen as legitimate, but because people fail to notice the bias.",

          "abstract": "Informal caregiving provides societally important healthcare functions but can take a toll on caregivers, with negative consequences for well-being. However, little is known about other psychological effects of informal caregiving and their specific temporal trajectories. Here, we focused on personality traits and examined selection (who becomes a caregiver?) and socialization effects (how do caregivers change over time?). We used longitudinal data from Dutch, German, and Australian representative panel studies (83,706 observations, 24,530 caregivers) to examine selection and socialization effects of caregivers’ Big Five personality traits. Respondents higher in openness were slightly more likely to take on the caregiving role. Over the transition to informal caregiving, we found no consistent evidence for within- person personality changes. However, with increasing time spent on informal caregiving, caregivers increased in neuroticism in two of the three studies and, on the item-level, tended to become less lazy, more considerate, and more worried. Overall, however, results provided more evidence of personality stability than change. We did not find robust moderation effects of gender and the caregiving context (care tasks, relationship with care recipient, and fulltime employment). We discuss theoretical implications for personality development and ways to advance research into psychological antecedents and consequences of informal caregiving.",

          "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a complex disorder shaped by factors such as craving, mood, and neurocognitive processes. While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a real-time method for capturing dynamic changes in behavior, traditional tasks and surveys are often too lengthy and demanding for repeated use in clinical settings. Integrating EMA with computational approaches offers a promising solution to predict smoking behavior dynamically while addressing the practical limitations of conventional assays, paving the way for more effective and scalable interventions. To evaluate the predictive value of computational markers derived from decision-making tasks and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data for short-term (daily smoking behavior) and long-term (cessation success) outcomes, and to assess the timing and amount of data collection needed for prediction. 79 daily smokers (mean age 25.64 years, 83% male) took part in a longitudinal experimental study involving EMA surveys of psychological states and decision-making tasks, delivered daily via a smartphone app, while undergoing a 5–6 week smoking cessation program. Using a machine-learning methodology (adaptive design optimization, ADO) to effectively generate task variables, we estimated computational markers from just 20 to 30 trials per day, reducing task length and participants burden. A time-lagged model incorporating both computational markers and self-reported daily psychological states provided the most accurate prediction of next-day smoking behavior. Higher levels of craving, depression, and ambiguity tolerance in decision-making on the previous day were significantly predictive of increased smoking amount the following day. Smoking cessation status at the end of treatment was most strongly predicted by lower discounting rates, reduced craving and stress, a longer smoking history, and greater engagement in treatment (AUC = 0.76). Notably, models based on data collected during the first week of follow-up, either on the decision-making tasks (AUC = 0.74) or psychological variables (AUC = 0.73), demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy for end-of-treatment smoking cessation. Combining computational markers with EMA data offers a dynamic and efficient approach for predicting smoking behavior and cessation success and holds promise for clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "Embodied social interactions in immersive virtual reality (VR) can improve intergroup relations. However, minimal work has empirically addressed applications of this approach to gender diverse identities. This study investigates the effects of VR perspective taking and VR-mediated intergroup contact on cisgender individuals’ interpersonal coordination, empathy, and affiliation with a transgender outgroup target. Australian young adults (N = 126) embodied either a transgender or cisgender virtual avatar, while interacting with a transgender confederate (human-controlled virtual agent). Participant-confederate dyadic motion trajectories were tracked across two iterations of a semi-structured interview, separated by the confederate’s gender identity disclosure. Using cross-recurrence quantification analysis, all participants exhibited more spontaneous interpersonal coordination with the confederate at phase two, although transgender-embodied men experienced the greatest increases. Participants also reported more empathy toward the confederate at phase two, and this mediated relationships between the sense of virtual embodiment and affiliation. However, only transgender-embodied participants reported interpersonal similarity with the confederate. Taken together, findings triangulate automatic, unconscious measures of affiliation (i.e., spontaneous coordination) with conscious, self-reported measures of affiliation and empathy. By simultaneously investigating VR perspective taking and VR-mediated contact approaches, we find that cisgender individuals may experience greater affiliation with transgender outgroup targets following a combined approach.",

          "abstract": "Children are active, curious learners. How might children’s curiosity shape their curriculum during word learning? Past research suggests that children’s tendency to explore can lead them to discover novel information during learning. This exploratory tendency could be especially useful when learning word meanings: exploring potential meanings for words broadly could help children efficiently probe a word’s possible extension. To investigate this question, we tested how children (5-8 years of age) and adults sample information when presented with a novel word and tasked with uncovering the word’s extension. Overall, we found that children explored novel word extensions conservatively. Children (as well as adults) favored sampling choices that confirmed a novel word meaning, as opposed to exploring broader possible meanings. Younger children’s sampling choices were especially conservative, with children often sampling the narrowest possible generalization option. Older children were more exploratory, probing broader possible word extensions more frequently. Counter to proposals that children are generally more exploratory at younger ages, our results suggest that when children test the extent of novel word meanings, they are often more likely to confirm their hypotheses than to explore.",

Our analyses consider more than a thousand concepts, and demonstrate that  average usage frequency across dozens of languages is a relatively good predictor of the typological prevalence of lexicalization across hundreds of languages. This finding  implies that cross-linguistic regularities in lexicalization can be attributed in part to shared communicative need across cultures.",

Digital single-session interventions adapted from existing evidence-based treatments are one solution to this problem, allowing potent skills to be widely accessible for diverse communities via brief, targeted, online programs. There is increasing demand and interest in developing digital single-session interventions, yet there exists no guide on how to adapt single-session interventions from existing interventions, making it difficult for researchers to engage in intervention developing and testing. Objective: To equip researchers with the confidence they need to develop single-session interventions, this manuscript outlines why digital single-session interventions are needed and creates a step-by-step guide on how to develop single-session intervention programs from existing evidence-based treatments. Method: We gathered eight scientists, all of whom have taken part in developing different single-session interventions. Results: Together, we crafted five guiding elements to consider during the development process, such as preparation (cultivating a single-session mindset), collaboration (assembling the right team to reach target audience), adaptation (selecting appropriate treatments and components), design (creating the content of the intervention), and engagement (using best practices to increase online uptake and learning). We provide an example of how we developed an online single-session intervention to enhance healthy relationship skills for youth with depressive symptoms. For more detail and direction, we created a supplementary designing SSIs checklist. Conclusion: This manuscript serves as a guide for intervention scientists, allowing for the creation of evidence-based, scalable digital single-session interventions for youth.",

          "authors": "Nils Uwe Mallock",
          "abstract": "Exposure to self-related uncertainty has been shown to cause defensiveness in the form of embracing extreme political attitudes and intergroup bias. However, so far it is unclear whether this mechanism extends to behavioral intentions, and thus constitutes a motivating factor for engagement in non-normative collective action. Here, this question is examined in Iraq in 2020 after a period of intense regional instability and protests. In a preregistered randomized controlled trial across diverse locations (N=279), participants’ self-integrity was threatened by mortality salience. They responded by reporting stronger intentions to engage in collective action, especially for non-normative forms including the use of violence; however, providing alternative self-affirmation opportunities partially mitigated this effect. Secondary analyses suggest the impact of both manipulations to be moderated by low emotional stability, disagreeableness, and high identification with existing social networks. This study extends self-affirmation theory by testing it in a conflict-affected setting and on specific behavioral intentions, discussing practical implications for psychological field interventions in post-conflict resolution.",

          "abstract": "Across eight economic games and survey experiments, we find that incentivizing third parties to punish destabilizes cooperation. When punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately, remain lower regardless of punishment feedback, and can only be restored by explicitly signaling that incentives are restricted to prosocial punishment. When we allow recipients of cooperation to choose the punishers they are paired with, they inadvertently reduce their own payouts by choosing incentivized punishers. Survey experiments suggest that these effects occur because recipients trust punishers more than dictators, care more about promoting prosocial punishment than preventing antisocial punishment, and that the introduction of incentives reframes social norms. Our results suggest that any effects of punishment on cooperation may be driven more by what it communicates about punishers’ intentions and social norms than by the imposition of material costs alone. Implications for criminal justice and systems of punishment are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental skill of human cognition. We use textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and emotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated stories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we test whether features relative to Mednick’s associative theory of creativity can explain creativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine 3 scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of human stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in terms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI methods. GPT-3.5 favours “its own” stories and rates human stories differently from humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i) network features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for GPT-3.5´s ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater role than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own stories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5´s ability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need for caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it does not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human creativity.",

          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "Abrupt, large changes in symptom severity (sudden gains or sudden losses) can have a lasting impact on the outcome of psychological treatment. Recent theories suggest that for a lasting effect to happen, the sudden gain must be perceived and processed by both the patient and the therapist. However, it remains unclear whether patients notice sudden changes in their symptom severity. In a first attempt to close this gap, we conducted a daily diary study with a non-clinical sample consisting of 138 participants. The participants were asked to rate their self-esteem, personality, and affect, as well as to indicate whether they perceived any changes in these variables since the previous day or week. Our results replicated previous findings that sudden gains and sudden losses also occur in non-clinical samples, but are unstable and not associated with depressive symptoms in such samples. Furthermore, although we found that participants' perceptions of change were associated with their actual experiences, more fine-grained analyses showed that this association was mainly due to participants reporting correctly that they experienced no change. That is, participants had difficulty identifying sudden shifts in their experience. Altogether this suggests that sudden gains and sudden losses are not easily identified by those who experience them. We discuss limitations of our study and also point to questions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Traditional rating scales have shaped psychological research, but are resource-intensive and can burden participants. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a tool to assess latent constructs in text. This study introduces LLM rating scales, a rating method that uses LLM responses instead of human ratings. Its application is demonstrated based on the development and validation of an LLM rating scale measuring patient engagement in transcripts of psychological therapies. Automatically transcribed videos of 1,131 sessions from 155 patients were analyzed using DISCOVER, a software framework for local multimodal human behavior analysis. The Llama 3.1 (8B) LLM rated 120 items on patient engagement, with the top eight items averaged to create a total engagement score ranging from 0 (low) to 100 (high). Psychometric properties were evaluated using the original sample, bootstrap resampling, and test folds. The LLM rating scale demonstrated normal distribution, strong reliability (ω = .953) and acceptable fit (CFI = .968, SRMR = .022), except RMSEA = .108. Validity was supported by significant correlations with engagement determinants (e.g., motivation, r = .413), processes (e.g., between-session efforts, r = .390), and outcomes (e.g., symptoms, r = −.304). Results remained robust across bootstrap and cross-validation analyses accounting for the hierarchical data structure. The LLM rating scale exhibited strong psychometric properties for measuring patient engagement, demonstrating the potential of the LLM rating scale approach as a psychological assessment tool. Importantly, this automated approach uses interpretable items, ensuring clear understanding of measured constructs, while supporting local implementation and protecting confidential data.",

Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Several factors (e.g., interpersonal stress, affect) predict loss-of-control (LOC) eating and overeating in adolescents, but most past research has tested predictors separately. We applied machine learning to simultaneously evaluate multiple possible predictors of LOC-eating and overeating severity in pooled and person-specific models. Method: Twenty-eight adolescents (78.57% female, age = 15.87  1.59 years, BMI %ile = 92.71  8.86) who endorsed  two past-month LOC-eating episodes completed a week-long ecological momentary assessment protocol. Pooled models were fit to the aggregated data with elastic-net regularized regression and evaluated using nested cross-validation. Person-specific models were fit and evaluated as proof-of-concept. Results: Across adolescents, the median out-of-sample R2 of the pooled LOC-eating severity model was 0.33. The top predictors were between-subjects food craving, sadness, interpersonal conflict, shame, distress, stress (inverse association), and anger (inverse association), and within- and between-subjects wishing relationships were better. The median out-of-sample R2 for pooled overeating severity model was 0.20. The top predictors were between-person food craving, loneliness, mixed race, and feeling rejected (inverse association), and within-subjects guilt, nervousness, wishing for more friends (inverse association), and feeling scared, annoyed, and rejected (all inverse associations). Person-specific models demonstrated poor fit (median LOC-eating severity R2 = .003, median overeating R2 = -.009); 61% and 36% of adolescents’ models performed better than chance for LOC-eating and overeating severity, respectively. Discussion: Altogether, group-level models may hold utility in predicting LOC-eating and overeating severity, but model performance for person-specific models is variable, and additional research with larger samples over an extended assessment period is needed. Ultimately, a mix of these approaches may improve the identification of momentary predictors of LOC eating and overeating, providing novel and personalized opportunities for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and other observers learn how to comply with shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. Punishment inevitably communicates information both about the transgression and about the authority’s motives, and the tradeoff between these inferences shapes when punishment succeeds and how it fails. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three pre-registered experiments (N=1254), and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework, that captures and explains these inferences quantitatively and parsimoniously. Individual differences in ideological authoritarianism were correlated with differing prior beliefs about authorities, and subsequent interpretations of punishment; the model predicted that observing punishment by the authority can entrench these differences and lead to further polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment, and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

In five studies, we used incidental anger induction (imagery or autobiographical recall) that allowed us to induce anger without altering the key elements of the game. Anger was successfully induced but did not increase punishment compared to a neutral control. In three further studies, we used integral anger induction (framing and emotion regulation) to manipulate anger originating within the game.\nRegarding the framing manipulation (Studies 6 and 7), participants reported heightened anger when the dictator took a lot from rather than giving little to the recipient, even though both decisions resulted in the same unfair split. Regarding the emotion regulation manipulation (Study 8), being confronted with a dictator how had taken an unfair share from the recipient, participants reported heightened anger when they were instructed to intensify their emotional reactions rather than to take a neutral stance. In all studies 6 - 8, participants in the conditions with heightened anger punished more than in the respective other condition. This experimental effect was mediated by anger reactions. Together, this series of studies provides evidence for the causal role of anger in third-party punishment, but only if anger originates from the unfair act itself.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-transcendence—connectedness within and beyond the self—is a complex phenomenon theorized to increase with age, but evidence is mixed. This longitudinal study is the first to investigate changes in self-transcendence across late midlife using life story narratives. \nMethod: We tracked self-reported and narrative identity self-transcendence scores of 163 participants as they aged from M=56.4 (SD=0.95) to M=64.5 (SD=0.94). Participants were 64.4% women, 35.6% men; 55.2% White, 42.9% Black, 1.8% interracial/other; median income was $75,000–$100,000; median education was college graduate. \nResults: Self-transcendence narrative themes of closure and self-actualization increased significantly over time, especially between ages 60–65, but self-reported self-transcendence did not change. These trends were not uniform; race by gender groups exhibited distinct trajectories over time.\nDiscussion: Late midlife is seen as ushering in opportunities for increased self-transcendence, especially acceptance of oneself and one’s life. We found some of the strongest empirical evidence of this phenomenon to date. On average, U.S. Black and White adults narrated their life stories with less regret and more satisfaction with self across late midlife. Findings demonstrate the utility of leveraging first-person narrative identity methods to collect and analyze data about rich, complex personality constructs and highlight positive changes associated with late midlife.",

          "abstract": "Conversational partners expect each other to communicate rationally and cooperatively and to contribute relevant and informative utterances. Often however, listeners infer additional meaning over and above the explicit content of an utterance. The present study investigates how speaker characteristics influence inferencing. Experiment 1 (N=205) demonstrates that when produced by knowledgeable speakers utterances such as “the library walls are blue” are more likely to be understood as conveying that the library walls have changed. Experiment 2 (N=205) finds that these inferences are more likely to arise when produced by a speaker who is not typically very chatty; reticent speakers have a higher threshold of what is considered an appropriate conversational contribution. Taken together, the findings from these studies demonstrate that listeners have pervasive expectations of cooperativity and if conversational contributions fail to satisfy this then listeners will engage in sophisticated reasoning to reconcile the mismatch between expectations and input.",

Paradoxically, many also disapprove of lying to children and teach children that lying is unacceptable, suggesting discrepancies between parental lying attitudes, lying behaviors, and teaching about lying. This study explored the alignment and discrepancies between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching across three lie types: other-oriented, self-oriented, and instrumental. Cross-sectional data were collected from parents in the Netherlands (N = 312, 79.8% mothers) and analyzed using correlational and Latent Profile Analyses. Between-parent associations suggested a general alignment between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching, with variations in strength depending on the type of lie. However, within-parent analyses showed that many parents exhibited discrepancies between their lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching. The prevalence and patterns of alignment and discrepancies also differed by lie type. These findings suggest that most parents do not fully practice what they believe or preach, nor do they consistently preach what they believe, reflecting internal conflicts within parents and inconsistencies in moral socialization within families. This study not only expands on the limited understanding of parental alignment and discrepancies between lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching but also proposes novel hypotheses of potential mechanisms underlying parental discrepancies, including parental stress, hierarchical family dynamics, and societal norms.",

          "abstract": "Hunger is a biological drive which can promote unhealthy dietary decisions. Yet, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this effect, and in particular the interactive role of attention and choice processes, remain elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment, in which 70 participants completed a multi-attribute food choice task in hungry and sated states. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, participants’ preference for tasty over healthy food items was amplified by hunger. Attention mediated this influence of hunger, as hungry participants focused more on tasty options, leading them to make less healthy decisions. Rigorous model comparisons revealed that an extension of the recently proposed multi-attribute attentional drift diffusion model best explained choice and response times. According to this model, hunger did not only increase the relative taste compared to health weight of, but it also increased the fixation-related discounting of health but not taste information. Our results suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying unhealthy dietary decisions under hunger are characterized by a nuanced interplay between attention and the significance assigned to the options’ underlying attributes.",

In this pre-registered study we investigated how teaching metapragmatic knowledge in classrooms impacts written irony comprehension in 10-year-old Finnish-speaking children (n = 41, 21 girls) compared to a control group (n = 34, 13 girls). At pre-test, children read ironic and literal sentences embedded in stories while their eye movements were recorded. Next, the training group was taught about irony, and the control group was taught about reading comprehension. At post-test, the reading task and eye-tracking were repeated. Irony comprehension improved after metapragmatic training on irony, suggesting that metapragmatic knowledge serves an important role in irony development. However, the eye movement data suggested that training did not change the strategy children used to resolve the ironic meaning. The results highlight the potential of metapragmatic training and have implications for theories of irony comprehension.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are neural prostheses that restore some level of hearing capacity, albeit\nconveying a less fine-grained speech signal than normal hearing conditions. For example, CIs\nconvey altered fundamental frequency (F0) information, disrupting the perception of lexical stress\n(e.g., distinguishing between the noun CONtent and the adjective conTENT) in languages in which\nthis feature rests on F0 modulations. CI-users can compensate for the degraded nature of the\nacoustic input by exploiting the audiovisual affordances of human communication, weighing more\nheavily the visual information provided by the speaker (e.g., lip movements and gestures). Recent\nstudies showed that, in individuals with normal hearing, the timing of simple up-and-down\nmovements of the hand (i.e., beat gestures) biases lexical stress perception. The present study tested\nif the timing of beat gestures produced by an avatar can bias Dutch lexical stress perception in\nvocoded speech, which simulates CI-hearing conditions. The bias induced by beat gestures in\nvocoded speech was particularly pronounced when hearing an ambiguous or the least frequent\nstress pattern in Dutch. These results suggest that (even artificially generated) beat gestures can be\nused to support speech perception in CI-mediated speech, especially when processing words with\nprosodic features that are less frequent.",

          "abstract": "Developing olfactory expertise is essential in professions like perfumery, where the ability to describe, categorize, and conceptualize odors is critical. This study investigates how academic training during a 1.5-year program at a perfumery school (ISIPCA) shapes olfactory expertise of perfumery students. Forty students were assessed at three time points, focusing on odor description, evocation, recognition, discrimination, and categorization tasks. Results show that training significantly enhanced language abilities related to odor description and categorization. Students developed a richer and more precise vocabulary to characterize odors, aligning more closely with expert’s terminology and contributing to the formation of a shared olfactory lexicon. Semantic similarity within and between students, as well as with expert references, increased, emphasizing the importance of consistent language use in expertise development. Advanced natural language processing and machine learning tools revealed that the richness of verbal descriptions and semantic similarity were strong predictors of expertise acquisition. In contrast, improvements in non-verbal tasks, such as odor discrimination and recognition, were more limited, suggesting that perceptual abilities may require more extensive training or specialized methods. Building on these results, we propose potential enhancements to olfactory training including reinforced language practice, mental imagery exercises, and sensory discrimination tasks, along with personalized training strategies. These findings highlight the central role of language in the emergence of olfactory expertise and the importance of computational methods for optimizing training programs and advancing educational practices in olfactory science",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we use an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model is applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learn to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results show that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

Yet, mindset history is an area of study where little peer-reviewed research exists. This paper aims to address this gap by being the first peer-reviewed study to inquire into the origins, history, and lineage of mindset, to gain a broad understanding of some of the various mindset psychologies that have been developed over time and across generations, as well as to gain a sense of the collective wisdom that is present in the field as a whole. This review found that mindset psychology has a diverse, century-long history of explicit research and practice, with its origin phase taking place between 1908 and 1939, early inquiries occurring between 1940 and 1987, and contemporary bodies of work emerging in, and beyond 1988. This review also identifies some of the lineages of research and practice that are closely related to the origins and history of mindset psychology, some of which span back hundreds and thousands of years. The paper concludes with a reflection on my lived experience as a mindset practitioner and the journey of transformation I moved through to embrace a more holistic and intergenerational understanding. You are invited to become part of the future of mindset psychology by deepening your understanding of its history, and by grounding your work in a comprehensive understanding of the entire field.",

          "abstract": "Perseverative thought (also known as repetitive thought) is an established transdiagnostic mechanism of internalizing psychopathology characterized primarily by its repetitive, difficult to control quality. Subjective difficulty concentrating frequently coincides with perseverative thought and may function as both mechanism and clinical consequence of perseverative thought. Although cognitive theories suggest a bidirectional relationship between perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating, experimental and longitudinal investigations provide mixed evidence. The current study addresses this gap by examining the temporal dynamics between momentary perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (8 surveys per day for 14 days) with 155 adult community participants (compliance ≥ 70%) oversampled for moderate/severe perseverative thought. Multilevel modeling tested concurrent and time-lagged associations. Difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought were concurrently and prospectively related within-person: higher difficulty concentrating at T-1 predicted higher perseverative thought at T, and higher perseverative thought at T-1 predicted higher difficulty concentrating at T. Findings held when controlling for the outcome at T-1. These findings demonstrate covariation between difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought within-person in daily life consistent with theoretical models that predict bidirectional relationships. Directions for future research include probing causality via momentary experimental approaches and exploring potential for clinical translation via just-in-time adaptive interventions.",

It then weighs the utility of social learn- ing against the utility of self-exploration (non-social learning). Using a multi-player treasure hunt game, we show that our model can quantitatively capture human trade-offs between social and non-social learning.

By running counterfactual simulations, the model computes several causal aspects that capture the different ways in which a candidate cause made a difference to the outcome. Logical combinations of these aspects define a semantics for the causal expressions. The model then uses pragmatic inference to decide what word to use in context. We test our model in a series of experiments and compare it to prior psychological accounts. In a set of psycholinguistic studies, we verify the model's semantics and pragmatics. We show that the causal expressions exist on a hierarchy of specificity, and that participants draw informative pragmatic inferences in line with this scale. In the next two studies, we demonstrate that our model quantitatively fits participant behavior in a speaker task and a listener task involving dynamic physical scenarios. We compare our model to two lesioned alternatives, one which removes pragmatic inference, and another which removes semantics and pragmatics. Our full model better accounts for participants' behavior than both alternatives. Taken together, these results suggest a new way forward for modeling the relationship between language and thought in the study of causality.",

          "authors": "Yufang Tu",
          "abstract": "Cheerfulness and positive affect play a critical role in decreasing mortality risks and enhancing well-being and longevity. However, limited research has examined longitudinal relationships between digital technology ownership/adoption (e.g., cell phones and computers) and changes in cheerfulness of older adults (Bixter, Blocker, Rogers, 2018; Seifert, Hofer, &amp; Rössel, 2018). The current study investigated whether cell phone and computer ownership/adoption are related to improved cheerfulness among older people over an 11-year period. Data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) was used. NHATS interviewed participants aged 65 and over since 2011 and annually thereafter. Data from 11 waves were used in this current study, and the sample size was 17355 participants at baseline. Self-rated cheerfulness (on a 5-point scale) was the outcome variable. Longitudinal multilevel modeling examined the following variables as time-invariant predictors: cell phone ownership/adoption (dichotomous yes/no), and computer ownership/adoption (dichotomous yes/no to having a desktop or laptop with Internet access). Covariates were age group, sex, years of education, and self-rated health. Interactions between time and cell phone ownership, and time and computer ownership, were also examined. While cell phone ownership at baseline significantly predicted cheerfulness (p=0.06), it did not significantly interact with time, so it did not predict changes in cheerfulness. However, computer ownership did significantly interact with time to predict increases in cheerfulness (estimate=0.006, p=0.028). This study indicated that potential technology ownership and/or adoption of older adults could predict pleasurable emotions (i.e., cheerfulness) in later life, above and beyond demographic and health factors. We consider the potential to incorporate computer adoption in efforts to promote healthy aging. Future research could examine the potential contributing factors of computer ownership and/or adoption (e.g., online connections to others and the world, enjoyment, convenience in information retrieving sense of safety or security,) and its roles in generating cheerful emotions among older adults.",

          "authors": "Georgia Carter; Frank Keller; Paul Hoffman",
          "abstract": "Word embeddings derived from large language corpora have been successfully used in cognitive science and artificial intelligence to represent linguistic meaning. However, there is continued debate as to how well they encode useful information about the perceptual qualities of concepts. This debate is critical to identifying the scope of embodiment in human semantics. If perceptual object properties can be inferred from word embeddings derived from language alone, this suggests that language provides a useful adjunct to direct perceptual experience for acquiring this kind of conceptual knowledge. Previous research has shown mixed performance when embeddings are used to predict perceptual qualities. Here, we tested if we could improve performance by leveraging the ability of Transformer-based language models to represent word meaning in context. To this end, we conducted two experiments. Our first experiment investigated noun representations. We generated decontextualised (‘charcoal’) and contextualised (‘the brightness of charcoal’) Word2Vec and BERT embeddings for a large set of concepts and compared their ability to predict human ratings of the concepts’ brightness. We repeated this procedure to also probe for the shape of those concepts. In general, we found very good prediction performance for shape, and more modest performance for brightness. The addition of context did not improve perceptual prediction performance. In Experiment 2, we investigated representations of adjective-noun pairs. Perceptual prediction performance was generally found to be good, with the non-additive nature of adjective brightness reflected in the word embeddings. We also found that the addition of context had a limited impact on how well perceptual features could be predicted. We frame these results against current work on the interpretability of language models and debates surrounding embodiment in human conceptual processing.",

          "abstract": "Incivility is largely denounced; yet, our focus on its ills have inhibited our ability to determine when incivility could garner rewards. We  propose that rude actors are conferred more social rewards when they respond to another’s incivility (i.e., retaliatory incivility) relative to when incivility is unprovoked, because retaliatory incivility is seen as more virtuous. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as two samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; sports fans, and employees. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility, far from being disparaged, can be a surprising path to social reward. Our findings have far-reaching practical implications, too, as incivility continues to rise internationally.",

The original experiment demonstrated that inoculation messages could stimulate resistance to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. However, a gap was identified in this study where exposing participants with inoculation scripts did not stimulate motivational threat, the key component that drives the attitude to defend specific beliefs. In this replication study, we also included conspiracy mentality as the moderator variable that might influence the strength of the association between inoculation scripts and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Findings from this study shows that logic-based and fact-based inoculation scripts were perceived differently by participants. Logic-based scripts were perceived as the script that exposed more evidence (fact) compared to fact-based and baseline scripts. Contrary to the original findings, the study failed to replicate the effect of inoculation treatments on anti-vaccine conspiracy attitudes. Instead, prior attitudes on anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, involvement and conspiracy mentality were shown as the significant predictors.",

          "abstract": "Stigmatised groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer-identifying (LGBTQ+) individuals, face increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and mpox (monkeypox). Layered and intersectional stigma limits healthcare access and public health participation, making trust and inclusivity essential in crisis management and risk communication. This study examines the impact of risk communication on LGBTQ+ communities during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, where detailed personal information shared for contact tracing led to further stigmatisation. Through in-depth interviews (N = 21), the research investigates (1) the intersectional and layered stigma and discrimination LGBTQ+ individuals faced; (2) factors that increased stigmatisation, eroded trust, and discouraged public health engagement, such as COVID-19 testing; and (3) strategies that reduced stigma, fostered inclusivity, and encouraged protective health behaviours. Findings reveal that health authorities' insensitivity, the disclosure of identifiable contact tracing data, and the negative portrayals of LGBTQ+ community spaces collectively exacerbated stigma and public health barriers, particularly in culturally homogeneous and structurally inequitable contexts. Conversely, confidentiality, inclusive messaging, and community-driven support were key to fostering trust and participation. The study underscores the urgent need for crisis management strategies that safeguard marginalised groups' rights, dismantle stigma, and prioritise equitable public health outcomes. These insights offer actionable lessons for policymakers and crisis managers navigating public health emergencies in high-stigma contexts.",

          "abstract": "Cloze tests have a long history and have been used to measure various abilities, including intelligence, reading comprehension, and language proficiency. To locate cloze tests within a nomological network of cognitive abilities, we conducted a multi-level random effects meta-analysis covering 110 years of research. Studies were eligible if they provided a measure of association between a cognitive fill-in-the-gap test and any cognitive ability test. We synthesized manifest correlations from 89 studies (N = 37,912, k = 634) and found an average correlation of r = .54 (95% CI [.49, .59], k = 485) with crystallized intelligence, r = .48 (95% CI [.42, .54], k = 69) with fluid intelligence and r =.61 (95% CI [.46, .77], \nk = 32) with general intelligence. While today's application of the typical cloze is to measure reading comprehension, our results revealed a similarly strong association with a broad range of crystallized abilities. None of the key moderators we investigated—text base, administration mode, deletion pattern, and response type—showed a significant effect. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. We conclude by revisiting the origin of the cloze test and highlighting the need for systematic studies on how different cloze test designs affect construct validity. Whereas the meta-analytic database predominantly originates from language research, where cloze tests are entrenched as markers of language proficiency, we propose reframing cloze tests as a versatile intelligence test format—just like multiple-choice tests constitute a testing method—that can be tailored to assess various specific cognitive abilities.",

Previously published meta-analyses of the relationship between integration and cross-cultural adaptation used alternative bivariate operationalisations, producing results of unknown accuracy. Here, using two existing datasets (total k = 57, total N = 7,512) and one highly-powered simulation study (total k = 30,000, total N = 8,981,481), we estimate the average effect of integration on adaptation based on the state-of-the-art multivariate approach to meta-analysing interactions and compare it with four bivariate approaches used in previous meta-analyses: the summative approach, the multiplicative approach, Euclidean distance, and the mid-point split approach. The multivariate results indicate that the interaction effect of heritage-culture and mainstream-culture orientations on adaptation is negligible and largely driven by mainstream-culture orientation. Among bivariate approaches, the midpoint split, which best preserves the interactive nature of integration, produces consistently the smallest effects. We discuss the implications of using these approaches and provide recommendations for operationalising integration in meta-analytical research.",

In a multinational sample from 15 countries (N = 14,978), VJS was positively associated with both general and specific conspiracy beliefs (about vaccines and climate change) within countries, though these associations varied across countries. However, economic, sociopolitical, and cultural country-level factors that might explain the cross-country variability (e.g., GDP, Human Freedom Index, Individualism-Collectivism), including proxies of collective victimhood, did not moderate the studied associations.

          "abstract": "A short period of eye-tracking can produce large amounts of data, making analysis challenging, particularly for clinical applications. Automated methods for extracting basic oculomotor features of saccades, fixation, or blinking are available. For more in-depth oculomotor analysis, manual cleaning and processing is often required. This is time-consuming and variable across individuals and over time, which limits scalability and clinical utility, even if identified oculomotor markers have high potential clinical significance. Automation provides an opportunity to reduce manual labour and improve replicability and precision through algorithmic approaches. Here we outline the design and validation of our SacLab Toolbox for processing data from well-established oculomotor paradigms commonly used in clinical research such as prosaccade, antisaccade, and smooth pursuit tasks. For prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, results showed good agreement between algorithmic and manual cleaning regarding which trials were to be included (86% for prosaccade and 91% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.89 and 0.79, respectively). The toolbox was also tested on data for both tasks from an independent laboratory with a different manual cleaning protocol, and the level of agreement remained high (87% for prosaccade and 93% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.94, respectively). The extent of concordance for the metrics extracted in both methods is discussed. The predominant reason for discrepancy between the manual process and our toolbox related to human error in the manual process. Overall, the results provide support for the benefits of this toolbox for these eye-tracking tasks in clinical and research applications.",

This transmission model implies that BV can erode the social cognitive and affective self-perceptions related to academic performance (self-efficacy), thereby declining actual academic performance. A plausible alternative but under-investigated model is that academic self-efficacy protects against the impacts of BV on students’ academic functioning by moderating the relation between BV and achievement (the buffer model). In this study, we use the Trends in International Math and Sciences Study (TIMSS) United States data to compare these models of BV, math self-efficacy (MSE), and math achievement and differences in this model across student, classroom, and school contexts. Approximately 8,700 students in 270 schools and 500 schools in Grades 4 and 8 each participated in the study. Using Bayesian multilevel multivariate modeling, we compare the buffer and transmission models, finding that in both Grades 4 and 8, the transmission model evidenced the best relative model performance. We discuss the patterns of relations at the individual student level and also examine classroom and school context effects. We discussion implications research and practice as well as limitations and future directions.",

          "authors": "Brent Pitchford; Karen M. Arnell",
          "abstract": "Rewarded stimuli are prioritized by the attentional system. Behavioral performance is improved when the task-relevant dimension is tied to a potential reward but is impaired when the irrelevant dimension is reward related. Within the rewarded Stroop task, the facilitation (reward responsiveness) and impairment (modulation of interference of reward association; MIRA) from reward-associated stimuli are thought to be due to different cognitive processes. In four experiments, we explored whether reward responsiveness and MIRA were influenced by reward magnitude and persisted following reward discontinuation. We manipulated how informed participants were of the stimulus-reward contingency based on whether they received stimulus-reward color instructions and whether or not the stimulus-reward contingency was certain (i.e., one color was always tied to one reward outcome). Results suggest that greater reward magnitude increased reward responsiveness, especially when participants were informed about the stimulus-reward contingency. However, greater impairment (MIRA) by a large versus small reward related color word was only observed when participants had little knowledge of the reward contingency (i.e., no instructions and a more uncertain mapping of stimuli to rewards) or during the extinction phase when reward associated colors were less relevant. These findings highlight the distinction between reward responsiveness to maximize gains and the unintentional prioritization of related but irrelevant information and suggest that reward associations that elicit greater reward responsiveness do not necessarily lead to greater impairment of conflict processing.",

          "authors": "Sylvain Gerin; Michael Andres",
          "abstract": "An unexpected touch on the shoulder immediately triggers an orienting response towards the touched location. Although this reaction seems automatic, localizing a touch in space is more complex than we might think. In the somatosensory cortex, tactile stimuli are initially coded independently of body posture. They are further reported on a cognitive map used to match tactile coordinates with postural information, under the control of the posterior parietal cortex. However, the mechanism underlying such tactile remapping remains unclear. To uncover this mechanism, we recorded the gaze behavior of participants receiving tactile stimuli on the fingers of their right hand in a palm-down or palm-up posture. Tactile stimuli induced horizontal gaze shifts whose direction was determined by the external position of the stimulated finger relative to the middle finger rather than by the external position of the stimulated hand. Comparison of the palm-up and palm down conditions showed that hand rotation reversed the direction of gaze shifts induced by each finger, except for the middle finger for which gaze remained central in both conditions, despite the rightward location of the hand. Eyetracking data thus indicate that spatial attention moves on either side of the axis extending along the middle finger to match the tactile coordinates of fingers with the current hand posture. We conclude that tactile remapping proceeds by shifting attention around a reference defined by the main axis of body parts, and that these shifts occur in an internal representation of the body that keeps track of postural information.",

          "abstract": "Parents and children appear to coordinate their attention to objects in their environment, often via mutual gaze. Children, however, display a novelty bias in interacting with objects, looking longer at novel objects relative to familiar objects. This may allow parents to follow in on their child’s focus of attention and label the novel objects, creating moments of optimal learning. The current study examined this with regard to whether parents are more likely to lead instances of joint attention to novel relative to familiar objects and how children learn from periods of child-led or parent-led joint attention. In particular, we investigated whether (i) parents lead more instances of joint attention when playing with novel relative to familiar objects, (ii) parents preferentially label novel relative to familiar objects, and (iii) children's learning of novel word-object associations is affected by the frequency of labelling and children's sustained attention towards the objects. We found that not only do children lead more instances of joint attention, but, relative to their caregivers, children lead more instances of joint attention to familiar objects relative to novel objects. Parents also appeared to follow in on their child’s attention and labelled familiar objects more often than novel objects. Furthermore, we found no evidence for children’s recognition of the novel word-object associations. Our findings highlight the contingent nature of social interactions between caregivers and infants, with children leading and parents following their child’s lead, especially with regard to more familiar objects in the child’s environment.",

          "abstract": "Effective emergency response teamwork relies on the team members’ mental models, such as having accurate situation awareness and shared mental models of the task, situation and teamwork. The present study developed and field-tested an approach to measure and monitor mental models in-situ. This was done by comparing the information that different team members had about their tasks and compiling the information to a “cohesion report” for the team leader. Data was collected during ongoing training scenarios across 14 training sessions for second-line emergency response teams (N = 134 participant recordings). The study developed and demonstrated a way of measuring cohesion. The study also tested the effect of providing the team leader with the team’s level of cohesion during the training session. Replicating a previous finding, we found that team-membership influenced team members’ shared mental models. This indicates that certain team factors contribute to some teams having higher cohesion than other teams. The experimental manipulation of providing team leaders with access to the cohesion measure improved the team’s mental models (when excluding the team role with most variation). Such tools could be used to evaluate and enhance mental models in emergency response teams, and further research could explore how team leaders could benefit from in-situ monitoring of the team’s mental models.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Nicolas Thomas Vogel; Justine Stang-Rabrig; Philipp Jugert; Birgit Leyendecker; Nele McElvany",
          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

          "abstract": "In opera singing competitions, judges use an overall score to evaluate the singers’ voices and determine their rankings. This score not only guides the singers’ technique and expressiveness, but also serves as a crucial indicator that can significantly influence their careers. However, the specific elements captured by this overall score remain unclear. To address this gap, the present study analyzed opera singing recordings to identify factors that explain the overall score. Ten trained female Japanese singers performed “Caro mio ben” under standardized recording conditions. Four experts evaluated the recorded performances by assigning an overall score of 100 points and rating six vocal attributes: vibrato, resonance, timbre, diction, intonation, and expressiveness. The recordings were then analyzed to calculate the acoustic features, including the singing power ratio (SPR), harmonic-to-noise ratio, and sound pressure level. We developed two linear mixed models: the first regressed the overall score on the subjective vocal attributes, whereas the second predicted the overall score from the acoustic features. Evaluator identity was included as a random effect in both models. The results showed that vibrato was a significant predictor of the overall score in the first model. In the second model, only SPR emerged as a significant predictor. These findings suggest that vibrato, which reflects emotional expressiveness and vocal control, and SPR, which indicates the relative power in the high-frequency band (2–4 kHz) and signifies a voice clearer than the accompaniment, are key factors in explaining the overall score in opera singing.",

Questions like these motivated Green and Hummel (henceforth, G&amp;H) in their seminal 2006 article in JEP:HPP, “Familiar Interacting Object Pairs Are Perceptually Grouped.” At first glance, the subject matter of G&amp;H’s article appears quite simple and mundane: actions like pouring coffee, cutting bread, or unlocking a door. Yet hidden at the core of such everyday routines are specific functional relationships between objects, such as a carafe and a mug, a knife and a loaf, or a key and a lock. G&amp;H’s article was a turning point in a long but sparse tradition of research that had considered such relations from a vision-science perspective (e.g., Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000; Ullman, 1984), as it steered many researchers — ourselves included — to explore questions in the burgeoning field now known as “relation perception.” This field advances the idea that, beyond objects, features, and locations, the visual system spontaneously or automatically extracts and represents relations — properties that specify interactions or connections between objects, rather than each object’s individual characteristics. In this perspective article, we outline new aspects of human visual perception that have been the focus of this field, and the major outstanding questions that remain.",

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why only humans speak and why only they perform music and, if both abilities are evolutionary related, how and why they eventually diverged. Human linguisticality and musicality are certainly biologically and behaviorally rooted in animal communication, cognition, and socialization. A hypothetical musilanguage must have constituted a transition stage from animal signal systems to the syncretic coexistence of coming-to-be language and music. Growing complexity of social networks and technologies essential for survival of Homo created the need to regulate social relations and secure effective transmission of important information, causing musilanguage to split into proto-music and proto-language, with different specialization (despite considerable overlapping of their usage functions). Proto-music focused on expressing emotional content through singing vocalizations (e.g., motherese) and rhythmic use of instruments (knapping). Proto-language focused on accurate and timely transmission of referential information. Further differentiation of musical genres, each forming its own repertory of expressions, turned proto-music into music. In parallel, proto-language evolved into language under pressure to continuously convey increasingly complex and dense information streams between growing numbers of participants - to accommodate demographic and technological growth. Increased prosociality promoted the emergence of more complex social structures and behaviors, cooperation, and codependency, directing music and language towards greater divergence and complexity.",

          "abstract": "Background. Adolescence is a unique developmental period associated with increased emergence of psychopathology. Negative life event (NLE) exposure is robustly linked with adolescent psychopathology and prior work suggests that emotion regulation may mediate this relation. However, research incorporating experiences of gender diverse (GD) adolescents has been lacking, despite elevated rates of NLEs and psychopathology in GD individuals. This study examined potential gender differences in the relations between NLE exposure, ER, and psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Methods. Data from 1955 cisgender boys, 1614 cisgender girls, and 194 GD adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study were utilized for the current study. Participants reported NLE exposure via Life Event Scale (LES) and ER difficulties via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Parent Report (DERS-P) in early adolescence (M (SD) age = 12.93 (.27) years), followed by their internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms via Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Brief Problem Monitor-Youth (BPM-Y) one year later (M (SD) age = 14.12 years). Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling and conditional process modeling. Results. GD youth had higher rates of NLE exposure and more ER difficulties and psychopathology symptoms than cisgender peers. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and all psychopathology symptoms for all gender groups. Gender moderated direct relations between NLE exposure and youth-report internalizing symptoms such that relations were stronger for cis girls and GD youth compared to cis boys. Conclusions. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and psychopathology symptoms in a large sample of adolescents in the United States. Higher negative life experience exposure, ER difficulties, and psychopathology symptoms for GD youth compared to peers warrant additional study on ways to support these adolescents.

Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive concept of secondary psychosis spectrum disorder, demonstrating that stress reactions and depression serve as a common foundation for these disorders. Their basis transitions from minimal introversion through normal state to maximal introversion along fluctuations in introversion, i.e., introversion spectrum, and these disorders arise secondarily from this spectrum.

          "authors": "Chad Van Iddekinge; Jake Harrison; Rong Su; Robert Ployhart",
          "abstract": "Attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory proposes that “the people make the place” (Schneider, 1987) and has served as a foundation for many areas of organizational research. In this review, we take stock of the ASA literature to identify what we know and what we need to know about ASA processes and their effects on organizations. Based on a review of over 6,000 articles that cited ASA, we identified 321 studies that used the theory as a basis for their hypotheses. However, only 77 (24%) of those studies actually tested an aspect of the theory. For example, although ASA is an organizational-level theory, most studies used the theory to test phenomena at other levels, such as individuals, teams, or occupations. Among studies that did test the theory, very few directly assessed its core hypotheses. For instance, only one published study directly tested the central hypothesis that ASA processes lead to homogeneity. Moreover, some parts of the theory were not supported. As an example, although the theory suggests that ASA processes will reduce organizational effectiveness, several studies found that homogeneity was associated with better performance. Although the amount of empirical support for ASA theory was uneven, we believe it still has the potential to help understand organizations and the people that make them. To that end, we provide an agenda for future research that prioritizes how to best test ASA’s core hypotheses. We also highlight connections between ASA and other theories and literatures that examine similar phenomena to inspire future research opportunities.",

This study examined the clinical utility of a clinician-rated global evaluation of personality functioning based on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). A total of 346 German mental health professionals provided LPFS ratings for 1,403 patients, stratified by thirty-eight diagnostic categories, including, but not limited to, personality disorders. Clinicians reported on each patient’s treatment outcome, recommended optimal treatment components for each patient, and provided their perspective on the clinical utility of the LPFS and its potential risk of stigmatizing patients. On average, clinicians rated the LPFS as \"very useful\", its applicability as \"rather easy\", and the risk of patient stigmatization as \"rather low\". Logistic and ordinal Bayesian multilevel models indicated meaningful associations between LPFS ratings and clinical judgments, highlighting its effectiveness in conveying clinical impressions. Greater impairments in personality functioning were associated with poorer clinician-rated treatment outcome and poorer prognosis. In addition, associations with optimal treatment components yielded a nuanced pattern, with clinicians typically recommending short-term outpatient psychotherapy for patients with mild impairments, long-term psychotherapy for patients with moderate to severe impairments, and intensive care interventions (e.g., outreach care, assisted living) for those with extreme impairments. The results indicate that German mental health professionals consider the LPFS to be a clinically useful concept and that it may be valuable in organizing and communicating information about patients.",

Using 32 virtual interior spaces with curved boundary types and varying architectural variables (size, light, texture, and color), 15 participants assessed aesthetic qualities while their brain activity was recorded via electroencephalography (EEG). Results reveal that alpha and beta oscillations play distinct roles in processing aesthetic judgments and architectural variables, while theta oscillations show no such differentiation.

The work we propose here focuses on whether and how children’s judgements of moral praiseworthiness may be affected by cost incurred by the agents. Recent work has revealed developmental changes in how children consider physical and psychological costs in their judgments of moral praiseworthiness. However, this question has only been examined among US children, and little is known about how much the findings can be generalized across cultures. In this paper, we examine the consideration of different types of costs (psychological, physical) in moral evaluation by children in China, and compare to the US data. We choose to study children in China not only because it is a non-WEIRD culture, but also because recent work has suggested that there are cultural differences between the US and China in terms of how children conceptualize desire inhibition and self-control. This research will have implications for research on children’s moral cognition across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Despite its key role in the development, maintenance, and treatment of anxiety disorders, the detailed mechanisms of human avoidance learning remain elusive. To contribute to the understanding of avoidance learning, we here report on a novel approach-avoidance conflict task that requires participants to learn associations between complex visual stimuli and combined appetitive and aversive stimuli while actively engaging with the experimental environment. Using an agent-based behavioral modeling approach, we implemented and validated an extensive set of control, heuristic, Rescorla-Wagner learning-based, and hybrid agents. We show that a Rescorla-Wagner learning-based agent with a prior expectation bias parameter best explains the learning behavior of 50 participants. As such, our work complements current research on the computational underpinnings of approach-avoidance behavior by showing paradigm and task instruction dependencies in approach-avoidance-relevant associative learning and contributes to the overall aim of achieving a more fine-grained understanding of the etiology of anxiety disorders.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive decline in older adults is a growing global concern. Exergames, which combine physical exercise with cognitive training in an interactive digital environment, have shown promise in mitigating this decline.\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of exergames in improving cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults through a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM, and IEEE databases for studies published between January 2014 and June 2024. Studies were included if they: (1) involved participants with mean age ≥60 years, (2) implemented exergame interventions in community settings, (3) included pre- and post-cognitive assessments, and (4) provided sufficient data for effect size calculation. The analysis examined effects across different populations (healthy, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia), exergame types, and various cognitive domains.\nResults: Ten studies comprising 690 participants (EXG=350, Control=340) met inclusion criteria. The pooled effect size was 0.1327 (95% CI 0.066-0.199, P&lt; .001), indicating significant positive effects of exergames on cognition. Subgroup analyses revealed that individuals with MCI showed the largest benefits (g=0.256, 95% CI 0.11-0.40, P=.003), followed by cognitively healthy older adults (g=0.132, 95% CI 0.03-0.23, P=.013). Aerobic exergames (g=0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.22, P=.002) and combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames (g=0.291, 95% CI 0.12-0.46, P=.002) demonstrated significant effects, but not in non-aerobic exergame. Among cognitive domains, memory (g=0.179, 95% CI 0.03-0.33, P=.021) and processing speed (g=0.337, 95% CI 0.31-0.37, P&lt; .001) showed significant improvements.\nConclusions: Exergames provide significant cognitive benefits for community-dwelling older adults, with particularly strong effects for individuals with MCI. Combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames appear most effective. These findings support the use of exergames as a practical tool for cognitive enhancement in community and residential environments.",

          "authors": "Povilas Karvelis; Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu",
          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. This brief report aims to clarify this misunderstanding through simple data simulations. To make the argument more intuitive, we consider two illustrative cases: comparing patients versus controls and comparing two groups formed by a median split. We demonstrate that reliability attenuates observed group differences just as much as it attenuates individual differences. Given that dichotomizing/grouping continuous data - which is implicit in many group differences analyses - leads to a loss of statistical power, low reliability proves to be even more problematic for studying group differences. While here we focused on cognitive sciences and psychiatry, our findings are quite general and could inform many other areas of research, including education, sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, etc., where test-retest reliability is rarely taken into account.",

          "abstract": "Infants with congenital heart disease are now frequently surviving into adulthood but experience poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including reduced cognitive and executive functioning. There is a critical need to link brain development to modifiable disease characteristics so we can offer intervention when the brain is most plastic. Brain dysmaturation in CHD is frequently experienced and likely impacted by the iron deficiency CHD infants experience from their disordered blood flow. Iron deficiency is significant for cognitive and executive function because striatal iron stores are needed for dopamine synthesis. Here we assess, with MRI, how striatal iron in CHD is different than in controls and how iron is impacted or related to various clinical characteristics. We find CHD participants had less iron than controls, indicating iron deficiency impacts deposition. Single ventricle infants had even less than other CHD participants post operatively. Within the CHD group, increased iron, through iron recycling, can also be indicative of cell death from hypoxia or ischemia.  We find additional evidence for this relationship, where increased iron was related to poor APGAR scores pre-surgery. Iron supplantation is a promising intervention to optimize cognitive and executive function in CHD.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) collection methods like experience sampling methodology can place significant burdens on participants, potentially resulting in careless responding, such as random responding. Such behavior can undermine the validity of any inferences drawn from the data if not properly identified and addressed. Recently, a confirmatory mixture model (here referred to as fully constrained latent Markov factor analysis, LMFA) has been introduced as a promising solution to detect careless responding in ILD. However, this method relies on the key assumption of measurement invariance of the attentive responses, which is easily violated due to shifts in how participants interpret items. If the assumption is violated, the ability of the fully constrained LMFA to accurately identify careless responding is compromised. In this study, we evaluated two more flexible variants of LMFA—fully exploratory LMFA and partially constrained LMFA—to distinguish between careless and attentive responding, in the presence of non-invariant attentive responses. Simulation results indicated that the fully exploratory LMFA model is an effective tool for reliably detecting and interpreting different types of careless responding while accounting for violations of measurement invariance. Conversely, the partially constrained model struggled to accurately detect careless responses. We end by discussing potential reasons for this.",

          "abstract": "Prior research documents strong associations between higher educational attainment and improved health and well-being outcomes. Studies on educational differences, such as those conducted by OECD and UNESCO, have focused on national trends in educational attainment. The current study builds on existing international surveys of educational attainment by providing supporting evidence for educational attainment in several countries and novel evidence for various other countries and territories. For example, results demonstrate that country-level aggregate estimates of the proportion of the population attaining a tertiary education from the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) aligns fairly well with existing estimates from the OECD, with a correlation of r=0.83 with 95% CI (0.57, 0.94), and the estimates for new countries may be a lower bound for the estimated proportion of the population attaining a tertiary education. A major additional contribution of this article is providing insights into the contexts of educational attainment across countries by reporting which sociodemographic groups tend to have attained higher levels of education and how these trends differ across countries. We examined these differences by evaluating the sociodemographic contexts (e.g., age, marital status, employment status) in which achieving more education is found using data from 202,898 participants across 22 countries that were post-stratified to be nationally representative within each country.",

However, this body of research has focused primarily on Germanic languages. It remains unclear whether this same computational process is also observed in Chinese, a writing system characterised by less systematicity of the meanings and functions of constituents across compounds. We quantified the ease of integrating the meanings of Chinese constituent characters into a compositional compound meaning using a computational model based on distributional semantics. We then showed that this metric predicted sensibility judgements on novel compounds (Study 1), lexical decision latencies for rejecting novel compounds (Study 2), and lexical decision latencies for recognising existing compounds (Study 3). These results suggest that a compositional process is routinely involved in Chinese compound processing, even in tasks that do not explicitly require meaning combination. Our results also suggest that a generic statistical learning framework is able to capture the meaningful functions of Chinese compound constituents. We conclude by discussing the advantages of routine meaning construction during compound processing in Chinese reading.",

Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, no reflection test priming effects were detected. Rather, an unexpected philosophical reflection effect emerged: making the philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

Fifteen established  RT therapists conducted therapy according to a standardized protocol. Questionnaires were submitted anonymously to a commercial company that analysed the results and reported to an independent assessor.  \nResults\nRT proved to be highly effective. The BSI-53 total score decreased from a value of 0.91 to 0.48 after 4 months of treatment. A score of 0.48 is close to the value of 0.42 measured in a representative sample of the Dutch population. For most study participants a single session was already satisfactory. Hedges g for this study was 0.95 indicating a large clinical effect. All 9 domains of the BSI-53 questionnaire showed a similar decrease in score, the mean decrease was 47%. Application of unbiased machine learning to all study parameters revealed that a positive effect of the therapy could be predicted from a few BSI-53 questions with high accuracy (AUC: 0,87). \nLimitations \nThis blinded outcome trial was not compared to an active control.\nConclusion\nThis study shows that RT is a highly efficacious treatment modality.

Religion is a cross-cultural human universal, yet explicit markers of religiosity have rapidly waned in large parts of the world in recent decades. We explored whether intuitive religious influence lingers, even among nonbelievers in largely secular societies. We adapted a classic experimental philosophy task to test for this intuitive belief in belief among people in eight comparatively nonreligious countries: Canada, China, Czechia, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and Viet Nam (total N = 3804). Our analyses revealed strong evidence that (1) people intuitively favor religious belief over atheism and that (2) this pattern was not moderated by participants’ own self-reported atheism. Indeed, (3) even atheists in relatively secular societies intuitively prefer belief to atheism. These inferences were robust across different analytic strategies, and across other measures of individual differences in religiosity and religious instruction. Although explicit religious belief has rapidly declined in these countries, it’s possible that belief in belief may still persist. These results speak to the complex psychological and cultural dynamics of secularization.",

          "abstract": "Older autistic adult literature is sparse, and little is known about the aging autistic population. However, recent evidence suggests an increased prevalence of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) diagnosis in the autistic population. It may initially be assumed that autistic individuals are genetically more likely to develop PD, but genetic studies do not provide evidence for a strong link between the two conditions. Alternatively, an underappreciated body of evidence may shed light upon why autistic individuals score highly on PD diagnostic criteria: movement differences in autism have been likened to those of PD. Given that PD diagnosis is primarily movement-based, if it is indeed the case that autistic movement appears parkinsonian, this may facilitate autistic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for PD. If validated, this theory could have serious implications for the specificity of the PD diagnostic process. The current review article sets out the evidence for high rates of PD diagnosis and parkinsonism in the autistic population and subsequently questions why this might be the case, making reference to genetic and behavioural similarities between autism and PD. Overall, this article highlights a potential diagnosis issue that should be further researched and considered by clinicians when conducting diagnostic assessments of movement disorders.",

If a Bayesian system under extremes of precision saw such a causational paradox, it would be forced to decide was that familiar but strange action done by me but controlled from afar or was that action from the environment and directed against me. Thus, the widespread positive symptoms become bayes optimal resolutions of the paradox as it pertains to thoughts, sensations, movement, and affect. A self-reinforcing process leads to a failure state when beliefs and perceptions become one; if a Bayesian system believes both my actions cause reality and reality causes my actions then it must do nothing, catatonia.\nThe paper demonstrates how a healthy model could itself become high precision as an initially adaptive response to trauma. By doubling down on our beliefs about the world we can prevent trauma from changing the way we view it, but as the world keeps changing, a tsunami of high precision spreads from the initial schism.",

If a Bayesian system under extremes of precision saw such a causational paradox, it would be forced to decide was that familiar but strange action done by me but controlled from afar or was that action from the environment and directed against me. Thus, the widespread positive symptoms become bayes optimal resolutions of the paradox as it pertains to thoughts, sensations, movement, and affect. A self-reinforcing process leads to a failure state when beliefs and perceptions become one; if a Bayesian system believes both my actions cause reality and reality causes my actions then it must do nothing, catatonia.\nThe paper demonstrates how a healthy model could itself become high precision as an initially adaptive response to trauma. By doubling down on our beliefs about the world we can prevent trauma from changing the way we view it, but as the world keeps changing, a tsunami of high precision spreads from the initial schism.",

          "abstract": "Deliberation, commonly referred to as \"System 2\" thinking, is a core component of popular dual-process models of reasoning. However, its precise conceptualization has received limited attention. In this perspective, I present a basic framework and organizing principles to think of deliberation and avoid problematic misconceptions. I argue that deliberation should be understood as multifunctional, serving multiple, complementary purposes. I highlight four such functions (response control, response generation, response justification, and regulation), identify challenges in our current understanding, propose guiding principles, and discuss critical outstanding questions. The resulting framework should help advance the theoretical and empirical study of deliberation in the coming years.",

          "abstract": "How best to explain the properties and capabilities of embodied minds? The conventional paradigm holds that living beings are to be understood as the sculpted products of genetics and environment, which determine form and function of the brain as the unique seat of intelligence. Some provision is made for emergence and complexity, as additional “facts that hold” about networks, circuits, and other components of life. Here, I present a sketch of a framework and research roadmap that differs from this view in key aspects. First, the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms and functionality indicate fundamental symmetries between the self-construction of bodies and of minds, revealing a much broader view of diverse intelligence across the agential material of life beyond neural substrates. Second, surprising competencies (not just complexity or unpredictability) in systems that have not had a history of selection for those abilities suggest an additional input into patterns of body and mind that motivates a research program on a latent space of patterns ingressing into the physical world. Emphasizing the principles of continuity and pragmatism, and using morphogenesis as a tractable model system in which to develop these ideas, I explore the implications of the following ideas: (A) Evolution favors living forms that exploit powerful truths of mathematics and computation as affordances, which contribute as causes of morphological and behavioral features.  (B) Cognitive patterns are an evolutionary pivot of the collective intelligence of cells; given this symmetry between neuroscience and developmental biology, I propose that the relationship between mind and brain is the same as the relationship between mathematical patterns and the morphogenetic outcomes they guide. (C) Many mathematicians, and a non-mysterian approach to science in general, suggest that these patterns are not random facts to be merely cataloged as “emergence” when found, but rather can be systematically discovered within a structured, ordered (non-physical) space. Therefore, I hypothesize that: (1) instances of embodied cognition likewise ingress from a Platonic space, which contains not only low-agency patterns like facts about triangles and prime numbers, but also higher agency ones such as kinds of minds; (2) we take seriously for developmental, synthetic, and behavioral biology the kinds of non-physicalist ideas that are already a staple of Platonist mathematics; (3) what evolution (and bioengineering, and possibly AI) produces are pointers into that Platonic space – physical interfaces that enable the ingression of specific patterns of body and mind.  This provides a new perspective on the organicist/mechanist debate by explaining why traditional computationalist views of life and mind are insufficient, while at the same time erasing artificial distinctions between life and machine, since both are in-formed by diverse patterns from the latent space. I sketch a research program, already begun, of using the tools of the fields of synthetic morphology and diverse intelligence to map out key regions of the Platonic space. Understanding the mapping between the architecture of physical embodiments and the patterns to which they point has massive implications for evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, AI, and the ethics of synthbiosis with the forthcoming immense diversity of morally important beings.",

          "abstract": "Many controversies arise from disagreements between moral rules and utilitarian cost-benefit reasoning (CBR). We show how moral learning from consequences can produce individual differences in people's reliance on rules versus CBR. In a new paradigm, participants (total $N=2328$) faced realistic dilemmas between one choice prescribed by a moral rule and one by CBR. Participants observed the consequences of their decision before the next dilemma. Across four experiments, we found adaptive changes in decision-making over 13 choices: Participants adjusted their decisions based on which decision strategy (rules or CBR) produced better consequences. Using computational modeling, we showed that many participants learned about decision strategies in general (metacognitive learning) rather than specific actions. Their learning transferred to incentive-compatible donation decisions and moral convictions beyond the experiment. We conclude that metacognitive learning is an important mechanism of moral learning and that individual differences in morality may be surprisingly malleable to learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "Psychopathy is a longstanding construct of great clinical interest, marked by traits such as callousness, manipulativeness, and impulsivity. The Elemental Psychopathy Assessment (EPA; Lynam et al., 2011) was developed to anchor the measurement of psychopathy within the Five Factor Model of personality. This preregistered study presents a meta-analytic review of the EPA’s construct validity, examining its relations at the domain and total levels with other psychopathy measures, personality traits, and psychopathological outcomes. Drawing from 50 studies across 38 manuscripts, over 3,500 effect sizes were analyzed. EPA Antagonism showed strong convergent validity with constructs like TriPM Meanness and SRP-III Callous Affect, while EPA Disinhibition was closely linked to impulsivity-related traits such as TriPM Disinhibition and SRP-III Erratic Lifestyle. EPA Narcissism was associated with interpersonal dominance and manipulation, whereas EPA Emotional Stability generally showed positive relations with adaptive traits and outcomes. Antagonism and Disinhibition emerged as the core psychopathy traits, while the role of Emotional Stability remained uncertain due to its varied associations with maladaptive outcomes. Moderator analyses revealed differences across sample types and EPA versions. These findings offer meta-analytic support for the EPA’s validity, highlighting the centrality of Antagonism and Disinhibition, and the complexity of Emotional Stability in the psychopathy construct.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peritraumatic dissociation is thought to contribute to posttraumatic symptoms like intrusions and memory disturbances. However, trauma-analogue studies that examined effects of experimental dissociation-induction on intrusions and memory were inconclusive. To better understand this, a necessary first step is to more systematically compare various induction methods.\nObjective: We evaluate different dissociation-induction-methods regarding their effectiveness, the intensity and quality of induced dissociation, and their effects on intrusions and memory in a pre-registered randomized-controlled online experiment.\nMethod: Healthy participants (N=213) were randomized to one of six dissociation-induction-methods: audio-photic stimulation, hypnotic-suggestion, or spiral-staring, each for one-minute or three-minute duration. Participants also completed two control conditions: a picture task as our primary non-dissociation-inducing control condition (control condition 1) and dot-staring as a second dissociation-inducing control condition closely resembling baseline or resting-state conditions in many experimental designs (control condition 2). Each condition was followed by an aversive (“trauma”) film. Peri-film dissociation intensity and quality, as well as film-specific intrusion-load and memory performance, were assessed. Dissociation-induction-methods were deemed successful if they elicited dissociation levels &gt; control condition 1 and ≥ control condition 2. Only successful dissociation-induction-methods were examined further. \nResults: Three-minute of hypnotic-suggestion and one-minute of spiral-staring successfully induced dissociation, while other methods did not meet the effectiveness threshold. Hypnotic-suggestion led to a greater increase in dissociation intensity than spiral-staring. However, dissociation induced by spiral-staring was perceived as more uncontrollable and unpleasant. Results did not support an adverse effect of dissociation induction or dissociation intensity on intrusion-load but on self-reported and objectively assessed memory performance.\nConclusions: Results indicate that hypnotic-suggestion and spiral-staring constitute effective, easy-to-implement, neuroimaging-compatible dissociation-induction-methods that allow to study dissociation in the laboratory. The present data did not support the notion that dissociation fosters intrusion formation but provides causal support for effects of dissociation on trauma memory.",

For internal structure validity, the fit indices of a series of confirmatory factor analyzes were evaluated for the one, two, and three-factor models. For validity with respect to other constructs, the SD-R constructs were correlated with the purity/sanctity subconstruct of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. For reliability, the ordinal alpha and the omega coefficient were used. Acceptable fit indices were obtained for the two and three oblique factor models, acceptable reliability indices for the core disgust and animal reminder scales was obtained, and small and significant positive correlations were obtained between the contamination and animal reminder factors with the purity/sanctity scale of the MFQ. The DS-R is an instrument with acceptable psychometric properties, although some adjustments must be made related to the reliability of the contamination scale, added to the exploration of other variables that correlate to each of its constructs to obtain greater validity in relation to other variables.",

We use these data to probe the hypothesis that complex concepts arise as syntactic combinations of simpler ones in a language of thought. First, we confirm our previous report of a regular and reproducible profile of decrease in frequency with number size, with local peaks for round numbers. Second, we show that frequency varies with the simplicity of the decomposition of a number into small prime factors. Third, we demonstrate that the entire frequency profile, including its overall decrease and local peaks, can be modeled by a grammar of algebraic combinations, whereby each number arises from addition and multiplication operations on smaller numbers. Those findings strengthen the hypothesis that compositionality in a language of thought underlies the emergence of exact number concepts.",

Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive concept of secondary psychosis spectrum disorder, demonstrating that stress reactions and depression serve as a common foundation for these disorders. Their basis transitions from minimal introversion through normal state to maximal introversion along fluctuations in introversion, i.e., introversion spectrum, and these disorders arise secondarily from this spectrum.

          "authors": "Juha Silvanto; Yoko Nagai",
          "abstract": "A major question in cognitive neuroscience is understanding the neural basis of mental imagery, particularly in cases of its absence, known as aphantasia.  While research in this field has focused on the role of sensory domains, we propose that the key to understanding imagery lies in the intertwining of sensory processing and autonomic responses. Interoception plays a crucial role in mental imagery by anchoring experiences in first-person physiological signals, providing a self-referential perspective, and grounding the imagery in the body while also enabling its emotional aspects. Moreover, interoception contributes to the sense of agency and volitional control, as well as body schema—key hallmarks of voluntary mental imagery. Therefore, imagery should be approached as an integrated phenomenon that combines sensory-specific information with interoceptive signals. At the neural level, this process engages the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), regions vital for synthesizing information across cognitive, emotional, and physical domains, as well as for supporting self-awareness. From this perspective, aphantasia may reflect a suboptimal functioning of the insula/ACC, which can account for its associations with deficits in autobiographical memory, emotion perception, and conditions such as autism and dyspraxia.",

          "abstract": "We encounter situations each day that require our auditory system to quickly interpret our surroundings. Auditory scene perception involves complex processes that allow us to identify both the setting and the objects within a scene, which are essential for decision-making, and situational awareness. While there is substantial evidence for distinct cortical regions and pathways supporting visual scene and object recognition, far less is known about how the brain processes complex auditory scenes and objects. This study aimed to determine whether distinct mechanisms underlie auditory setting and object identification and whether these mechanisms interact to aid perception. Participants listened to 200 natural auditory scenes of varying durations (1, 2, and 4 sec) and identified the setting (e.g., café) as well as the objects (e.g., talking, espresso machine, music) within each scene. Overall, performance was highest on the object identification task, and there was a significant interaction between task and scene duration, with a greater benefit of longer durations for the object identification task. Different low- and mid-level acoustic features of the scenes predicted performance on the two tasks. These results suggest that the auditory system employs distinct (and potentially interactive) computations for setting and object identification, allowing for quick interpretation of complex, real-world auditory scenes. The interaction between task performance and scene duration further suggests object and setting identification may operate on different temporal scales; objects might require more time for accurate individuation, while settings may be recognized more efficiently through global properties of scenes, such as openness or naturalness.",

The snow is likely produced by spontaneous (non-stimulus driven) activity in the visual system, but the specific neural mechanisms are not known. We hypothesize that the activity producing visual snow is present early in the visual pathways. Here, we tested whether it reaches motion selective areas, including V5/MT, using the motion aftereffect.\nMethods: Eleven participants with visual snow syndrome (VSS) adapted to high contrast drifting gratings on the left and right sides of a central fixation point, moving in opposite directions. After adaptation, participants judged motion visible in their visual snow viewed on a blank screen, pressing a button when the motion of the snow on both sides looked the same. The duration of the adapter gratings varied across trials (1.6 - 45 sec). In a control condition, we presented a stationary square wave pattern during the test period to confirm that participants with VSS experienced a typical motion aftereffect for external stimuli. \nResults: Following adaptation, most participants (10/11) reported that their visual snow moved in the opposite direction of the adapting gratings, as expected for the motion aftereffect. Longer adapter durations resulted in longer-lasting illusions and this relationship was linear on a log-log axis, consistent with the motion aftereffect literature. \nConclusions: Visual snow is susceptible to the motion aftereffect, suggesting that the neural activity producing visual snow reaches motion selective neurons involved in perceiving the motion aftereffect, which are believed to include V5/MT. If visual snow arises before area V5/MT, our findings suggest this activity is propagated forward through the visual pathways.

Longer adapter durations resulted in longer-lasting illusions and this relationship was linear on a log-log axis, consistent with the motion aftereffect literature. \nConclusions: Visual snow is susceptible to the motion aftereffect, suggesting that the neural activity producing visual snow reaches motion selective neurons involved in perceiving the motion aftereffect, which are believed to include V5/MT. If visual snow arises before area V5/MT, our findings suggest this activity is propagated forward through the visual pathways. Pinpointing the neural origins of visual snow may facilitate the development of novel treatment approaches targeting specific visual brain areas or networks.",

          "abstract": "In psychological assessment, vocabulary tests are commonly used as reliable and efficient indicators of crystallized intelligence, as retrospective proxies for premorbid intelligence, and as measures of language proficiency. However, many of the widely used German vocabulary tests are outdated, proprietary, and lack a clear rationale for item selection. To address these limitations, we developed a new, openly available vocabulary test: the Next-Generation Open Vocabulary Assessment (NOVA). Therefore, we first constructed 110 multiple-choice vocabulary items with support from ChatGPT and administered them to 1,052 German-speaking adults using a multiple-matrix design, along with a declarative knowledge test for validation purposes. In a second step, we used Ant Colony Optimization to compile two parallel 30-item short forms, optimized for reliability and item difficulty and discrimination. The resulting tests assessed vocabulary unidimensionally and reliably, covered a large ability range, and correlated strongly with declarative knowledge. We provide a Shiny app for the calculation of standard values based on individual test results. Additional analyses revealed that 57% of the variance in item difficulties could be explained by word frequency and word length, which may be particularly useful for streamlining the future development of vocabulary tests.",

          "authors": "Isaac Ahuvia; Jeremy William Eberle; Jessica L. Schleider; Bethany Teachman",
          "abstract": "Introduction. Some have suggested that labeling oneself as having clinical anxiety may promote avoidant coping, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, the construct of anxiety identity centrality (seeing one’s anxiety as relatively important to one's self-concept) has rarely been assessed, and its relationship with avoidant coping has not been investigated. Methods. In a sample of 1,234 high-anxiety adults, we analyzed the relationship between anxiety identity centrality and situational and experiential avoidance (preregistration: https://osf.io/g8qh9/). A Bayesian ordered probit regression framework was used to model the relationships between ordinal variables. Results. As hypothesized, anxiety identity centrality showed small-to-medium positive correlations with situational (r = .42, p &lt; .001) and experiential (r = .12, p &lt; .001) avoidance. After controlling for anxiety symptom severity, anxiety identity centrality was still positively associated with situational (b = 0.34, 95% credible interval [0.22, 0.48]) and experiential (b = 0.13, 95% CI [0.03, 0.28]) avoidance. Discussion. Anxiety identity centrality is a correlate of avoidant coping that can be measured with a single-item ordinal measure. The present study is cross-sectional; we cannot infer causal or temporal relationships between anxiety identity centrality and avoidant coping. Future research should investigate their causal relationship.",

          "authors": "Frances Wang; Deepa Thomas; Brooke S. G. Molina; Shirley Duong",
          "abstract": "Background: Loss of control over alcohol use is a component of impaired control and an important premorbid risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Prevailing assessments of loss of control over alcohol use have important limitations. For instance, many items imply intentions to limit drinking (e.g., drink more than intended?), which would not be endorsed by individuals who exhibit uncontrolled drinking with no intentions to moderate their behavior. Existing items have also been shown to be frequently endorsed when drinking limits are exceeded for non-compulsive (e.g., social) reasons. Thus, we developed and validated a novel loss of control survey whose content focused more on the thoughts, feelings, and motivations underlying loss of control and deemphasized intentions to limit drinking. Methods: 29 adults diverse in racial and ethnic identities and balanced on sex assigned at birth completed cognitive interviews to test the interpretability of devised loss of control items and to refine the item set. A quantitative survey was administered to 246 adults (55.7% White, 44.3% Black, 41.6% assigned male sex, 58.4% assigned female sex) to test the validity of refined items. The resultant loss of control items (the Loss of Control-Alcohol [LOSS-A] scale) were administered alongside measures of alcohol problems (AUDIT, DSM-5 AUD symptom scores), heavy drinking frequency, alcohol treatment history, and existing impaired control measures. Results: The LOSS-A scale showed excellent psychometric properties that did not differ by race or assigned sex. It showed incremental predictive utility for several alcohol outcomes over existing loss of control and impaired control measures. Conclusions. The final eight-item LOSS-A scale is a brief and valid way to measure loss of control across a wide range of drinkers that addresses limitations of existing measures.",

          "abstract": "Previous fMRI studies have documented links between internalizing problems in youth and brain functional connectivity of the default (DN), frontoparietal (FP), and salience (SA) networks. Characterized by a large symptom heterogeneity and comorbidity, it remains elusive how individual internalizing symptoms relate to DN, FP, and SA connectivity. Leveraging a large population-based sample of adolescents (N = 2426; mean age = 14.1 years) and an integrated network modelling approach, we identified symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and functional connectivity and explored sex and timing-specific differences in these links. Our findings revealed small negative associations between self-reported feelings of worthlessness and guilt and DN within-network connectivity and positive associations between fearfulness and FP within-network connectivity. Moreover, sadness and fearfulness were positively associated with DN-SA between-network connectivity. Exploratory analyses revealed no significant sex differences but indicated that DN within-network connectivity around age 10 was negatively associated with self-reported worthlessness at age 14. Our findings show symptom-specific associations between internalizing problems and brain functional circuitry in youth and highlight the complex interplay of symptoms and brain networks.",

          "abstract": "Missing data are a common challenge in multilevel designs, and multiple imputation (MI) is often used for handling them. Past research has shown that multilevel MI provides an effective treatment of missing data, so long as the imputation model takes the multilevel structure and the intended analyses into account, and modern methods have been developed that can accommodate even complex types of analyses. However, multilevel MI can be difficult to apply in practice, where the multilevel structure is often not very pronounced or not of immediate interest in the analysis. In these applications, existing methods can become unstable and often struggle to provide reliable results. In this article, we introduce a fully conditional specification approach to multilevel MI that combines single-level imputation methods with group means (GM) or adjusted group means (AGM) to accommodate the multilevel structure. Based on a theoretical investigation and three simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of these methods in different applications, including applications with balanced designs, unbalanced designs, and larger numbers of variables. Our findings suggest that the AGM approach—though not the GM approach—performs well in most of the scenarios we investigated and can even outperform conventional approaches to multilevel MI in challenging applications. We also provide an illustrative example for the implementation of these methods in a simulated example, and we discuss the implications of our findings for practice.",

          "abstract": "Decades of research have shown that skill learning often unfolds exponentially — people improve rapidly early on, and then performance gradually levels off. Given how important expectations of learning are for actual learning, we explored whether people accurately intuit this canonical time course of skill learning. Across six preregistered experiments (n = 500), we find that people correctly predict that skill learning curves (error reductions over time) on a novel visuomotor task will follow an exponential decay function, both for an imagined naïve player and for themselves, before engaging with the task. Moreover, people are sensitive to conditions that merit exponential learning within a bounded time frame and only predict these curves when an imagined player puts in effort and the task is not too difficult. However, people systematically misestimate specific parameters of skill learning (e.g., initial and average performance, and rate of improvement), which relates to reduced affect at the beginning of learning. Critically, these negative effects can be ameliorated by practice: Providing people with minimal practice reduces their prediction errors and, in turn, buffers them from negative feelings at the beginning of learning.",

The current consensus, rooted in computational functionalism, proposes that consciousness should be ascribed based on a principle of computational equivalence. The objective of this opinion piece is to criticize this current approach and argue in favor of an alternative “behavioral inference principle”, whereby consciousness is attributed if it is useful to explain (and predict) a given set of behavioral observations.

This study examined associations between suicidal ideation and emotional-processing difficulties, coping strategies, resilience, and cognitive functioning in individuals with moderate-severe TBI.\n\nMethod: Data from 106 individuals with moderate-severe TBI were analyzed. Suicidal ideation and emotional distress were assessed using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Participants also completed measures of emotional lability and detachment (Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorders [CAT-PD]), coping (Coping Scale for Adults), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and cognitive functioning, including subjective (CAT-PD, Brief Rating of Executive Function) and objective measures (Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone). Spearman’s correlations and structural equation modeling were used to examine psychological and cognitive correlates of suicidal ideation.\n\nResults: Suicidal ideation was positively associated with emotional lability, emotional detachment, non-productive coping, and self-reported cognitive problems, and negatively associated with resilience. Structural equation models indicated that emotional distress accounted for 76–100% of these associations. Conversely, suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with adaptive coping or objective cognitive performance.\n\nConclusions: Emotional processing, non-productive coping strategies, low resilience, and self-reported cognitive problems are linked to suicidal ideation in individuals with moderate-severe TBI, primarily through their associations with emotional distress. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and its underlying contributors in suicide prevention for this population.",

Importantly, technological artefacts not only reflect human cognition but actively extend it, shaping a reciprocal relationship between mind and environment. This perspective may have broad implications, from clinical applications and education to innovation policy, suggesting new avenues for diagnostic technologies and inclusive design. Thus, we call for interdisciplinary research to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying technological cognition and to explore how different technologies engage distinct cognitive and neural pathways.",

          "abstract": "Based on claims that changes in women’s hormone levels influence their mating psychology, the Congruency Hypothesis proposes that women in relationships who change their hormonal contraceptive use after meeting their partner will report lower sexual satisfaction with their partner than women who do not change their oral contraceptive use. However, findings from studies testing this hypothesis have reported mixed results. Consequently, we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies on this topic. For the thirteen effects sizes from studies using between-subjects designs, the pooled correlation between congruency and sexual satisfaction was not statistically significant (r = .04, p = .091) and a Robust Bayesian meta-analysis found that the null hypothesis was moderately favoured over the Congruency Hypothesis (BF10 = 0.123, i.e., BF01 = 8.13, r = .003). For the four effect sizes from studies using within-subjects designs, the pooled correlation between congruency and sexual satisfaction was statistically significant (r = .18, p = .001) and a Robust Bayesian meta-analysis found weak evidence in favour of the Congruency Hypothesis (BF10 = 1.55, r = .09). Although the effect of congruency on sexual satisfaction may be statistically significant in some analyses, across all analyses, results indicated that the magnitude of the congruency effect was small. Thus, we suggest that it is unlikely that changes in oral contraceptive use have a substantial (i.e., large) effect on women’s sexual satisfaction on average. Still, some women might experience congruency effects and the overall evidence remains uncertain. More work, ideally in the form of randomized controlled trials, is needed to find a definite answer for research questions relying on the Congruency Hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Harry Shirley",
          "abstract": "The Buddhabrot, a unique rendering of the Mandelbrot set, has long captivated mathematicians and artists alike, yet its deeper symbolic significance remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of fractosymbolism—the intersection of mathematical fractals and archetypal imagery—and argues that the Buddhabrot serves as both a mathematical and symbolic representation of the Unus Mundus, the primordial unity of psyche and matter. Through Mandelbrot Mapping and Symbolic Amplification (MMSA), we analyze how the Buddhabrot mirrors fundamental archetypes found across mythology, religion, and art.\n\nBy mapping the Buddhabrot onto the stages of psychological individuation as outlined by Neumann and Jung, we reveal striking parallels between fractal structures and the evolution of consciousness. Each phase of individuation, from the uroboric unconscious to the realization of the Self and beyond, finds a geometric counterpart within the Buddhabrot’s recursive forms. Furthermore, we examine historical symbols—such as the mandala, the winged scarab, and the sacred heart—demonstrating how they share fractosymbolic qualities with the Buddhabrot.\n\nFinally, we explore the Buddhabrot’s potential role as a fundamental structure underlying both psyche and cosmos. From its alignment with ancient spiritual traditions to its resemblance to the cosmic microwave background, we propose that the Buddhabrot represents a hidden order that bridges mathematics, myth, and consciousness. If fractals describe the natural world, and symbols encode psychological meaning, then the Buddhabrot may be the missing link—a fractal archetype emerging at the intersection of science and the sacred.",

          "title": "Ingressing Minds: Causal Patterns Beyond Genetics and Environment in Natural, Synthetic, and Hybrid Embodiments",
          "authors": "Michael Levin",
          "abstract": "How best to explain the properties and capabilities of embodied minds? The conventional paradigm holds that living beings are to be understood as the sculpted products of genetics and environment, which determine form and function of the brain as the unique seat of intelligence. Some provision is made for emergence and complexity, as additional “facts that hold” about networks, circuits, and other components of life. Here, I present a sketch of a framework and research roadmap that differs from this view in key aspects. First, the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms and functionality indicate fundamental symmetries between the self-construction of bodies and of minds, revealing a much broader view of diverse intelligence across the agential material of life beyond neural substrates. Second, surprising competencies (not just complexity or unpredictability) in systems that have not had a history of selection for those abilities suggest an additional input into patterns of body and mind that motivates a research program on a latent space of patterns ingressing into the physical world. Emphasizing the principles of continuity and pragmatism, and using morphogenesis as a tractable model system in which to develop these ideas, I explore the implications of the following ideas: (A) Evolution favors living forms that exploit powerful truths of mathematics and computation as affordances, which contribute as causes of morphological and behavioral features.  (B) Cognitive patterns are an evolutionary pivot of the collective intelligence of cells; given this symmetry between neuroscience and developmental biology, I propose that the relationship between mind and brain is the same as the relationship between mathematical patterns and the morphogenetic outcomes they guide. (C) Many mathematicians, and a non-mysterian approach to science in general, suggest that these patterns are not random facts to be merely cataloged as “emergence” when found, but rather can be systematically discovered within a structured, ordered (non-physical) space. Therefore, I hypothesize that: (1) instances of embodied cognition likewise ingress from a Platonic space, which contains not only low-agency patterns like facts about triangles and prime numbers, but also higher agency ones such as kinds of minds; (2) we take seriously for developmental, synthetic, and behavioral biology the kinds of non-physicalist ideas that are already a staple of Platonist mathematics; (3) what evolution (and bioengineering, and possibly AI) produces are pointers into that Platonic space – physical interfaces that enable the ingression of specific patterns of body and mind.  This provides a new perspective on the organicist/mechanist debate by explaining why traditional computationalist views of life and mind are insufficient, while at the same time erasing artificial distinctions between life and machine, since both are in-formed by diverse patterns from the latent space. I sketch a research program, already begun, of using the tools of the fields of synthetic morphology and diverse intelligence to map out key regions of the Platonic space. Understanding the mapping between the architecture of physical embodiments and the patterns to which they point has massive implications for evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, AI, and the ethics of synthbiosis with the forthcoming immense diversity of morally important beings.",

          "abstract": "Attentional control - also called executive functions or cognitive control - refers to our ability to maintain and implement a goal and goal-relevant information in the face of distraction. There is growing evidence that attentional control cannot be established as a psychometric construct with the measures used so far. This asks for other ways of measuring attentional control. Early research has used structural equation modeling to extract attentional control from working-memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance and manipulation of information) and short-term memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance of information). Attentional control was first modeled as the residual variance of working memory after controlling for short-term memory. Second, it was modeled as the common factor across working-memory and short-term memory measures, with higher loadings for working-memory measures. After a systematic search, we found three datasets in which both models could be systematically tested. Moreover, we determined the robustness of the results by bootstrapping 5000 correlation matrices from the original correlation matrix and by estimating both models using these simulated correlation matrices. Across the datasets, the models could be successfully estimated, but they were not fully and exactly replicated. Moreover, all these model estimations were not robustly observed when the 5000 simulated correlation matrices were used. Therefore, attentional control could not be reliably extracted from working-memory tasks at the latent-variable level. These findings further strengthen the case against a psychometric construct of attentional control, increasing the challenges in the conceptualization of this construct.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity loss demands urgent action, and protected area are one of the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation measure. While conservation efforts are known to be driven by economic and political factors, there is an absence of literature addressing the potential role played by behavioural traits at the population level. We investigated how population-level behavioural traits influence the proportion of terrestrial protected area by using large-scale cross-cultural surveys and geospatial data from 75 countries. We show that behavioural traits explain more variation in protected area coverage than economic indicators alone. Furthermore, trust is negatively associated with protected area coverage at the country level, suggesting that high-trust societies rely more on informal conservation practices. These findings challenge conventional models focused on economic and governance drivers and highlight the need for policies that align with population behaviours. Integrating behavioural insights into conservation planning could unlock more effective biodiversity conservation strategies in the era of environmental changes.",

          "abstract": "Black men may be especially prone to drinking-to-cope or drinking to alleviate negative affect in early adulthood due to a unique confluence of factors that impact drinking patterns in emerging and early adulthood (e.g., Zapolski et al., 2017). The current study examined these associations using a prospective longitudinal design among Black men in rural Georgia. We hypothesized that across time, increases in depression would be associated with decreases in state hope and perceived life chances. Similarly, we anticipated changes in depression, state hope, and perceived life chances would be associated with a greater frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking episodes. Black men (N=504) in rural communities were assessed at four timepoints across emerging adulthood. We examined between and within subject effects across time between harmful alcohol consumption and depression, state hope, and perceived life chances, using regression latent curve models with structured residuals (LCM-SR; Curran et al., 2014) and random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM; Hamaker et al., 2015).\nGenerally, depressive symptoms, hope, and perceived life chances were not prospectively associated with frequency of alcohol consumption or binge drinking episodes. Binge drinking episodes were associated with later increase in depressive symptoms, but symptoms were not associated with increases in binge drinking. These findings suggest that despite seeing increased depressive symptoms, decreased hope, and decreased life chances over time, these mood-related factors were not associated with drinking behaviors among this sample of rural Black men. Future research should explore alternative mechanisms that may drive consumption patterns in this marginalized population.",

          "authors": "Sean Devine; Carl F. Falk; Ken A. Fujimoto",
          "abstract": "Bayesian multilevel modeling techniques have become increasingly popular. As researchers leverage these techniques, information criteria—fit indices which provide information about a model’s fit to the data—play an important role in disambiguating between competing models. The deviance information criteria (DIC) has been historically popular and is computationally easy, yet newer indices such as Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and an approximation to the leave-one-out cross-validation information criterion (LOO-CV) have been recently introduced. However, researchers may be unsure about which criteria to use, as to our knowledge, a systematic evaluation of these Bayesian criteria in a multilevel context has not yet been undertaken. Complicating this matter, computation of these indices using the so-called marginal likelihood is sometimes recommended, yet use of the conditional likelihood is easier and more readily found in some popular software. In addition, researchers frequently select the model with the lowest value of the information criteria, discounting the presence of uncertainty in calculating the criteria. Across two extensive simulation studies meant to mimic experimental and observational studies, we investigate the model selection accuracy of conditional and marginal versions of DIC, WAIC, and LOO-CV; we also compare a lowest wins strategy versus one that considers model selection uncertainty. In general, indices based on the marginal likelihood had a slight advantage and performed similarly to each other, whereas under the conditional likelihood WAIC and LOO-CV outperformed DIC. In addition, we argue that a selection strategy that simply chooses the model with the lowest information criteria may result in overfitting.",

We review the latest research that converges to suggest that when children receive, witness, or provide help, there can be unintended negative consequences—for example, receiving help can produce feelings of incompetence. The discussion of the paper grapples with how to balance the negative and positive outcomes of helping behavior, with an eye toward promoting children’s wellbeing and social cohesion in society.",

However, there is limited empirical research on which factors explain individual differences in intervention gains. Based on suggestions from recent personality development theories and intervention frameworks, we 1) examined whether achieved personality state changes during an intervention explain differences in the degree of trait change and 2) whether individual differences in change could be explained by participants’ motivation and intervention engagement. The study was based on a 12-week personality intervention with a total of 1,523 participants. Personality states were assessed on a daily and weekly basis, whereas personality traits were measured with self- and observer-reports at the beginning and end of the intervention. Participants who deviated in their states most strongly from their initial trait level also changed more in their trait levels in the corresponding direction. Both state and trait changes were stronger if participants a) were more committed to their change goal, b) believed more strongly in the changeability of personality traits, c) completed more implementation intentions, and d) enjoyed their implementations more (i.e., reinforcement). In contrast, the strength of the desire to change, expected attainability, opportunities identified for practice, difficulty of the implementation intentions, and preference for self-reflection or behavioral practice did not systematically predict change. Taken together, these findings provide support for most of the central components of volitional change theories and can help guide future individualized intervention efforts.",

Here, we develop a measure, g-distance, which considers model adequacy as the extent to which models exhibit a similar range of behaviors to the humans they model. We define g as the combination of two easilyinterpretable dimensions of model adequacy: accommodation and excess flexibility. We apply this measure to five models of an irrational learning effect, the inverse baserate effect (IBRE). g-distance identifies two models, a neural network with rapid attentional shifts (NNRAS) and a dissimilarity-similarity generalized context model (DGCM18), that outperform the previously most supported model (EXIT). We show that this conclusion holds for a wide range of beliefs about the relative importance of excess flexibility and accommodation. We further show that a pre-existing metric, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), misidentifies a known-poor model of the IBRE as the most adequate model. Along the way, we discover that some of the models accommodate human behavior in ways that seem unintuitive from an informal understanding of their operation, thus underlining the importance of formal expression of theories. We discuss the implications of our findings for model evaluation generally, and for models of the inverse base-rate effect in particular, and end by suggesting future avenues of research in computational modeling.",

Socio-demographics, health information, and questionnaire data was collected using online surveys. Eligible women were invited to provide a blood sample. We ran latent profile (LPA) and subsequent analyses in R using RStudio.\nOutcomes: Indicator variables in the LPA included sexual arousal and desire domains of the Profile of Female Sexual Function and testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.\nResults: Analyses resulted in a pattern of three latent classes. Classes reporting relatively lower and higher sexual arousal (LPA-derived Means and 95% CIs: -0.79 [-1.24; -0.34] and 0.62 [0.51; 0.72]) did not differ significantly in sex steroid concentrations (testosterone: -0.21 [-0.38; -0.03] and -0.33 [-0.47; -0.20]; DHEA: -0.47 [-0.57; -0.37] and -0.26 [-0.39; -0.13]; androstenedione: -0.36 [-0.50; -0.22] and -0.39 [-0.49; -0.29]), while the class reporting relatively medium arousal (-0.11 [-0.31; 0.08]) showed the highest testosterone, DHEA and androstenedione concentrations (testosterone: 0.8 [0.60; 1.01]; DHEA: 0.99 [0.76; 1.23]; androstenedione: 1.08 [0.88; 1.29]). There were no significant differences in sexual desire between classes (-0.08 [-0.23; 0.06]; 0.00 [-0.13; 0.14]; 0.10 [-0.09; 0.30]) differing significantly in sex steroid concentrations (-0.69 [-0.80; -0.58], -0.04 [-0.15; 0.07], 0.94 [0.71; 1.16] for testosterone) nor associations between the sex steroid concentrations and degrees of sexual desire.\nClinical Implications: These findings cast further doubt on the utility of measuring sex steroids for diagnosing female sexual dysfunction in premenopausal eumenorrheic women, even when considered in combination.\nStrengths &amp; Limitations: We analyzed a large community sample and controlled for potentially biasing factors. We analyzed sex steroid concentrations determined with gold standard methodology. Excluding women with early menopause and menstrual dysfunction might have resulted in finding three, rather than more, latent classes.\nConclusion: Testosterone and pre-androgen profiles do not clearly identify premenopausal eumenorrheic women with low sexual arousal and desire.",

Studies 1 and 2 draw on federal data of over 30,000 offenders and find that participants’ estimates of moral motives for crime predict higher recidivism while estimates of material motives predict the opposite. Studies 3 and 4 use economic games and find that when players take money from others for moral reasons, they are less deterred by the imposition of fines. Studies 5-8 use judgment studies of a variety of crimes and find that these effects hold when motives are manipulated but actions are kept constant, they persist at higher levels of consequences, and they are unique to moral motivation.

Decades of work explores how people both produce and detect randomness, revealing profound non-random biases and heuristics in our mental representations of randomness. But how is randomness realized in the mind? Do individuals have a “one-size-fits-all” conception of randomness that they employ across different tasks and timepoints? Or do they instead use simple context-specific strategies? Here, we develop a model that reveals individual differences in how humans attempt to generate random sequences. Then, in three experiments, we reveal that random behavior is stable across both tasks and time. In Experiment 1, participants generated sequences of random numbers and one-dimensional random locations. Behavior was remarkably consistent across the two tasks. In Experiment 2, we gave participants both a random-number-generation and a two-dimensional random-location-generation task, such that the tasks diverged in structure. We again observed stable individual differences across tasks. Finally, in Experiment 3, we collected data from the same participants as in Experiment 2, but one year later; we found stable individual differences across that span. Across all experiments, we find idiosyncratic behaviors that are stable across tasks and time. Thus, we suggest that a trait-like randomness generator exists in the mind.",

          "authors": "Yijun Qian; Anna Schwartz; Yichi Zhang; Arthur F. Kramer; Leanne Chukoskie",
          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive decline in older adults is a growing global concern. Exergames, which combine physical exercise with cognitive training in an interactive digital environment, have shown promise in mitigating this decline.\nObjective: To assess the effectiveness of exergames in improving cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults through a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM, and IEEE databases for studies published between January 2014 and June 2024. Studies were included if they: (1) involved participants with mean age ≥60 years, (2) implemented exergame interventions in community settings, (3) included pre- and post-cognitive assessments, and (4) provided sufficient data for effect size calculation. The analysis examined effects across different populations (healthy, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia), exergame types, and various cognitive domains.\nResults: Ten studies comprising 690 participants (EXG=350, Control=340) met inclusion criteria. The pooled effect size was 0.1327 (95% CI 0.066-0.199, P&lt; .001), indicating significant positive effects of exergames on cognition. Subgroup analyses revealed that individuals with MCI showed the largest benefits (g=0.256, 95% CI 0.11-0.40, P=.003), followed by cognitively healthy older adults (g=0.132, 95% CI 0.03-0.23, P=.013). Aerobic exergames (g=0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.22, P=.002) and combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames (g=0.291, 95% CI 0.12-0.46, P=.002) demonstrated significant effects, but not in non-aerobic exergame. Among cognitive domains, memory (g=0.179, 95% CI 0.03-0.33, P=.021) and processing speed (g=0.337, 95% CI 0.31-0.37, P&lt; .001) showed significant improvements.\nConclusions: Exergames provide significant cognitive benefits for community-dwelling older adults, with particularly strong effects for individuals with MCI. Combined aerobic and non-aerobic exergames appear most effective. These findings support the use of exergames as a practical tool for cognitive enhancement in community and residential environments.",

          "abstract": "This study extends the loss function-based parameter estimation method for diagnostic classification models proposed by C. Ma, de la Torre, et al. (2023, Psychometrika) to consider prior knowledge and uncertainty of sampling. To this end, we integrate the loss function-based estimation method with the generalized Bayesian method. We establish the consistency of attribute mastery patterns of the proposed generalized Bayesian method. The proposed generalized Bayesian method is compared in a simulation study and found to be superior to the previous nonparametric diagnostic classification method—a special case of the loss function-based method. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to real data and compared with previous parametric and nonparametric estimation methods. Finally, practical guidelines for the proposed method and future research directions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used to assess decision-making deficits in clinical populations. Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Pedophilic disorder has been linked to neurodevelopmental differences in diagnosed individuals. One common biomarker for atypical neurodevelopment are elevated levels of atypical handedness as individuals with several neurodevelopmental disorders show increased levels of left-, mixed-, or non-right-hand preference. A few primary studies have indicated that atypical handedness could also be more prevalent in pedophilia and child sexual offenders. However, individual studies are prone to sampling biases. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature on this topic is still missing. In this pre-registered study, we performed a meta-analysis on k = 14 studies that were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (until January 2025). These 14 studies measured hand preference in n = 1245 individuals with pedophilia and child sexual offenders and n = 5703 controls. We found evidence against higher rates of atypical handedness irrespective of handedness classification using random-effects frequentist and robust Bayesian meta-analyses. There was no evidence of heterogeneity nor small-study or publication bias across analyses. These results suggest that atypical handedness is not suited to serve as a biomarker for pedophilia.",

          "abstract": "Personality has been related to cognitive interest and performance in primates, including humans, yet this relationship remains unexplored in the genus Gorilla. In our study, we investigated the association between personality, interest, and performance in a cognitive enrichment task among 17 zoo-housed western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) from two zoos. We conducted personality assessments using the Gorilla Behavior Index questionnaire, which comprised 25 adjectives. Exploratory factor analysis using a Robust Unweighted Least Squares revealed six statistically significant factors with acceptable standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 75% of the variance. The experimental task involved retrieving food from a tube presented in a social context. Each session consisted of a 30-minute recording of a gorilla performing the task, with a total of three sessions per individual. We included interest and success variables in the analysis. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyse each predictor variable. We found positive associations between Fearfulness and Extraversion and the variables of interest, but we did not find a link between the personality factors and task success. Additionally, we observed that repeated exposure to the task led to decreased interest but improved performance. Furthermore, females showed greater efficiency in food extraction over time compared to males. Thus, our findings suggest that personality and sex play an important role in explaining gorillas' interest and performance in solving cognitive enrichment tasks.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, a core symptom of mood disorders such as depression, is marked by diminished pleasure and motivation for rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, like the 4-arm bandit (4AB), show limited sensitivity to reward-processing impairments associated with anhedonia. Here, we developed and validated a modified 3-arm bandit (3AB) task designed to reduce cognitive load while retaining sensitivity to reward and punishment learning. Following this validation, 1,000 participants were pre-screened with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG). Participants scoring above 2 on SHAPS and below 45 on DARS were classified as anhedonic, while those scoring 0 on SHAPS and above 55 on DARS were classified as non-anhedonic, resulting in 111 anhedonic and 95 non-anhedonic individuals who completed the 3AB task. Modelling results revealed no significant group differences in reward learning rate (p = 0.23), punishment learning rate (p = 0.37), reward sensitivity (p = 0.28), or punishment sensitivity (p = 0.46). Additional assessments of win-stay/lose-shift strategies and reaction times also showed no significant differences. Bayes Factor t-tests provided moderate -to-strong evidence for the null hypothesis, with BF01 values of 3.36, 5.14, 4.97, and 5.96 for each of the above parameters, respectively. These findings indicate either that anhedonia does not impair reward and punishment learning or that the 3AB task lacks the sensitivity to detect such differences. By simplifying the task structure while maintaining core learning mechanisms, the 3AB task provides a novel approach for studying reward processing, challenging the notion that anhedonia impairs reward sensitivity and indicating that this learning mechanism may remain intact.",

          "abstract": "Evaluating the quality of primary studies is a key step in meta-analyses in psychology. This step is aimed at reducing the risk of bias and establishing the validity of the inferences drawn from the meta-analytic findings. However, the extant body of research offers little guidance on how to represent and incorporate primary study quality (PSQ) in meta-analyses, and some common procedures, such as creating sum scores from a set of quality indicators, often lack the backing from measurement models. Addressing these issues, we present a tutorial that guides researchers in their analytic decisions and approaches to represent and incorporate PSQ in their meta-analyses. Specifically, we describe, review, and illustrate approaches to (a) represent PSQ by single or multiple quality indicators or aggregated scores; (b) examine the moderator effects of PSQ; and (c) test the sensitivity of moderator effects to PSQ. We illustrate these approaches and present a step-by-step tutorial with analytic code for researchers’ guidance. We also encourage meta-analysts to take a measurement perspective on representing PSQ if multiple quality indicators are aggregated into a quality score. Moreover, we argue for conducting moderator sensitivity analyses to obtain more evidence on the impact of PSQ in a meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "Rational constructivism is a contemporary theory of cognitive development that aims to reconcile the existence of sophisticated cognitive abilities early in ontological development with the profound cognitive change we observe across childhood. The theory draws inspiration from computational cognitive science to describe children’s reasoning, concept learning, and revision as a form of probabilistic inference. Like previous constructivist theories, rational constructivism proposes that children generate and revise their own theories using the knowledge they obtain from the world; this information is integrated by using efficient, probabilistic inferential learning mechanisms to tweak or radically revise their existing theories, representations and beliefs. The paper begins with a general overview of the theory of rational constructivism, covering its key theoretical commitments and predictions. We then describe how it accounts for the empirically observed patterns of both incremental and radical developmental change observed in childhood and discuss the cognitive mechanisms of those conceptual changes. Finally, we sketch out a general computational framework for it, and address open questions and directions for future research.",

Sleep has been well established to play a role in the consolidation of newly learned information and schema-based information but has yet to be explored within mathematical cognition.

The sleep condition watched the lecture at 9pm, completed an immediate recall task to explain the concept, then a second recall task 12h later at 9am. The wake conditions watched the lecture at 9am, completed an immediate recall task then a second recall task 12h later at 9pm. Written responses were then assessed using a comparative judgement task by subject experts. Across all three experiments, results showed that participants in the sleep condition retained their knowledge from the immediate recall to 12 hours later, while in the wake condition, participants’ knowledge declined significantly between sessions. These results suggest that sleep may be involved in an important process of maintenance of learned information of mathematical concepts.",

This systematic review aimed to synthesise what is known about the impact of EDS on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and associated moderating factors, following a change in diagnostic boundaries.\nMethods: Fifteen databases, grey literature and reference lists were systematically searched. A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and guidelines for narrative synthesis. Findings were grouped according to outcomes, moderating factors, and measurement instrument. A further synthesis aligned outcomes with domains of HRQoL. Risk of bias was addressed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool.  \nResults: Eight quantitative studies met eligibility criteria. Findings indicate substantial impact on HRQoL, particularly in how symptoms are perceived and functional status. However, how HRQoL is measured and researched are influencing these results. \nConclusion: This review suggests key aspects of how HRQoL is experienced remain underexplored and underreported. Issues of methodological rigour raise further concerns around the usefulness of study findings. Further research is required to clarify how aspects of HRQoL are prioritised and experienced and how they can best be measured, to improve management of this debilitating condition.\nPROSPERO registration number CRD42022318979",

We use a complex systems perspective to examine the interplay of several psychological factors and their unique relationships with chronic pain disability. We analyzed two cross-sectional datasets (N = 935 and 1366) collected at a pain clinic and rehabilitation center in Belgium. These included self-reported data on pain-related fear and avoidance beliefs, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pain intensity and disability. We used Gaussian Graphical Models to examine conditional associations between these variables, their relative importance (having more/stronger relationships), and how they are moderated by pain-related fear and pain intensity. Our analyses revealed highly interrelated networks, with many unique, positive associations between the included factors. Depressive symptoms and pain intensity were most strongly related to disability. Fear-avoidance beliefs featured less prominently than previous studies looking at this concept in isolation suggested. Apart from differences in two associations between samples, and two moderation effects of pain intensity in one sample, the network structure was similar across the two samples. Overall, our results show that psychological factors related to chronic pain and disability have intricate interrelations, highlighting the complexity of chronic pain and the need to study its many components in relation to each other. The consistency across the two samples provides encouraging evidence that the results reflect a stable pattern within this complex system.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Predictors of life satisfaction vary between people and potentially also within people across the life span. However, little is known about when changes in the association between domain satisfaction and overall life satisfaction occur. In the present study, we focused on the last years of work before retirement when it is often assumed that workers become less attached to their workplace and focus on other areas of life instead, such as leisure activity. Our aim was to test if the associations between domain satisfaction (job and leisure) and overall life satisfaction change in the years before retirement. \nMethods. We applied a time-to-retirement metric in a latent growth curve analysis to longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 3,401) to investigate whether the within-person associations between (1) job and overall life satisfaction and (2) leisure and overall life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. \nResults. We found that job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. \nDiscussion. We interpret the results as evidence for a potential pre-retirement work disengagement, either to support post-retirement adjustment, or to protect from negative work experiences. We highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment.",

A rational innovator should be state-sensitive, effectively switching to exploitation when the best available idea reaches some standard. We tackle innovation with a discovery-by-recombination game under additive reward growth, and compare the optimal state-dependent policy with a state-independent policy. Our experiment reveals that participants made state-dependent decisions, exploring more in rounds with early successes, albeit being told of the same true success probability. In contrast, the optimal state-dependent policy switches to exploitation earlier. This suggests that participants' state-sensitivity may be driven by ad-hoc subjective probabilities. Participants also deviated from optimality through excessive exploration, switching multiple times between exploration and exploitation, and their switching points also differed from the theoretical optimum.",

It was found that at present, most mindset theories seldom acknowledge or compare themselves to one another, nor do they examine how all theories belong to a coherent and comprehensive theory of mindset. It is recommended more studies are undertaken to better understand all of the theories that co-exist in the mindset field and how these theories relate to people’s direct experience. You are invited to participate in this process of shared learning, so that the mindset field can develop more coherent and comprehensive theories of mindset.",

          "abstract": "We present the Oscillating Field Perturbation (OFP) model, a quantum model that provides a quantitative account of the Yerkes-Dodson law concerning the relationship between arousal and performance. Inspired by neural models, OFP conceptualizes cognitive control as an oscillating field that perturbs a quantum system, and represents arousal as the ``gain'' induced by this field. By integrating OFP with the Multiple Particle Multiple Well (MPMW) framework, we demonstrate that OFP successfully explains how the shape of the Yerkes-Dodson law varies with task difficulty and familiarity, consistent with empirical findings. To the best of the authors' knowledge, OFP is the first model to provide a unified account of the empirical variations in the shape of the Yerkes-Dodson law.",

          "abstract": "The extraordinary public policy response to COVID-19 in Australia saw extended lockdowns in some Australian states and territories, some of the longest in the world. This paper seeks to understand the effect these periods of lockdown had on the mental health of those living through them. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design we study two different periods one in 2020, one in 2021 where there were some jurisdictions (Victoria, New South Wales and in the second period the Australian Capital Territory) experiencing extended lockdowns while the rest of the country was largely living life as normal with no or low local transmission of the virus. While there seems to have been an effect in this first period, we do not find a statistically measurable effect in 2021 as even though distress rose during the lockdown period, it rose similarly among those jurisdictions out of lockdown as well. We speculate this may be because of adaptation to stress, growing cases in control jurisdictions, or the vaccine roll-out providing a concrete endpoint for lockdowns.",

          "abstract": "Although uncontrollability is the core feature of perseverative thought that best accounts for its relationship to psychopathology, other features – for example, valence and content – have also been identified as potentially clinically-relevant in their own right. We describe results from a proof-of-concept study that examined the extent to which major underlying features of worry could be used to predict which of three common cognitive regulatory strategies (mindful acceptance; focused attention meditation; and thought suppression) would be helpful for regulating that worry. N = 40 adults selected for high trait worry (80% also met criteria for one or more DSM-5 anxiety-related diagnoses) generated and provided feature ratings for three idiographic thought topics. Participants then attempted to control each worry using each of the three strategies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a within-subjects design (k = 468 observations). We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to test preregistered hypotheses regarding the extent to which each of five empirically-derived underlying dimensions of a worry (uncontrollability; negative valence; self-focus; apprehension; and social-memory content) could be used to predict which strategy would be most efficacious for regulating that worry. We did not find support for our preregistered hypotheses; however, in exploratory analyses, we found that mindfulness-based strategies were particularly effective compared to thought suppression for thoughts rated as higher (versus lower) in uncontrollability. Future research should test these principles in larger samples, using more diverse expressions of perseverative thought.",

          "abstract": "The distinction between intention and foresight is critical for law and morality. For example, a military officer deciding to bomb a target while foreseeing civilian casualties raises questions about whether these deaths were intended or merely foreseen. This study aimed to disentangle the neural correlates of intention and foresight using a novel paradigm. Twenty-five participants completed a task inspired by the game Frogger, where hitting objects could be desirable (earning points) or inconsequential. Outcomes varied by likelihood (high vs. low) and actuality (hit vs. miss), resulting in a 2×2×2 design: intention (present/absent) × outcome (hit/miss) × expectedness (expected/unexpected). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude was larger when participants intended to hit objects, while the P3 potential increased for unexpected outcomes. However, neither signal exclusively reflected intention or foresight; the FRN also indexed expectedness, and the P3 reflected intention. To address this overlap, we used effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering, which identified a widespread brain activity pattern that may better dissociate intention from foresight. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural processes underlying complex decision-making, with potential applications in ethical and legal frameworks.",

Participants engaged either in 90 minutes alternating between video gaming and scrolling on smartphone (VGSS condition) or watching documentaries (control condition). Perceived workload, mental fatigue, motivation and boredom of each condition were assessed. Cognitive performance and physical activity intention were measured pre-post VGSS and control condition. Then, participants performed a knee extensors endurance task until exhaustion at 20% of their maximal voluntary peak force.\nParticipants perceived the VGSS as more demanding than watching documentaries, but only a slight increase in mental fatigue and no difference between conditions in cognitive performance was observed. Muscle endurance performance did not differ after VGSS or documentary watching, and physical activity intention decreased regardless of condition.\nEngaging in VGSS did not induce a specific state of mental fatigue, explaining the absence of impaired muscle endurance performance. Both conditions negatively impacted physical activity intentions, suggesting that sitting in front of a screen impairs intentions to be active.",

Given how important expectations of learning are for actual learning, we explored whether people accurately intuit this canonical time course of skill learning. Across six preregistered experiments (n = 500), we find that people correctly predict that skill learning curves (error reductions over time) on a novel visuomotor task will follow an exponential decay function, both for an imagined naïve player and for themselves, before engaging with the task. Moreover, people are sensitive to conditions that merit exponential learning within a bounded time frame and only predict these curves when an imagined player puts in effort and the task is not too difficult. However, people systematically misestimate specific parameters of skill learning (e.g., initial and average performance, and rate of improvement), which relates to reduced affect at the beginning of learning. Critically, these negative effects can be ameliorated by practice: Providing people with minimal practice reduces their prediction errors and, in turn, buffers them from negative feelings at the beginning of learning.",

However, the literature is full of inconsistencies regarding the factors associated with school engagement in this population, many of which remain understudied.\nObjective: This study aims to investigate how factors at the youth, care history, and placement levels relate to school engagement in adolescents in residential care from a multilevel perspective.\nParticipants and Setting: The sample included 161 adolescents aged 12–18 (M = 15.22, SD = 1.59), of whom 46.6% were boys, 49.7% were girls, and 3.7% identified themselves as non-binary. They were placed in 24 residential facilities managed or supported by the Child Protection System in Spain.\nMethods: Data were collected through online questionnaires. Care workers provided information on adolescents’ demographics (i.e., age, gender, and nationality) and care history variables (i.e., age at entry into care, number of out-of-home placements). Adolescents self-reported their internalizing and externalizing problems, perception of the group climate, and school engagement.\nResults: After accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., adolescents nested within residential facilities, the results showed that higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and having experience multiple out-of-home placements, were associated with lower levels of school engagement. In contrast, the perception of an open group climate was related to higher levels of school engagement.\nConclusions: This study highlights the importance of factors associated with school engagement, which are essential for developing guidelines and recommendations to help practitioners and group care workers support adolescents with school-related issues.",

Using exploratory and confirmatory latent construct modeling with a cross-sectional and diverse sample of 314 undergraduate participants, we found that the bi-factor model of Sadism and schadenfreude that best fit the data articulated Sadism as a sub-facet of schadenfreude. However, an EFA did not find the same relationship, and instead suggested a four-factor solution that split harm-enjoying traits into higher order Sadism and schadenfreude domains that each had lower-order facets—including a malicious component of schadenfreude that most closely abuts Sadism. Future research should seek to identify the mechanisms that translate a passive, schadenfreudic disposition into actual acts of Sadistic aggression.",

          "abstract": "There are many putatively distinct phenomena related to perception in the oblique regions of space. For instance, the classic oblique effect describes a deficit in visual acuity for oriented lines in the obliques, and classic “prototype effects” reflect a bias to misplace objects towards the oblique regions of space. Yet these effects are explained in very different terms: The oblique effect itself is often understood as arising from orientation-selective neurons, whereas prototype effects are described as arising from categorical biases. Here, we explore the possibility that these effects (and others) may stem from a single underlying spatial distortion. We show that there is a general distortion of (angular) space in the oblique regions that influences not only orientation judgments, but also location, extent, and size. We argue that these findings reflect oblique warping, a general distortion of spatial representations in the oblique regions which may be the root cause of many oblique effects.",

Although childhood obesity rates are increasing, there is no strict regulation of the marketing of unhealthy foods towards children. This is problematic since the human brain, especially areas important for cognitive control, continues to develop into the 30s. It is not known in how far the brain response to unhealthy food cues varies with body mass index (BMI) and age. To investigate this, 168 children (10-17 y) and 182 adults (30-67 y) from the European IDEFICS cohort were scanned with fMRI while viewing pictures of healthy and unhealthy foods. Children exhibited lower activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) compared to adults when exposed to unhealthy food cues. Across all age groups, individuals with higher BMI demonstrated reduced activation in the middle cingulum in response to unhealthy food stimuli. Lastly, the relation between BMI and brain activation in response to unhealthy compared with healthy food stimuli varied with development: in children, higher BMI was correlated with decreased activation in right anterior insula and right dlPFC, whereas no such relationship was observed in adults. These findings suggest that children with higher BMI may be particularly vulnerable to unhealthy food cues. In this light, the lack of regulation regarding unhealthy food marketing targeted at is children concerning, especially considering the global increase in obesity rates.",

A scientometric analysis of the literature linking cannabis and schizophrenia has not been conducted before. \nMethods\nBibliographic data for all articles and reviews with the terms cannabis (or marijuana) and schizophrenia in the title, abstract or keywords were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS). CiteSpace was used for co-citation analysis. VOSViewer was used for visualizing keyword and co-authorship networks. \nResults\nBetween 1976-2024, there were 3101 publications in total, with 130198 associated references. From 1976 until the 1990s, the research output remained minimal, but grew rapidly thereafter, peaking in 2020-2021. The most prolific author was Robin M. Murray, and the most prolific journal was Schizophrenia Research. The countries contributing most to the literature were USA (28%), UK (24%) and Australia (12.5%). Co-citation analysis revealed 13 research clusters. Earlier clusters dealt with epidemiological and clinical aspects. Trends in the middle period included gene-environment interactions, endocannabinoid system, therapeutic interventions, and the effects of cannabis on the brain. Recent trends included cannabidiol, causal explorations using genetic information, and the relationship between geographical variation in cannabis use and the epidemiology of psychoses. Potential future directions suggested by structural variation analysis included novel interventions for cannabis use in schizophrenia such as neuromodulation and technology-based psychotherapies, genetic risk stratification, immune/neuroendocrine markers, sex-specific issues, and forensic research. \nConclusion\nThis scientometric review illustrated the evolution of scientific literature on cannabis and schizophrenia over five decades, and identified emerging trends and future directions.",

          "abstract": "Decreased cognitive control, encompassing processes like response inhibition and error processing, has been identified as a potential neurocognitive risk factor for psychopathology. Although electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise as a cost-effective and high temporal resolution method for linking brain function to behavior, large-scale EEG research to realize this potential remains limited. In this study, a population-based sample of 2994 adolescents (M_age = 18.4 years, range 16-21 years) was utilized to first assess reliability of EEG markers of cognitive control (ERN/Pe, No-Go N2/P3) measured during a Go/No-Go task. This involved computing split-half reliability, Cronbach’s Alpha (CA) and Pearson’s correlations for an increasing number of error/No-Go trials. Given the low-density setup, our analyses focused on the electrode locations FCz and Cz. Moderate reliability (split-half reliability and CA ≥ 0.6) was obtained with a minimum of 9/10 errors for ERN, 7 errors for Pe, and 15 No-Go trials for No-Go N2/P3. Second, linear regression models were used to estimate univariate and multivariate associations between child and family characteristics and EEG parameters (ERN/Pe, No-Go N2/P3 and midfrontal theta power). We report robust associations between higher IQ and larger Pe, No-Go P3 and midfrontal theta power. Maternal education and household income showed a similar association, but seemed partly explained by IQ. Smaller No-Go P3 was observed in adolescents with a migration background. Finally, larger ERN and No-Go N2 were observed in female as compared to male participants. These findings highlight the need to adjust for these variables in future EEG studies in adolescent populations. In conclusion, this study highlights the feasibility of incorporating EEG into large-scale population-based research, even with relatively short task duration. Importantly, researchers should balance higher reliability against retaining more participants and minimizing potential bias.",

We describe two cohorts of the Estonian Biobank for whom, besides self- and informant-rated personality traits, detailed data are available on a wide range of measures including health behaviour, biomarkers, anthropometric measurements, and medical diagnoses and treatments. The first cohort (N[self-report] = 3,640, N[informant-report] = 3,488) filled out the NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3) between 2008 and 2018. The second cohort (N[self-report] = 77,400, N[informant-report] = 21,986), collected between 2021 and 2022, responded to a large and diverse item pool called the 100 Nuances of Personality (100NP) covering the Big Five and other traits. Research opportunities include investigation of personality traits’ properties, gene discovery, prediction of health and well-being, and causal modelling. New data are added periodically through additional data collection waves and linkage with various registries and databases.",

          "abstract": "Calorie labeling is a popular policy to address the obesity epidemic, but it has had little empirical success. Under the premise that willful avoidance of information plays a role in this result, we propose a novel approach—pre-nudges—to make consumers more receptive to calorie information. Unlike nudges, which are used to directly influence a choice, pre-nudges are used to directly influence how consumers react to the nudge itself (the calorie label). In line with predictions from our theoretical analysis, we test two pre-nudges in the context of menu labeling: one aims to increase self-efficacy, and the other one highlights the long-term health risks of overeating. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, we find that both pre-nudges reduce calorie information avoidance. Overall, our paper suggests a possible role for pre-nudges in addressing the obesity epidemic—one of the largest public health issues globally—and illustrates the potential usefulness of pre-nudges more generally",

          "authors": "Daria Glukhova",
          "abstract": "This article explores the patterns of political representation by movement parties and their influence on policy-making in a comparative manner by investigating policy successes of four movement parties – two in Germany (AfD, die Grünen) and two in Italy (M5S, Federazione dei Verdi), - against the policy expectations of the social movements they represent. It shows that movement parties can achieve policy influence and help transmit policy demands of their associated social movements into institutions in other ways than through a powerful position in the government or in parliament. This demonstrates that a party does not have to be in a governing coalition to achieve policy success, nor does being in a government coalition at the time of policy adoption ensure policy survival in the long-term. On the contrary, parties in opposition or with low representation in parliament are able to achieve important policy impact, despite their relatively low popularity in the elections prior or following the adoption of a particular policy. Policy success can be attributed to a number of diverse factors: close alignment with the movement, impact on the agenda-setting stage through implicit or explicit influence of the party, cooptation of policy issues by established political parties, and direct participation in policy-making. The latter, however, does not by itself ensure long-term sustainability of the policy success. We elaborate on the implications of this research on theories of democratic representation, coalition governance, and public policy.",

          "abstract": "Why do citizens support central bank independence (CBI)? Despite important research on economic and political reasons to grant independence to central banks, we know little about what the public thinks about CBI. This is important given citizens' potential role in constraining politicians' ability to alter CBI. We hypothesize that support for CBI is influenced by citizens' limited understanding of central bank governance and their beliefs about who will gain control over monetary policy if independence is reduced. Our expectations are confirmed by a preregistered survey experiment and a pre-post-election test in the U.S. Support for CBI increases when respondents learn that the President would gain more influence if independence was reduced. This support decreases when respondents expect a co-partisan to lead the executive branch. These findings shed light on the legitimacy basis of monetary institutions in politically polarized contexts and, from a policy perspective, indicate the limits of central bank communication.",

          "abstract": "Norris and Inglehart's (2019) cultural backlash theory has become popular for understanding right-wing backlash. The theory views backlash as a reaction from segments of the population who feel alienated by advancing societal liberalization. We test this core claim of the theory by investigating whether highly educated individuals increasingly adopted more liberal attitudes toward immigrants, LGTBIQ+ rights, and gender roles over recent decades across European countries, and whether this has led to an increasing liberalization gap to lower educated segments of the population. Using data from the European Values Study (1980–2020) and the European Social Survey (2001–2021) we find that liberalization dynamics vary significantly across countries and attitudinal indicators. Growing liberalization gaps are most common in Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in a distinct and pronounced way concerning LGTBIQ+ attitudes. Western Europe shows fewer gaps, mostly in isolated attitudes on immigration and gender roles. We conclude that cultural backlash theory is most applicable to Central and Eastern Europe (and to some extent in Southern Europe). In most countries, explaining backlash through this lens requires acknowledging that growing liberalization gaps occur on singular attitudes rather than being a widespread phenomenon.",

We used fictive teacher names (immigrant/native; male/female) as a salient attribute of the list of otherwise identical elective classes in economics. We find a robust same-type bias in preferences for teachers. The same-type biases are significant on the full sample but stronger among low-skilled and female students. Our results point to an intersectional mechanism; students are significantly less likely to select classes led by a teacher of the opposite gender \\emph{and} ethnicity, implying that the students’ same-sex bias primarily affects ethnic minority teachers. While the ethnicity bias is robust to default nudging, elevating the opposite gender as the default option reduces or even eliminates the selection bias. We also show that, due to these student preferences, underrepresented teachers may receive significantly weaker students under standard admission systems.",

          "authors": "Susanne Garritzmann; Sigrid Roßteutscher; Max P. Jansen; Birgit Becker",
          "abstract": "Political efficacy is a powerful predictor of political participation. Many traditional measures of efficacy in political science prompt survey respondent to think of “people like me”, thus evoking a group reference. However, without specifying which of multiple possible group memberships respondents ought to think of, answers may refer to completely different groups across respondents, resulting in imprecise measures. In this paper, we argue that political efficacy encompasses not only an internal and an external dimension, but that there also is a third dimension, group-related political efficacy, which reflects variation in degrees of political responsiveness to different groups. To empirically assess our argument, we developed new measures of political efficacy and conducted two large, register-based surveys among different age groups (adolescents and adults) in Germany. The results show that individuals have very different perceptions of group-related political efficacy depending on their educational, economic, and migration backgrounds. With around 30 percent, a significant share of respondents has opposing group-related and external efficacy, suggesting that theoretically and empirically differentiating between these dimensions is important. Based on our evidence, we conclude that a vague stimulus as “people like me” blur the differences between general external and group-related dimensions of political efficacy. Instead, to adequately assess political efficacy, we suggest to use our newly developed (short) scales, specifying the concrete group of reference that the researcher is interested in.",

Then, we evaluated how title changes have affected the evolution of the journals’ language of publication, authorship, readership and impact. The acceleration of the trend towards the de-nationalization and anglicization of journal titles coincided with the rise of discourses on internationalization in the 1980s and the growing use, a decade later, of quantitative indicators in research evaluation, above all the Impact Factor. In general, this rebranding strategy of scholarly journals resulted in a higher visibility on the global market of scientific publications, leading to a more internationalized authorship and readership, but to the detriment of the use of national languages.",

Our results indicate significant shifts in attitudes, particularly regarding social justice, following the flooding. We found a strong and robust relationship between social justice and environmental attitudes. A causal mediation analysis revealed that floods affected environmental attitudes indirectly through social justice attitudes beyond direct effects. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating the principles of justice in addressing climate change and suggest that young people’s perspectives on social justice play a crucial role in shaping environmental policies and responses to climate crises.",

This study explores the role of a rhyme-driven translation approach in achieving textual fluency in Arabic translations of Shakespearean poetry. The research combines qualitative textual analysis with quantitative empirical data to examine how rhyme preservation influences translation choices, employing a mixed-method approach. Findings reveal that prioritising rhyme while integrating domestication, literalism, and foreignisation results in a natural and fluent target text, depending on the translator’s literary and linguistic capabilities. Empirical results further confirm this fluency, as 68.41% of participants perceived the translation as an original Arabic poem. These insights contribute to the literature on poetry translation strategies, illustrating that a hybrid translation approach can successfully maintain both aesthetic and structural integrity.",

Together, we examine how these processes amplify a certain demographic subset of experts over others in a cumulative manner and what the consequences are for the selection and representation of experts to the public, and to the legitimacy of expert authority, more generally",

We consider change from Wave 8 (2016-17) to Wave 10 (2020-22) of the European Social Survey (ESS). Climate consciousness increased overall, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. Politicisation of climate change increased mostly in Western Europe, where it increased more on the left, and for left-wing party voters, than on the right. Populist-Right parties were distinctive in the relative stability of climate consciousness among their voters. Our results show increased politicisation of climate change attitudes within Western European countries, but also convergence between polities of the East and West at higher levels of climate consciousness, which may affect EU climate policy making.",

          "abstract": "Empirical research in the social sciences is often interested in understanding actor stances; the positions that social actors take regarding normative statements in societal discourse. In automated text analysis applications, the classification task of stance detection remains challenging. Stance detection is especially difficult due to semantic challenges such as implicitness or missing context but also due to the general nature of the task. \nIn this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable stance detection in a generalized (non-domain, non-statement specific) form. Specifically, we test a variety of different general prompt chains for zero-shot stance classifications.\nOur evaluation data consists of textual data from a real-world empirical research project in the domain of sustainable urban transport. For 1710 German newspaper paragraphs, each containing an organizational entity, we annotated the stance of the entity toward one of five normative statements. \nA comparison of four publicly available LLMs show that they can improve upon existing approaches and achieve adequate performance. However, results heavily depend on the prompt chain method, LLM, and vary by statement. Our findings have implications for computational linguistics methodology and political discourse analysis, as they offer a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in performing the complex semantic task of stance detection. We strongly emphasise the necessity of domain-specific evaluation data for evaluating LLMs and considering trade-offs between model complexity and performance.",

Using population-wide administrative data on library loans in Denmark linked with information on literary awards and reviews, and a difference-in-differences design, I compare loans before and after an award/review, using shortlisted and books yet-to-receive awards/reviews as controls. Quality signals from cultural intermediaries significantly increase loans, especially among individuals with high levels of cultural capital. This challenges the emphasis on the detached aesthetic dispositions of the cultural elite in Bourdieu’s theory on cultural distinction. Second, higher cultural legitimacy does not increase signal impact. This questions the assumption that cultural intermediaries mobilize cultural legitimacy to consecrate cultural products. An equally important function of cultural intermediaries might be to inform and engage receptive audiences. The findings provide new insights into how signals from cultural intermediaries affect (whose) behavior.",

          "authors": "Cornelius Heimstädt",
          "abstract": "Start-up founders often face the challenge of pitching their ventures to a heterogeneous audience, with varying expectations and values. In the early 21st century, start-up pitches have become increasingly complex, with the value of start-ups no longer conceived solely in economic terms, but also in moral, social, and environmental ones. This chapter explores how a start-up, presenting its value through \"sustainability,\" navigates these multiple valuations during its pitch. Drawing on Goffman’s dramaturgical framework, Muniesa and Helgesson’s concept of \"spectacles of valuation,\" and Asdal et al.’s concept of \"the good economy,\" I coin the concept of \"the spectacle of the good economy\" to describe how start-up pitches function as public performances where valuation takes place between entrepreneurs and their audiences. Through an analysis of the pitch of a start-up (pseudonym: SoilSight) at a major agricultural trade fair, the chapter examines how material and semiotic elements of the pitch—particularly the \"pitch deck\" and the entrepreneur’s performance on stage—contribute to a valuation of the start-up as \"sustainable,\" understood as a hybrid value that combines both economic and more-than-economic (social, moral, environmental) elements. By extending Peircean semiotics to the analysis of pitch performances, the chapter contributes to the understanding of how the good economy is staged, negotiated, and redefined in contemporary start-up culture.",

Developed through interdisciplinary research and informed by critiques of racialized beauty standards, the IHT spans a spectrum from coily to straight textures, incorporating factors such as curl pattern, density, and style. The IHT, which is composed of two questions with an optional third question, provides a scientifically grounded approach to studying hair as a marker of identity and systemic inequities.",

Using a survey experiment with a representative sample of over 5,000 respondents in Australia, we find substantial and contradictory misperceptions across the number, origins and labour market attributes of immigrants. Most respondents prefer less immigration overall, but favour increased high-skilled immigration. Support for increased immigration rises by 4.5—7 percentage points when respondents are shown narratives on how immigrants can help improve housing affordability. Conversely, highlighting the perceived negative impacts of immigration on housing affordability reduces support for increasing or maintaining current immigration levels. Providing quantitative information on immigrants’ characteristics generates smaller increases in support for more immigration than narratives. For immigration from Pacific Island countries, exposure to quantitative information increases support for relaxing visa requirements but there is no evidence that narratives have any effect.",

          "abstract": "Tourism has become a vital driver for economic growth and cultural exchange in\nTamil Nadu, particularly in rural areas where traditional customs and livelihoods coexist with\nincreasing visitor numbers(N. et al., 2024). This study employs qualitative methods, including\nsemi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations, to assess the\nsocio-cultural and economic effects of tourism on rural communities. Findings reveal that while\ntourism generates economic benefits such as increased income and job creation, it also presents\nchallenges like seasonal fluctuations and over-reliance on the industry. Socio-culturally, tourism\nfosters cultural interaction and empowers marginalized groups, especially women, through\nentrepreneurship. However, concerns arise regarding the erosion of traditional values and\ncustoms. Environmental impacts are evident, with increased pressure on natural resources and\ninfrastructure, although eco-tourism initiatives have spurred conservation efforts. The study\nunderscores the need for community-focused and sustainable tourism frameworks that align\neconomic benefits with cultural preservation and environmental sustainability. Inclusive policies\nthat engage local stakeholders in decision-making are essential for ensuring tourism development\naligns with community priorities and long-term sustainability.",

These processes are crucial in sociology and other social sciences, as they study how individuals, families, or organizations change over time or engage in different activities in one or more domains. SA allows for effectively describing and visualizing these temporal processes, helping identify regularities or anomalies in the number, duration, or timing of events and states. These patterns can be linked to units' characteristics (e.g., gender) or contextual factors (e.g., policy changes). The chapter outlines the main steps in conducting SA: coding and visualizing sequences, calculating dissimilarities, clustering similar sequences, and using cluster membership in regression models. This \"core program\" is demonstrated using data from the German pairfam survey. The chapter also provides references to recent advances and concludes with a discussion on challenges and open questions in the field.",

We elaborate the role of religion within IAT, methodologically differentiate religious traditions, and empirically test hypotheses regarding local religious ecologies and community homicide over time in the U.S. In analyses of county-level panel data, we find that increases in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are directly associated with increases in homicide rates, while increases in the Catholic adherent rate are directly associated with decreases in homicide rates. Using spatial analysis to examine spillover effects from adjacent locations, increases in the Catholic adherent rate and the evangelical Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with increases in homicide, while increases in the mainline Protestant adherent rate are indirectly associated with decreases in homicide. The total effect (both direct and indirect) for changes in the evangelical Protestant adherent rate is the largest in the model. In sum, elaborating and extending IAT, this study theorizes and then demonstrates the importance of differentiating between specific religious traditions for understanding spatial and temporal patterns in crime.",

          "abstract": "This article contributes to anthropological reflections on ‘hope’ and ‘expectation’ by analysing the experiences of time of two Ecuadorian migrants who returned to their homeland from Spain and envision their future lives differently. Building on the migrants’ trajectories and reasonings, we propose a clearer conceptual delineation of the notions of hope and expectation than the ones that currently prevail in anthropology. We do so by showing their interrelations and articulations, particularly in one’s own experience (constituted by moments of expectation and moments of hope), and by drawing attention to our interlocutors’ temporalisation. As a future-orientation, ‘hope’ is directed toward change and constitutes an envisioning more open and creative than ‘expectation’, which builds on continuity and stability. The notion of ‘duration’ provides insight into the ways our interlocutors compartmentalise their time experience, constituting a sense of past-ness, present-ness, and future-ness, which impacts their future imaginings as ‘hoping’ versus ‘expecting’.",

          "abstract": "This paper originally investigates intergenerational wealth inequalities across European countries over the past two decades. Employing a modified socioeconomic attainment model, we identify three primary micro level channels linking social origin to offspring wealth attainment: education, income, and wealth transfers. These channels can be scaled up at the country level to capture the structure of intergenerational rigidities. Empirically, the study examines how wealth stratification by social origin can be predicted by intergenerational rigidities in education, income, and wealth transfers. Aggregate intergenerational measures are computed leveraging about 600,000 individual observations from 31 European countries in 3 points in time (2005, 2011, 2019) from EU-SILC data,  with parental education serving as the measure of social origin. Complementing previous single country studies, our findings reveal that wealth attainment is substantially stratified by parental education in most, if not in all, European countries. Moreover, its cross-country and cross-temporal heterogeneity is consistently predicted by intergenerational rigidities in education, income, and wealth transfers. This study contributes to the comparative literature on wealth inequality by underscoring its strong interconnection with established origin-related inequalities in socioeconomic attainment.",

          "authors": "Davi Resende; Gabriel Richter; Marcelo Sant'Anna; André Trindade",
          "abstract": "In certain settings, goods can be consumed outside of formal markets (e.g.: theft, counterfeit, or illegal sharing of subscriptions). When the share of informality is large, firms’ pricing decisions can be substantially affected, as the extensive margin - customers migrating to informal consumption - makes demand more elastic. We study this question in the context of electricity theft in Brazil, where stolen energy can represent more than 50% of the total formal market. We use detailed micro data from a major electric utility to estimate a structural model where consumers choose if they want to be formal or informal and then, how much to consume. For identification, we leverage a natural experiment where prices increased permanently to a set of consumers. We use the model to simulate counterfactual scenarios where: (i) theft is not possible, and (ii) the firm uses different pricing strategies. We find that the presence of informality increases the elasticity of demand from 0.24 to 0.39, and reduces monopoly optimal prices by 10.4%. Eliminating theft altogether would allow the firm to reduce prices by 17.7% while keeping profits constant. We also find that price discrimination is an effective tool to reduce informality rates.",

This report aims at providing a definitional framework for this value by drawing upon the domains of philosophy, political science and psychology, examining solidarity practices, including EU responses to major current crises in the EU. This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",

In 2021, the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) replaced the Residential Variation Statistics (EVR) and the Migration Statistics (EM) with the new Change of Residence and Migration Statistics, which included methodological changes.\n\nObjective: I evaluate differences between the EMCR and previous sources and produce weights to make the EMCR consistent with the EVR and EM. I publish the weights in an open repository (https://github.com/MiguelGonzalezLeonardo/Weights_EMCR_Spain).\n\nMethods: I analyse the percentage differences for internal and international migration between the EMCR and the previous sources at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 levels in 2021, the only year when the three sources were published simultaneously. I then produce weights by dividing the migration counts from the EVR and EM by those from the EMCR for each spatial unit.\n\nResults: I found strong differences between the new source and the previous sources for international migration, especially for emigration, which needs to be calibrated with the weights. The EMCR and EVR register similar numbers of internal migrants.\n\nConclusions: Methodological changes in statistical sources can lead to large differences in the measurement of a social phenomenon. This suggests the need to assess time-series consistency and produce weights for calibration.\n\nContribution: I provide open data with weights to calibrate internal and international migration in the new Spanish migration source and produce consistent time-series with previous sources at different scales.

Lurking behind these questions is often the assumption that states are rational actors. This essay will therefore examine the concept of rationality, the state of the art about the rationality of states, and the strategic thinking of several states in the Indo-Pacific. I argue that it is the observer’s approach to a state that determines the state’s rationality according to Mearsheimer and Rosato’s homo theoreticus benchmarks, which model states as machines and angels rather than humans. When seen as rich tapestries rather than black boxes, states in the Indo-Pacific often violate this rationality standard. Based on insights from cognitive science, I suggest some directions for rethinking the rationality of foreign policy and reconceptualising the rational actor assumption.",

          "title": "A consolidação do setor farmacêutico na economia global: crescimento, influência, desvios e marketing",
          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "Este trabalho investiga como o setor farmacêutico tornou-se um dos maiores e mais influentes setores econômicos da atualidade. Apresenta números e informações que respaldam essa afirmação e busca elucidar os fatores que contribuíram para tal ascensão. Desde a descoberta da penicilina por Alexander Fleming em 1928, as indústrias farmacêuticas evoluíram de pequenas entidades - muitas vezes familiares e de atuação local - para corporações multinacionais avaliadas em centenas de bilhões de dólares com influência global. Entretanto, além da descoberta e diversificação de medicamentos, do aumento da demanda e da expansão da capacidade produtiva, parte dessa evolução é sustentada por estratégias complexas e, em alguns casos, perversas, que priorizam a maximização dos lucros em detrimento da saúde pública e individual. Os achados deste estudo revelam que, nas últimas duas décadas, as receitas do setor quadruplicaram, atingindo 1,48 trilhão de dólares em 2022, um montante comparável ao Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) de países desenvolvidos, como a Espanha. As vinte maiores empresas do setor possuem um valor de mercado combinado de US$ 3,5 trilhões e ativos totalizando US$ 1,86 trilhões, gerando receitas anuais de US$ 820 bilhões e lucros de US$ 181,6 bilhões. Para contextualizar, somente os ativos dessas companhias são comparáveis ao PIB de todos os países da África Subsaariana. Empresas, como a Johnson &amp; Johnson, possuem um valor de mercado que supera o PIB de 184 nações. O estudo também examina e discute práticas questionáveis adotadas pela indústria farmacêutica, incluindo o investimento de bilhões de dólares em lobby e financiamento eleitoral, influência sobre órgãos reguladores, apoio financeiro a organizações de pacientes, patrocínio a autores de \"Diretrizes Clínicas\", manipulação e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos, e o direcionamento de investimentos maciços para fortalecer laços com prescritores, hospitais universitários e instituições acadêmicas. São fornecidos exemplos concretos dessas ações, apoiados por estudos, levantamentos de dados e decisões judiciais, que ressaltam as consequências alarmantes desta realidade. Por fim, a pesquisa analisa o marketing farmacêutico como uma das principais estratégias de aumento de vendas. A despeito dos medicamentos não serem mercadorias comuns, suscetíveis à promoção sob a lente do consumo desenfreado, as empresas investem bilhões anualmente em publicidade dirigida diretamente ao consumidor. No contexto brasileiro, o setor farmacêutico destaca-se como um dos principais investidores em marketing. Nos últimos anos, diversas empresas da área figuraram entre os maiores gastos individuais com propaganda. A emergência de estratégias de marketing digital impulsionadas pela internet, algoritmos avançados e redes sociais, junto a campanhas publicitárias nocivas à saúde pública e coletiva, ratificam um cenário preocupante e desafiador.",

          "authors": "Sally Goldspink; Nieky van Veggel; Hilary Engward; Naim Abdulmohdi; Andrea Tuckwell; Marie Alexander",
          "abstract": "Background In England, the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwifery Advocate (PMA) role places nurses and midwives at the centre of workforce retention and transformation. The PNA/PMA role blends professional nursing leadership and clinical supervision through the Advocating for Education and Quality Improvement (A-EQUIP) model, which is grounded in directing change and steering service development. Taken collectively, the overarching impetus for the PNA/PMA role is to improve quality of care whilst developing and sustaining cultures of professional wellbeing and nurse/midwife retention. To date, however, little is known about what the impact the PNA/PMA role might have on the day-to-day practice of nurses and midwives, nor if it improves quality in practice, professional wellbeing, and retention. This NHS-funded study examines the impact of the PNA/PMA role on nurse/midwife involvement in quality improvement, wellbeing, and retention within one public sector healthcare NHS Trust in England.\n\nStudy design and methods During 2022, fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with PNA’s and PMA’s who had completed their training and are included on the NHS Trust PNA/PMA register. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed through qualitative thematic analysis.\n\nResults Thematic analysis detected 5 themes and 10 subthemes: (1) Transforming in Tandem (a) Role of Advocacy, (b) Restorative Focus, (2) Creating Safe Spaces, (c) Emotional Support, (d) Interpersonal Relationships, (3) Challenging the Status Quo (e) Counteracting Blame Culture, (f) Empowering Change (4) Empowerment and Development (g) Building Resilience (h) Building Resilience, (5) Types of Advocacy (i) Educational and Emotional Advocacy (j) Coaching and Conversations.\n\nConclusions The findings suggests that the most effective aspects of the Professional Nurse Advocate (PNA) and Professional Midwife Advocate (PMA) roles are those that directly empower individuals and create a supportive, reflective environment. However, while building resilience is vital, it is equally important to recognize its limits and ensure that healthcare professionals are not pushed to the point where their resilience becomes a barrier to their well-being and the overall improvement of their work environment.",

          "abstract": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is a significant and widespread social problem and concern for human health. The determinants of GBV are complex and include many factors that are sensitive to the impacts of climate change. However, the links between climate and GBV have been understudied relative to many other social impacts of climate change. In this narrative review, we describe how climate change can shape the incidence of GBV through its effects on human physiology and psychological well-being, economic and natural resources, migration patterns, and access to critical infrastructure and services. Empirical and theoretical gaps in this body of literature are significant and stem from an over-reliance on traditional measures of domestic violence and household surveys from a non-representative set of contexts. We argue that researchers should develop new, multi-method approaches for studying GBV and its relationship to climate variability, which can allow for a more expansive understanding of climate effects on violence.",

          "abstract": "Background\nThere is limited knowledge on service and benefits use behind long-term unemployment. In this study, we identify different pathways behind long-term unemployment utilising information on previous labour market position. Further, we analyse differences in health care and social benefits use based on these pathways. This study aims to produce knowledge useful for early identification and supportive actions for those outside of labour market or in risk of such. \nMethods\nAmong Finnish working age population, individuals who had been mainly unemployed in years 2020 and 2021 and had information on their labour market position for years 2013-2021 were identified (n = 72,485). For the analysis, register information from Statistics Finland, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland and Finnish Institute for Welfare and Health was used. To identify diverse pathways based on previous labour market position, sequence analysis was conducted. Linear regression models were used to analyse cluster differences in health care and social benefits use while controlling for potential confounders age, sex, education, living situation, migrant background and low income. \nResults\nFive clusters were identified based on previous labour market position: unemployed (54%), students (3%), employed (23%), inactive (10%) and individuals with unstable working career (10%). Health care attendance was most frequent among those inactive and unemployed. These clusters had also highest share of those with mental and musculoskeletal disorders and were most with sickness absence and with basic social assistance. In these associations between health care and benefits use and clusters, confounding due to sociodemographic factors seems to play a minor role apart from students, with whom we saw decreased risk of mental health diagnoses compared to unemployment when confounding due to age and sex was taken into account. Income differences between clusters were large in beginning of the observation years. In the end of the observation time, unemployed, inactive and students were at similar level of income while those in employment and those returned to unemployment had higher earnings.\nConclusions\nPrevious labour market position should be considered while planning preventive efforts and developing individual multisectoral services and social security for those in risk of labour market marginalisation.",

          "authors": "Leonard Baum; Joanna J. Bryson",
          "abstract": "Growing global concern about the problems associated with concentrated market power in the digital economy is leading to a renewed interest in competition policy. Since the late 2010s, China’s government has squarely confronted the problems of its own ‘Big Tech’ with a new competition regime for digital markets. Outcomes represent a unique learning opportunity for Western academics, competition authorities and lawmakers alike, which has so far been underutilized. However, given unreliable official figures, a new methodology is needed to assess competition in China’s digital economy. This article introduces a market capitalization approach that builds on the informativeness of China’s financial markets. We use Bloomberg financial data of 1142 publicly listed firms for the period 2019 to 2022 to quantitatively examine the impact of China’s new digital competition regime. We find a causal link between the new governance approach and  a reduction of market concentration and aggregate growth in the primary markets of China’s three most dominant digital platforms – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BATs). Further, our results show a robust correlation between the new competition regime and reduced market concentration and market capitalization growth rates across China’s digital markets. Other empirical findings include a negative correlation between market concentration and the openness of digital markets, a non-relationship between market concentration and profits, and the inability of profit and revenue-based metrics to capture market power effectively in China’s digital economy. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these insights for Western regulatory strategies, particularly as the EU and China emerge as global frontrunners in the field of digital competition regulation.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenon of delayed retirement in Sierra Leone, focusing on the underlying socio-political and economic factors that contribute to this trend. Given the insecurity and instability in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, older workers are increasingly choosing to remain in the workforce well beyond traditional retirement age. The study delves into the challenges posed by high unemployment rates, inadequate social security systems, and the need for income security. Through qualitative interviews with government officials, retirees, and economists, this research identifies key reasons for delayed retirement and evaluates its impact on both the labor market and the broader economy. The findings underscore the importance of developing comprehensive retirement policies and systems to support an aging workforce and improve economic security in the region.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the concept, measurement, principal stylized facts, and theoretical aspects of compositional inequality. Compositional inequality refers to how the shares of capital and labor income vary along the income distribution. This analysis is valuable for several reasons. From a macroeconomic perspective, it elucidates the link between functional and personal distributions of income, which is crucial for addressing the drivers of income inequality in a context rising capital share. From a comparative economic perspective, it locates economic systems on the continuum between two extremes: classical capitalism, where the rich earn predominantly from capital and the poor from labor, and new capitalism, where the composition of capital and labor is uniform across the distribution. We refer to the entire range of systems along this continuum as the distributional varieties of capitalism. Recent empirical studies indicate that, in most countries, we are far from classical capitalism, though with notable exceptions, such as Latin American countries.\n\nThis underscores the need to evaluate the benefits of compositional equality. The paper concludes that compositional equality is desirable for at least two reasons: it promotes fairness and supports an inclusive, profit-driven regime of accumulation and growth.

          "abstract": "Current research on education reform has focused chiefly on positive shocks that intend to equalize educational opportunity, while negative shocks that impede school access have rarely been investigated. What would happen to someone exposed simultaneously to both types of shocks? I tackle this question in the context of Vietnam, where a universal primary education reform (a positive shock) and an introduction of tuition fee for secondary education (a negative shock) took place almost at the same time but affected different cohorts. I find that the negative shock decreased individual years of schooling, whereas the positive shock increased it. The beneficial effect of the positive shock outstrips the adverse effect of the negative shock, resulting in an overall improvement in educational attainment for those exposed to both shocks. The favorable joint effect on schooling is more pronounced for socioeconomically disadvantaged rural residents, women, and ethnic minorities. Educational assortative mating, intergenerational persistence of education, and labor market outcomes are also examined in this article.",

          "abstract": "This research aims to examine the progression of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives at China Construction Bank (CCB) from the year 2014 to 2023. The study seeks to assess the evolution of CCB's CSR reporting, with a particular emphasis on environmental sustainability, employee well-being, and the impact of government policies. This research employs a longitudinal study approach, incorporating case studies, content analysis, and a thorough review of annual CSR reports. It scrutinizes quantitative indicators such as green financing and employee statistics to discern trends and patterns in CSR engagement. Our findings indicate a substantial enhancement in both the quantity and quality of CSR disclosures by CCB during the period under review. A significant upsurge in green financing is observed, signifying CCB's dedication to environmental sustainability. There is also a noticeable improvement in employee welfare and diversity, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of female and younger staff. The correlation analysis reveals a positive relationship between CSR initiatives and financial outcomes, implying that CSR may be instrumental in achieving business prosperity. Furthermore, government policies are found to have a substantial influence on the CSR strategies adopted by CCB. This research offers an in-depth examination of a decade of CSR practices within a prominent Chinese commercial bank. It underscores the pivotal role that government regulations play in directing CSR initiatives and illustrates the beneficial effects of CSR on financial performance. The insights gained are of significant value to policymakers, industry participants, and scholars intrigued by CSR within the banking industry.",

          "abstract": "In Venezuela, numerous armed groups known as sindicatos have taken advantage of the weakness of the central state to control mining areas. In so doing, these groups have established forms of rentier micro-states by maintaining sovereign functions (police, tax, customs, etc.) and taking over public services (water, electricity, health, education, transport, etc.). In this contribution, we provocatively ask to what extent such rentier micro-states can be deemed disposable. Through an ethnographic and documentary study of the Las Claritas mining area, we consider that, if they are indeed disposable, it is not so much because the Venezuelan state can dispose of them at will (although a coup de force by the Venezuelan army should not be excluded), but rather because the political organization required for mining can cease to exist once the subsoil resources have been depleted, thereby turning these areas into vulnerable and potentially ephemeral rentier micro-states.",

The data shows a significant rise in green financing, demonstrating CCB's commitment to environmental sustainability, along with improvements in employee diversity, marked by an increased proportion of younger staff and minority staff. The correlation analysis highlights a positive relationship between CSR initiatives and financial outcomes, suggesting that CSR is a crucial factor in driving business success. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of a decade of CSR practices in a leading Chinese commercial bank, emphasizing the importance of regulatory frameworks in guiding CSR activities and demonstrating the positive impact of CSR on financial performance. \nThe insights derived from this study offer valuable implications for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers interested in CSR practices within the banking sector.",
