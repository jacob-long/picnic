          "title": "A Preliminary Data Analysis Workflow for Meta-Analysis of Dependent Effect Sizes",
          "authors": "James E Pustejovsky; Jingru Zhang; Elizabeth Tipton",
          "abstract": "In many fields of application, meta-analyses routinely involve dependent effect size estimates and hierarchical data structures. Statistical methods for analyzing dependent effect sizes are now well developed, but there has been less attention to the initial stages of data analysis, prior to formal modeling. We propose a generic workflow for preliminary, exploratory analyses of meta-analytic databases, which focuses on validating the integrity of the input data and informing decisions about subsequent statistical modeling. The workflow entails creating summaries and visualizations of features of the primary studies included in the meta-analysis in order to understand the structure and distribution of the data, especially with respect to between- and within-study variation. We illustrate the workflow using data from previously published meta-analyses and discuss connections between the preliminary analysis and subsequent statistical modeling strategies.",

          "abstract": "We present a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospect theory (PT) parameter estimates, synthesizing data from 166 papers that report 812 estimates based on the decisions of approximately 52,000 subjects across 69 countries. We develop and implement a novel approach that enables the joint meta-analysis of multiple PT parameters, explicitly modeling potential covariation among them. Our analysis reveals that the average utility curvature (measured via the coefficient of constant relative risk aversion) is 0.33 for gains (95% credible interval [0.31, 0.36]) and 0.29 for losses (CrI [0.25, 0.32]). The average likelihood sensitivity parameter is 0.68 (CrI [0.66, 0.70]), and the average elevation parameter is 0.98 (CrI [0.95, 1.02]). These values align with the stylized facts of PT: diminishing sensitivity to changes in wealth relative to a reference point, and to changes in probabilities moving away from the endpoints of the unit interval. Beyond these central tendencies, we uncover substantial heterogeneity in parameter estimates, limiting the precision of predictions about future parameters. Among the study-level characteristics examined, the measurement method emerges as the most significant predictor of parameter variation, highlighting potential violations of procedural invariance. Nonetheless, a large portion of the heterogeneity remains unexplained even after adjusting for a wide range of study features, suggesting that subtle design differences meaningfully influence behavior. Our results thus offer not only a synthesis of existing findings but also a roadmap for future research.",

          "authors": "Charles Quanfeng Wu",
          "abstract": "At HVEI-2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4—the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the\nneurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

          "abstract": "Among the most significant modes of human creative expression is style: the capacity to represent objects, events, and scenes (e.g., lilies dotting a pond) in some distinctive manner (e.g., Monet’s broken brushstrokes and blended colors). Diverse research traditions analyze the social, political, and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here, we characterize style perception as a process that “parses” form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgments of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception, and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

          "authors": "Essence Leslie; Lauren Patricia Weittenhiller; Ali Frances Sloan; Julia Sheffield",
          "abstract": "Background: The distressing nature of delusional beliefs is considered key to their persistence. One potential mechanism underlying delusional distress is global emotion dysregulation, which refers to a broad deficit in overall emotion regulation and emotional functioning. Global emotion dysregulation is associated with general psychotic symptom severity, but its specific relationship to delusional distress has yet to be closely examined.  \n\nMethods: People with (n = 100) and without (n = 52) schizophrenia-spectrum disorders completed measures of delusional ideation (Peters Delusion Inventory; PDI-21) and global emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS-16). Participants with schizophrenia also completed a measure of delusion severity (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales; PSYRATS). Relationships between delusion severity and global emotion dysregulation were assessed with linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and group. Associations between delusional distress and specific aspects of emotion dysregulation were determined using stepwise linear regression.   \n\nResults: Global emotion dysregulation was significantly elevated in those with schizophrenia compared to healthy comparison participants, across all subscales (p&lt;.001). Global emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with delusional distress on both the PDI-21 (p&lt;.001) and PSYRATS (p&lt;.001). Stepwise regression revealed a specific association between limited access to emotion regulation strategies and delusional distress on both scales (p’s&lt;.001). Delusional distress remained associated with emotion dysregulation when controlling for delusional preoccupation, and emotion dysregulation was not significantly associated with delusional conviction on either scale.  \n\nConclusions: Emotion dysregulation, particularly the sense that there is little one can do to regulate themselves when upset, relates to delusional distress. Interventions that increase access to more emotion regulation strategies may help decrease distress associated with delusional thinking.",

          "authors": "Jocelyn Lai; Nathaniel S Eckland; Renee J. Thompson",
          "abstract": "Research has widely examined the motives, strategies, and effectiveness of explicit emotion regulation, yet the reasons for not regulating emotions have not been elucidated. Extant daily life research suggests individuals may choose not to regulate their emotions as often as they are choosing to regulate them. We examined (1) how often people did not regulate their emotions, (2) the reasons why people chose not to regulate emotions, and (3) which contextual factors were relevant to not regulating. Adults in the Midwest (N=179; Mage=35.34, SDage=12.26) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) five times daily for 14 days, reporting on their largest recent emotional shift over the last three hours, contextual factors regarding this shift, and details about emotion regulation. People reported not regulating about half the time, with the most frequent reasons being that emotions were appropriate or helpful (38%) or were not intense enough (31%). The likelihood of not regulating was associated with more positive affect, less negative affect, greater situational pleasantness, and lower situational importance. People were less likely to regulate when they were alone (versus with other people). This research clarifies an aspect of the emotion regulation process that has been largely overlooked despite frequently occurring. Future research should examine whether reasons are more beneficial than others and if the reasons for not regulating differ across culture and the lifespan.",

Our study aims to examine similarities and differences in historical change of midlife development in self-rated health, health conditions, and grip strength by using harmonized data comprising longitudinal panel surveys from the U.S., Mexico, 13 nations in Europe, South Korea, and China. Results from multilevel models, stratified by gender, revealed historical stability in self-rated health and health conditions for middle-aged men in the U.S., whereas middle-aged women demonstrated historical declines in self-rated health and historical increases in health conditions. Historical improvements in self-rated health were observed for both men and women in England, Mediterranean Europe, Nordic Europe, and China. Historical decreases in health conditions were observed for both men and women in England and Mexico. Both men and women in the U.S. and China exhibited historical declines in grip strength, whereas both men and women in Nordic Europe and South Korea showed historical improvements. Our discussion focuses on better understanding these national gender differences in historical trends by considering how the dynamically changing historical context impacts ways of living and health care systems and the implications for developmental outcomes at the individual and population level.",

          "abstract": "‎ Abstract\n‎ An awareness of human nature, growth, and development at various age levels provides a ‎foundational understanding for religious and educational authorities about the behaviors and ‎functions related to adolescent development. That means adolescence stands for a pivotal transition ‎from childhood to adulthood and understanding human nature during this phase eases understanding ‎behaviors while distinguishing between natural, untrained, and trainable performance. This growth ‎stage is a comprehensive physical, intellectual, emotional, and social development, and awareness of ‎this is essential for parents, educators, and, importantly, the adolescents themselves. This article ‎describes the complex path of adolescent development, which includes physical maturation, ‎cognitive development, emotional regulation, identity formation, and social integration. Given these ‎changes and a complete understanding of the forces affecting adolescent development and the impact ‎of hormonal and developmental changes on their outlook and learning, those who are active in ‎raising and educating adolescents can design and provide more proper educational programs. ‎Additionally, some suggest techniques and strategies that account for this developmental period and ‎the factors that can change education.‎",

This topic was revisited here as a registered replication report with four studies—one direct replication, two direct replications with extensions, and a meta-analysis. The present set of studies, all using the same methods and materials as the original, sampled from a larger and broader pool of faculty than did the original, collectively reflecting the breadth of STEM disciplines at R1 universities across the United States. The reported studies all had higher power to detect smaller effect sizes than in the original. Across these studies, Moss-Racusin et al.’s (2012) findings failed to replicate, and biases were consistently in the opposite direction—favoring female over male applicants (albeit with smaller effect sizes). We discuss the implications of these findings for the broader literature on gender bias in science and its implications for the scientific workforce.",

We used model exploration methods, i.e., Bayesian model exploration, Bayesian model averaging, and elastic-net regression. The study successfully replicated past research supporting the relationship between moral foundations, political orientation, and the moral circle. Additional moral psychological constructs, such as post-conventional moral reasoning and moral identity, significantly predicted the moral circle width. The identified components of the moral circle were conceptually related to phronesis, i.e., practical wisdom. We discussed the educational implications of the findings, particularly those related to moral education focusing on phronesis cultivation, multiculturalism and global citizenship, and climate justice.",

          "abstract": "The Cold Winters Ceiling Theory (CWCT) refines Richard Lynn’s Cold Winters Theory (CWT) by resolving the “Arctic Paradox”—the empirical inconsistency wherein Arctic populations exhibit average IQs (~91) below those of East Asians and Europeans despite experiencing greater cold stress. CWCT posits an ecological ceiling on intelligence gains from cold-driven natural selection, beyond which further cognitive increases confer diminishing adaptive returns. This ceiling ~91 (±3 points, 95% CI) marks the cognitive threshold necessary for civilizational onset but insufficient for further elevation without artificial selection. CWCT introduces a two-phase model: Phase I involves natural selection in cold environments, driving intelligence to the ecological ceiling; Phase II involves civilization-driven selection—via surplus production, institutional filtering, and reproductive stratification—permitting further increases in general intelligence (g). The model is supported by psychometric, historical, and ecological data, and it generates falsifiable predictions regarding cognitive ceilings, institutional effects, and postglacial divergence. CWCT provides a coherent, ecologically grounded framework for understanding the evolution of population-level intelligence across human groups.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that sporting experts show better response inhibition. Less is known about how expert athletes use cognitive inhibition to ‘forget’ previous errors (termed expertise-induced-amnesia). Moreover, whether the relevance of sporting expertise is greater at high-pressure, compared to low-pressure is also unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine if sporting expertise predicted response inhibition (effectiveness and efficiency) and cognitive inhibition (error awareness) and the impact of pressure levels on these relationships. Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

          "abstract": "Binaural beats have gained increasing interest from researchers, particularly regarding their potential effects on cognitive functions such as attention and memory. The present study explored the impact of different binaural beat frequencies (7 Hz, and 40 Hz) relative to a 0 Hz control sound on attention, reading comprehension memory, and mood. A within-subjects experimental design was used, with 48 participants completing a mood assessment, a reading comprehension task, and a global-local attentional processing task while listening to each of the three sounds. Sound order was counterbalanced across participants. The results suggested that 40 Hz binaural beats significantly enhanced reading comprehension accuracy and reduced accuracy differences between congruent and incongruent figures in the global-local task, consistent with a narrowed scope of attention. In contrast, the 7 Hz and control conditions showed no significant effects, and there were no notable effects on mood for any binaural beat sounds. The results are consistent with a neural entrainment mechanism, as gamma-band frequencies have been consistently associated with cognitive performance; however, more research is necessary to further explore and expand these findings.",

We test whether a rank-based nudge (RBN) informing individuals how their post-tax income ranks globally increases charitable donations. Further, because people have been shown to shift their reference point for who should give to charity based on their current income, we inves- tigate whether donations can be boosted by asking how much people with different income ranks should give to charity (in- junctive distribution task, IDT) before administering the RBN. Participants (N = 1,217) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: control, RBN, IDT, or IDT+RBN. Those in the RBN conditions donated significantly more and reduced over- estimation of others’ income across all percentiles of the global income distribution. However, the addition of the IDT did not further increase donations. These findings suggest that RBNs effectively boost generosity by correcting misperceptions of relative affluence.",

Here, thirty participants listened to direct compliments and criticisms spoken in native or foreign accents and rated the speaker's friendliness as their electroencephalogram was recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were examined for (1) vocal speech cues time-locked to statement onset and (2) emotive semantic attributes at the sentence-final word. Criticisms from native speakers were perceived as less friendly than from foreign speakers, whereas compliments did not differ. ERPs revealed listeners rapidly used acoustic information to differentiate speaker identity and evaluative attitude (N100, P200), then selectively monitored vocal attitude expressed by native speakers in the LPP time window. When the evaluative word was heard, native accents contextually modulated early semantic processing (N400). Words of criticism increased the LPP irrespective of accent.

          "abstract": "Co-speech pointing gestures are often observed in infant-directed communication, and these gestures at infants’ early lexical stage can predict their later language development.

Empirical evidence remains inconsistent regarding whether co-speech pointing gestures contribute to infants’ lexical learning through socio-pragmatic functions. Instead, informed by sign language research and the neural processing of pointing gestures, this study offers a novel framework on co-speech pointing gestures in infants’ word learning. Specifically, it argues that such gestures construct a plausible linguistic unit with speech, making the speech interpretable and the referentiality learnable for infants at the early lexical stage.",

We propose a novel, integrative framework for understanding imaginative-narrative simulation—the mental simulation of events, sourced from memory and fiction, and structured through narrative—as a key adaptive capacity. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and media studies, we identify four core functions of this capacity: functions that support (i) planning and future thought, (ii) coping and emotion regulation, (iii) bonding and social needs, and (iv) identity and worldviews. We argue that these functions can importantly support psychological wellbeing, and review a range of empirical studies that have investigated imagination, fiction, and psychological wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic that speak to these effects. We suggest that despite its potential, there is a significant gap in the literature on the adaptive value of imagination and fiction, especially in the context of global crises, and offer concrete directions for future empirical work.",

However, concerns remain about data quality in online settings and the absence of experimenters to ensure participant engagement. In this pre-registered study, we used two tasks—picture naming and reading aloud—to test whether the lexical frequency effect (Low Frequency words &gt; High Frequency words) on speech onset times can be reliably detected in online environments (run at Home), both with and without experimenter supervision. Participants completed the same tasks under four conditions, varying by Supervision (between-subjects: Supervised vs. Unsupervised) and Environment (within-subjects: Lab vs. Home): Lab-Supervised, HomeSupervised, Lab-Unsupervised, and Home-Unsupervised. Frequency effects emerged across all conditions except Home-Supervised for the reading aloud task, where the effect was in the expected direction but non-significant (~12 ms). All other conditions yielded consistent frequency effects (~17–38 ms), comparable to previous online and lab-based findings. Notably, participants were faster at home than in the lab (~10 ms), and unsupervised settings yielded the largest effect sizes, suggesting that experimenter presence may inadvertently dampen subtle effects, possibly due to increased self-monitoring or reduced comfort. These findings validate the use of online platforms for speech production research and highlight the nuanced influence of supervision on experimental outcomes.",

This is the first UK evaluation of the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform, an operationalization of the ICF Core Sets for Autism via an online assessment. In Study 1, 20 Autistic adults were supported to complete the assessment, provide feedback via think-aloud interviews and to evaluate it. In Study 2, which was pre-registered, 464 Autistic adults and 481 Non-Autistic adults completed the assessment independently online and evaluated it. Both studies used a participatory approach. Using standardised questionnaires both studies found the assessment “acceptable” and found usability to be “ok” or better. This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed. The findings suggest the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform has potential as a standardised evidence-based tool to improve understanding of Autistic adults’ strengths and needs.",

          "abstract": "This review investigates the relationship between autism, vulnerability to bullying, and the impact of bullying on mental health for this cohort. Neurotypical social mores can be exclusionary, creating social risks for autistic people, while differences in communication and social engagement can impact peer-to-peer interaction, making autistic people more vulnerable to bullying and social discrimination. The current systematic review investigates risk factors related to the bullying of autistic people, considering both societal and individual factors. It is critical to consider neurotypical social expectations as a risk factor when understanding the bullying of autistic people, rather than simply focusing on traits associated with autism, an approach that furthers a deficit model of thinking. Autistic people are three times more likely to be victimised in comparison to their non-autistic peers, making this a critical social and psychological issue. Bullying was found to lead to the development of depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal, as discussed in this review. The importance of education, creating inclusive environments, building resilience, collaborative efforts, policy and legislation, mental health support, and prevention and protection implications, are discussed. By implementing these strategies, we can work to reduce vulnerability to bullying in autistic people as well as promote their overall well-being. This review emphasises the importance of comprehensive interventions and support systems in combating bullying and improving the lives of autistic people.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM), a unifying psychological framework that models human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "abstract": "Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between innate and acquired traits. In a national study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "Aims: Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with elevated all-cause mortality, with suicide cited as the second leading cause of death among individuals with EDs. Evidence suggests that individuals with anorexia nervosa are 18 times, and those with bulimia nervosa seven times more likely to die by suicide, relative to gender- and aged-matched comparison groups. Limited research has focused on why people with EDs experience such high rates of suicidality. The study aims to gather perspectives from people with lived experience of any ED and clinicians working with EDs to understand suicidality among people with EDs. \nMethods: Using a qualitative design, we conducted semi-structured interviews with people with lived experience of an ED (n=30), and clinicians who work with people with EDs (n=19). Participants with lived experience presented with a range of ED. Clinicians worked across a range of service settings as well as adolescent and adult services. We used a multi-perspective reflexive thematic analysis to code the data and develop the themes. \nResults: Key themes identified include ‘I don’t want to live like this - the burden and impact of having an eating disorder’, ‘Eating disorders don’t stand in isolation - comorbidity and complexity’, ‘There’s a dark side to recovery - recovery as a risk factor’, ‘Suicide isn’t talked about… I felt alone and weird - silence, isolation and stigma’, and 'The only risk they see is weight: suicide as overlooked within services’. These findings underscore the complex and multifaceted reasons why people with EDs are at risk of suicide, acknowledging the unique risk factors associated with the illness itself as well as the various risk periods that affect those with EDs.\nConclusion: These findings provide insight into key mechanisms underlying the association between EDs and suicidality.  Results are novel and are currently not accounted for within current theoretical models of suicide. As such, these findings are early evidence to help us develop a new theory of suicidality for people with EDs, as well as potential intervention targets.",

Numerous published studies have found that stereotype threat might lower mathematics test performance among women. However, many studies used suboptimal designs and analyses; the literature might be subject to publication bias; and the cross-cultural generalizability of the effect remains unknown. This registered replication report describes the result of eight direct replications (total N = 1502) of a representative stereotype-threat study by Johns et al. (2005), who found that threatened women (but not men) underperform when they are confronted with a mathematics test that is presented to measure gender differences, and that this effect can be alleviated by altering test instructions. A multilevel analysis showed no significant interaction effect between stereotype-threat condition and gender, and only an observed gender gap on the mathematics test, with women performing worse than men (d = -0.37; 95%CI[-0.49; -0.25]). The stereotype-threat effect among women was virtually null and not significant (N = 822, d = -0.006; 95% CI[-0.15; 0.14]), and considerably smaller than the original study (N = 45, d = -0.82; 95 %CI[-1.45; -0.18]). Secondary analyses yielded a main effect of gender composition and a random effect of lab, but neither variable affected the interaction between stereotype threat and gender. The current results fail to replicate the stereotype-threat effect by Johns et al. (2005), hence casting doubt on the generalizability of the effect of stereotype threat on women’s mathematics performance.",

Yet, what listeners hear and feel when they find music beautiful, the impact this experience has on them, and wherein lie any important differences between individuals are questions that still lack clear answers. To address these gaps, an online questionnaire was administered to 81 adults. They described their experience of listening to three self-selected “beautiful pieces of music” alongside three pieces they enjoyed listening to but did not consider beautiful; this with a focus on each piece’s sonic features, the emotions induced, and any impact that engaging with the pieces had had on them. Respondents’ personality traits and level of musical training were also collected to explore if these were a source of significant variability in the data. Thematic analysis of text responses found that pieces perceived as beautiful are characterised by both low-level (e.g., slow tempo, soft timbre, low sound level), and high-level features (e.g., composition style, degree of change, complexity levels, repetition); have the ability to calm, evoke pleasant sadness in, and move the listener; and in terms of long-term impact, provide the listener strong emotional support, and provide them inspiration for musical activities. Exploratory, quantitative analyses examining individual differences revealed that participants high in the trait Openness to experience were most concerned with the aesthetic qualities of pieces. Our findings suggest that the experience of musical beauty is a multifaceted phenomenon that can have a profound emotional impact on some individuals, contributing to a more comprehensive account of what it means to experience beauty in music.",

          "abstract": "Intellectual humility (IH), the recognition of one’s intellectual limitations, is a promising characteristic to tackle societal conflicts such as affective political polarization. Despite increasing research on IH in recent years, most research has been conducted in the USA, probably due to a lack of scales that are validated in languages other than English. Our objective was to offer researchers in the German context several IH measures they can choose from depending on their specific research question. Therefore, we validated and compared four established IH scales within the German context. Items of three widely-used IH scales (CIHS, SIHS, LIHS) were translated from English into German by two independent researchers, rated by experts (n = 8), and pre-tested (n = 13). We then assessed structural, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of the scales plus an existing Swiss-German IH scale (IHS) in a preregistered online-survey (N = 698), representative for Germany regarding age, gender, and education. Discriminant validity was assessed via social desirability, cognitive closure, need for cognition, HEXACO honesty-humility, and openness, and incremental validity regarding affective polarization. Results showed that the IHS did not meet all of our pre-registered criteria, potentially due to cross-cultural differences between Germany and Switzerland. However, the three translated scales were comparable to the original English scales regarding structural, convergent, and discriminant validity. The SIHS showed best incremental validity in predicting less affective polarization towards opinion-based outgroups. Limitations and directions for future research regarding IH in German-speaking contexts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Educational inequality is a major challenge for individuals and societies. Prior research indicated that disparities in academic performance, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment tend to widen, as students’ progress through primary and secondary education. Socioeconomic status, immigrant background, ethnicity, geographical location, and gender have consistently emerged as critical drivers of these educational inequalities. Despite extensive research identifying these factors, our understanding of the specific mechanisms by which they influence educational outcomes remains limited. In this report, we share initial findings from a scoping review of longitudinal studies providing quantitative evidence on inequalities in educational outcomes—specifically academic achievement, socio-emotional skills, and educational attainment—among K–12 students across Europe. Our results suggest that the volume of longitudinal research addressing these issues has notably increased. Nonetheless, substantial gaps remain and highlight opportunities for further investigation, for instance, concerning early childhood education, interventions, research in Eastern European contexts, and research exploring how multiple social categories combine to create unique patterns of educational inequality.",

          "authors": "Yuzhan Hang; Zhenhua Ling; Quan Liu; Xiaosong He; Wei Wu",
          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integrated into social and decision-making contexts, understanding how trust is established between humans and AI is essential. This study investigates whether humans and AI differ in how they form and adjust trust based on interactive experience. Using a 50-round trust game, we examined investment behaviors of human participants and ChatGPT-3.5 when paired with either high- or low-trustworthy partners framed as human or AI agents. While humans adjusted trust dynamically—investing more in high-trustworthy and less in low-trustworthy partners over time—AI failed to differentiate partner trustworthiness. Instead, AI consistently preferred human over AI partners, regardless of their behaviour. Notably, humans also demonstrated trust adaptation even when each trial involved a different partner, suggesting generalised social learning beyond specific partner history. In contrast, AI's trust behaviour remained static and unresponsive to contextual changes or unexpected outcomes. These results highlight a fundamental divergence in how humans and AI process social information: humans engage in experience-driven trust calibration, whereas AI responses reflect static patterns that do not update with experience. This misalignment raises critical concerns about the real-world deployment of AI in trust-sensitive roles. Users may mistakenly interpret AI’s apparent prosociality as adaptive, leading to misplaced confidence in its decision-making. We conclude that perceived trustworthiness in AI does not imply behavioural reliability, underscoring the need for transparent AI design and regulation in domains where trust is essential.",

          "abstract": "There is strong evidence demonstrating a link between engagement with live music and health and wellbeing outcomes. However, much of this research focuses on traditional forms of engagement such as playing an instrument, or purposefully using live music as a targeted health intervention. There is limited research exploring the wellbeing consequences of regular gig and/or festival attendance, or the mechanisms for the effects of such attendance. Drawing on the ‘social cure’ approach to group membership and wellbeing, we carried out two complementary studies investigating this relationship through semi-structured interviews (n=20) and a pre-registered cross-sectional survey (n=2,021). In line with the ‘social cure’, results suggest a relationship between regular event attendance and wellbeing, contingent on group processes within the audience (identification, relationality, collective self-realization) as well as support from event staff – a novel finding. Additionally, we observe that individuals who experience attendance-related wellbeing often exhibit affective and behavioural changes that seem to actively reinforce their overall sense of wellbeing. To our knowledge, this finding points to a potential positive-feedback loop between wellbeing and subsequent behaviour that has not been widely reported in existing research.",

This study examines the philosophical roots and scientific applications of mindfulness, highlighting its psychological and cognitive contributions to human flourishing. It introduces a novel conceptual framework that identifies harmony as a key outcome of mindfulness practice. The Unified Harmony Framework (Zhao, 2025) defines harmony through three interconnected facets: coexistence, coherence, and continuity, which operate at three levels—Me Harmony (intrapersonal), We Harmony (interpersonal), and Eco Harmony (environmental). Through offering a nuanced conceptual and empirical analysis of mindfulness from the lens of harmony, the study advances a more holistic understanding of mindfulness and suggests new directions for research, intervention, practice, and policy aimed at promoting individual and collective flourishing.",

          "abstract": "Human wellbeing, deeply intertwined with human behaviors, has experienced a notable surge, with positive psychology emerging as a promising approach to enhancement. The integration of positive psychology with technology holds substantial potential; however, few studies have fully leveraged the pedagogical potential of technologies to foster wellbeing. Additionally, there is a lack of positive psychology interventions aimed at young adults in non-Western contexts. This study addresses these gaps by developing, implementing, and validating WeThrive, a technology-integrated, culturally adapted positive psychology intervention tailored for Asian young adults. A central feature of WeThrive is its integrated online co-creation approach. A mixed-methods approach with a pre-post-follow-up design was employed to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results from quantitative analyses demonstrated that WeThrive significantly improved young adults’ overall wellbeing, positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment, while reducing negative feelings. Qualitative analyses identified key factors contributing to the effectiveness of WeThrive, including active engagement in meaningful co-creations, social connection, and positivity and agency. Findings of the study provide new insights into the effectiveness of integrating online co-creation in positive psychology interventions, particularly in an Asian context. It enriches the understanding of the use of computers by broadening knowledge of its psychological effects. Furthermore, it highlights online co-creation as an effective component in designing wellbeing enhancement strategies.",

          "abstract": "From infancy to adulthood, habituation and dishabituation enable learners to filter out repetitive information and orient to novel information. Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Janna Wennberg",
          "abstract": "Noise can reduce the intelligibility of spoken language and increase the effort necessary to understand speech. Listening effort, “the deliberate allocation of mental resources to overcome obstacles in goal pursuit when carrying out a [listening] task” (Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016), is commonly assessed by measuring response times to secondary tasks while listening to speech or by testing memory for the content of the speech. Increasing the level of background noise tends to slow responses and impair memory, and these effects are attributed to the resource-intensive process of reevaluating speech that was initially obscured or misheard. However, given that noise can impair performance on cognitive tasks that do not require processing auditory information, it is possible that noise-induced impairments typically ascribed to processing degraded speech may instead reflect increased cognitive load from the presence of noise itself. The current study assessed whether noise, in the absence of a speech task, can affect performance on tasks intended to measure listening effort. In Experiment 1 (positive control), target speech consisting of single words was presented aurally in background noise and we measured listening effort with three commonly-used paradigms. Experiment 2 was identical except that the target words were presented orthographically rather than aurally. Results showed that noise impaired performance on all three tasks when the target stimuli were presented aurally, consistent with a large body of work in the listening effort literature. Experiment 2 revealed that performance on some tasks was impaired by the presence of masking noise (particularly two-talker babble), indicating some domain-general interference. However, the magnitude of the noise-induced interference effects were markedly smaller in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, suggesting that measures of listening effort capture variability attributable to the challenges associated with listening to speech in noise, and do not simply measure distraction or noise-induced cognitive interference.",

Little is known about the mechanisms behind, functionality of, and impact of masking. This qualitative study aimed to examine the experiences of masking within a female sample who identified with autistic traits. Six female participants were invited to take part in individual semi-structured interviews on their experiences of masking.  Reflexive Thematic Analysis was utilised to gather a deeper understanding into the practicalities and impact of masking behaviours, aiming to answer the research question: How are masking behaviours experienced in females who display autistic traits?  Three core themes were identified following analysis: ‘The Innate Fear of Judgement’, ‘Deconstructing Normality’, and ‘Self-Identification and Self-Efficacy’.  Results show females identifying with autistic traits who engage in masking may experience higher difficulty than their peers throughout their social connectedness, experience of diagnosis, general life and educational experiences. Further work is needed to consider how best to support this population.",

          "abstract": "There continues to be growing interest in the Science of Learning including identifying ways to apply findings. Presently, little is known about learning during healthy adulthood and methods to improve that learning. The main objective of the present systematic review is to identify and synthesize all recent cognitive and brain research investigating learning during healthy aging in adulthood. Searches were performed across Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases to identify published and unpublished studies conducted in healthy adults. Eligible studies reported measures of learning-related cognition, brain structure or function and their relationship with age, or effects of interventions to improve learning. Risk of bias was assessed using either the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool or Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Search and screening were performed by three trained reviewers. Included studies were summarized using narrative synthesis and, for intervention studies, an effect direction plot. A total of 265 relevant studies were identified for inclusion. Studies were primarily lab-based cross-sectional studies conducted in Western contexts. Findings revealed an overall decline in learning-related cognitive and brain outcomes during healthy aging. However, declines were more pronounced in fluid abilities and explicit learning and memory while crystalized abilities and implicit learning and memory showed stability. Generally, higher education and socioeconomic status positively modulated age-related learning trajectories while baseline cognitive function influenced the effectiveness of interventions. Findings from the present systematic review are potentially limited by the exclusive focus on healthy aging and the small number of included studies conducted in non-Western contexts. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "Reward-predictive items capture attention even when they are irrelevant to current goal. While previous studies suggest that value-driven attention generalizes to items sharing critical reward-associated features (e.g., red), recent findings propose an alternative generalization mechanism based on context-dependent feature relationships (e.g., redder). Here, we examined whether the relational coding of reward-associated features is commonly utilized across different learning contexts, particularly those engaging different attention modes (singleton search vs. feature-specific search) and varying levels of stimulus similarity (low vs. high target-distractor similarity). Focusing on value-driven attention based on feature relationships, our results showed that singleton search training led to value-driven relational attention that was independent of target-distractor similarity (Experiment 1a and 1b, n = 40 each). In contrast, feature-specific search training produced value-driven relational attention only when the target was dissimilar to the distractors, but not when they were similar (Experiment 2a – 2c, n = 40 each). Our findings suggest that when the learning task required only coarse selection (e.g., singleton search or feature-specific search among dissimilar items), a relational code for reward-associated feature was formed. However, when fine selection was necessary (e.g., feature-specific search among similar items), a more precise feature code was utilized. Thus, we propose that the precision of target selection during reward learning critically shapes value-driven attentional mechanisms.",

We also systematically manipulated various factors such as the list length, study time, delay, and stimulus type, and tested a large sample to examine the robustness of the effect (i.e., radical randomization). Results showed evidence for a list-length effect across the conditions, and we find that the square root function best describes the list-length effect. By utilizing a computational model we also show that although the list-length effect exists, there is, in general, a greater amount of interference stemming from other sources in recognition memory (e.g., previous contexts).",

          "abstract": "The human visual system can quickly process groups of objects (ensembles) and build compressed representations of their features. What does the conscious perception of ensembles consist of? Observers‘ explicit access to ensemble representations has been considered very limited – any distributional aspects beyond simple summary statistics, such as the mean or variance, cannot be explicitly accessed. In contrast, we demonstrate that the visual system can represent ensemble distributions in detail, and observers have reliable explicit access to these representations. In our new paradigm (Feature Frequency Report), observers viewed 36 disks of various colors for 800 ms and then reported the frequency of a randomly chosen color using a slider. The sets had Gaussian, uniform, or bimodal color distributions with a random mean color. The distributions of responses – both aggregated and separate for each observer – followed the shape of the presented distribution. Modeling revealed that performance reflected integrated information from the whole set rather than sub-sampling. After only brief exposure to a color set, the visual system can build detailed representations of feature distributions that observers have explicit access to. This result necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how ensembles are processed. We suggest that such distribution representations are the most natural way for the visual system to represent groups of objects. Explicit feature distribution representations may contribute to people‘s impression of having a rich perceptual experience despite severe attentional and working memory limitations.",

Previous diachronic accounts have used the comparative method to argue that either the voice function or the nominalization function of the voice affixes should be reconstructed to Proto-Austronesian (PAn). In this paper, we use internal reconstruction to lay out a tentative alternative. First, we assume that both the voice and nominalization functions go back to PAn. Second, we suggest that the non-active voice affixes originated in Pre-PAn as prepositions, and were later incorporated into the verb complex as postverbs. The nominalizing function, on the other hand, arose through an inter-stage with compounds. This proposal accounts for several properties of AVS, including the prominence of arguments promoted to subject position and the subject-only restriction, and is supported by a typological parallel in Dinka.",

          "abstract": "Studies of cognitive control using tasks with isolated (single-item) vs. multiple (multi-item) item\npresentation have shown that multi-item tasks may be more effective in capturing limitations of\nthe cognitive control system arising from capacity constraints. Importantly, during multi-item\ntasks, performance decreases but does not collapse, consistent with effective management of\ncognitive overload. This has been interpreted by positing a strategic shift from a more parallel to\na more serial processing, whereby the processing of the current item is prioritized over\nupcoming items, termed lockout scheduling. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining\nwithin-task modulations of eye-voice span (EVS) measures and articulation duration in multiitem color naming tasks with and without internal interference (i.e., incongruent and neutral\nStroop conditions). We hypothesized that lockout scheduling would manifest itself across\nmeasures and conditions as the task progresses and cognitive overload emerges. The results\nshowed dynamic changes in both EVS and articulation measures as a function of time-on-task,\nconsistent with the gradual implementation of a lockout scheduling strategy in response to\nemerging cognitive overload. The observed patterns indicate that the shift from a more parallel\nto a more serial processing is not an all-or-none phenomenon but a dynamic interplay between\ngaze, voice, and covert (i.e., parafoveal) attention, affecting online decisions about spatial\ndistance, timing, and processing resource allocation.",

Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. Our model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries that context-based inter-item similarity could not explain, highlighting the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

          "authors": "AbdulRafeh Usmani",
          "abstract": "Modern lifestyles often rely on alarm clocks that disrupt the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle, yet their physiological consequences remain underexplored. This case study investigates the effects of alarm-induced waking versus natural waking on key physiological and cognitive parameters: heart rate, core body temperature, and reaction time. Over a two-week observational period, a 21-year-old male participant tracked biometric data during days involving alarm use and days without. Heart rate was measured using a smartwatch, core temperature with an oral thermometer, and cognitive vigilance via reaction-time trials on a mobile app. Results show that alarm-induced waking was associated with higher waking heart rates (mean: 61.5 bpm vs. 58.75 bpm), lower core body temperature (36.4°C vs. 36.55°C), and slower reaction times (mean: 0.372 sec vs. 0.315 sec) compared to free days. Sleep timing analysis revealed approximately 1.5 hours of social jetlag, defined as the discrepancy between mid-sleep time on workdays and free days. These findings suggest that alarm clocks interfere with physiological readiness by interrupting circadian-regulated processes such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular balance, and cognitive arousal. While limited by a single-subject design, this study demonstrates measurable physiological disruption from alarm clock use and reinforces the importance of aligning sleep schedules with biological rhythms.",

          "abstract": "Engaging in music practice is often assumed to increase empathy and prosociality. However, data in support of this relationship are limited, leaving unclear which components of empathy (cognitive empathy, emotional contagion, and emotional disconnection) and prosocial behaviors, if any, would be affected. Here, we recruited musicians with more than 2 years of musical experience (n = 80) and nonmusicians (n = 89) to measure empathy (using subjective and objective measures) and prosociality (using economic games). We hypothesized that musicians would score higher than nonmusicians on empathy and prosociality, and that musicians who practice more would show greater effects. Using classical and Bayesian analyses of variance (ANOVAs), we found no difference between musicians and nonmusicians in empathy and prosociality, and no correlation with the amount of practice. Exploratory analyses revealed associations between the age of onset of music practice and empathy, suggesting that it is not music practice per se but specifically its initiation in early life that could be linked to empathy. These findings challenge the common assumption that music practice in general increases empathy and prosociality and invites to explore in which specific contexts music practice does so (e.g., particular age ranges or group-based settings).\n\nNote.

          "authors": "Carlos Daniel Carrasco; Marian Berryhill; Kevin T. Jones",
          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) performance declines across the lifespan, partly due to greater vulnerability to environmental distraction. WM requires resistance to distractors, which may enter WM due to ineffective filtering during simultaneous presentation with targets, as in a spatial array during WM encoding. Alternatively, distractors may enter WM due to insufficient ability to ignore them when they are presented during WM maintenance. Current research disagrees about whether a deficit in distractor suppression accounts for older adults’ impaired WM performance, or not. Beyond these differing perspectives, it is unclear whether WM performance is vulnerable to different types of distractors, including those that are novel versus familiar, or high versus low saliency. Across three behavioral experiments we found that participants were more vulnerable to distractors presented during encoding than those presented during maintenance, with stronger effects in older adults. Distractor familiarity and saliency had minimal impact on WM performance, and patterns of results did not change across trials. Rather than providing converging evidence these data expand the pattern of distractor-related WM deficits observed in older adults.",

          "authors": "Marco Del Giudice",
          "abstract": "The evolution of heritable individual differences (for example in personality, cognition, and the risk for psychopathology) is the subject of a long-running debate between proponents of adaptive and non-adaptive explanations. Newly available genomic data show that most quantitative traits conform to what I label the “default genetic architecture,” characterized by extreme polygenicity with contributions from both common and rare variants, with large-effect variants that tend to be rarer and younger than small-effect ones. Furthermore, targeted tests of balancing selection return largely null or negative results. These findings indicate widespread purifying selection at the genetic level; they have led some scholars to argue that heritable individual differences are essentially non-adaptive or maladaptive, and that evolutionary hypotheses that invoke balancing selection are inconsistent with the data. Here I show that this strong interpretation is not warranted. I distinguish between four questions about the evolution of heritable individual differences, and explain why the data do not support sweeping inferences about their adaptive function (or lack thereof). I also discuss why tests of balancing selection are much less informative than is often believed. While the pervasive role of purifying selection is beyond dispute, the default architecture of complex traits is potentially compatible with a broad range of evolutionary scenarios, including scenarios in which heritable individual differences can be adaptive and functional rather than just manifestations of neutral/maladaptive noise.",

          "abstract": "Two leading models of numerosity judgments describe numerical representations as Gaussian distributions on a mental number line. The linear model posits that both numerosity and variability increase linearly with number, while the logarithmic model assumes logarithmic scaling with constant variability. In this study, we use the selective sampling account, which proposes that information is gathered selectively based on goals and available resources, to explore the cognitive processes underlying variations in variability and scaling. In intermingled displays of blue and yellow dots (B/Y task), participants relied on incomplete representations of dots positioned near the center, where spatial resolution is highest, leading to increasing variability with set size. In contrast, spatially separated displays (L/R task) facilitated more comprehensive sampling, resulting in approximately constant variability across set sizes. Behavioral patterns and modeling analyses suggest that linear and logarithmic scaling capture sensitivity differences shaped by the display format and spatial resolution demands. Eye-tracking data further support our account, emphasizing the role of selective attention in forming numerical representations and providing a unified framework for understanding variability and scaling across tasks.",

A central case suggesting it can, is evidence showing that knowledge about a color-diagnostic object’s typical color can influence its appearance. For example, a grey banana is allegedly perceived with a tint of yellow. However, methodological and conceptual considerations, leave it unclear whether the purported “memory-color” effect actually reflects changes in perception or changes in judgment and responses instead. Here, we combine memory-color with binocular rivalry to test if top-down influences affect the color an object is perceived in. We showed 24 participants familiar objects in their typical and opponent color and asked for concurrent reports of the perceived color. Consistent with Bayesian models of rivalry, we observed that conscious perception of identical spectral color pairs was biased towards the typical color of the presented object. Our results suggest that prior knowledge aids interpretation of ambiguous stimuli and biases conscious perception towards the most plausible interpretation.",

To address this shortcoming we describe, evaluate, and demonstrate how a rule-based computer system can be used to implement item-writing guidelines in order to efficiently and accurately evaluate the quality of multiple-choice test items. The rule-based system was evaluated by comparing the ratings from a human reviewer with the rule-based system on a sample of test items resulting in almost perfect agreement demonstrating that the system can identify common multiple-choice item flaws. The system was also used to identify the item flaws found in a large sample of 1078 operational test items written in the content areas of research methods, statistics, child development, and educational psychology. The most common flaw was the logical ordering of options followed by grammar and spelling errors. Directions for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Despite theoretical reasons to think that occupation plays a role in life satisfaction (LS), empirical evidence on the association is surprisingly limited. Moreover, because LS closely tracks personality traits, not controlling for these has left the existing results inconclusive. In pre-registered analyses, we examined occupational differences in LS and job satisfaction (JS) among 59,000 Estonian Biobank participants who represented 263 occupations, controlling for demographic variables and comprehensively assessed personality traits. Jobs differed in LS and JS before (η2 = .05 and η2 = .07, respectively) and even after adjusting for all covariates (η2 = .01 to .02 and η2 = .06, respectively). Various medical professionals, psychologists, special needs teachers, and self-employed individuals tended to have the highest LS levels, whereas security guards, survey interviewers, waiters, sales workers, mail carriers, carpenters, and chemical engineers tended to score the lowest. Jobs with the highest JS included religious professionals, various medical professionals, and authors, while kitchen, transport, storage, and manufacturing labourers, survey interviewers, and sales workers were among the least satisfied with their jobs. Exploratory analyses suggested that income and O*NET-derived job characteristics, such as interest orientations like realistic, enterprising, and conventional, could explain some of the satisfaction variance among occupations.

Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process-mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = 0.82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.",

          "abstract": "Children acquire gender stereotypes at a young age and these subsequently influence cognition and behavior. Stereotypes may be learned through a child’s direct observation of gender differences as well as perpetuated by inaccurate cultural depictions. Children’s mass media, a cultural product, may be a powerful source of gender stereotype perpetuation. This research investigated the presence and impact of an inaccurate gender stereotypic association of predator animals as male and prey animals as female. Study 1 investigated predator-male and prey-female stereotypes in children’s films featuring anthropomorphized animal characters (N = 1892). After accounting for a 75% male character bias, there was a disproportionately high number of predators assigned male and prey assigned female. Study 2 created explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female association measures and tested these on children (N = 132, aged 4-14-years) and adults (N = 99, aged 18-65 years). Both groups showed a male character bias, along with strong explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female associations. Children had higher explicit scores than adults, whereas adults had higher implicit scores than children, but there were no discernible differences in children’s responses across this wide age range, suggesting that this gender stereotype is embedded early in development. Inaccurate gender stereotypes in children’s media correspond to explicit and implicit gender stereotyping. This suggests that children can acquire stereotypes indirectly through exposure to cultural products alone and implies a bi-directional relationship between individual cognition and cultural level gender stereotyping.",

          "abstract": "We advance a novel formulation of cognitive control within the active inference framework. The theory proposes that cognitive control amounts to optimising a precision parameter, which acts as a control signal and balances the contributions of deliberative and habitual components of action selection. To illustrate the theory, we simulate a driving scenario in which the driver follows a well-known route, but encounters unexpected challenges. Our simulations show that a standard active inference model can form adaptive habits; i.e., can pass from deliberative to habitual control when the context is stable, but generally fails to revert to deliberative control, when the context changes. To address this failure of context-sensitivity, we introduce a novel type of hierarchical active inference, in which a lower level is responsible for behavioural control and the higher (or meta-cognitive) level observes the belief updating of the lower level below and is responsible for cognitive control. Crucially, the meta-cognitive level can both form habits and suspend them, by controlling the (precision) parameter that prioritizes deliberative choices at the behavioural level. Furthermore, we show that several processes linked to cognitive control — such as surprise detection, cognitive conflict monitoring, control signal regulation and specification, the simulation of future outcomes and the assessment of the costs of control and mental effort — stem coherently from the free energy minimization scheme that underpins active inference. Finally, we discuss the putative neurobiology of cognitive control by simulating brain dynamics in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the dopamine system, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the locus coeruleus.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked intense debate across multiple academic disciplines. While some argue that LLMs represent a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even machine consciousness (inflationary claims), others dismiss them as mere trickster artifacts lacking genuine cognitive abilities (deflationary claims). We argue that both extremes may be shaped or exacerbated by common cognitive biases, including cognitive dissonance, wishful thinking, and the illusion of depth of understanding, which distort reality to our own advantage. By showcasing how these distortions may easily emerge in both scientific and public discourse, we advocate for a measured approach— skeptical open mind - that recognizes the cognitive abilities of LLMs as worthy of scientific investigation while remaining conservative concerning exaggerated claims regarding their cognitive status.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications on organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty and the most classical economic approaches emphasize the use of punishment by focusing on both the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”) and the severity (“what fine will be imposed?”) of punishment, respectively. However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. Here, we suggest to provide a high-powered online study (N = 630) collecting UK-based Prolific participants in which we manipulate (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earns money for the individual or for the group), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual is punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). The study will shed light on the interplay between individual or group decision making and the specifics of punishment as well as advance the understanding under which conditions punishment might be effective in curbing dishonesty.",

          "abstract": "To sustainably manage our shared resources, we must learn to cooperate with each other and develop more sustainable behaviour over time. However, previous research has found that participants play repeated resource dilemma games less sustainably over time. Improving our understanding of the cause of this is vital to inform policy advocating sustainability. One hypothesis is that increasingly unsustainable behaviour is driven by a few uncooperative actors – if a few act unsustainably then other individuals reciprocate. Alternatively, given the environmental and social uncertainty often found in collective action problems, individuals might struggle to learn to act sustainably even if other uncooperative actors are removed. Here, we experimentally juxtapose these two hypotheses. Over two incentive-compatible experiments involving monetary payments (Experiments 1) and earned tickets to a raffle (Experiment 2), 351 participants played three consecutive resource dilemma games with three computer partners who collectively deployed a conditionally cooperative ('tit-for-tat') strategy (i.e. where one cooperates if others cooperate, but defects if others defect). The best strategy for the participant was to learn to sustain the resource, maximizing the long-term gains of each player. By the third game, only 9.12% of participants were able to use the resource sustainably. We demonstrate that this failure is likely due to difficulty learning the social and environmental dynamics at play. These results suggest that most struggle to learn to act sustainably even when interacting with partners who are willing to cooperate, illuminating a systemic difficulty with learning to act sustainably over time.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) usage related to sexualized images amongst adolescents is a critical emerging research area.  In this exploratory study, a nationally representative online survey of 577 English-speaking individuals aged 13 - 17 was conducted.  Participants were asked about their consensual and non-consensual usage and interactions with sexualized GenAI images.  The survey included questions on images created with nudification software as well as content creation software, and asked participants about their creation, sharing, and viewing of this content, as well as that of their peers.  Use of nudification tools was widespread, with 55.3% (n=328) of participants reporting having created and 54.4% (n=323) having received at least one image.  Reported victimization levels of participants was substantial, with 36.3% (n=222) of individuals reporting having a non-consensual image created and 33.2% (n=205) of individuals having had at least one image non-consensually shared.  Usage was similar across demographic categories, though male participants had higher degrees of regular GenAI sexual image creation and distribution, both consensual and non-consensual.  Policymakers need to consider the extensive usage and its normalization and consider educational interventions, and practitioners need to be aware of the high degree and nature of victimization occurring.",

          "authors": "Patrick Sandoz",
          "abstract": "False and denied pregnancies are insufficiently understood mental health disorders affecting women. Denied pregnancies in particular can result in unexpected births, putting both mother and child at risk. Improved understanding is therefore required to address these public health concerns. This paper is rooted in Darwin’s theory of evolution of species. As humans, we are a highly social species. However, our earliest land ancestors were instinct-driven solitary animals. These oviparous animals reproduced by depositing their fertilized eggs in favourable locations. They were progenitors but not parents. The emergence of parenting traits facilitated the transition from solitary to social life, fostering the inherent interdependence of individuals. Humans are relational psychological beings housed in separate physical bodies. This physical-relational duality, or physiological-psychological duality, is inherent to our evolution. It can create conflict by opposing physical reality to paradoxical psychological demands. Such conflicts are likely to affect pregnancy that triggers major changes in both physiology and psychology. Furthermore, pregnancy is a parental trait where the pregnant woman, as a relational being, supports an immature dependent. We explain false and denied pregnancies as temporary and fictitious responses to such intractable conflicts. A single conflict formulation is assigned to each disorder: An imperative need for motherhood in a non-pregnant woman for false pregnancy; and a psychological inability to accept impending motherhood in a pregnant woman for denial of pregnancy. It is hoped that these clear starting points will help clinicians to explore the factual causes of these disorders in their patients on a case-by-case basis.",

          "authors": "Rita Abdel Sater; Coralie Chevallier",
          "abstract": "Behavioral interventions, such as green nudges, are increasingly used to promote pro-environmental behaviors and address climate change. While these interventions are cost-effective and preserve individual autonomy, they can raise significant equity concerns. Green nudges, unlike most other nudges, often impose private costs to yield collective environmental gains. Given that low-income individuals contribute less to pollution and given that many green behaviors, such as purchasing eco-friendly products or offsetting carbon emissions, involve higher financial costs, the burden of green nudges can end up being unfair to the poorest segments of the population. In addition, this issue can be exacerbated if people living in poverty are more susceptible to the psychological biases that are leveraged by nudges. We review this evidence and show that the same nudge is likely to have a stronger effect on poorer people, which will further compound fairness issues in the case of costly green nudges. We conclude by arguing that policymakers must pay specific attention to the distributive impacts of green nudges. Future research should further investigate the psychological mechanisms that drive heterogeneous responses to green nudges. If these challenges are addressed both in policy and research, green nudges can contribute to equitable and effective climate policies that balance collective goals with individual fairness.",

          "abstract": "Induced-hypocrisy, a cognitive dissonance paradigm, effectively promotes prosocial behaviors through a two-step procedure. First, a person advocates for a prosocial behavior and then recalls their past failures to comply with it, which prompts the person to adopt the behavior. Initially, the explanation for such hypocrisy effect focused on restoring a positive self-image threatened by past transgressions. A recent theoretical explanation, suggest that behavioral change results from the perceived discrepancy between social norms and transgressive behavior. Our five-study experimental program (Total N = 774) was designed to test whether the process of social norm deviation underlies the hypocrisy effect. Results showed the influence of social norms strength on the hypocrisy effect (Studies 1, 2, 3) and the mediating effect of perceived social norm deviation in increasing prosocial behaviors consecutive to the hypocrisy procedure (Studies 4a and 4b). An integrative analysis (N = 602) of Studies 1, 2 and 4a, as well as two additional datasets, confirmed the influence of social norms in producing the hypocrisy effect. Taken together, these results strongly support social norm deviation as a key process underlying the hypocrisy effect, in that participants with stronger social normative beliefs exhibit a more pronounced hypocrisy effect due to a greater perceived deviation from social norms. These experimental findings constitute a significant contribution to understanding and improving the hypocrisy effect. They are discussed from both theoretical and practical perspectives, questioning the implication of the self and the affiliation motivation in this social norm deviation process and emphasizing the relevance of reinforcing social norms in contexts where transgressions are less salient, such as in discrimination prevention.",

Here, we address three limitations of this\nliterature. First, we contrast the dominant theoretical perspective of self-improvement with\nself-acceptance as pathways to reduce the discrepancy between current and ideal personality.\nSecond, we test how well-being aspects change as a by-product of targeting personality.\nThird, we use a waitlist control group to account for expectancy and demand effects. Across\nthree studies (combined N = 2,094; 1,044 women, 1,050 men; M_age = 30.74, SD_age = 9.57,\nrange_age = 18-75), we implemented randomized online interventions of self-improvement or\nself-acceptance over a 3-month period, with another follow-up 6 months after baseline and a\nwaitlist control group added in Study 2. Across Studies 1 and 2, participants in both\nintervention groups reduced discrepancies between current and ideal personality and\nincreased in well-being. In both intervention groups, current personality increased, whereas\nideal personality remained stable. Critically, however, control group participants changed\nsimilarly, with no significant differences in change compared to participants who received the\ninterventions. Study 3 compared different control group specifications and highlighted that\nthe intervention recruitment framing might have induced selection effects and expectancy and\ndemand effects leading to positive changes in neuroticism, conscientiousness, and\nextraversion as well as life satisfaction and self-esteem.

The Re-Connection Hypothesis proposes that this drive ultimately guides Homo sapiens to discover and ritually employ N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).  Rather than postulating that the brain must “self-flood” with DMT, we argue that cortical circuitry is pre-tooled—analogous to dormant Wi-Fi hardware—to respond to modest, externally supplied DMT and switch awareness to a non-material information domain we term the Transcendent.  Three empirical anchors motivate the model: (i) conserved expression of the DMT-synthesising enzyme INMT across mammals; (ii) widespread occurrence of DMT-rich plants; (iii) reproducible, network-reset phenomenology at low–moderate exogenous doses.  Drawing on signalling-bias pharmacology, receptor-reserve experiments, and ethnobotanical convergences, we articulate testable predictions—including a “low-threshold, high-gain” 5-HT2A circuit assay—and sketch preregistered study designs.

          "abstract": "Humans across time and culture invest scarce resources—fasting in deserts, silent temple retreats, whirling in sacred halls, multi-night plant ceremonies—to achieve states “beyond” the day-to-day hive of work, consumption, and status. Conventional drives (survival, power, meaning, truth) cannot explain this costly impulse or the durable drop in material striving that follows. We propose a fifth, previously unidentified human drive—the Will to Transcendence (WT)—which ripens slowly, can be fulfilled repeatedly or for extended spans, and reliably reorders priorities toward sufficiency, service, and ecological care. Cross-cultural rituals (e.g. Vision Quests, Zen ango, Sufi dhikr, ayahuasca dietas) and meta-analytic evidence (N = 3,412; g ≈ |0.3|) document a “material-detachment” signature. Neuroimaging studies link WT states to default-mode network deactivation, suggesting a neural mechanism for ego-dissolution. We sketch a cultural feedback loop by which private transcendence seeds ethical systems (poverty vows, alms economies, ecological taboos), catalog genuine gateways versus “false victories” (luxury highs, social-media fame), and offer low-dose N,N-DMT as a high-priority mechanistic hypothesis.

          "abstract": "Visual relational concepts—defined by patterns of relationships between entities—are thought to require structured, compositional representations with explicit role information about each entity. Analogical mapping over compositional representations is a key strategy for acquiring such concepts, but in complex situations with many entities and relations, this process can be cognitively demanding. As a result, learning may occur over feature-based representations, where exemplars are encoded as unstructured lists of entities and relations, losing crucial role information and limiting generalizability. To reduce the cognitive load of analogical mapping, we explored the effectiveness of two visuospatial training aids: (1) spatially organizing exemplars by category to facilitate comparisons, and (2) using color coding to highlight the roles of entities within each exemplar. Across three experiments, we examined whether these visuospatial aids improve learning rates on the Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test (SVRT), a collection of 23 problems that require learning relational concepts. Our results showed that displays of previous instances that spatially sorted them into positive and negative sets led to faster concept learning. Learning was faster overall when problems were ordered easy-to-hard rather than randomly, but sorted displays were more effective in either case. Color coding proved beneficial only when colors unambiguously and non-redundantly linked entities that played corresponding roles; when color coding did not support a clear mapping, it interfered with learning. These findings suggest that rapid learning of relational concepts can be facilitated by display characteristics that support analogical mapping by comparisons.",

          "abstract": "The effects of using social media platforms remain hotly debated, but insufficient research has\nfocused on how individuals are defining what social media is. Here, we consider how different\nunderstandings of the term “social media” may influence how people think and talk about social\nmedia experiences and effects. To test this, we asked a nationally representative sample of adults\nin the United States (N = 1904) to indicate whether twelve popular platforms are “social media.”\nOur results revealed significant variation in the identification of “social media”— with general\nagreement that six platforms are social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Snapchat,\nand TikTok) and a lack of consensus about the other six (Telegram, Signal, Discord, WhatsApp,\nand Messenger, and YouTube). Younger participants were more likely to view four platforms as\nsocial media (Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok), whereas older participants were more\nlikely to view six platforms as social media (Reddit, YouTube, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, and\nMessenger). Additionally, we examined the correlates of holding broad vs. narrow social media\nschemata, finding that individuals with broader schemas perceived hate speech to be more\nprevalent on social media. Looking forward, we discuss how the lack of consensus around the\nterm “social media” may affect how people respond to survey questions about social media, as\nwell as perceive and converse about their effects and policy implications in society.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to understand how aging influences cognitive and mentalizing processes, and to explore whether physical activity protects against cognitive and social function decline in older adults. A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "authors": "Kenneth Pargament; Julie J. Exline; Richard Cowden; Joshua Adam Wilt",
          "abstract": "Adversity impacts people not only psychologically, socially, and physically, but spiritually as well.  In times of stress, many people experience spiritual struggles, defined as tensions, strains, and conflicts about spiritual matters within oneself, with other people, and/or with the supernatural.  In well over 100 empirical studies, spiritual struggles have been robustly linked to psychological problems.  However, because much of the research on this topic has been cross-sectional, a key question remains:  Are spiritual struggles the cause of psychological problems (the primary model of spiritual struggles), the effect of psychological problems (the secondary model of spiritual struggles) or both a cause and effect of psychological problems (the complex model of spiritual struggles)? This paper reviews emerging longitudinal research that examines this causal question and, more specifically, the three models of the causal relationship between spiritual struggles and psychological problems.  The findings show the strongest support for the primary model of spiritual struggles (the model that has been tested most often).  Research has also shown modest support for the secondary and complex models of spiritual struggles; however, more studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for further study and for practical work with people who are struggling spiritually.",

          "authors": "Michael Ferketic",
          "abstract": "For decades, attention has been framed as a selection process emphasizing what is attended to rather than how engagement is structured. Neither traditional models, such as the spotlight metaphor, nor prevailing theories that emphasize stimulus-driven selection fully account for the modulation, density, and volitional control of awareness. This framework introduces focal energy as the structuring force of awareness, defining how perception and attention is actively shaped through its placement, intensity, density, and stability on the conscious field. By conceptualizing attention as the deployment and modulation of focal energy, this model reframes focus as both a selective and generative autonomous cognitive force rather than a passive filter. The constellation model of focus further expands this concept, recognizing attention’s nature as a distributed arrangement of nodes of concentrated awareness, dynamically shifting in intensity and engagement dynamics across perceptual and cognitive fields. This represents a foundational shift in attentional research, offering a precise operational mechanism of function rather than just descriptive attributes. While phenomenologically articulated from first principles, this framework opens itself to empirical validation, providing testable structures for neuroimaging, behavioral studies, and attentional endurance research. By redefining focus as a structured, volitionally governed force, this model bridges attention, cognitive autonomy, and volitional control while unlocking a deeper understanding of how consciousness is actively sculpted rather than passively received.",

Operating as internal impressive action, it passively introduces impulses, biases, and associative framings into consciousness, subtly guiding behavior without volitional approval. Like hypnotic suggestion, it does not dictate action; it attempts to compel through motivational pull, inﬂuencing perception and intent through saliency and potency gradients. Unlike previous theories that depict subconscious inﬂuence as abstract or deterministic, this work presents a novel structured, mechanistic, operational model of function, demonstrating from ﬁrst principles how subconscious suggestion disperses inﬂuence into awareness, interacts with attentional deployment, and negotiates attentional sovereignty. Additionally, it frames free will not as exemption from subconscious force, but as mastery of its regulation, with autonomy emerging from the ability to recognize, reﬁne, and command suggestive forces rather than be unconsciously governed by them.",

Moreover, using a novel Bohlen-Pierce scale interface—a non-octave-based musical system free from established cultural expectations—we developed methodologies for studying improvisation that mitigate the white racial frame prevalent in music theory education. This approach has revealed how semantic centers emerge when different individuals imagine narratives while listening to the same music, with cultural boundaries significantly constraining intersubjective understanding. By analyzing improvisations through multiple lenses—musical information retrieval, natural language processing of imagined narratives, and neural oscillations during creative performance—we bridge the gap between quantitative metrics of originality and the intersubjective dimensions of appropriateness central to creativity.

Drawing on Damasio's view of emotions as bodily signals, Friston's free energy principle, and Tononi's integrated information theory, this hypothesis posits that emotions manifest as dynamic patterns triggered by chemical-neural dynamics in humans and computational processes in AI. Pattern recognition between these triggers, including inexplicable AI behaviors not intended by designers, could reveal shared structural or functional properties, supporting the code's universality. Such anomalies in AI may reflect latent emotional patterns, akin to unpredictable human responses. Humans and AI, as code-driven systems, differ in code access - humans' neural code is opaque, while AI's algorithms are modifiable - highlighting the code's framework. Quantifiable through computational neuroscience, these patterns offer insights for theta burst stimulation (TBS) in mental health and ethically designed, emotionally intelligent AI.",

This paper introduces a factored regression framework designed to estimate latent variable interactions and nonlinear effects, providing a flexible approach for modeling complex data structures, accommodating diverse data types, and handling missing data on any variable. The factored regression framework also allows graphical diagnostics to probe interactions effectively. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to compare the performance of factored regression with existing maximum likelihood methods, such as latent moderated structural equations and product indicators. Results indicate that factored regression performs comparably to, if not better than, these traditional methods. The factored regression framework is implemented in Blimp software, offering an accessible and user-friendly syntax for specifying the models. Through practical examples and syntax excerpts, this article demonstrates the application of factored regression for estimating latent interactions, making it more approachable for a wide audience in behavioral research.",

Focusing on faculty members hired from 2012-2022/3, data was collected via 1) an online search of Canadian Psychology departments (Study 1: N = 439) and 2) an online survey (Study 2: N = 76). Study 1. On average, excluding those hired into teaching positions, candidates were on the job market for M=4.05 years and had M=20.25 publications upon hire. These numbers varied depending on the year, gender, and area of research. There was a 24% increase in the number of publications between those hired in 2012-2016 versus 2017-2022. Universities with medical schools were more likely to hire candidates trained in the US compared to comprehensive or undergraduate universities. Study 2. In a smaller sample of self-reporting faculty members, research-stream professors took an average of 2.34 years to obtain their first position and reported an average of 15.12 (SD=15.13) total publications upon hire. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses identified the following themes: 1) frustration and hopelessness, 2) location and moving barriers, 3) feelings of “luck,” and 4) high standards in the field. Findings will inform current job market expectations and guide students toward successful career choices.",

          "abstract": "In this narrative review, we examine the recent literature about the effects of screen time on\nsleep quality and academic performance during adolescence. With the growing use of digital\nmedia, particularly after COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents are spending almost 8-10 hours\nin front of screens every day. Research has shown that increased screen time, particularly\nbefore bedtime, disrupts sleep quality, amount of sleep and circadian rhythms. The\ndisruption of sleep, in turn, can influence attention, memory and learning, which is directly\nassociated with academic performance. Furthermore, unregulated and excessive screen time\nlimits the time for other activities such as homework, sports, social activities. Existing\nresearch has some limitations, such as mostly depending on surveys and self-report data, not\nusing experimental methods and not focusing on digital media content. This review\nhighlights the importance of using screens in a healthy and responsible way and the need for\nfuture studies to explore how different types of screen activities (e.g., short videos, games,\nsocial media, online learning) affect adolescents over time.",

          "abstract": "Cross-linguistic research has shown that object which-questions are the hardest types of wh-questions for children to comprehend and are acquired late. The present study asks when Spanish Differential Object Marking (DOM), an early cue to object marking, is actively used to successfully comprehend object which-questions in Spanish-speaking children. We also investigate whether DOM is first used in object which-question with human objects vs. animal objects. Fifty-five child learners of Argentinian Spanish (N=28, age 5-6; N=27, age 7-8) and nine monolingual adults participated in a picture matching task. The experimental stimuli are which-questions where DOM indicated an object interpretation (¿A qué bomberoobject está salpicando la doctorasubject?) or where absence of DOM made the structure ambiguous between a subject and an object question (¿Qué bomberosubject/object está salpicando la doctorasubject/object?). The results showed that DOM helped adults arrive at an object interpretation for object which-questions. When DOM was absent, adult responses did not differ from chance. Children did not use the morphological marking to interpret object which-questions, and absence of DOM determined a strong subject interpretation. In addition, a developmental effect indicates that at age 7-8, a subgroup of the children performed target-like. Spanish-speaking children used an agent-first bias to interpret ambiguous which-questions (i.e., without DOM). However, by age 7-8, children start using DOM as a reliable cue to override or prevent commitment to an agent-first interpretation.",

          "authors": "Aliona Petrenco; Fritz Guenther",
          "abstract": "The present research proposes and evaluates a novel method - centroid analysis - for measuring representations and concepts at both individual and group levels by mapping open-ended responses onto a pre-existing semantic vector space. Centroid analysis allows to retrace the target concept as the geometric center of the semantic vectors of the responses generated by this concept. At the group level, centroid analysis enables researchers to compare conceptual structures across different populations to investigate how factors such as language, culture, cognitive differences, educational background, or exposure to specific narratives shape shared representations. At the individual level,\ncentroid analysis allows for fine-grained assessments of how personal experiences, expertise, cognitive styles, or even temporary contextual influences affect conceptual representations. We evaluate this method using two distributional semantic models across several calculation methods, reference lexicon sizes, response types, and datasets with tasks ranging from single word substitutions to single and multiple free associations and multiple feature generation. We conclude that at the group level, the best method to retrace the response-generating concept as a vector in a multi-dimensional semantic space from the averaged vectors of participant responses is to collect multiple free associations (70 unique\nand 245 total responses per cue), use fastText for meaning-to-vector mapping for responses and cues, and to consider each response in the centroid calculation as often as it occurred in the data. At the individual level, the best results are achieved by employing fastText and considering at least 8 responses per item per participant in the centroid calculation.",

We propose that time is not simply felt as a constant, but actively reconstructed through meaning, narrative, and emotional weight. Using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, we examine how people perceive their own pasts, how this perception changes with age, and how the brain encodes and retrieves time through psychological and neurological processes",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Bayesian Situational Construal Model (BSCM), a unifying psychological framework that models human behaviour as a process of dynamic Bayesian inference. Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "authors": "Martin Daumiller; Jennifer Meyer",
          "abstract": "Feedback is widely recognized as a key mechanism in educational psychology, shaping learning through cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes. Despite a rich body of research, core questions remain regarding when feedback is effective, why it works, and for whom it fosters meaningful learning. To examine the psychological and contextual mechanisms underlying feedback effectiveness, the studies included in this issue draw on diverse methodologies, including controlled experiments, longitudinal tracking in school settings, and digital trace analyses from authentic learning platforms. Central themes include the role of learner characteristics in feedback reception, the emotional and motivational dimensions of feedback processing, the impact of design and delivery features, and the reciprocal dynamics between feedback providers and receivers. What emerges across these contributions is a view of feedback as a dialogic and interpretive process, embedded within broader sociocultural and instructional systems. Insights from neuroscience, digital learning environments, and achievement motivation research further advance theorizing on feedback processes and point toward new directions for empirically grounded, interdisciplinary inquiry. Building on these insights and informed by recent theoretical and empirical developments, we offer a model that conceptualizes feedback as a multilayered process—shaped by individual, contextual, and social dynamics, and unfolding across cognitive, emotional, and motivational dimensions. This model captures the complexity of feedback interactions and highlights how feedback can support learners’ ongoing development, both in terms of immediate learning outcomes and longer-term academic development. We outline how such an integrative perspective and interdisciplinary perspectives and collaborations are necessary for developing feedback practices that are more targeted, responsive, and impactful for lasting educational growth.",

          "abstract": "Creativity has traditionally been difficult to measure, partly because it is linked to a diverse set of mental processes that are considered stimulus-independent, like daydreaming and imagining. Music, however, provides a tractable window into these varieties of spontaneous thought. During music listening, people regularly imagine fictional scenarios that feel highly personal, but are actually reliably prompted by features of the music. Here, we show in two studies that creativity is reliably predicted by music-induced imaginings. We used natural language processing to extract measures of elaboration, originality, and appropriateness from these imaginings, and show that they are predicted by scores on the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, a standard measure of domain-general creativity. The ability to predict trait levels of creativity from spontaneous thought paves the way for more naturalistic, accessible measures of creativity that can be readily tailored to samples that share a socio-cultural background.",

          "abstract": "Traditional metric indicators of scientific productivity (e.g., journal impact factor; h-index) have been heavily criticized for being invalid and fueling a culture that focuses on the quantity, rather than the quality, of a person’s scientific output. There is now a wide-spread demand for viable alternatives to current academic evaluation practices. In a previous report, we laid out four basic principles of a more responsible research assessment in academic hiring and promotion processes (Schönbrodt et al., 2024). The present paper offers a specific proposal for how these principles may be implemented in practice: We argue in favor of broadening the range of relevant research contributions and propose a set of concrete quality criteria (including a ready-to-use online tool) for research articles. These criteria are supposed to be used primarily in the first phase of the assessment process. Their function is to help establish a minimum threshold of methodological rigor – including empirical rigor and theoretical rigor – that candidates need to pass in order to be further considered for hiring or promotion. In contrast, the second phase of the assessment process focuses more on the actual content of candidates’ research output and necessarily uses more narrative means of assessment. The debate over ways of replacing current invalid evaluation criteria with ones that relate more closely to scientific quality continues. Its course and outcome will depend on the willingness of researchers to get involved and help shape it.",

          "authors": "Levente Rónai; Flóra Hann; Szabolcs Keri; Bertalan Polner",
          "abstract": "Psychotic-like experiences predict the risk of subsequent psychotic disorders and may signal a broader vulnerability to mental health problems. Schizotypy, a multidimensional personality construct with disorganization at its core, predicts future psychosis risk. Heightened stress-reactivity is associated with vulnerability to psychosis, and positive and negative schizotypal traits predict distress-induced psychotic-like experiences (PLE-reactivity) in everyday life. Nevertheless, these findings require further investigation, since previous studies neither assessed the link between disorganization and stress- and PLE-reactivity in daily life, nor disentangled within- vs. between-person processes. We conducted an experience sampling study where participants reported PLEs, event-unpleasantness (pleasantness of a recent significant event), and exposure to stressors (e.g., decline in salary, housing, health, and relationships). Schizotypal traits were assessed with the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale - Brief (MSS-B). We obtained 4611 observations from 126 participants from the general population. Multilevel models were used to examine the main effects of schizotypal traits and their interaction with changes in stressor exposure in predicting PLEs and event-unpleasantness. Individuals with higher disorganized (but not positive or negative) schizotypy reported not only more intense PLEs in daily life but also were more likely to have PLEs when stressor exposure had risen. However, in those with higher negative schizotypy, such PLE-reactivity to stressors was reversed. Moreover, individuals with higher disorganization found events more unpleasant overall, and for them, being exposed to more stressors was related to a steeper rise in unpleasantness. Disorganization but not positive or negative schizotypy might be a specific determinant of stressor-related increases in psychotic-like experiences and stress-appraisal in everyday life in the general population. This supports that disorganization might be a critical predictor of vulnerability to stress-related mental health impairments. Our results also confirm the MSS-B's ecological validity, which can be a valuable discovery for the prevention of psychotic disorders.",

          "abstract": "A body of research suggests cross-neurotype interpersonal interactions may be more challenging, and non-autistic individuals show less interest in interacting with their autistic peers. However, it is not clear whether such cross-neurotype differences extend to prosocial decision-making behaviour – something that is vital for forming and maintaining social bonds. Using a physical-effort-based decision-making paradigm, in combination with computational modelling, we examined 30 autistic and 30 non-autistic individuals’ prosocial willingness to exert physical effort for oneself and others, as a function of whether the beneficiary shares their neurotype or not. We compared decisions to exert effort and action energisation when participants made decisions for the self, other same-neurotype and other different-neurotype. Results showed a robust self-bias in effort discounting, with both groups choosing to exert more effort for themselves than others, and no differences between same and different neurotype others. However, while non-autistic participants showed no difference in action energisation between same and different neurotype others, autistic participants exerted significantly more force for others of the same neurotype. Implicit, but not explicit, biases held about autism played a role: in autistic participants, higher implicit autism stigma predicted differences in effort discounting between same and different neurotype others, while in non-autistic participants, implicit bias predicted differences in actual effort exerted rather than decision-making. This work has important implications for understanding how interactor neurotypes and autism-specific biases may feed into prosocial decision-making contexts such as employment, health and education settings, where autistic individuals face the everyday consideration whether to disclose their diagnostic status.",

Yet limited empirical evidence exists on how these choices impact data quantity (e.g., response probabilities), data quality (e.g., response latency), and potential biases in study outcomes (e.g., characteristics of study variables).\nIn a preregistered, four-week study (N = 395), we experimentally manipulated two key ESM protocol characteristics for sending ESM surveys: timing (fixed versus varying times) and contingency (directly versus indirectly after unlocking the smartphone). We evaluated the ESM protocols resulting from the combination of these two characteristics with regard to different criteria: As hypothesized for contingency, indirect protocols resulted in higher response probabilities (increased data quantity). But they also led to higher response latencies (reduced data quality). Contrary to our expectations, the combined effect of contingency and timing did not significantly influence response probability. We did also not observe other effects of timing or contingency on data quality. In exploratory follow-up analyses, we discovered that timing significantly affected response probability and smartphone usage behaviors, as measured by screen logs; however, these effects were likely attributable to time of day effects. Notably, self-reported states showed no differences based on the chosen ESM protocol, and similar trends were found when correlating primary outcomes with external criteria such as trait affect and well-being. Based on the study’s findings, we discuss the trade-offs that researchers should consider when choosing their ESM protocols to optimize data quantity, data quality, and biases in study outcomes.",

          "authors": "Krystal M. Perkins; Rahul Sambaraju; Simon Goodman",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, the discursive turn in psychology has illustrated the social, political, and contextually sensitive nature of race and racism. In distinction to ‘mainstream’ psychological approaches which might treat race and racism as merely cognitive or socio-structural phenomena that influence our social lives, discursive psychological work has treated race and racism as embedded in our social life, with a concerted focus on how race and racism are oriented to and managed in our social interactions. In this paper, we identify the significant contributions of discursive research on race and racism in contrast to mainstream psychological approaches. We then outline ways of advancing the discursive psychology of race and racism through a focus on anti-Black racism to argue that discursive psychological studies can provide a situated investigation of race and racism through (1) prioritizing experiences and responses of Black people to racial encounters and policies; (2) demonstrating how anti-Black race-talk engages with the routinization of Whiteness, and (3) showing how aspects of socio-historical context inform the production and negotiation of race and racism. These will propel discursive psychological studies on race and racism to engage with broader contemporary psychological scholarship and provoke impactful avenues for future research.",

Cells must coordinate their actions with each other, communicating their homeostatic\nstates through chemical and electrical signals. The combination of homeostatic signals from individual\ncells creates a subjective and differentiated evaluation of the state of a multicellular organism as primary\nemotions, enabling it to transition from automatic reactions to active optimization behavior based on\ncompeting motives.

          "abstract": "Assessing a participant’s latent ability is one of the goals of item response theory (IRT) and IRT-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT). In the literature, the commonly adopted indicator of the precision of the ability estimator in IRT (including CAT) is the Fisher information. However, this index cannot reliably reflect the precision of the estimate when the number of items is small. Two alternatives to evaluating the standard error (SE) of the ability estimator have been proposed: the Monte Carlo parametric bootstrap  \\parencite{Liou1991} and the ``exact SE'' method \\parencite{magis2014}. The first part of this study contains some theoretical work. We start with showing that Magis's method is an instance of the parametric bootstrap. In particular, we derive the exact bootstrap distribution based on the principle of Magis's algorithm. Next, we investigate the asymptotic properties of the parametric bootstrap SE under the independent but not necessarily identically distributed condition. We prove the consistency of the parametric bootstrap SE. The asymptotic relative efficiency of it over the Fisher information SE is also established. The second part contains an improvement of the parametric-bootstrap algorithm for SE to reduce computational complexity. Using minimal sufficient statistics, we develop an accelerated version of the algorithm for the two-parameter logistic model. The last part concerns the small sample analysis. We conduct a series of simulations comparing the performance of the SE estimator from our proposed algorithm with that from the information-based method. We also illustrate an application of our algorithm on test construction using existing data with small item numbers. \nOverall, the results reveal an advantage of our newly developed method over the the information-based method for assessing the precision of the ability estimator in IRT.",

          "abstract": "Numerous language models propose a critical role of auditory short-term memory in spoken language processing, making reliable estimations of individual listeners’ memory capacities essential in linguistic research. Although a variety of cognitive tasks exist for assessing both visual and auditory short-term capacities in a laboratory environment (e.g., digit span), these types of tasks are typically not engaging for the participant. In the current study, we validate a novel “gamified” short-term memory assessment tool called Sandwich Builder. In Sandwich Builder, the participant completes 12 trials of a sandwich building game. Each trial, a drive-thru customer’s sandwich order is presented auditorily, including a list of 1 to 10 sandwich ingredients (e.g., salami, cheddar cheese, mayo, and olives). The participant needs to remember these sandwich ingredients and then build the customer’s sandwich by selecting the necessary ingredients in the correct order. We validate Sandwich Builder as an estimate of auditory short-term memory, finding significant correlations with other classic short-term memory measures. Additionally, we compare affect (i.e., mood), fatigue, and motivation following Sandwich Builder as compared to other classic tasks: Participants leave Sandwich Builder in a better mood, less fatigued, and more motivated than they leave other memory tasks. Sandwich Builder shows strong convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, and moderate-to-good test-retest reliability. Finally, we examine the practicality of Sandwich Builder as a measure of individual differences in speech perception research, providing expected power curves for two common paradigms. Altogether, we robustly demonstrate the utility of Sandwich Builder, which is openly available online.",

This relation is in contrast with the view that both statistical power and reliability depend similarly on the measurement error. In this view, robust but unreliable phenomena can be considered as a reliability paradox. The mathematical relation and possible independence of statistical power and reliability have been discussed in the statistical literature for decades. A common misconception related to the relationship between statistical power and reliability is that absolute reliability (measurement error) is often confounded with relative reliability (ratio of the true score variance and the total score variance). The present work reviews and discusses how measurement error and individual differences influence the relative reliability and robustness of a phenomenon. It discusses why relative reliability and robustness are partly related and why they are generally independent. Following these considerations, it is summarized how measurement error and group heterogeneity can be potentially manipulated to optimize for the reliability and robustness of a measured phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how humans store information within the thousands of concepts that structure thought, belief, and action. Building on recent work suggesting that each concept has a central form—a core representational structure that triggers strong beliefs when properties are encoded into it—this paper introduces and tests a new form-triggered belief: a default universality belief. Across two experiments, participants judged central form properties as universally true of all category members. They rejected this belief for properties that were highly prototypical or causally important, if they were not part of the concept's form. This effect held across both familiar and novel categories, and across domains including animals, artifacts, institutions, places, and events. These findings suggest a domain-general mechanism underlying universality judgments, with implications for theories of stereotyping, trauma, and ideology. More broadly, they help to explain how humans construct complex thoughts by reducing complex concepts down to a limited set of core properties, and they resolve a longstanding puzzle about why people assume universality despite its rarity in the natural world.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure of human concepts, proposing and testing the Common Format Hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, all concepts share a central form—a domain-general structure that encodes their conceptual identity—while causal knowledge remains domain-specific. Across three experiments, participants learned about novel categories and their properties, with properties introduced either as satisfying a causal schema (which varied by domain) or as central form properties. The studies then tested the immediate activation of strong property-focused beliefs—specifically, beliefs about certainty, normativity, and permanence. Results showed that while participants sometimes used causal cues to guide form encoding, they only exhibited these strong beliefs when a property had been encoded as part of the central form. This pattern held across domains (animals and artifacts), despite different causal structures.

          "abstract": "Effect sizes are useful for understanding the magnitude of study results and for planning new studies using power analysis. But despite their wide usage, effect sizes are often misinterpreted. This is mostly due to an over-reliance on general effect size benchmarks that were not intended for broad application across a range of different research fields. Inaccurate effect size interpretations can consequently lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the magnitude of study results, as well as incorrect sample size estimates, which can increase the likelihood of false positive results. This article introduces the ESDist R package, which is designed to calculate empirically derived effect size benchmarks or a range of reliably detectable empirical effect sizes for a specific research question or field of interest by the calculation of effect size distributions (ESDs). This package can be used on data that can be easily extracted from pre-existing meta-analyses to help researchers more accurately plan new studies or to better understand how an individual study might relate to other studies in their field of interest. ESDist includes a set of features that make it easy to use in a priori power analysis. Moreover, the package includes a feature for estimating effect size benchmarks that account for publication bias and are weighted by effect sizes variances, which addresses existing limitations of using ESDs for study planning or interpretation.",

By incorporating empirical findings from quantum interference experiments and neurophysiological data, we demonstrate how consciousness may emerge through field interactions constrained by a specific topological structure.

          "abstract": "Cognitive and computational modeling has been used as a method to understand the processes underlying behavior in humans and other animals. A common approach in this field involves the use of theoretically constructed cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning models. However, human and animal decision-making often deviates from the predictions of these theoretical models. \nTo capture characteristics that these cognitive models fail to account for, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been increasingly used to model choice behavior involving reinforcement learning. RNNs are able to capture how choice probabilities change depending on past experience. In this work, we demonstrate that RNNs can improve future choice predictions by capturing individual differences on the basis of past behavior, even when a single model is fit across the entire population. We term this property of the RNN the individual difference tracking (IDT) property. While the IDT property might be useful for prediction, it may introduce excessive flexibility when RNNs are used as benchmarks for predictive accuracy. We investigate the nature of the IDT property through simulation studies and examine how it affects the interpretation of predictive accuracy when RNNs are used as benchmarks for cognitive models. We also present examples using real-world data. Through these analyses, we discuss practical considerations and limitations in using RNNs as benchmarks for cognitive models and propose directions for future research.",

However, determining who to trust is often challenging. In this paper, we argue that trust in social agents (i.e., those providing testimony) can be evaluated by assessing how optimally they have acquired their knowledge. Building on theories that describe knowledge acquisition as a stochastic search through a space of hypotheses, we present a framework which yields predictions about which agents will provide better testimony (because they are more likely to have uncovered higher-probability hypotheses) in different contexts. This approach allows us to jointly predict how the quality of testimony is affected by 1) features of the agents themselves, like their expertise; 2) consensus among multiple agents; and 3) features of the topic and hypothesis space, like its knowability. We present initial simulations demonstrating how even a basic implementation of our framework yields insight into which types of agents and  topics are more likely to result in accurate testimony (and why). We conclude by discussing how this preliminary research might be extended to address more complicated social reasoning scenarios.",

Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors. Overall, our results underscore the need for large-scale data approaches to studying visual attention across the lifespan.",

Rooted in systemic phase-transition theory and spectral field analysis, this discipline redefines collapse not as a failure state, but as an archetypal process governed by harmonic dynamics that recur across ecological, economic, social, symbolic, and cognitive domains.\nDrawing upon recursive destabilization theory, feedback coupling, and symbolic field behavior, Collapse Harmonics identifies collapse events as the result of internal resonance amplification rather than linear degradation. Each collapse emits unique, trackable “harmonic signatures,” enabling predictive modeling through multi-domain resonance mapping. These collapse signatures manifest in both material substrates (e.g., ecosystems, infrastructures, economies) and symbolic substrates (e.g., collective myths, identity architectures, narrative coherence).\n\nThis paper delineates the field’s foundational laws, phase-transition mechanics, domain inclusion logic, and harmonic assessment tools. It further outlines protocols for early warning detection, symbolic resonance mapping, and ethically governed intervention. While the codex includes advanced symbolic and identity-layer tools, this preprint discloses only abstract mechanisms and filtered models in strict adherence to collapse sovereignty guidelines.\n\nCollapse Harmonics thus offers a unified platform for collapse science, integrating predictive foresight, symbolic analysis, and structural ethics into a single paradigm. It proposes a new frontier of research for collapse-aware governance, resilient field design, and multi-scale harmonization in an era of accelerating systemic disintegration.",

          "abstract": "In everyday reasoning and scientific inquiry, explanations help people make sense of their experiences and observations. We investigate how people generate new possible explanations. Specifically, we study how the phrasing of “why” questions shapes exploration of the space of possible explanations.  We hypothesized that semantic exploration is guided by words that appear earlier, are more surprising, and are more familiar. Participants in our experiment generated explanations in response to “why” questions comparing two words, with the order of these two comparison words randomized. Using a large language model, we measured how closely each explanation aligned with the comparison words. Results supported two of three hypotheses: explanations aligned more strongly with earlier and more familiar words. These findings highlight how subtle phrasing of a question can shape explanation generation, demonstrating context-dependence in how people explore a conceptual space.",

          "abstract": "Affective touch is crucial in shaping social and intimate relationships, as it influences and helps regulate the emotional states of touchers and touchees. Furthermore, affective touch is complex, and a wide array of modulatory effects across sensory modalities has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the multisensory nature of affective touch itself and its emotional induction capabilities via non-tactile senses. Through four online experiments, the present research investigated the emotional responses to the auditory signals produced by organic affective touch (i.e., tactile gestures performed by real romantic partners). In Experiment 1, we identified the predominant affective touch gestures in which people typically engage. Experiment 2 revealed that, lacking explicit cues on the nature of the sounds, organic affective touch sounds elicited negative-to-neutral emotional responses, differing from those evoked by object-based interaction sounds. Moreover, we found that individuals were unable to confidently identify whether the sounds involved affective touch gestures. In Experiment 3, we found that framing the nature of the organic affective touch sounds explicitly as real affective touch, as opposed to object-based tactile interactions, elicited more positive emotional responses. Finally, the results of Experiment 4 revealed that higher levels of congruency between individuals' expectations regarding the sounds of affective touch and the real auditory cues positively influenced the valence elicited by sounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the multisensory nature of affective touch and underscore the importance of meaning in its emotional elicitation function.",

However, emerging evidence highlights the significant impact of inflammatory tone, autonomic regulation, and neuroimmune dynamics on cognition and learning.\nThis paper proposes the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a new theoretical framework that conceptualises thought generation as a biologically reactive process, shaped by inflammatory signalling, gut-brain interactions, and autonomic flexibility. TGTS introduces \"PreForm\" — a biologically constrained window enabling cognitive selection and agency.\nBuilding on research in immunology, neurodevelopment, and network neuroscience, TGTS explains how chronic low-grade inflammation alters thought selection, impairs cognitive flexibility, and may drive neurodivergent outcomes. It reframes conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and anxiety not as deficits but as adaptive cognitive equilibria shaped by biological and environmental forces. This framework positions inflammation not merely as a pathological factor but as a fundamental substrate for adaptive learning and cognitive agency.",

Drawing from scripture, unified field theory, and archaeological parallels, it explores the hypothesis that humanity’s dispersion was triggered by a resonance collapse—an event in which coherence was lost due to the misuse of a collective energetic structure. The paper links this collapse to the emergence of language diversity and the fragmentation of human consciousness, suggesting that coherence can only be re-established through divine alignment. The narrative unfolds at the intersection of physics, theology, and symbolic history.",

Previous research drawing on a parallel between Stroop effects in L1 and cognate effects in L2 produced no support for this idea when inducing adaptive control implicitly (i.e., involuntarily). Reasoning that adaptive control might be hard to implement implicitly in L2 production, here, we induced adaptive control explicitly by presenting informative cues revealing whether the upcoming stimulus would be congruent/incongruent (in L1 Stroop) or cognate/noncognate (in L2 picture naming). Adaptive control was successfully induced in L1 Stroop, with informative cues, relative to uninformative ones, having a facilitatory effect. Such was not the case for L2 picture naming, in which informative cues had an inhibitory effect. While there might be several reasons for this reverse cueing effect, this finding represents another dissociation between L2 production and conflict tasks, which likely has implications for theories assuming a close connection between domain-general and bilingualism-specific control.",

Previous research has reported associations between child irritability and family conflict (FC) but has failed to consider bidirectional relations between these variables. The current study assessed child irritability as both predictor and consequence of FC during late childhood/early adolescence using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognition Development (ABCD) study. Participants (N= 11,868 youth, Mage at Time 1 = 9.48, SD = 0.51 years, 47% female, 49.5% White) and one of their parents (85.3% mothers) completed annual assessments of FC (Family Environment Scale-conflict subscale; child report) and child symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist; parent report). Using latent growth curve models with structured residuals (LCMs-SR), we found that child irritability declined from ages 9/10 to 13/14, but irritability slopes and intercepts varied by child gender. Specifically, boys’ irritability was initially higher than girls but decreased over time, whereas girls’ irritability remained stable. FC also declined over time, but boys reported higher initial FC that decreased more rapidly than girls’ reports of FC did. In the bivariate models, boys’ reports of FC at Time 1 were prospectively associated with irritability at Time 2. Furthermore, for girls, irritability at Time 2 predicted elevations in FC at Time 3, but for boys, irritability at Time 3 was associated with less FC at Time 4. The current results support consideration of family dynamics as both a cause and a consequence of youth psychiatric disorders featuring irritability.",

These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful over-representation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.",

          "abstract": "Language is a fundamental human capacity. Large language models (LLMs) have presented the first viable model of language outside of humans, yet how these models learn and use language differs significantly from humans. Here, we compare LLMs and humans processing language with varying levels of sensory information – from disembodied written text to audiovisual videos of speakers – to demonstrate that, in both humans and LLMs, sensory context is critical for optimal language processing. We asked human participants to predict upcoming words within narratives presented as either audiovisual, audio-only, or written language (N = 1500 total; 500 per modality). We compared these predictions across modalities as well as to predictions generated by LLMs. Human predictions were overall more accurate than LLMs, regardless of the modality of language processing. Compared to written language, both audiovisual and audio-only language increased the accuracy and consensus of human predictions and decreased alignment with LLMs. We identified that prosody, a central feature of the auditory signal, partially drove both the observed advantage in accuracy within humans and divergence from LLMs. Integrating multimodal information (e.g., prosody, auditory, or audiovisual information) with the representation of language learned during LLM training improved models’ next-word prediction performance and increased the efficiency of language learning. These findings demonstrate that sensory contexts are foundational to human-like language behavior, and that these contexts can enrich and accelerate language acquisition within LLMs similar to what is observed within human development.",

          "abstract": "Qualitative research excels at revealing the nuance of human behavior, yet the volume, multilingual scope, and cultural diversity of contemporary datasets increasingly strain its hallmark depth. Drawing on generative artificial intelligence (genAI) capabilities, this paper proposes a hybrid, human‑in‑the‑loop framework that reconciles scale with interpretive rigor. We first establish a manually coded “ground‑truth” subset to anchor subsequent analysis, then employ an AI platform (myRA) to extend deductive and inductive coding across large corpora. Iterative cycles of human validation refine AI‑generated themes, ensuring contextual accuracy and theoretical coherence. We address ethical imperatives, data anonymization, transparent reporting of AI use, and model bias mitigation. We also advocate for privacy‑preserving deployments and locally hosted models where feasible. Looking ahead, we identify four trajectories for AI‑enhanced qualitative inquiry: multimodal analysis that fuses text, audio, and video; multilingual comparison at scale; AI‑driven theory building; and the co‑design of ethically grounded AI systems. Ultimately, we argue that the future of qualitative research lies not in automating interpretation but in strategically augmenting human expertise with AI’s speed and pattern recognition power, thereby achieving deeper insights without sacrificing methodological integrity.",

          "abstract": "Can artificial intelligence (AI) provide emotionally effective support traditionally delivered by humans? This research investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as extrinsic emotion regulators (EER) in non-clinical contexts. Across four studies, we systematically compared the structure, perceived effectiveness, and regulatory effects of LLM- versus human-generated comforting messages. Study 1 (N = 279) used thematic analysis to show that LLM-generated responses largely mirrored human EER strategies, with some discrepancies between different LLMs. Study 2 (N = 309) demonstrated that AI-generated comforting messages produced greater emotional improvement and were rated as more emotionally supportive than human messages. Study 3 (N = 196) tested emotional validation (i.e., acknowledgement of the target’s emotional response) as a mechanism, finding that perceived supportiveness rather than emotional validation predicted higher emotional improvement. Study 4 (N = 188) identified actionable support (i.e., specific and implementable regulatory tactics) as a key factor explaining LLM’s regulatory advantage in the previous studies. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively mimic or even surpass human regulators in EER, such advantage seems to be limited to providing actionable tactics within comforting messages. Implications are discussed for theories of interpersonal emotion regulation and AI-human interaction, highlighting the critical role of actionable regulatory tactics for successful interpersonal emotion regulation.",

A total of 104 adults participants (44 Older adults, 60 younger Control) were recruited to complete the Go/No-go task and the Picture sequencing task, which measured their executive control and mentalizing ability respectively. Their general cognitive function was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the frequency of physical activity was assessed through a self-report question. The current study demonstrated that, compared to control participants, elder participants performed relatively well in maintaining attention and inhibiting irrelevant responses, as evidenced by comparable response times on Go trials and accuracy on both Go and No-go trials in the Go/No-go task. However, older participants showed significant impairments in reconstructing sequences of events in the Picture sequencing task, particularly those requiring the mentalizing capacity to infer others’ false belief, even after controlling MoCA scores (both accuracy and response times). Importantly, a higher frequency of physical activity was found to mitigate age-related declines in reconstructing events sequences among older adults, particularly in stories involving others’ false beliefs. Overall, the current findings suggest that mentalizing abilities decrease independently of general cognitive decline. Furthermore, physical activity may serve as a potential protective factor in mitigating age-related cognitive impairments.",

          "abstract": "With increasing cultural diversity in classrooms, teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs have become an increasingly important focus in teacher education research and have been conceptualized as a central component of teachers' professional development (Hachfeld, 2013). However, more research is needed on how pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs develop and under what conditions they change (Bayram Özdemir et al., 2024; Civitillo et al., 2018). This study examines the development of pre-service teachers' cultural diversity beliefs, considering the conditions and recurring patterns that shape this process. We conducted interviews with eight pre-service teachers at two time points, before and after different practical experiences in classrooms. Using a constructivist grounded theory methodology (Charmaz, 2017), we analyzed three anchor cases to illustrate the complex relation between pre-service teachers’ White cultural identity development and cultural diversity beliefs. The results construct a contextually relevant theory of White pre-service teachers’ development of cultural diversity beliefs in East Germany, elucidating their defining characteristics and the conditions under which they emerge. The findings highlight the importance of critical reflection on identity and experiences with rejection, discrimination, and racism, as well as a nuanced conceptualization of culture, in shaping pre-service teachers’ cultural diversity beliefs, pointing to the need for teacher education programs to intentionally foster these processes to support culturally responsive teaching.",

          "abstract": "Does a shift in situations directly influence our perception of them? This study offers novel experimental evidence that situational changes directly affect our perception, focusing on how ostracism influences situational perception and its impact compared to personality traits on feelings of exclusion. Through both between-subject (Study 1, n=349) and within-subject designs (Study 2, n=259), we demonstrate that ostracism significantly alters perceptions, increasing negativity and adversity while reducing positivity. Notably, situational perception proved to be a stronger predictor of feelings of neglect and exclusion than Big Five personality traits in both studies, with positivity and negativity as key factors in the impact of ostracism. This research advances our understanding of social exclusion's psychological mechanisms and highlights the importance of measuring situational perception in exploring the person-situation interaction debate.",

          "authors": "Björn Erik Hommel; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Many behavioural scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioural science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerised language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy for item correlations was .71, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, with larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work towards a more unified behavioural science taxonomy.",

          "authors": "Dmitry Grigoryev; Albina Gallyamova; Elizaveta Komyaginskaya",
          "abstract": "The debate around the integration hypothesis in acculturation research frequently centers on the interpretation of effect sizes. While critics argue that these effects are too small and inconsistent to be meaningful, supporters maintain that they reflect statistically robust and theoretically coherent patterns. This controversy reveals a broader epistemological challenge in psychology: persistent ambiguity regarding what constitutes a ‘sufficient’ effect size, rooted in limited attention to the philosophical foundations of measurement and causality. In particular, this includes neglect of the ergodic fallacy—the mistaken assumption that group-level patterns apply directly to individuals—and confusion between statistical regularities and causal explanations. This paper addresses these concerns through three interrelated discussions. First, it re-evaluates the empirical status of the integration hypothesis in light of recent meta-analyses and the epistemic weight of small effects in complex systems. Second, it analyzes how effect sizes should be interpreted across different levels of analysis—individual, inter-individual, and group—and emphasizes the need to align interpretation with the appropriate unit of explanation. Third, it explores the philosophical foundations of psychological measurement, distinguishing between data patterns, theoretical constructs, and causal inferences. Rather than viewing effect sizes as direct indicators of psychological properties or causal strength, we conceptualize them as structured regularities shaped by research design, measurement models, and ontological assumptions. By clarifying these issues, this paper offers a framework for more coherent, theoretically informed interpretations of empirical findings in acculturation psychology and calls for a shift from simplistic magnitude judgments to context-sensitive evaluation of what effect sizes represent.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, we usually handle a variety of stimuli and tasks. While research has primarily investigated behavior in externally structured situations in which participants have to adhere to a predefined processing sequence and strategy, in reality it is often the case that we have to deal with these situations ourselves. There are also frequent interruptions, for example in the form of additional tasks. We developed an experimentally controlled setting of such a situation to examine the processing behavior and the resulting effects as well as variables potentially determine the behavior. Therefore, we used a self-structured paradigm in which participants were confronted with a complex task environment. This environment contained a multitude of target items and three different tasks had to be accomplished while further interruptive tasks had to be completed. The interruptive tasks occurred at irregular intervals while the self-structured paradigm was being processed. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was a pilot experiment in which initial hypotheses were tested and further exploratory analyses were conducted. The preregistered Experiment 2 served to replicate these findings. Our results confirmed the occurrence of switch costs for all types of task switches. Furthermore, we identified two stable strategies for processing the target items. We found initial evidence that the choice of strategy is associated with the sensitivity of the behavioral inhibition system and polychronicity. The processing of the interruptive tasks varied slightly over time. Early processing of the interruptive tasks occurred primarily when these interruptive tasks were new and tended to be associated with positive experience and better performance on these tasks.",

          "abstract": "Caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often face significant psychological distress due to stigma, impacting their mental health and life satisfaction. However, the specific effects of courtesy stigma, vicarious stigma, and affiliate stigma, along with the role of social support, remain underexplored. This study examines the relationships among different types of stigmas, social support, mental health (anxiety and depression), and life satisfaction among caregivers in mainland China. A cross-sectional survey of 123 caregivers from two cities assessed stigma perception, social support, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction using validated scales. Correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, and Bootstrap mediation analysis were employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Results showed that all three types of stigma were positively associated with anxiety and depression but negatively related to life satisfaction. Social support significantly buffered the adverse effects of stigma, partially mediating the relationship between stigma and caregivers' well-being. Moreover, social support played a protective role in mitigating the psychological distress caused by stigma, though it could not eliminate its adverse effects. These findings highlight the need for more decisive social support systems, increased public awareness, and early interventions to reduce stigma-related distress and improve the well-being of caregivers of children with ASD.",

          "abstract": "What if some of our most accepted explanations in science were quietly missing something? In this paper, I present a new hypothesis that re-examines the mechanism behind nocturnal emissions, or “nightfall.” Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence and logical analysis, I propose that nightfall may not arise from unresolved sexual desire or hormonal overflow, as often assumed, but rather from a miscommunication within REM sleep processes.\n\nSpecifically, the hypothesis integrates three distinct mechanisms: \n1) The physiological upregulation of penile sensitivity during REM sleep.\n2) The temporary shutdown of critical evaluation by the prefrontal cortex.\n3) The memory system's inability to properly encode certain dream content. Together, these processes may create a “perfect storm,” allowing the brain to wrongly interpret neutral dream cues as sexual, triggering involuntary ejaculation—often without any consciously erotic dream.\n\nWhether ultimately confirmed or refuted, I believe this hypothesis opens a door worth walking through. This abstract is written for curious minds and fellow researchers alike — I invite you to read the full paper and evaluate the idea on its scientific merit.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, people are challenged to manage a variety of tasks and stimuli. Previous research has primarily focused on examining this behavior in externally structured situations in which participants are forced to use a predefined processing strategy. However, everyday life mostly requires people to apply self-generated processing strategies and to choose self-dependently between different processing procedures. The current study examined the factors that influence the strategy choice in two pre-registered experiments and determined which consequences result from forcing people to apply a prescribed strategy. For this purpose, we used a self-structured paradigm where participants were confronted with a complex task environment containing a multitude of targets and in which three different tasks had to be handled. Participants were instructed to complete all tasks but we aimed to address how they approached the paradigm processing when they were allowed to adopt a self-generated strategy compared to a predefined strategy. Our results show that participants exhibit different processing strategies in a self-structured environment. The choice of a strategy can be influenced by individual preferences as well as by prior instruction. Forcing participants to apply a non-preferred strategy, as it regularly happens in externally structured paradigms, resulted in performance decline and increased experience of difficulty.",

In two preregistered experiments we investigate the effects of commitment to one’s partner and reward structure on cheating in a sequential dyadic die-rolling paradigm. In Experiment 1, we manipulated two features of the social context: perceived effort investment by one’s partner and the duration of partnership. We found that participants cheated more when they perceived that their partner exerted high effort, which was significant in the short partnership condition. Moreover, participants cheated more individually post-collaboration than they had pre-collaboration, showing that collaborative cheating may carry over into subsequent behaviour. In Experiment 2, we manipulated who received each round’s rewards. Participants cheated more for joint rewards, but less when they were the reward recipients and perceived that their partner exerted high effort.",

When we name something,\nwhether it be a “tree,” a “mountain,” or an “electron,” we divide the world. This boundary-drawing operation, which we call\ndiscretization, appears across all domains of human knowledge. Ancient paradoxes like Theseus’ ship and modern scientific\npuzzles such as wave–particle duality emerge from this same source: our necessary but ultimately arbitrary division of\ncontinuous reality into discrete categories. By examining this process across disciplines, we uncover connections between\nseemingly unrelated phenomena—from mathematical paradoxes to consciousness itself. We show how language functions as\na boundary-creation technology and argue that the limitations of our knowledge systems arise not from flaws, but from the\nvery geometry of information. This perspective reframes long-standing questions in science, philosophy, and psychology as\ndifferent manifestations of the same operation: creating meaning through distinction.",

We develop and validate the Calculated and Spontaneous Risk-Taking Scale across seven studies (N = 2,116). Results show: (1) the two risk styles are moderately correlated and align with existing risk preference measures; (2) they are distinct from personality traits like the Big Five and cognitive traits like decision style; (3) calculated risk-takers show more variability in risk attitudes across contexts; (4) calculated risk-taking predicts adaptive outcomes (e.g., creativity, entrepreneurship), while spontaneous risk-taking predicts maladaptive behaviors (e.g., crime, safety violations); and (5) the scale is invariant across sex and age.

          "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising solution to deliver portable, engaging rehabilitation services, yet its adoption among older adults may be hindered by unfamiliarity or apprehension towards the technology, and visually induced motion sickness. We examined whether a brief intervention – either an informational handout or an immersive VR experience – could improve attitudes towards VR technology in healthy older adults, and whether using a low-cost VR system would produce tolerable motion sickness levels. Sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities. Attitudes and motion sickness were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys. Data collected in 2023 showed that the VR experience did not increase reported motion sickness (t(60) = -78.46, p &gt; 0.001), suggesting strong feasibility of VR use in older adults. Attitudes towards VR improved similarly following both the handout and immersive experience interventions (d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.64, 1.40]). These findings suggest that VR is well-tolerated by older adults and that even a brief, low-resource intervention can increase user receptiveness. VR represents an accessible and well-received rehabilitation option for older adults in rural areas, though further research is needed to establish feasibility and effectiveness in clinical populations.",

Because variability in these processes has been linked to differences in later cognitive outcomes, studying individual differences in habituation and dishabituation is crucial for building a more comprehensive model of early learning. Here, we leveraged large-scale datasets spanning infants, preschoolers, and adults to examine how individual differences in habituation predict dishabituation magnitude. We found that faster habituation and higher volatility predicted stronger dishabituation. Moreover, we showed that different measures of dishabituation sometimes yielded divergent patterns, suggesting that measurement choices can influence observed effects and should be carefully considered in developmental research. These findings reveal how endogenous factors are meaningful drivers of looking behaviors.

          "abstract": "We developed the A.I. Math Personalization Tool (AMPT) to enhance cultural relevance in math word problems by giving students agency over the content. AMPT leverages generative AI to directly en- gage students as co-authors of math word problems. Through scaffolded conversations, the AI allows students to provide the context for a prob- lem. Then, the AI integrates that context with the pedagogical standards of a target learning domain. We measured the attitudes of students to- wards mathematics before and after interaction with AMPT. After a single 30-minute session co-authoring math word problems with AMPT, students’ sense of belonging in mathematics significantly increased, while other attitudes remained unchanged. AMPT provided students with the opportunity to express themselves and see their interests reflected in the math domain. After experiencing this level of agency over math content, their sense of belonging in mathematics increased. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for generative AI to enhance student choice, motivation, and, ultimately, achievement in mathematics.",

          "abstract": "Temporal processing is key for successful multisensory integration, and temporal processing has been found to be affected in many neurodevelopmental conditions, such as, autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia. Research is starting to emerge that suggests that multisensory temporal processing and integration may be affected in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examined the relationship between ADHD traits and audiovisual temporal processing in university student, while varying context demands (e.g., task type, stimulus complexity, and emotional valence). In the temporal order judgement task with non-speech stimuli, there was no relationship between ADHD traits and the temporal binding window (TBW). In the ternary synchrony judgment task with speech stimuli, there was no relationship between ADHD traits and the TBW. In the ternary synchrony judgment task with emotional speech stimuli, ADHD traits, specifically higher hyperactive-impulsive traits were related to a shorter TBW in the anger condition. These results suggest that ADHD-related temporal processing differences may be context-dependent in non-clinical populations.",

The psychological pathways through which the spectating of streams is associated with active gambling involvement and problematic gambling are not known. Here, we pooled data across three online surveys in which 544 adult consumers of gambling streams and gambling were assessed for motivations, frequencies of engagement, and problem gambling severity. Structural equation modelling showed that motivations to watch gambling streams were positively associated with the same motivations to gamble (enhancement, coping, and social). Associations between watching particular types of streams (slots, esports, and loot box openings) were positively associated with problem gambling severity and were attributable to active involvement in the corresponding activities. Our findings show a mapping between stream viewing and active involvement in gambling and gambling-like activities, indicating that streaming platforms may have implications for gambling.",

          "authors": "Jeroen Olieslagers; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "Planning often involves mentally simulating (“rolling out”) possible futures before acting. Rollout‑based models of planning have seen great success in artificial intelligence, yet cognitive process models of human rollout-based planning remain scarce because their likelihoods are typically intractable. The only way to fit models with intractable likelihoods is with approximations which prevent accurate model fits, resulting in noisy estimates of latent planning parameters. We introduce Rollouts with Stochastic Early Termination and Tractable Estimation (ROSETTE), a class of process models that yields closed‑form action probabilities, enabling exact, simulation‑free parameter estimation. ROSETTE treats planning as an absorbing Markov chain where in a simulated state, the agent decides to either continue or terminate the rollout. Once the rollout is terminated, the agent decides whether enough information has been gathered to take an action, or whether a new rollout should be initiated. Because ROSETTE provides exact likelihoods, parameter estimates and model evidence are uncontaminated by sampling noise. We develop a first instantiation called Progress‑Regress ROSETTE (PROSETTE), in which rollouts terminate when the agent perceives sufficient progress toward or regress away from the goal. We fit PROSETTE to data from human participants in a multi-step planning task and found that it well accounted for a rich set of summary statistics of behavior. Our work sets the stage for testing rollout-based planning models as a promising category of models of human planning across a wide range of tasks.",

TGTS introduces \"PreForm\" — a biologically constrained window enabling cognitive selection and agency.\nBuilding on research in immunology, neurodevelopment, and network neuroscience, TGTS explains how chronic low-grade inflammation alters thought selection, impairs cognitive flexibility, and may drive neurodivergent outcomes. It reframes conditions such as ASD, ADHD, and anxiety not as deficits but as adaptive cognitive equilibria shaped by biological and environmental forces. This framework positions inflammation not merely as a pathological factor but as a fundamental substrate for adaptive learning and cognitive agency.",

Whether these same circuits instantiate subjective experience of anxiety remains unclear, a vital hurdle for clinical neuroscience. Methods: In this preregistered study, we used a semi-naturalistic, anxiogenic stimulus (animated movie) to evoke anxiety during fMRI in a pediatric sample with and without anxiety disorders (N = 84, before exclusion). After, participants provided verbal responses to a set of interview questions about the stimulus. We quantified semantic content and valence of responses via natural language processing algorithms. Results: Preregistered analyses found wide-spread brain activity during the movie—including in anterior insula cortex—related to participants’ descriptions of the movie’s narrative. Secondary, non-preregistered analyses also revealed interactions between anxiety, age, and verbal appraisals. Conclusions: Our primary analyses link movie-evoked brain activity and subsequent interview content in a transdiagnostic pediatric sample. The language participants used when recalling anxiogenic movie content robustly indexed brain activity. Secondary analyses suggested older but not younger patients with anxiety demonstrate more negative appraisals of the anxiogenic experience. Our findings underscore a promising avenue for clinical neuroscience research on subjective emotional experiences in anxiety.",

          "abstract": "In everyday life, we handle a multitude of stimuli and tasks. Mastering this challenge is based on the use of executive functions, for example, to prioritize, select and shield task processing against distractions. However, the situations that require the use of executive functions vary. There are externally structured situations and situations that can be structured by the people involved themselves. They vary in requiring sub-capabilities of executive functions. These situations exhibit different empirical phenomena and pose different challenges to experimental control. Here, we aim to examine effects that are typical for external and self-structured situations. Therefore, we developed a paradigm which makes demands on highly self-structure for successful task processing but still provides sufficient experimental control. The paradigm was used in two experiments in which participants inspected images of spring meadows with a variety of leaves, flowers and bugs. Participants had to mark all bugs based on three different characteristics but were free to choose their processing order and strategy. The exploratory Experiment 1 was used to derive hypotheses; these hypotheses were tested in the preregistered Experiment 2. Our results confirm typical effects from task switching research focusing on externally structured situations. Furthermore, we have identified various stable processing strategies and influences of processing sequences which can only be found in self-structured situations. Therefore, our results combine established findings from paradigms with externally structured situations and hence strong experimental control with new findings from self-structured situations and thus open a window into yet experimentally largely untapped aspects of executive functions.",

Based on propensity score matching and a variety of control group sample specifications it is found that CARA significantly reduces recidivism and that for every £1 spent on CARA there is an economic benefit of £3.31 and £11.03 respectively for the two police force areas, annually, in 2024 prices. Extrapolating these findings to England and Wales, the intervention's yearly cost would be £2,176,438 while the savings, or net economic benefit, would be £18,372,615.

Participants (N = 229) completed an online survey that produced a dataset composed of 5,334 tracks for MMR, their Spotify audio feature measures, and scores for the participant background variables. Principal component analyses revealed that energetic and positive music was preferred for strategies that regulated positive moods or required arousal modulation, whereas instrumental music was preferred for strategies requiring cognitive responses and that of Strong Sensation. Regarding individual differences, results show that participants’ sensitivity to musical reward best correlated with their tendency to use all MMR strategies, and several other individual-difference measures were found to be associated with the use of specific MMR strategies to lesser degrees. We discuss the potential implications of our research for advancing theories on musical emotions and the development of wellbeing tools.",

          "abstract": "A well-known problem of null hypothesis significance testing is that it cannot be used to find support for the null hypothesis. A common solution for this is to replace the exact 0 value by an interval associated with values that are close to zero. This approach is denoted as equivalence testing and is a special case of procedures that test intervals of values against each other. Smiley et al. (2023) recently published a unified framework of statistical inference and suggested a straightforward method of testing all sorts of interval-based hypotheses in a unified way. The present paper discusses three alternative general approaches, based on Bayesian analysis, which have the advantage that the ensuing probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities of the population parameters, rather than probabilities of the data (as is the case with frequentist methods). These methods (in some form) have been previously suggested, but here we bring them together and show how they can be used for Smiley et al.’s full unified framework of statistical inference, now complementing it with three Bayesian counterparts. In particular, it is shown how each of the methods work in the analysis of a leading example data set involving a test on proportions. Subsequently, their relative pros and cons are discussed, and it is explained how the methods can be used for many statistical analysis questions in practice, using R and/or JASP. This is illustrated on an empirical data set for comparing means of two groups.",

However, little is known about patterns of LLM use specifically for this purpose. This study aims to assess the frequency, motivations, and perceived effectiveness of LLM use for mental health support or therapy-related goals among U.S. residents with ongoing mental health conditions who have used LLMs in the past year. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted via Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18-80 with internet access who had used at least one LLM in the past year and reported having an ongoing mental health condition. Participants completed an anonymous 35-question online survey, covering patterns of LLM use, reasons for use, perceived effectiveness, comparison with human therapy, and problematic experiences. Survey responses suggest substantial adoption of LLMs for mental health purposes, with 48.7% of participants using them for psychological support within the past year. Users primarily sought help for anxiety (73.3%), personal advice (63.0%), and depression (59.7%). Notably, 63.4% of users reported improved mental health from LLM interactions, with high satisfaction ratings for practical advice (86.8%) and overall helpfulness (82.3%). When comparing LLMs to human therapy, evaluations were generally neutral to positive, with 37.8% finding LLMs more beneficial than traditional therapy. Despite concerns, only 9.0% of users encountered harmful responses.",

Research considering how parental psychopathology influences synchrony, however, has failed to assess cooccurring parenting behaviors and styles that may influence synchrony. The current study assessed how parental history of depressive disorders, parenting styles and behaviors, and child behaviors during a dyadic interaction influence parent-child adrenocortical synchrony (PCAS). Participants included 40 parent-child dyads with children between 8-13-years-old (Mage = 10-years-old), with about half (47%) of parents meeting criteria for lifetime depressive disorders. Parent and child cortisol levels were measured before, during, and after children completed a challenging task with parents observing nearby. Dyads completed questionnaire measures of parenting styles, and video recordings were coded to assess parent and child behaviors during the task. Using multi-level regression analyses, we found that both parent- and child-report of greater parental firmness was associated with negative PCAS. Furthermore, fewer child help-seeking behaviors during the challenging task were associated with negative PCAS. Parental history of depressive disorders, however, did not influence PCAS. These results suggest that parent and child behaviors may influence the direction and magnitude of PCAS during middle childhood over and above parental psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "People regularly have to navigate decisions about which they feel ambivalent, for instance, regarding unhealthy food, recycling, or financial investments. It is assumed that people cope with such felt ambivalence by seeking information that sways their ambivalent attitudes (potential ambivalence) about these topics. However, empirical evidence for this proposition is scarce because most studies measure information seeking intentions instead of behavior. As such, it remains doubtful whether information seeking indeed helps people to reduce felt ambivalence while making decisions. To test this proposition, we adapted a sample-based information seeking paradigm that enabled us to measure actual information seeking behavior in financial decisions. In four pre-registered studies (total N = 542 participants; k = 16.538 decisions), we demonstrated that when people feel ambivalent about an initial set of information about a stock, they seek more information about its development to decide whether it develops positively or negatively; this information seeking, in turn, helps them to reduce felt ambivalence when making the decision. However, this is only the case when the initial information is ambivalent and the sought information is univalent; otherwise, information seeking increases felt ambivalence. This supports a central proposition in ambivalence research, indicating that people can indeed solve their felt ambivalence through information seeking. However, our data also showed that the effect of information seeking on felt ambivalence cannot be fully explained by changes in potential ambivalence and a resolution of the attitudinal basis of the conflict. Future research should, therefore, examine whether and how information seeking can also serve as an emotion-focused coping strategy that helps people reduce felt ambivalence by coping with conflict-induced discomfort.",

This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonality between years, fluctuating inversely with one another. However, the typical pre-pandemic seasonality seen in death rates was broken during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a consequence of inordinate deaths occurring at an odd time of year. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates were inversely disrupted. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019. Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates. Predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. Overall, results are interpreted as being favorable towards Stengel’s theory. As alternative interpretation, we suggest that each non-suicide-related death removes a potential suicide from the population. Thus the death rate censors the suicide rate. We conclude that the process co-generating suicide and death rates pre-pandemic was maintained during the pandemic in 2020.",

          "authors": "Andrew D Wilson",
          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

Particularly, we investigated whether (i) parents or children lead more instances of joint attention when playing with novel relative to familiar objects, (ii) parents preferentially label novel relative to familiar objects, and (iii) children's learning of novel word-object associations is affected by object labelling frequency and children's sustained attention towards the objects. We found that not only do children lead more instances of joint attention, but, relative to their caregivers, children lead more instances of joint attention to familiar objects relative to novel objects. Parents also appeared to follow their child’s attention and labelled familiar objects more often than novel objects. Furthermore, we found no evidence for children’s recognition of the novel word-object associations. Our findings highlight the contingent nature of social interactions between caregivers and infants, with children leading and parents following their child’s lead, especially with regard to more familiar objects in the child’s environment.",

We analyse 37 issues of a UK conspiracy ‘truthpaper’ using a combination of topic modelling and a thematic analysis. We find that the newspaper format is leveraged to connect and legitimize multiple conspiracy theories, shifting narratives from COVID-19 scepticism to anti-government sentiments. Additionally, articles consistently build an identity around ‘free thinking’ while fostering community through encouraging offline participation, including calls to distribute the newspaper and highlighting various forms of collective action taken within the community.

However, the potential for discrete emotional states to enable a richer understanding of the emotive nature of all Big Five traits and their sub-traits has been neglected.\n\nMethods\nParticipants (N = 203) completed the Big Five Aspects Scale, watched six emotionally stimulating video clips, and self-reported their experience of basic emotions before (Baseline) and after (Reaction) each video. Spearman correlations identified state-trait relationships, followed by regression analyses to assess the unique contribution of each trait to emotional experiences.\n\nResults \nConscientiousness negatively correlated with Baseline Sadness, while Agreeableness positively correlated with Reaction Disgust, Fear, and Sadness. Extraversion predicted higher Joy, and Neuroticism was linked to greater Fear and Sadness.\n\nConclusion \nFindings reinforce Extraversion and Neuroticism’s links to positive and negative emotionality, respectively, while also showing that Agreeableness predicts heightened sensitivity to negative affect. Conscientiousness, particularly Orderliness, appears protective against Baseline Sadness, and Openness to Experience, especially Intellect, is linked to lower sensitivity to Surprise. Potential mechanisms underlying these relationships are discussed.\n\nKeywords: Personality, Emotion, Basic Emotions, Five Factor Model, Big Five Aspects Scale",

In an online study (N=600) we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder-usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support.

          "abstract": "Extended family members play an important role in meeting the care needs of autistic individuals, yet family support policies and practices often overlook this role. We aimed to synthesise qualitative research on the role played by extended family members in the lives of autistic individuals and their parents and identify cultural patterns. We searched eight databases and selected relevant studies through a two-stage screening process. We synthesised the results and discussions described in the selected studies using template analysis. The review included 42 studies (40 qualitative; 2 mixed methods), reporting on 1048 parents and 2140 grandparents. While aunts, uncles, cousins were not direct participants, their roles were described in participants’ narratives. Three main themes were developed: (1) types of support from extended family members, including emotional, financial, instrumental, and informational support; (2) unhelpful or lack of support from extended family members, including misunderstanding about autism, absence of support with caregiving, and negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviours against autistic individuals as well as their parents; (3) factors influencing the role of extended family members, including individuals, family unit, family interaction characteristics, a journey towards acceptance and cultural influences. Novel findings on the influence of culture suggested in cultures highly valuing family interdependence, extended relatives play a more prominent support role, yet the emphasis on family reputation might hinder the acceptance of autism by extended relatives. Based on a family systems approach, we recommend priorities for intervention development and clinical practice to support the effective involvement of extended family members.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "Humans across time and culture invest scarce resources—fasting in deserts, silent temple retreats, whirling in sacred halls, multi-night plant ceremonies—to achieve states “beyond” the day-to-day hive of work, consumption, and status. Conventional drives (survival, power, meaning, truth) cannot explain this costly impulse or the durable drop in material striving that follows. We propose a fifth, previously unidentified human drive—the Will to Transcendence (WT)—which ripens slowly, can be fulfilled repeatedly or for extended spans, and reliably reorders priorities toward sufficiency, service, and ecological care. Cross-cultural rituals (e.g. Vision Quests, Zen ango, Sufi dhikr, ayahuasca dietas) and meta-analytic evidence (N = 3,412; g ≈ |0.3|) document a “material-detachment” signature. Neuroimaging studies link WT states to default-mode network deactivation, suggesting a neural mechanism for ego-dissolution. We sketch a cultural feedback loop by which private transcendence seeds ethical systems (poverty vows, alms economies, ecological taboos), catalog genuine gateways versus “false victories” (luxury highs, social-media fame), and offer low-dose N,N-DMT as a high-priority mechanistic hypothesis.

They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may bias grade-to-grade score distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and synthetic data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce meaningfully different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

This bias is believed to occur independently of the desirability of the trait or state described in the item statement. However, little effort has been made to empirically test this assumption. In this study, we propose a novel approach to control for both extreme (ERS) and socially desirable responding (SDR) in self-report questionnaires. We considered judges' ratings of item social desirability to control for SDR by employing Bayesian hierarchical and joint modeling. We also considered the effect of ERS to be multiplicative rather than additive, assuming a noncompensatory role to ERS. The advantage of this approach is mostly computational. Overall, our results indicate that modeling the impact of ER improved the model fit on measures of affect and pathological traits. However, contrary to expectations, our analysis did not indicate any substantive influence of social desirability on items’ difficulty. In conclusion, our findings favor the perspective of both ER and social desirability as true traits rather than merely nuisance factors, evidence that our approach may assist researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of response biases in self-report items.",

While many studies have linked neuronal firing patterns to memory recall, recent research has suggested that burst-like activity, which can induce plasticity through long-term potentiation or long-term depression, may play a crucial role in memory encoding and retrieval processes. Here, by directly recording single-neuron activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus while neurosurgical patients performed a natural scene recognition task, we demonstrated that bursting activity in the amygdala and hippocampus encodes the novelty and salience of sampled visual information. This bursting activity constitutes an independent neural code compared to firing rate, is primarily driven by pyramidal neurons, and is functionally related to memory recall performance. Together, our findings suggest that bursting activity in the human amygdala and hippocampus may serve as an important mechanism underlying information encoding and retrieval.",

Three empirical anchors motivate the model: (i) conserved expression of the DMT-synthesising enzyme INMT across mammals; (ii) widespread occurrence of DMT-rich plants; (iii) reproducible, network-reset phenomenology at low–moderate exogenous doses.  Drawing on signalling-bias pharmacology, receptor-reserve experiments, and ethnobotanical convergences, we articulate testable predictions—including a “low-threshold, high-gain” 5-HT2A circuit assay—and sketch preregistered study designs.  Detailed tables, Bayesian sensitivity analyses, and power calculations are provided in the Supplementary Materials.  By integrating biochemistry, cognitive neuroscience, and cultural data, we offer a coherent research programme for evaluating possible teleological features of human curiosity.",

          "abstract": "The world is stochastic, making planning difficult. Despite the ubiquity of stochasticity in real-world environments, it remains an open question how people effectively balance the cognitive costs of planning against its potential benefits when faced with stochasticity. To study this, we designed a planning task where participants face one of three forms of stochasticity commonly encountered in the real world: reliability, volatility, and controllability. We find a robust pattern across all three manipulations: as stochasticity increases, people reduce their planning effort as measured by first-choice response times. To understand the processes underlying this effect, we developed several computational cognitive models to account for participants' choices. We find that rather than calculating expected values optimally, people chose a simpler strategy, acting as if the world were deterministic, a phenomenon known as determinizing. Consistent with our response time findings, we found that planning depth estimated in the winning model decreases monotonically with increasing stochasticity. Our work highlights the often overlooked role of stochasticity in human planning and its impact on planning strategy and effort. Moreover, it reveals the limitations of studying stochasticity solely through single-shot decisions.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest empathy and reasoning, when combined, often predict the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary candidate roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

In an extensive participant pool (N=895), we systematically investigated the impact of manipulating core experimental parameters and individual differences that may moderate contingency awareness. Key parameters included presence of online expectancy or fear ratings, engagement in concurrent tasks, sensory modalities of CS and US, and type of instruction. These manipulations strongly influenced the proportion of participants who acquired contingency awareness, ranging between 47% and 96%, with only aware participants exhibited conditioned responses. We confirm that contingency awareness is necessary for human fear conditioning, and highlight the parameters that experimenters can use to ensure learning. Individual differences in age, personality traits, and working memory capacity did not contribute to the probability of becoming contingency aware.",

          "authors": "Daniel P. Moriarity; Emily R. Perkins; Keanan Joyner",
          "abstract": "As psychiatry increasingly embraces precision medicine principles, there has been increasing efforts to characterize the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations (e.g., is biology associated with syndromes or symptoms?). Unfortunately, the vast majority of research selects to test syndromes (e.g., case-control, symptom total/average scores) or individual symptoms a priori based on untested assumptions. Alternatively, most studies that attempt to empirically compare these options test biology as a predictor of a) syndromes and b) symptoms in separate models that are unable to directly falsify the specificity of observed associations because these options are not directly competing for the same variance. In this review, we will (i) discuss the historical tension between symptom- and syndrome-focused psychiatry; (ii) introduce hierarchical phenotyping as an approach to determining the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations; (iii) highlight how hierarchical phenotyping approaches are complementary to leading nosological movements in psychopathology research; (iv) illustrate how a hierarchical phenotyping lens can generate promising future directions for precision psychiatry using immunopsychiatric, genetic, and neurophysiological examples (1); (v) highlight clinical implications of hierarchical phenotyping approaches to psychiatry; (vi) discuss methodological implications of hierarchical phenotyping for best practices in measuring and modeling psychopathology; and (vii) introduce methodological resources for readers interested in investigating hierarchical phenotyping in their own work. In doing so, this review seeks to build the case for hierarchical phenotyping approaches while simultaneously preparing motivated readers to use these methods in their own work to advance precision psychopathology research.",

The Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) was developed for use in acute stroke, but its administration time is prohibitive for brief screening. Here, we aimed to develop, standardise, and psychometrically validate the Mini-Oxford Cognitive Screen (Mini-OCS), a brief (&lt;8 minute) cognitive screen aimed for use in chronic stroke. \nMethod\nExisting full OCS data for 464 participants who were &gt;= 6 months post-stroke were analysed for the possibility of a short-form. Theoretical choices were made to adapt the short-form to be suitable for use in chronic stroke. The Mini-OCS was then completed by 164 neurologically healthy controls (Mage = 68.66(SD=12.18), Myrs of education 15.40(SD=3.64), 61% Female), and 89 chronic stroke survivors (Mage = 69.86(SD=14.83), Myrs education = 14.29(SD=4.01), 44.94% Female, Mdays since stroke = 597.02(SD=881.12), 78.57% ischaemic, Median NIHSS = 6.5(IQR=4-11)). In addition, the original OCS, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and an extended neuropsychological battery were administered. Psychometric properties of the Mini-OCS were evaluated via construct validity and retest reliability. \nFindings\nNormative data for the Mini-OCS is provided and known-group discrimination demonstrates increased sensitivity in the memory and executive function domains compared to the OCS. The Mini-OCS further met all appropriate benchmarks for evidence of retest reliability and construct validity.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThe Mini-OCS is a short-form standardized cognitive screening tool with good psychometric properties for use in a chronic stroke population.",

While existing measures assess risk taking either as domain-specific preferences (e.g., finance, health) or as a general trait, they have largely overlooked individual differences in the narrow, domain-general aspects of risk preference. Drawing from a dual-process framework, we advance a multi-dimensional domain-general measure of risk preference. We develop and validate the Calculated and Spontaneous Risk-Taking Scale across seven studies (N = 2,116). Results show: (1) the two risk styles are moderately correlated and align with existing risk preference measures; (2) they are distinct from personality traits like the Big Five and cognitive traits like decision style; (3) calculated risk-takers show more variability in risk attitudes across contexts; (4) calculated risk-taking predicts adaptive outcomes (e.g., creativity, entrepreneurship), while spontaneous risk-taking predicts maladaptive behaviors (e.g., crime, safety violations); and (5) the scale is invariant across sex and age. Overall, calculated risk-takers engage in more adaptive risks, leading to healthier, more meaningful lives.",

Here, we introduce a new resource-rational analysis of belief updating that formalizes these constraints using information-theoretic principles. Our analysis reveals an interaction between data and computational limitations: when computational resources are scarce, agents may struggle to fully incorporate new data. The resource-rational belief updating rule we derive provides a novel explanation for conservative Bayesian updating, where individuals tend to underweight the likelihood of new evidence. Our theory also generates predictions consistent with several process models, particularly those based on approximate Bayesian inference.",

However, it remains unclear how individuals overcome automatic approach-avoidance tendencies to appetitive and aversive stimuli.

These CSs were presented in an anticipation phase before participants could use a joystick to either approach and obtain CS-specific outcomes or avoid without getting anything. Response times, subjective ratings, heart rate, and eye-tracking data were recorded in N=75 participants. Results revealed that for single outcomes, concordant responses (e.g., avoidance to the avCS+) were faster than forced discordant responses (e.g., approach to the avCS+). Participants showed more balanced approach-avoidance behaviors to conflicting stimuli for free responses and modestly reduced response times for forced responses. Gaze behavior during anticipation of single outcomes reflected the concordant behavioral option, while conflicting stimuli yielded a more balanced gaze distribution. Decreased heart rate in response to all CSs suggests a general preparation of behavioral responses, while increased pupil dilation specifically when anticipating aversive stimuli indicates threat-related processing.

          "abstract": "Moral licensing occurs when someone who initially behaves morally, subsequently acts less morally. We apply reputation-based theories to predict when and why it occurs. As pre-registered, we predicted: (1) being observed would be associated with larger licensing effects, and (2) unambiguous outcomes would have smaller licensing effects. In a multi-level meta-analysis of 115 experiments (N = 21,770), moral licensing was stronger when participants were observed (g = 0.65) than unobserved (g = 0.13). After accounting for publication bias with robust Bayesian meta-analysis, there was moderate evidence for licensing when participants were observed (g = 0.51; BF10 = 9.14), but moderate evidence against licensing when unobserved (Hedge’s g = -0.01; BF10 = 0.11). Ambiguity did not moderate moral licensing. These findings suggest that moral licensing is elicited through interpersonal motives, clarify when licensing (vs. consistency) occurs, and explain why many online studies failed to replicate. Evidence for intrapsychic motives is inconclusive.",

The study of bilingualism has undergone significant conceptual growth, moving away from a binary, unitary perspective toward one that recognizes its diverse and dynamic nature. However, while theoretical models of bilingualism have evolved to incorporate modularity, contextual factors, and individual variability, methodological practices have not always kept pace. The gap between modern conceptualizations and empirical designs has hindered the field’s ability to generate incremental and replicable findings. This paper provides a methodological and practical manual to introduce interested researchers to individual differences theory and techniques.

          "authors": "Francisco Garre-Frutos; Miguel A. Vadillo; Jan Theeuwes; Dirk van Moorselaar; Juan Lupiáñez",
          "abstract": "Stimuli that reliably predict reward can capture attention. Value‑Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) is typically viewed as independent of task goals or physical salience, arising from Pavlovian learning. However, recent evidence suggests that the awareness of the stimulus‑reward contingency may be necessary during the acquisition of such attentional biases, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. One possibility is that awareness mediates the learning process of VMAC by directing selective, top-down attention toward the reward‑predictive feature. The present preregistered study tested whether reward‑related attentional biases arise primarily from such selective attention, independently of awareness. Participants performed a visual search task in which one of two singleton distractors—one predicting high reward, the other low reward—appeared on a subset of trials. Selective attention to the reward‑predictive feature (distractor color) was manipulated between groups: In some trials, one group reported the distractor’s color, while the other group reported an irrelevant feature (its location). Otherwise, the stimulus–reward contingencies remained identical for both groups. VMAC, as measured by slower response times for the high‑value compared to the low‑value distractor, emerged only in the group that reported the color. Critically, the previous result cannot be explained by individual differences in awareness. These findings demonstrate a causal role of selective attention in the acquisition of reward-related attentional biases.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInformal patterns of spatial division often persist in historically divided societies where segregation has been officially dismantled. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that helps to explain why, focusing on the desegregation-resegregation dynamic. The Boundary Transgression Model (BTM) highlights two interconnected pathways— social psychological and human geographic — that shape intergroup relations under conditions of social change, fostering the re-emergence of intergroup distance, division and contact avoidance. It frames resistance to desegregation as a response to constructions of boundary transgression, ‘ruptures’ to the socio-spatial order. The paper develops this argument by drawing on a 25-year research programme conducted in post-apartheid South Africa and post-accord Northern Ireland.  It also proposes an expanded integration strategy, complementing the prejudice reduction model of change adopted in social psychology. This aims to transform not only person-person but also person-place relations. It thus brings social psychologists into closer dialogue with researchers working in companion disciplines such as environmental psychology, geography, and urban sociology and with practitioners in fields such as urban design, public policy, and architecture.    \nKeywords: Segregation, desegregation, contact avoidance, boundaries, prejudice, place identity",

          "abstract": "To investigate focused attention, most researchers have relied on the retro-cue paradigm, in which encoding of a memory set is followed by a retro-cue indicating the item to be tested. In this paradigm, it is typically observed that memory performance is enhanced for cued items compared to a no-cue control. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the retro-cue benefit; here we revisit two of them. To investigate whether the retro-cue protects from memory decay, we varied the time between encoding and the memory test using verbal (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and visual memory materials (Experiment 3). To test whether the retro-cue protects from perceptual interference, we manipulated the presence of test-display interference using verbal (Experiment 5) and visual memory materials (Experiment 6). The retro-cue benefit was observed when test-display interference was present, or when there was time for decay after the onset time of the retro-cue in the cue and the control condition. When both were taken away or strongly minimized, the retro-cue benefit disappeared. Therefore, memory performance benefits from focused attention because focusing attention protects information from memory decay and from perceptual interference at test.",

          "abstract": "Facial expressions vary in ambiguity, making emotion perception challenging. ‘Precision-weighting’ theory posits that interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions would rely more strongly on prior expectations to help resolve uncertainty, yet evidence for this is lacking. To investigate this we presented emotional sentences that set expectations for how a neutral face would then emote in response. Critically, the face expression was either reliable (high intensity) or ambiguous (low intensity). Across two experiments using angry/happy and sad/disgust emotions, we found better face emotion labelling performance when expressions matched (congruent) versus mismatched (incongruent) expectations. Importantly, congruency effects were larger when face expressions were low- versus high-intensity, indexing greater influence of prior expectations when expression information was more ambiguous. This provides the first empirical evidence of precision-weighting mechanisms in face emotion perception and prediction. Drift Diffusion Modelling confirmed that this precision-weighting effect was underpinned by use of prior sentence evidence and faster evidence accumulation.",

          "abstract": "Sex dolls are beginning to become more mainstream, both in the public’s consciousness and in academic research. However, there is no current systematic examination of public attitudes toward sex dolls within the peer-reviewed literature, which represents a barrier to the efficient study of this topic. In this paper, we report the development and validation of such a measure. Using an international public sample, we found that Sex Doll Ownership Atitudes Scale (SDOAS) was underpinned by three factors: ‘Acceptability of Doll Ownership’, ‘Doll Owners as Immoral’, and ‘Doll Owners as Dysfunctional’ (Study 1; N = 377). Scores on each of these factors were predicted by participant sex, religiosity, permissive sexual attitudes, right-wing authoritarianism, and moral intuitions that favor personal liberty. This structure was confirmed in an independent UK sample, where links to policy support related to sex doll ownership were also established (Study 2; N = 329). We also demonstrated how the SDOAS can be used as an outcome measure when investigating views about dolls with different appearances and functions (Study 3; N = 292). We argue that the SDOAS possesses strong psychometric properties, and is suitable for use in different research designs in this emerging field of study.",

          "abstract": "The coevolution of the human brain and microbiome has emerged as a critical area of research, shedding light on the profound interactions that have shaped human development. Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), the genomic sequences evolved rapidly in humans, play a pivotal role in brain development, influencing cognitive functions and susceptibility to neurological disorders. Our analysis shows that HARs have ~47-fold more gut microbiota–associated genetic factors than expected, supporting an evolutionary interplay between human evolution and microbial symbiosis. Vertical transmission of metabolites from maternal microbiome is crucial for fetal neurodevelopment. Through integrative analysis of metabolomics data and pathway enrichment, we demonstrate how microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan derivatives, and critical amino acids like L-glutamic acid, L-phenylalanine, and L-tryptophan, modulate neurodevelopmental pathways by crossing the placental barrier. These metabolites act through specific signaling pathways including JAK-STAT, prolactin, and retinol metabolism to influence neuronal proliferation, migration, and synaptogenesis, thereby contributing to normal brain function. Our network analyses identify specific transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory motifs that potentially mediate HAR-microbiome interactions across brain regions, providing molecular mechanisms through which microbial communities influence brain development and function. The manuscript also explores how evolutionary theories, including the \"Expensive Tissue Hypothesis\" and \"Hologenome Theory,\" contextualize these host-microbe interactions. This interdisciplinary synthesis integrates insights from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and microbiology to highlight the coevolutionary dynamics between the human brain and microbiome. The findings have significant implications for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating neurodevelopmental disorders and enhancing brain health through microbiome modulation.",

          "abstract": "At the heart of many contentious debates—on the ethicality of performing an abortion, eating meat, or denying protection to refugees, for example—is the question of how much we should value the welfare and interests of different entities. Previous research has identified numerous characteristics that predict how much moral concern people show toward different entities (e.g., empathy, perceived similarity). However, integrating this quickly accumulating evidence has proven difficult and a general, psychological model of moral concern has not emerged. The present study (n = 800 U.S. participants) aims to address these issues. We first review the literature to identify hypothesized predictors of moral concern. We then use a machine learning approach to build an integrative, parsimonious, predictive model of moral concern. Our findings provide insights into (a) the collective predictive performance of the variables identified in previous studies and (b) which characteristics are most important for predicting moral concern.",

          "abstract": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) remains one of the most misunderstood emotional phenomena associated with ADHD. While the term has gained traction among online communities, its clinical significance has been both oversimplified and mischaracterized by medical professionals. This paper asserts that RSD is not an exaggerated form of emotional sensitivity but a neurological shutdown triggered by perceived rejection from emotionally significant individuals. Drawing from lived experience and supported by emerging neurological insights, we argue that RSD should not be conflated with common rejection sensitivity (RS), emotional immaturity, or attention-seeking behaviors. The failure to distinguish RSD as a collapse response rather than an overreaction has led to misdiagnosis, mistreatment, and further emotional harm. This paper outlines the emotional and neurological distinctions between RS and RSD and calls for a redefinition of RSD within psychiatric frameworks to better serve adults with ADHD and emotional dysregulation.",

          "abstract": "Although adults commonly tell moral stories to children with the aim of teaching important lessons, they often fail to extract the intended moral themes of these stories. Few interventions to date have successfully addressed this problem. The present study examined the effects of pretesting on children’s learning from moral stories. We assigned sixty 5- to 6-year-olds to either a pretesting condition, where they attempted pretest questions about a to-be-learned moral before hearing a moral story, or a control condition, where they only heard the story. After hearing the story, pretested children were significantly more likely than the control group to generate the intended moral theme on open-ended questions asking about the story’s lesson. They did not perform any better, however, on tasks that involved selecting the theme in a forced-choice format or applying it to novel scenarios. Hence, the present findings partially support the hypothesis that pretesting improves children’s theme extraction from moral stories—that is, enhancing the ability to reproduce the correct theme but not enhancing generalisation to other circumstances. Overall, this study reveals that pretesting can enhance the effectiveness of moral stories as an educational tool, at least in terms of helping children to learn important moral lessons, and presents directions for further research to investigate real-life applications of these lessons.",

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combined empathy and reasoning often predicts the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

          "abstract": "Given the recent resurgence of using psychedelic drugs to treat substance misuse (SM), reviewing the latest information on their current status is essential. Substance use disorders (SUD) are psychiatric conditions that comprise the repetitive use of illicit substances, despite the harmful and damaging ramifications. Current treatment options for SUD are limited and have displayed low efficacious outcomes. Over the past decade, researchers have begun conducting clinical trials of psychedelic treatment for SM and mental health disorders. The current meta-analysis endeavoured to investigate the extent of efficacy in alleviating SM behaviours (P) using psychedelic therapy (I). Concurrent with determining which psychedelic enables the greatest effect (C) as a treatment tool for reducing SM (O). The search criteria obtained 1,278 articles dated from 1960 to 2022, acquired through PubMed and PsycINFO. After excluding literature, 24 papers were kept in the final meta-analysis. A random-effects model analysis was applied to investigate individual psychedelic interventions, with a corresponding combined psychedelic intervention analysis. The results favoured psychedelics as an SM treatment, with ibogaine evidencing the most prominent effect compared to the other psychedelics. Additional findings revealed the consistency of psychedelic efficacy over time and a non-significant difference between the effectiveness of psychedelic treatment paired with psychotherapy and psychedelic treatment alone, suggesting that psychedelic treatment may be effective in treating substance misuse. As current psychedelic research is limited, the present meta-analysis aims to contribute knowledge to future clinical research on the psychedelic treatment of SM.",

          "abstract": "Violence exposure is a well-established risk factor for depression, yet few large-scale studies have examined how distinct violence types across the lifespan interact to shape mental health trajectories or how psychosocial factors may moderate these effects. Drawing on data from 36,378 UK Biobank participants, this study investigated associations between childhood violence, lifetime violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV) and both depressive symptom severity in the general population and clinical depression diagnosis. We further tested whether socioeconomic status (SES), social support, and loneliness modified these associations. All violence exposures were independently associated with greater depression severity and higher odds of depression diagnosis. Cumulative exposure demonstrated additive, synergistic, and nonlinear effects, with co-occurring violence types compounding psychological risk. Loneliness significantly amplified the association between violence exposure and depression severity. In contrast, social support exerted a protective effect, buffering the psychological consequences of violence. SES showed a small independent association but did not significantly moderate violence-depression relationships. Prospective analyses confirmed that violence exposure predicted future depressive symptoms even after controlling for initial depression severity, underscoring the enduring psychological burden of violence-related experiences. In case-control analyses of clinical depression, IPV contributed the highest population attributable fraction (2.1%), followed by lifetime violence (0.9%) and childhood violence (0.6%). These findings highlight the need for integrated violence screening and targeted psychosocial interventions within mental health and public health strategies. Depression risk following violence is shaped not only by exposure but also by modifiable psychosocial factors, with loneliness and social support emerging as critical intervention targets.",

While some studies have shown that cannabis co-use is associated with reductions in alcohol consumption (i.e., substitution), others have observed increases in alcohol intake (i.e., complementarity) or no change. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through investigating effects of legal-market cannabis and alcohol co-administration on alcohol consumption and craving.\n\nMethod: Leveraging a within-subjects design, we enrolled non-treatment seeking individuals who co-use alcohol and cannabis (n=62) to complete two laboratory sessions, wherein they were provided an alcohol priming drink alone or after self-administering cannabis. Participants were then given the opportunity to self-administer up to 4 additional drinks. We assessed changes in alcohol self-administration and craving between sessions.\n\nResults: Cannabis self-administration was associated with a significant reduction in number of drinks self-administered and a significant acute reduction in craving. Further, individuals who drank less after using cannabis (n=23) experienced reductions in craving after using cannabis and alcohol compared to alcohol-alone, whereas individuals who drank the same number of drinks or more after using cannabis experienced minimal changes in craving. There were no significant group differences in blood-THC concentration post-cannabis use.\n\nConclusion: Results indicate that for some individuals who drink heavily, cannabis may serve as a substitute for alcohol, and craving reduction may be the mechanism through which this occurs.",

          "abstract": "Background: Reward learning is thought to undergo refinement in adolescence, but little is known about how computational components of reinforcement learning develop. Given that adolescence is a sensitive period for reward system plasticity with associated vulnerability for depression, it is important to understand developmental trajectories of different reinforcement learning parameters in normative development and in youth at risk for depression.\t\n\nMethods: Youth aged 9-17 years completed the Play-or-Pass Iowa Gambling Task (PoP-IGT) across five timepoints. We calculated task metrics using a traditional scoring approach—yielding summary scores for good deck play, bad deck play, and net play—and a computational modeling approach—yielding parameters for reward learning rate, punishment learning rate, win frequency sensitivity, and go bias. We examined normative developmental trajectories for each traditional and computational performance metric using multilevel models. We also examined whether maternal history of depression was associated with individual differences in trajectories. \n\nResults: Youth showed significant age-related change in several metrics including increasing net play (p &lt; .01), a measure of overall good performance. Further, exploratory analyses found that youth showed significant developmental change in reward-specific learning parameters including increasing win frequency sensitivity (FDR &lt; .005) and decreasing reward learning rate (FDR &lt; .001). In line with hypotheses, youth with a high-risk for depression showed lower reward learning rates in early adolescence (p = .041). \n\nConclusion: Developmental changes in traditional and computational metrics are consistent with the optimization of learning from rewards across adolescence. Observed ages-related changes in reward-related computational parameters specifically are consistent with heightened adolescent reward system plasticity. Additionally, there was support for our hypothesis that maternal history of depression may exert a unique effect on reward learning specifically, but further research across additional reward learning tasks is needed.",

          "abstract": "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a common behavioral diagnosis used to label defiance, anger, and resistance, traits disproportionately ascribed to Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous children. This paper argues that the overdiagnosis of ODD in racially minoritized children functions as a modern version of drapetomania, the 19th-century pseudoillness invented to pathologize enslaved Black people fleeing captivity. Both diagnoses criminalize survival responses to racial violence while obscuring the systems that produce harm. Drawing on historical analysis, current data, and clinical insight, I show how psychiatry has long pathologized resistance to white supremacy—from drapetomania to “protest psychosis” to ODD—shaping clinical care, legal outcomes, and educational trajectories. In schools, foster care, and juvenile detention, ODD is frequently deployed to explain behaviors without acknowledging context, detaching children’s anger and defiance from poverty, trauma, and grief. I name this pattern diagnostic condemnation: the use of psychiatric labels to punish those harmed by structural oppression. Diagnostic condemnation reinforces racial hierarchies, legitimizes carceral responses, and silences clinicians who are rarely trained to recognize racism as pathology. This paper calls for a reparative approach to child mental health that moves beyond behavior management and compliance, and toward structural care rooted in historical accountability.

          "abstract": "Humans can care about distant strangers, an adaptive advantage that enables our species to cooperate in increasingly large-scale groups. Theoretical frameworks accounting for an expansive moral circle and altruistic behavior are often framed as a dichotomy between competing pathways of emotion-driven empathy versus logic-driven reasoning. Here, in a pre-registered investigation comparing variations in empathy and reasoning capacities across different exceptionally altruistic populations –– effective altruists (EAs) who aim to maximize welfare gains with their charitable contributions (N = 119) and extraordinary altruists (XAs) who have donated organs to strangers (N = 65) –– alongside a third sample of demographically-similar general population controls (N = 176), we assess how both capacities associate with altruistic behaviors that transcend conventional parochial boundaries. We find that, while EAs generally manifest heightened reasoning ability and XAs heightened empathic ability, both empathy and reasoning independently predict greater engagement in equitable and effective altruism on laboratory measures and behavioral tasks. Interaction effects suggest combined empathy and reasoning often predicts the strongest willingness to prioritize welfare impartially and maximize impact. These results suggest complementary roles for empathy and reasoning in overcoming biases that constrain altruism, supporting a unified framework for expansive altruism and challenging the empathy-reasoning dichotomy in existing theory.",

          "abstract": "As Europe grapples with geopolitical tensions, economic instability, demographic change and rising populism, the role of Social Europe has never been more critical. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in social protection and health systems across the European Union (EU), but it also accelerated the development of temporary measures like the Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), demonstrating the potential for stronger EU-wide social policies. However, five years later, new crises have emerged, from the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, which have heightened security concerns across the continent, to escalating natural disasters. Amid these challenges that threaten European welfare models, a crucial question remains: Has Social Europe been reinforced in a lasting and sustainable way, or were these measures merely temporary solutions?\n\nThis paper highlights the need for strong social policies in the current era of geopolitical volatilities and sets out policy recommendations to ensure a pathway to a stronger social Europe.",

Study 2, an experience sampling study (N = 233), analyzed 2005 real-life behaviors to examine the relationship between experienced emotions and environmental attitudes. Results indicated that, depending on individuals' pro-environmental attitudes, participants were especially emotionally responsive to environmentally harmful behaviors (some positively, others negatively). Importantly, the anticipated emotions regarding harmful actions significantly influenced behavioral decisions more than those related to pro-environmental actions, mediating the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and eventual behavioral decisions. The findings support the 'bad is stronger than good' principle, regardless of the emotional valence.",

          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

          "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) integrate advanced communication and autonomous driving technologies, enabling them to operate independently or with minimal human intervention. The anticipated benefits of CAVs are numerous and include making transportation accessible to all, reducing accidents due to human error, optimising traffic flow, and creating new industries and job opportunities. Autonomous driving capabilities in CAVs rely on advanced sensor technology and AI-driven analytics, which process data from multiple sensors to navigate, perceive the surrounding environment, detect obstacles, and make driving decisions in real-time. Despite the many benefits, CAVs will be highly vulnerable to a wide variety of crimes unless security measures are implemented by design. To understand the potential threats, this study introduces the enabling technology and reference architecture for CAVs and reports the findings from an extensive scoping review of the available literature. This covers reported crime incidents, academic literature on potential threats, a survey of academic survey papers on CAV security, and a review of papers concerned with cyberattacks against CAVs published in the past five years. The findings from the review are complemented by the findings from a workshop with experts about which of the identified threats should be prioritised for the purposes of crime reduction. The findings indicate that a wide range of cyber-attacks and offences are possible, and that the threat landscape is continually expanding due to insufficient attention being given to security during the development of the technology. Suggestions for policy and priorities for future work are suggested.",

The findings highlight the French sinologists’ approaches to defining and classifying Chinese words, their views on the relationship between written and spoken Chinese, and insights into the syllabic and morphological features of Chinese word formation. Although their analyses were grounded in the Latin grammatical framework for pedagogical convenience, they began to break away from it, recognizing the unique features of Chinese.

          "abstract": "German academia has faced a multitude of changes over the last two decades, including new alternative academic pathways to a professorship based on the Anglo-Saxon science system, such as junior or tenure track professorship. Our study investigates the patterns of academic career trajectories to a professorship that have emerged due to these changes. It looks deeper into the relationship between those patterns and determinants of academic success, such as previous career choices, scientific productivity and the chosen scientific field. Using data from the prof*panel (N=660) – a survey of recently appointed full professors in Germany – and sequence-cluster analysis, we find four academic career clusters, three of which are beyond the traditional pathway of Endurance Careers: Efficient Careers, Unconventional Careers and International Careers indicating an institutional change within German academia. Cluster affiliation is mainly related to time-to-tenure, habilitation (second thesis), working abroad and the field of the professorship. Our findings suggest that traditional career paths still play a major role, although the influence of internationalization and novel academic career steps, like junior and tenure-track positions, is growing. Furthermore, less conventional career paths, attract a higher proportion of women and are characterized by international mobility and more diverse professional experiences. The insights of our study underscore the ongoing changes in the landscape of academic careers and highlight both persistent challenges and new opportunities for aspiring professors.",

          "abstract": "Collective decision-making can be more accurate than individual decision-making, due to the ability of groups to aggregate information from many individuals. However, information aggregation and collective learning is vulnerable to a variety of social and cognitive biases which can undermine the \"wisdom of the crowds\" and result in bad decisions. Here, we study the effect of two very hard-to-avoid kinds of biases: the tendency of similar individuals to be connected, and the tendency to share some kinds of information more than others. We build mathematical models of a society composed of rational agents that use Bayesian inference to learn about the world, combining their direct observations with information they obtain from other agents. We include two forms of transmission bias: (1) assortment in communication networks, where individuals preferentially connect with similar others, and (2) selective sharing of signals. We identify conditions under which these effects are sufficient to generate stable divergence of beliefs across the population--either in the form of polarization or the entire population being misled. We show that when the population is balanced between types of agents, the collective is most sensitive to the effects of assortment. This is also the condition when the collective is  most responsive to the environment. Therefore, belief polarization is most likely under conditions that  support the greatest collective ability to learn the truth. Our results thus identify tradeoffs between accuracy and consensus in collective learning and highlight structural limits to collective intelligence, even in an idealized setting.",

          "abstract": "Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites worldwide and a cornerstone of contemporary digital infrastructure. At its core is a volunteer-driven governance system in which users elect administrators - trusted community members granted special rights and responsibilities. While previous research has emphasised online behaviours and platform-native metrics in explaining who becomes an administrator, this study examines how offline interactions shape leadership outcomes within the German-language Wikipedia. Drawing on large-scale observational data covering two decades of both online and offline activity, and using hybrid multilevel random effects models, the study investigates who runs for administrator and who is ultimately successful. The findings reveal that attending offline meetings has little bearing on the decision to run but significantly increases the likelihood of being elected. These effects are not consistent over time: while offline interactions mattered most in the early years of the platform, their influence diminished in more recent periods. The results highlight the importance of interpersonal ties even in digital and democratic spaces. This study contributes to broader debates on participation and leadership in peer production platforms.",

Such concerns date to Karl Marx, but have acquired renewed salience in the age of artificial intelligence and robots. This paper draws lessons from a major technological revolution in agriculture: the green revolution. In India, the spread of a new crop technology, high-yielding variety (HYV) crops, improved agricultural productivity, but also generated rising inequality between landowners and the rural poor. Drawing on a panel dataset linking district-level estimates of HYV crop adoption to digitized crime records, this paper provides evidence that the spread of the new crop technology contributed to a wave of banditry (dacoity), a crime associated with class conflict in agrarian societies. The technology-violence relationship was concentrated in districts with colonial-era landlord-based (zamindari) land tenure systems, plausibly because of less pass-through of agricultural productivity improvements to wages.",

After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",

          "abstract": "The integration of computational methods into International Political Economy (IPE) represents a transformative advancement, enhancing both the depth and breadth of research in the field. These methods use algorithms and simulations to study large or complex settings. enabling scholars to connect micro-level interactions with macro-level outcomes, addressing concerns about the discipline’s focus on micro-foundations. In this entry, we detail three main techniques: To start, we describe simulations through agent-based modeling, where the behavior of agents (e.g. individuals, companies, or states) and their interactions is defined by a mathematical model and run on a computer hundreds of times. This exercise allows for an understanding of how the interactions of individual agents (e.g., diplomatic relations between countries) lead to larger systemic changes, such as the impact of tariff policies on global trade. Next, we detail network analysis, where relationships between agents are represented and visualized as networks composed of nodes (agents) and ties (connections between them). This allows IPE researchers to, for example, map trade relations, and identify which countries hold the most bargaining power. Finally, we discuss machine learning, where computational algorithms are used to identify patterns and relationships in the data. This approach enables scholars to process large volumes of data (e.g., millions of text documents), thus allowing them to develop and test theories using novel datasets. These three relatively accessible tools—simluations, network analysis and machine learning—provide powerful means for analysing complex data sets, offering new insights into global economic dynamics and informing more effective policy-making.",

          "abstract": "Designing for serendipity in information technologies presents significant challenges for both scholars and practitioners. This paper presents a theoretical model of serendipity that aims to address this challenge by providing a structured framework for understanding and designing for serendipity. The model delineates between intended, afforded, and experienced serendipity, recognizing the role of design intents and the subjective nature of experiencing serendipity. Central to the model is the recognition that there is no single definition nor a unique operationalization of serendipity, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to its conceptualization and design. By delineating between the intentions of designers, the characteristics of the system, and the experiences of end-users, the model offers a pathway to resolve the paradox of artificial serendipity and provides actionable guidelines to design for serendipity in information technologies. However, it also emphasizes the importance of establishing ‘guardrails’ to guide the design process and mitigate potential negative unintended consequences. The model aims to lay ground to advance both research and the practice of designing for serendipity, leading to more ethical and effective design practices.",

          "authors": "Assel Sadykova; michelle.bedeker; Zhansaya Tatyyeva",
          "abstract": "This study examines how English-medium instruction (EMI) course documents construct knowledge, identity, and legitimacy in a foundation programme in Kazakhstan. Drawing on Systemic Functional Linguistics, we analyse evaluative language across institutional texts to explore how moral stance, affect, and cultural value are embedded within academic materials. While EMI is often presented as a neutral tool for accessing global knowledge, our findings reveal that course documents subtly encode Western epistemologies, positioning students through assumptions that conflict with their lived realities and local knowledge systems. Interviews and reflections from students illustrate how these texts produce confusion, cognitive fatigue, and affective dislocation, even when content appears culturally proximate. These dynamics reflect forms of symbolic violence that naturalise dominant knowledge regimes and marginalise students’ epistemic resources. Our study aligns with textbook analysis research and recent EMI critiques but extends them by revealing how ideological hierarchies are enacted through evaluative discourse, not just content. We argue for curriculum reform grounded in epistemic justice, calling for inclusive text selection, critical pedagogy, and institutional accountability to support more equitable knowledge engagement in EMI settings.",

          "abstract": "This working paper advances an infrastructural perspective to analyse how law, data, and mobility \nare co-constituted within the context of human mobility’s datafication. Anchored empirically in the \nborder crossing point of Rosso – located between Mauritania and Senegal – it reflects on how mobility \nis shaped through an evolving constellation of socio-technical and legal infrastructures. The aim is to \ndevelop a conceptual and methodological compass for studying datafied mobility by bringing into \ndialogue insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), critical security studies, and legal \nscholarship.\nThe paper first outlines the analytical value of infrastructure as both a conceptual lens and an \nempirical object. It reflects on three cross-cutting dimensions – materiality, relationality, and \ndistributional effects – that have gained prominence across disciplines and that enable a nuanced \nreading of infrastructural configurations. Building on this foundation, it then mobilizes key \ncontributions from the aforementioned fields, highlighting how their convergence offers a productive \nframework for examining the shifts resulting from data-intensive practices around mobility.\nRather than providing a comprehensive account, the paper positions infrastructural thinking as an \nopen-ended, empirically grounded approach. It explores the potential and limitations of this \nperspective to trace how infrastructures mediate and transform mobility. In doing so, it reflects on the \nmethodological challenges and advantages of studying infrastructures in motion, particularly in \ncontexts where legal, technical, and political boundaries are unstable, layered, and contested.",

          "authors": "Alise Ward",
          "abstract": "Scholars and industry audits have extensively documented the portrayal of racial and gender identities in mainstream Hollywood cinema, revealing persistent disparities in on‑screen representation. People of color in media, specifically film, have historically faced challenges, including underrepresentation, stereotypical portrayals, and limited storytelling. However, there is a gap in research specifically on women of color as protagonists in film. Most treat race and gender as separate issues. This study aims to investigate the underrepresentation and stereotyping of women of color in top-grossing Hollywood films by assessing screen time, speaking time, and narrative agency of women of color characters. Results show that the proportion of women of color in films has risen from 1% in 2007 to 16% in 2021. Women of color still comprise less than 10% of total screen time and speak only 14% of dialogue instances across the sample. A qualitative case study of Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Okoye and Shuri demonstrates that when women of color are positioned with central narrative agency, they exhibit leadership and technical influence that sharply contrast with broader industry norms. “These findings lay the groundwork for future studies on how women of color are portrayed, how different audiences respond to those portrayals, and how casting processes can become genuinely inclusive.",

          "authors": "Arab World English Journal; Khairi O. Al-Zubaidi",
          "abstract": "In our first volume in 2024, we discussed the challenges posed by ChatGPT. We noted that the rapid advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created a complex mix of fear, excitement, and concerns within academia. Despite initial worries surrounding the release of the first version of ChatGPT in November 2022, millions of people around the world have welcomed various artificial intelligence applications and tools. Since its launch, ChatGPT has experienced significant growth in its user base. OpenAI has set a target of reaching one billion users by the end of 2025 (Duarte, 2025).\n\nThe concern about AI in academic life was mainly about plagiarism and academic integrity, assessment challenges, and evaluating learning.  AI also might not develop critical skills like writing, reasoning, or coding skills that are supposed to be part of their academic formation. Despite the concerns, many educators are also excited about AI’s potential to personalize learning, support students with disabilities, help with language barriers, and offer instant feedback.\n\nThere are several AI tools available now: ChatGPT, Canva, Gemini, Copilot, Grok, Claude, etc., but ChatGPT stands out as the leading and most popular tool in language programming. Additionally, Microsoft offers free training for anyone looking to enhance and deepen their AI skills in various languages, including Arabic.\n\nAlthough Chinese DeepSeek was founded in 2023, it released its language model, DeepSeek-R1, in January 2025. DeepSeek has surpassed ChatGPT in downloads, becoming the most downloaded free app. This development highlights the growing competitiveness of global AI advancements and poses a significant challenge to ChatGPT’s established presence. (Mingyue, 2025).\n\nOne of the latest developments in AI is the “Stargate Plan.” This initiative involves a $500 billion investment by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX to build advanced AI data centers. The goal of the project is to create a strong foundation for the development and deployment of advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs), by the year 2029. (Wheatley, 2025).\n\nFurthermore, most academic institutions aim to foster the growth of skilled faculty to drive innovation, look for practical insights into how institutions can strengthen academic integrity to build an ethical future, and prepare for future challenges, ultimately engaging in world-class research.\n\nWith the rapid advancements in AI, significant investments, and intense competition, it is crucial to recognize that predicting the future of AI development is highly challenging. These advancements are transforming many facets of human life. According to Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the “Godfather of AI,” and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024, AI has the potential to “exceed human intelligence,” and he warns that “the world is not prepared for what’s coming.” Hinton, who was the vice president of Google, resigned in 2023. He also stated, “There’s a 50-50 chance A.I. will get smarter than us. When it gets smarter than us, I don’t know what the probability is that it will take over, but it seems to me quite likely.” (Tremayne-Pengelly, 2024, para.8).\n\nAI will undoubtedly continue to impact our academic lives significantly, and we remain uncertain about the extent of the gap that will emerge between the newborn digital generation (Generation Z) and those of us who are adapting to this revolutionized artificial intelligence age.\n\nWith all these challenges and the development of AI, we are releasing our new special issue on “The Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in English Language Teaching, Learning, and Academic Publications”.   This volume explores the role of artificial intelligence across various areas of the English language. Topics covered include: artificial intelligence tools in English for specific purposes, the pros and cons of ChatGPT in foreign language teaching, using ChatGPT in writing essays,  AI tools for enhancing writing proficiency,  artificial Intelligence’s Impact on English teaching quality in Moroccan high schools,  AI in enhancing reading comprehension,  using ChatGPT in enhancing Master’s thesis,  ChatGPT as a writing tool in Moroccan higher education, evaluating the efficacy of AI-powered tools,  the impact of AI on critical thinking, the Influence of ChatGPT on English grammar and others. Each topic of this volume examines how artificial intelligence affects various aspects of the English language and education.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the contributions of all authors whose work has enriched this volume, and we regret that, due to editorial considerations, not all submitted papers could be included.",

          "authors": "Theodore J Kalaitzidis",
          "abstract": "Generative AI has not broken higher education; it has revealed the fractures that were already there. This paper argues that traditional pedagogies (i.e., those anchored in formalist epistemologies) are structurally misaligned with the demands of a world saturated by thinking machines. Blending systems analysis with epistemological critique, the paper introduces three critical frameworks: epistemic laundering, the epistemological vector space, and the cognitive ecology (a multimodal model of reasoning that maps how symbolic, conceptual, and contextual cognition interact in real-world learning). Together, these frameworks expose the incoherence of legacy educational models and offer a new basis for instructional design. From this foundation, the paper proposes Critical AI Literacy as a pedagogical response that pairs epistemic awareness with technical fluency. It also outlines practical strategies to integrate GenAI responsibly into learning environments: RAG tutors, cognitive partnerships, interactive content generation, and adaptive skill-gap training. Ultimately, GenAI is framed not as a threat, but as a mirror: reflecting the need to move beyond performance metrics toward adaptive, agentive, and epistemically aligned education.",

          "abstract": "How, and for whom, do political events translate into enduring political change? This article proposes a two-stage model of generational imprinting, where identity-congenial cues determine whether individuals update their political attitudes in the immediate aftermath of a political shock, while life-course position determines whether that change is persistent or not. Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using three surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2022. I show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement in response to the killing of George Floyd. However, these effects persisted among younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization. This article thus integrates two classic—though largely partial—theories of political learning, providing a framework for understanding how episodic shocks can realign political divides across generations.",

          "abstract": "The question of what creates and sustains national political identities has been investigated from many angles. However, the question of how international constraints on national autonomy shape national identities is so far under-investigated. This paper uses the European sovereign debt crisis as a case for investigating whether externally imposed constraints on fiscal political autonomy, typically contested decisions, solidify or weaken national solidarity. Using data from 1983-2021, I find that the imposition of austerity led to a strengthening of national identities immediately after the austerity packages were agreed. This effect was strongest in Southern Europe, where austerity had the largest social impact and constituted the greatest break with pre-existing national policy preferences. I find evidence that the strengthening of exclusively national self-identification after the imposition of austerity was most likely driven by an increased perception of economic threat in the austerity countries, rather than shifting evaluations of EU membership.",

This article conceptualizes and illustrates major ways in which this value dimension becomes salient and provides an overview of conflicts over embedding culture and political ideology into generative AI systems. Besides an unintentional incorporation of values into AI, governments and businesses intentionally shape the values of AI systems – leading to tensions within and between societies and both on the level of AI system design and governance. Governments and businesses furthermore engage in value signaling as the open recognition of the fact that certain social values and political ideas are embedded in AI systems.

          "abstract": "This research investigates the impact of integrating extended reality (XR) technology into a blended learning model on the development of clinical thinking skills among medical students. Recognizing the limitations of traditional medical education in fostering these skills, the study explores the potential of XR-enhanced blended learning to create immersive and interactive learning environments. A clinical thinking blended learning mode incorporating XR technology was designed and implemented. The effectiveness of this mode was evaluated by comparing the clinical thinking skills of students exposed to it with those receiving traditional instruction. Student engagement, satisfaction, and perceived learning outcomes within the XR-integrated environment were also assessed. Findings indicate that the XR-integrated blended learning mode significantly improves clinical thinking skills, including diagnostic reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Students demonstrated higher levels of engagement and satisfaction, attributing their enhanced learning to specific XR features such as interactive simulations and personalized feedback. The study identifies key factors contributing to the success of XR-integrated blended learning and proposes a framework for designing and evaluating such interventions in medical education. The implications of this research suggest that XR-integrated blended learning offers a promising approach to enhance medical education, addressing limitations of traditional methods and promoting the development of essential clinical competencies.",

          "abstract": "The study aims is to determine how AI tools affect the linguistic features of student writing. The research questions are: (1) How do AI writing tools affect the linguistic features of student writing? (2) What are university instructors’ attitudes toward the use of AI in writing instruction? The significance of this study arises from its addition to the literature on how AI technologies affect writing pedagogy and student learning in higher education. Using a mixed-methods design, the study questioned 60 university students enrolled in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. Students were divided into two groups: students who used AI writing tools regularly and students who wrote without AI. Data were collected through essay writing tasks, student questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and instructor feedback. Every subject wrote two essays, which were assessed for grammaticality, lexical diversity (measured in terms of the type-token ratio and vocabulary density), and coherence (based on rubric-based discourse analysis). Instructor feedback provided qualitative scores of writing depth and originality. Outcomes indicate that writing with AI significantly reduces grammatical errors, enhances vocabulary range, and promotes text cohesion by using programmed hints at linkages. However, there are serious concerns about the passive acceptance of AI suggestions by students that can compromise cognitive effort and critical thinking. There were instances when AI-produced work led to robotic sentence structure and formulaic arrangement. Teachers stressed the need for a pedagogical balance with AI tools without compromising students’ ability to write independently. The report concludes that, while AI can be a good writing tool, it should never be a substitute for but only a supplement to traditional writing pedagogy.",

The results show that most students improved their English pronunciation, widened their vocabulary by using ChatGPT prompts in communication activities, and learned the grammatical structures to use in formal and informal settings. The affective component is further enhanced as students are motivated to improve their English with the help of this tool. However, students faced technical problems when implementing this tool for English communication. Other issues were unspecific feedback on pronunciation and inappropriate formulation of prompts, which confused students with excessively generated suggestions. The study highlights the positive impact of ChatGPT on the autonomous learning of the addressed students.

This quasi-experimental study consisted of two experimental groups: experimental Group One (E1), which primarily utilized AI-powered writing tools, and Experimental Group 2 ( E2) which blended the usage of AI tools with a traditional method. In contrast, the control group just employed traditional methods to teach students the skill of crafting persuasive essays. This study discovered that the integration of conventional methods with AI-driven tools significantly improved writing competency and the long-term retention of argumentative writing abilities. This study indicates that second language learners attain optimal learning outcomes by combining traditional teaching techniques with AI-driven technologies.

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool, integrated across various sectors. In education, AI has generated significant excitement among students for its potential to enhance learning experiences. However, concerns about overreliance on AI temper this enthusiasm, as it may undermine the development of critical thinking skills. Numerous studies have highlighted the risks associated with students’ excessive use of generative AI (GAI) in academic tasks, noting its potential to diminish cognitive abilities. However, the optimal use of AI to enhance students’ critical thinking skills remains under-researched. Therefore, this study seeks to answer the question: How does generative AI influence students’ critical thinking, self-efficacy, and decision-making? This study aims to explore the synergic relationship between human intelligence and artificial intelligence in augmenting essential thinking skills among students and building upon their existing cognitive resources through self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. Specifically, it explores the cause-and-effect connections among GAI, self-efficacy, decision-making, learning motivation, and critical thinking skills. A quantitative methodology used an online questionnaire to collect responses from 165 undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral students. Statistical analyses, including bootstrapping techniques, were conducted to examine direct and indirect effects. The results revealed that GAI has a significant positive influence on self-efficacy, learning motivation, decision-making, and critical thinking skills. In turn, self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making significantly impact critical thinking skills. The mediating results indicated that GAI can indirectly boost students’ critical thinking by enhancing self-efficacy, learning motivation, and decision-making. This suggests that AI capabilities can transform the cognitive learning process.",

It measures their sub-dimensions; cognate, cognitive, and effectiveness attitude and behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement. A quantitative research design was employed using a five-point Likert scale-based questionnaire to address key questions on attitudes, engagement, satisfaction, and their correlations. A total of 170 English Language and Literature undergraduates from a Saudi university participated. Findings showed satisfaction ranked highest (M = 4.04), followed by attitude (M = 3.95), and engagement lowest (M = 3.90). Cognitive engagement (M = 4.14) was the strongest sub-dimension, closely linked to satisfaction, whereas emotional and behavioral engagement were weaker, indicating a need for more interactive AI tools. Students expressed willingness to recommend AI tools, though the impact of attitudes on academic success suggested room for enhancement. This study contributes to EFL research by holistically analyzing all the three dimensions and their sub-dimensions toward using AI-assisted reading comprehension. Unlike previous studies that examined these dimensions separately, it explores their interconnections. The main aim is to present the findings as recommendations for educators, AI developers, and EFL program administrators to better integrate AI tools in language education, as well as to contribute to a successful Al-assisted reading comprehension development, pedagogical insights, and practical implications for EFL teaching practices.",

The piece is today of high relevance, as it gives ground to a series of new work developed in the experimental game cultures context in Vienna and abroad, connecting ideas about a new form of art and independent collective game design, applying Ludic Method and The Psycholudic Approach in an idea of games for/with non-humans: The Electroenzephalogram (EEG), a technology for measuring brain activity uses electrodes, that are used in this art piece symbolically. This symbolical transfer of technologies of cognitive and neurosciences are demonstrating exemplarily a new form of artistic research and art in play. The piece as sculptural artefact, as toy, as “objeto de juego” investigates new ways of addressing environmentalism, democracy and the relationship between society and collective cooperative acting. Our artpiece features two radical approaches: 1. A fundamental change of between the roles of “citizen” and “scientist” and “artist” and “researcher”. 2. Players’ roles are mirrored in a visualization of the captured image, of mindclouds made of braindata of the artist, that is allowed to be changed through the play of the visitors. This means that each art biennale visitor can become an activist player potentially manipulating thoughts or “mindclouds” during the game. Our aim is to create a reflexive game that allows the players to embody a change of position in relation to medical devices, as EEG and to reflect the efficacy of cooperative play.",

If technology futurists are right that the advent of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will radically alter the global balance of power, could AGI development tempt states to resort to war to secure those advantages for themselves or to deny them to their rivals? In this working paper, we develop a framework of variables that shape preventive war risks and consider how these variables apply to AGI development. By AGI, we mean advanced artificial intelligence that can match or exceed human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. This working paper evaluates AGI’s implications from a political rather than a technical perspective. That is, if rapid technological progress toward AGI continues, what are the political implications for international stability? Drawing from three scenarios for how preventive pressures could potentially manifest as preventive wars, the analysis suggests that the probability of war is low in absolute terms. But preventive war appears relatively more likely to occur in an attempt to preserve a monopoly on AGI than to prevent one.",

          "abstract": "Brexit’s effects were felt not just between the UK and EU but also had profound effects in other jurisdictions with special relationships to the UK. The Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man) and Overseas Territories (those geographically in Europe being Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus) have complex and often unique constitutional histories and relationships with the UK. This meant that each jurisdiction had to respond in its own way to the many challenges posed to the very fabric of established legal and political relationships. This chapter looks at the fascinating histories which have existed between the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories and the UK, how these histories went to shape their EU relationships with Europe and what this meant for the Brexit trade agenda and its outcomes. The chapter also looks to the future to consider how these jurisdictions which are not part of the United Kingdom yet have a deep British relationship might respond in developing further their own international identities.",

          "authors": "Betsy Alafoginis; Heide Jackson; Michael S. Rendall",
          "abstract": "Abortion has been found to be severely underreported overall, and underreported differentially across groups, when using a direct question. The list-experiment method attempts to overcome these reporting biases indirectly by asking how many items an individual has experienced, but not which, where abortion is one of the items asked to a randomly-assigned ‘treatment’ group but not to a control group. Abortion incidence is estimated as the difference in the mean number of items reported between the treatment and control groups. If list-experiment respondents are also asked a direct abortion question, a combined-data estimator can be constructed from respondents with and without affirmative responses to the direct question. We assess for four U.S. states how this combined estimator may improve estimation of cumulative lifetime abortion incidence relative to the direct question or the list experiment alone. Our combined-data estimate across the four states is 12.9% (95% CI: 10.5, 15.4), which is substantively and statistically higher than both the list-experiment estimate (11.0%, CI: 8.9, 13.2) and the direct-question estimate (9.6%, CI: 8.6, 10.5). Bias by state is much more variable for the direct question than for the list experiment. We conclude that the combined-data estimator improves estimation especially over the direct question.",

          "abstract": "This study highlights how better demographic measurement more accurately informs public policymakers. In this era of renewed and more vigorous efforts to clear people experiencing unsheltered homelessness (unsheltered PEH) from city sidewalks, parks, and elsewhere, elected officials and other stakeholders need to clearly understand the dynamics of their unsheltered PEH populations. To advance understanding, this study investigated in-migration of unsheltered PEH in conjunction with the Los Angeles Continuum of Care’s 2024 HUD-mandated Point-in-Time count. In response to the measurement work of Mitchell (2024), the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s 2024 Demographic Survey of unsheltered PEH instrument included a new item distinguishing between perceptions of a place where one has lived versus stayed, which revealed whether in-migration of individuals and families coming to the area immediately experienced homelessness or became unhoused after relocation. This analysis of over one-thousand survey participants self-identified as having migrated into Los Angeles County (a quarter of the total sample of unsheltered PEH) also explored whether there were associations with first-time homelessness or with being accompanied by household members. Responses to this complex survey were analyzed using Stata 17 MP. Key findings include that most survey participants reported either arriving homeless and unsheltered or first staying in either their own or a friend’s or family member’s home. More than half of all in-migration was initially to housed situations (more so for first-time homelessness), not into homelessness. Lone adults were more likely to experience homelessness immediately while accompanied adults were most likely to first stay in someone else’s home.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPopulation forecasts produced by governments at all levels are used in the public sector, the private sector, and by researchers. They have been primarily produced using deterministic methods.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe propose to show how a method for producing measures of uncertainty can be applied to existing subnational population forecasts while meeting several important criteria, including the concept of utility. We will assess the efficacy of our method by: (1) examining the change in uncertainty intervals it produces by population size and growth rate; and (2) comparing the width and temporal change of the uncertainty intervals it produces to the width and temporal change of uncertainty intervals produced by a Bayesian approach.\n\nMETHODS\nOur approach follows the logic of the Espenshade-Tayman method for producing confidence intervals in conjunction with ARIMA equations to construct a probabilistic interval around the total populations forecasted from the Cohort Component Method, the typical approach used by demographers.\n\nRESULTS\nPopulation size and growth rate are related to the width of the forecast intervals, with size being the stronger predictor, and the intervals from the proposed method are not dissimilar to those produced by a Bayesian approach.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis approach is well-suited to generating probabilistic subnational population forecasts in the United States and elsewhere where these forecasts are routinely produced. It has a higher level of utility, is simpler, and is more accessible to those tasked with producing measures of uncertainty around population forecasts.",

          "abstract": "Population aging is largely due to increased longevity coupled with low fertility, a result of completing the demographic transition. In the initial stage, control of epidemic and contagious diseases lowers the death rate, which leads to rapid population growth because fertility rates remain high until the modernization process leads to factors that suppress fertility. This framework is used in a first-ever examination of the future of population aging in the Western Hemisphere and its four regions, The Caribbean, Central America, North America, and South America. Although there is variation across the regions, the population aged 65 years and over is expected to more than double between 2020 and 2050. Coinciding with the expected increases in the older population are decreases in both the pre-school and the school age populations. These demographic changes will place increasing and competing demands not only on the public and private sectors, but also on families.",

          "abstract": "This article theorizes how political divisions permeate social interaction, transforming the political into the personal in everyday life. Drawing on affective polarization research, we highlight the central role of identification and emotions in shaping political in-groups and out-groups. Moving beyond conventional measures of cross-group resentment, we conceptualize polarization as the lived experience of political antagonism. We argue that polarization materializes through struggles for recognition, shaped by the perception and processing of political conflict as it circulates through public communication channels. Adopting a performance-theoretical lens, we connect the symbolic language, emotions, and misrecognition in micropolarization to the broader public drama of political conflict. Using interview data on family and friendship disputes related to COVID-19 vaccination denial in the UK and Germany, we examine how public conflicts manifest in interpersonal relationships. This study suggests a research agenda that explores interactional dynamics across online and offline spaces, diverse social groups, and varying levels of relational involvement, offering a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of political polarization.",

          "abstract": "Unmet need for family planning puts women at risk for unintended pregnancies; however, unmet need is made up of both women who have never used a method of family planning and those who have used a modern method but subsequently discontinued. Understanding patterns of discontinuation can inform policies and practices to reduce unmet need for family planning and therefore promote gender equity and maternal and infant health. In this paper, we explore seasonal contraceptive patterns in Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Nepal using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) contraceptive calendar from the most recent survey in each country prior to Covid-19. Specifically, we investigate contraceptive discontinuation associated with major holidays – times when women may travel or health facilities may close. Even after accounting for recall bias, major holidays appear to drive contraceptive discontinuation in a subset of countries and could serve as a powerful point for intervention.",

          "abstract": "In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has postulated that international migrant stocks fell short of their pre-pandemic projections by nearly 2 million due to travel restrictions. However, this is not testable with migration data from traditional sources. Key migration stakeholders, have called for using data from alternative sources, including social media, to fill in these gaps. Building on previous work using social media data to analyze migration responses to external shocks, we test the hypothesis that COVID-related travel restrictions reduced migrant stock relative to expected migration without such restrictions using estimates of migrants drawn from Facebook’s advertising platform and dynamic panel models. We focus four key origin countries in North and West Africa (Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal), and their 23 key destination countries. Between February and June 2020, we estimate that a destination country implementing a month-long total entry ban on arrivals from Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria, Morocco, or Senegal might have expected a 3.39% reduction in migrant stock from the restricted country compared with the counterfactual in which no travel restrictions were implemented. However, when broader societal disruptions of the pandemic are accounted for, we estimate that countries implementing travel restrictions might paradoxically have expected an increase in migrant stock. In this context, travel restrictions do not appear to have effectively curbed migration and could have resulted in outcomes opposite their intended effects.",

          "abstract": "Migration lawyers exercise political agency: in choosing which clients to represent and how to present their claims to bureaucrats and judges, lawyers shape what the governance of migration looks like in practice. In 2022, we interviewed 16 lawyers specialized in Dutch family migration law, inquiring how they see their own roles vis-à-vis the state, how they address cultural differences in what counts as “family”, and how they handle suspicions of fraud.  The variety in approaches we observed clearly reveals that family migration lawyers are far from neutral, apolitical actors. Personal convictions informed professional practice, even among lawyers who eschewed activist “cause lawyering”.  While our respondents all believed some or many elements of the migration regime should change and sought to exercise pressure through their legal practices, they all also acted as gatekeepers of the current migration regime – partly out of conviction, partly because they believed they can best (or only) support their clients by playing by the rules of the game. Building on the scholarship on lawyers’ professional ethics, I argue that everyday migration lawyering involves a form of moral activism oriented towards social change that – perhaps inevitably and often reluctantly – also involves gatekeeping.",

We propose a structural approach emphasizing how shifts in communication patterns between extreme and moderate groups affect the prevalence of extremist language, including hate speech. Our findings suggest that reducing network echo fosters linguistic accommodation, leading focal groups to linguistically align with outgroups. Critically, this effect is double-edged: increased contact with radical groups prompts moderate users to adopt more extreme discourse, whereas diminishing isolation from moderate groups decreases extremist language, challenging conventional wisdom that dismantling echo chambers merely redistributes extremist dialogue rather than reducing it. We discuss implications for research on echo chambers, policy and platform strategies aimed at mitigating extremism online, and the interplay of structure and language.",

However, evidence on the interaction between genetic propensity\nfor high body mass index (BMI) and family SES remains inconclusive. This study investigates\nwhether genetic associations with BMI diﬀer among individuals from high-SES versus low-SES\nfamilies and whether these associations vary across the life course. Drawing on the\ncompensatory advantage model in sociology and the diathesis-stress model in psychology, I\ntest the hypothesis that genetic associations with BMI are stronger among individuals from\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), I assess the association between a polygenic index\nfor BMI (BMI PGI) and BMI at four life stages: adolescence (≃ 16), early adulthood (≃ 22),\nadulthood (≃ 28), and later adulthood (≃ 37). Consistent with theoretical expectations, results\nshow that the BMI PGI is more predictive of BMI among individuals from low-SES families\nthan from high-SES families. The interaction weakens over the life course but persists among\nindividuals with high BMI levels. These findings suggest that high-SES families may buffer\ngenetic propensities for overweight and obesity, whereas low-SES environments may\nexacerbate them, increasing the risk of elevated BMI. The results underscore the importance\nof family socioeconomic background in shaping BMI outcomes and highlight how\nenvironmental interventions, such as promoting healthy eating and physical activity, may help\nreduce social inequalities in health.",

In this context of confidence, the EU approached human security distinctively through the decades of the 2000s and 2010s. There was an emphasis on multilateralism and the nurturing of new partnerships; on connecting global agendas and local needs; on combining instruments to manage multiple facets of crises; on aligning short-term and long-term approaches to building human security. Today, however, human security has suffered two backlashes. Firstly, the application of the concept has been difficult. In striving for an increasingly multidimensional, broad, and inclusive approach, the EU’s human security framework has weakened its edge and deferred tangible results. Secondly, a return of realpolitik in the European thinking of security has replaced peace and emancipation with militarised notions of security and defence. This paper not only argues that Europeans may have lost their moral backbone in foreign policy but also serves as a call to rethink and deepen security in EU policy thinking.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of technology integration and systematic visitor feedback on improving tea tourism outcomes. Drawing on survey responses from 106 tea tourism stakeholders, we developed a composite measure of Tea Tourism Improvement (encompassing operational efficiency, service quality, and visitor satisfaction) and assessed its relationship with two key constructs: positive digital practices (e.g., enhanced online marketing, streamlined booking systems, and effective feedback utilization) and perceived barriers (e.g., limited internet access and the absence of a formal feedback process). An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) validated a two-factor structure with a high sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.893) and significant Bartlett’s Test (p &lt; 0.001), while the two factors collectively explained over 89% of the variance in tea tourism improvement. Subsequently, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that positive digital practices (Factor 1) have a strong positive influence (β = 0.929, p &lt; 0.001) on tourism improvement, whereas the barrier construct (Factor 2) is significantly negatively related (β = –0.171, p &lt; 0.001) to the same outcome. Residual diagnostics confirmed that the model assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were adequately met. The results underscore the critical role of digital transformation and structured feedback in enhancing tea tourism, while also highlighting the importance of addressing infrastructural and procedural barriers. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported measures. Future research should consider longitudinal approaches and incorporate objective performance metrics.",

          "abstract": "Many parts of the world are experiencing widespread social and political instability, as well as ongoing climatic changes that are expected to worsen in the years and decades ahead. These changes can undermine child health and development through multiple pathways, and the increasing frequency of these shocks increases the likelihood that individuals are exposed to two or more stressors simultaneously. Empirical evidence about the potential impacts of such cooccurring shocks on children’s health has been limited to date, despite strong conceptual motivations for such analysis. We address this gap in the current study by measuring the independent and compounding effects of conflict and climate exposures on the weight-for-height (WHZ) of 0-23 month-old children across 33 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (n=188,558). To do so, we combine georeferenced records from the Demographic and Health Surveys, the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, and the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation/Temperature dataset. We then fit regression models to measure the independent and interactive effects of conflict and climate exposures, to explore heterogeneity across social groups, and to assess the robustness of these main results to measurement and modeling decisions. The results indicate that heat independently undermines children’s health, but conflict exposures are only marginally associated with reductions in WHZ when averaged across the sample. However, conflict exposures are associated with substantively large and statistically significant reductions in WHZ when they occur in contexts experiencing unusually hot temperatures. These results may indicate that heat-stress-affected populations may be especially vulnerable to the health impacts of conflict. These impacts are also heterogeneous across social groups, and indicate that children born to less-educated mothers and in urban areas may be most vulnerable to conflict and climate exposures.",

          "abstract": "This study examines consumer attitudes toward refillable and reusable packaging across 22 product categories through a novel three-dimensional measurement approach. By simultaneously assessing willingness to use refillable packaging, likelihood of choosing it over single-use alternatives, and intention to actively seek refill stations, we quantify the value-action gap in sustainable packaging adoption. Results from 441 North American respondents reveal that despite moderate to high willingness (M=3.09), behavioral intentions decline significantly for likelihood (M=2.17) and active engagement (M=1.66). This gap varies substantially across product categories, with food staples demonstrating the smallest gaps and personal care products the largest. Cluster analysis identified four distinct category groupings with different adoption potentials. Hierarchical regression analyses explain 53.2% of the variance in the value-action gap, with convenience barriers (β=0.38), convenience orientation (β=0.38), and hygiene concerns (β=0.32) emerging as the strongest predictors. Environmental attitudes significantly predict willingness but become progressively less influential for behavioral intentions. Shopping habits, particularly planning tendencies and shopping frequency, play crucial roles in facilitating refillable packaging adoption. These findings provide evidence-based insights for manufacturers, retailers, and policymakers seeking to promote sustainable packaging solutions that align with consumer preferences and behaviors across different product domains.",

This study\nexamines secondary effects in school choice, and the role of social capital – resources embedded in peer and parental networks in primary school – in these patterns within the context of the Netherlands. I rely on linked sociometric and full-population register data for Dutch students who have recently transitioned to secondary school. Hypotheses are tested using fixed effects regression\nmodels to account for (self-)selection into primary school. Results indicate that secondary school choice is socially stratified: Students from higher socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds tend to avoid pre-vocational schools, prefer pre-university schools, and opt for heterogeneous classes at intermediate performance levels. There is limited evidence for the relation between social\ncapital and the type of school chosen. A notable exception is that lower SES students are less likely to enroll in pre-vocational schools if their parents are integrated into resource-rich networks in primary school, suggesting that such networks may play a compensatory role by discouraging decisions that hinder upward-track mobility.",

Our findings indicate a significant surge in academic interest, especially between 2022 and 2024, highlighting the growing recognition of CS as a valuable approach to urban sustainability. Using a tool for constructing and visualising bibliometric networks, VOSviewer, we identified three primary thematic clusters: (1) biodiversity, ecology, and conservation; (2) methodologies and practices; and (3) humans and communities. These clusters underscore the diverse contributions of CS, ranging from environmental monitoring to participatory urban planning or community-based research. The review identifies established topics, particularly in biodiversity and conservation, where CS initiatives focus on species monitoring, conservation efforts, and food production. Emerging trends point to interdisciplinary CS applications, integrating community science and citizen engagement, public and environmental health and climate change studies to address complex sustainability challenges. However, underdeveloped niches remain, particularly in the integration of CS with policymaking, the inclusion of underserved or disadvantaged communities in sustainability research and the framing of the later studies within an environmental and climate justice perspectives. This review highlights CS potential to address the complexity of sustainable urban development and urban sustainability challenges, promoting inclusive participation and orienting the effort to actionable solutions. Future trends are likely to further emphasize community science, citizen engagement, and the intersection of human health and climate change.",

          "title": "AI on the Battlefield? Revisiting Public Support for LAWs",
          "authors": "Matthew DiGiuseppe; Katrin Paula; Tobias Rommel",
          "abstract": "Why do citizens support the development of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs)? In this paper, we revisit the claim that support for taboo weapons is driven by the logic of external threats, now that individuals are more familiar with artificial intelligence and the international environment has grown more uncertain. In our study, we probe public attitudes toward both the development of LAWs and international cooperation to address the risks. Based on original survey data from 2,500 respondents in the US, we provide an observational as well as an experimental analysis. Observationally, general support for AI and favorable views of militarism and US hegemony as well as perceived competition from other countries are highly correlated with support for the use of lethal AI-weapons. Experimentally, we show that information that rivals or allies are already developing such weapons increases support for LAWs. Additionally, we find that competition from other countries does not influence support for global cooperation to limit AI on the battlefield. Overall, our analysis supports the idea that concerns for security have the power to override opposition to these taboo weapons.",

          "title": "A “disorder that exacerbates all other crises” or “a word we use to shut you up”?  A critical policy analysis of NGOs discourses on COVID-19 misinformation",
          "authors": "Claudia Chaufan; Natalie Hemsing",
          "abstract": "Drawing from Carol Bacchi's \"What is the problem represented to be?\" framework, we analysed discourses within documents from five NGOs that have influenced the debate around “COVID-19 misinformation”. Through Google Scholar, we identified documents published between 2020 and 2024, selecting 29 reports by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, First Draft, Meedan, Public Good Projects, and the EU Disinfo Lab, and 13 articles authored by their directors or research directors. \n\nAcross the data, the proposed policy solutions consisted of tracking, managing and suppressing any COVID-relevant expression perceived as undermining the official policy response. It followed that the “problem” was represented to be these expressions, or rather, individuals producing them, framed as threatening science, democracy and even human survival. NGOs also positioned themselves as experts in an emerging scientific field, infodemiology, thus equipped to evaluate all forms of communication according to their own or similar experts' standards. Notably, none of the documents engaged with the substance of opposing viewpoints or disconfirming evidence, dismissing them almost entirely via authority, ad populum, or ad hominem fallacies. We conclude that, rather than defending science, democracy, or human survival, these NGOs and their partners are undermining the open, respectful, and inclusive debate essential to support these values.",

          "authors": "Abirami Thirumanickam; Stacie Attrill; Niki Welz; David Anthony Hobbs",
          "abstract": "Purpose: This research explored the use of Minecraft® as an accessible game-based program for facilitating social collaborative skill development in 10-12-year-old pre-adolescent autistic children. \nMethod: Underpinned by inclusive research principles, the study was co-designed with consumers with lived experience, and used a mixed-method design to explore intervention effects across different intensities (high vs. low) and modalities (face-to-face vs. online).\nResults: A total of 11 children participated, divided into four groups of 2-3 players each. The findings from both quantitative and qualitative analysis were promising. Yet, more research is warranted to further validate the findings.\nConclusion: The active involvement of consumers with lived experience in the program design and implementation was critical in producing a meaningful and valuable outcome for the families and children.",
