          "title": "Examining Externalization as an Approach for Eating Disorder Recovery: A Qualitative Study of Self-Reported Experiences with Intrapersonal Dialogue",
          "authors": "Michelle Cowan",
          "abstract": "A narrative therapy technique, externalization involves personifying an illness, condition, or part of the self and dialoguing with it as if it were another person. Externalization is used to separate the person in therapy from the problems they are experiencing through the careful use of language and dialogue. This article examines the use of externalization as a tool for eating disorder recovery among a sample of 10 study participants whose recorded responses and interviews were coded as part of a larger discourse analysis related to personal definitions of recovery. Although externalization worked well for some participants, most had either stopped practicing externalization completely or had integrated the externalized eating disorder persona back into their concept of self. This research illuminates the complex and varied experiences people have with intrapersonal communication and emphasizes the care that must be taken when investigating the use of internal dialogue as a tool for dealing with mental illness.",

          "title": "AI Cannot Be Reproduced: Medical AI Needs a Culture of Logging, Not Reruns",
          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), including generative AI, are rapidly being adopted for tasks ranging from manuscript drafting to clinical decision support. Yet the evaluation and governance of these systems still rely heavily on a traditional notion of “reproducibility”: if one runs the same procedure under the same conditions, one should obtain the same result. For probabilistic and highly environment-dependent LLMs, bit-identical reruns are neither realistic nor especially useful.\nDrawing on OpenAI’s work on weight-sparse transformers and recent proposals such as MedLog for event-level clinical AI logging, this article argues that medical AI—particularly AI-assisted writing and explanation—should shift its primary evaluative target from strict reproducibility to auditability. In practice, this means designing layered “log cultures” that record how systems were used, with appropriate granularity for different levels of risk. Even if future models achieve substantially higher technical reproducibility, meaningful verification of individual outputs will still depend on access to their provenance: what model, in which version, was run with what inputs and settings, under whose oversight. Journals such as NEJM AI are well positioned to move from merely asking, “Was AI used?” to setting concrete expectations about what must be logged, retained, and, where appropriate, shared. Such standards would guide clinicians, institutions, vendors, and payers in building log practices that make AI use contestable rather than opaque.",

          "authors": "Liz Allen; Veronique Kiermer; Simon Porter; Ruth Wittham",
          "abstract": "The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) was introduced in 2015 to improve transparency, accountability, and recognition in scholarly authorship by standardizing the description of contributor roles. This study aims to provide the first comprehensive retrospective system-wide analysis of global adoption of CRediT. A key challenge is that while support for CRediT has grown organically, among authors and publishers, implementation has been inconsistent across publishers, making systematic data collection difficult. To overcome this challenge, we used the Dimensions database and applied a multi-stage text-extraction method. Our analysis identified more than 3.2 million roles articles, preprints and conference papers including CRediT, from 2015 to 2024. Our results show accelerating adoption, with CRediT appearing in 22.5% of all 2024 publications with available full text. All 14 CRediT roles are now widely used, with notable growth in roles reflecting evolving research practices such as Software and Data Curation. Adoption spans disciplines and geographies, dominated by STEM but expanding into social sciences, and are strongly shaped by publisher policies, system integrations and disciplinary focus. We discuss the drivers of CRediT’s organic expansion, its role in strengthening research integrity and assessment, and the need for coordinated governance and infrastructure support as the taxonomy enters its next decade. Updates and standards of implementations will be important to ensure that CRediT remains relevant and valuable for its multiple use cases and aligned with how research itself is evolving.",

          "authors": "Agata Czech; Noam Tal-Perry; Becky Ioppolo; Steven Wooding",
          "abstract": "A diverse body of empirical research has produced mixed findings on gender disparities in research funding. Only a few of these studies effectively control for the structural factors of discipline and seniority of applicants. We have conducted the first institution-wide analysis of grant applications using high-resolution administrative data to understand gender-based disparities in funding outcomes. We included 18,583 applications submitted between 2015 and 2023 and assessed whether women applied for grants at different rates, requested different amounts, or had different success rates. After adjusting for seniority and disciplinary area, we found no evidence of consistent gender disparities in application rate. Historical gender disparities in application size in favour of men were observed but did not persist. Weak evidence for gender disparities in success rate was observed in favour of women, which disappeared after controlling for application size. However, when examining individual disciplines and seniorities, gender disparities in both directions were observed for rate, size and success. These findings highlight the importance of separating structural and individual factors in understanding funding disparities to allow for effective interventions; the value of institutional administrative data in allowing this type of analysis; and highlight the role of structural (career stage and disciplinary) disparities in the gender disparities seen in scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Implementation science aims to bridge the gap between research evidence and routine healthcare practice by understanding and optimizing the integration of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). In this paper, we identify seven persistent challenges limiting implementation progress, including (1) overwhelming volume of implementation materials (e.g., reports, interviews, surveys), (2) contextual variability, (3) complex interactions among contextual factors, interventions, and outcomes, (4) stakeholder engagement constraints, (5) equity and access barriers, (6) insufficient or biased data, and (7) concerns around data security, trust, and ethics. We explore how advances in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges by enhancing evidence extraction and synthesis, contextual analysis, stakeholder engagement, and adaptation throughout the implementation process. Using a live project in precision oncology as a practical example, we demonstrate how AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), clustering algorithms, and sentiment analysis, can support implementation research and practice, from concept (e.g., barriers, facilitators, strategies) extraction and barrier identification to process mapping. We also introduce ImpleMATE, an AI-enabled platform that integrates implementation science knowledge with dynamic learning health system workflows, enabling continuous knowledge extraction, decision support, and feedback for implementation improvement. While AI offers significant potential to accelerate and scale implementation efforts, we emphasize the need for ethical oversight, transparency, and human collaboration to ensure responsible, equitable, and impactful application in practice.",

          "abstract": "The replication crisis reveals pervasive methodological weaknesses, with replication failure rates exceeding 60% in psychology and preclinical biology. While preregistration improves transparency, it lacks technical enforcement and quantitative assessment of rigor. ECLIPSE v2.0 introduces a computational framework that enforces falsification integrity through cryptographic data splitting, single-shot validation, and automated auditing.\n\nThe framework integrates five sequential stages: (1) irreversible data partitioning with SHA-256 verification; (2) binding preregistration of falsification criteria; (3) cross-validated model development; (4) single-shot holdout testing; and (5) automatic integrity assessment. Three quantitative tools were developed: the Eclipse Integrity Score (EIS) measuring methodological rigor; the Statistical Test for Data Snooping (STDS) detecting performance inflation; and an Automated Code Auditor using multi-level static analysis to identify protocol violations.\n\nAcross four validation studies, ECLIPSE achieved: (1) strong discrimination between honest and p-hacked studies (Cohen’s d = 3.54, AUC = 0.991); (2) 89% sensitivity for detecting 15% performance inflation; (3) auditor accuracy F1 = 0.908; and (4) prediction of replication success in 73 published studies (ρ = 0.68), outperforming impact factor and sample size.\n\nECLIPSE provides the first quantitative, enforceable, and scalable methodology for ensuring research integrity through prevention, detection, and assessment.

          "abstract": "High dimensional omics, longitudinal clinical data, and surveillance streams are now routine in translational research, yet reproducibility and governance often lag behind. We present a framework developed at Institut Pasteur that makes analysis auditable, portable, and privacy preserving. It couples containerised Nextflow/Snakemake pipelines for bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics with rigorous quality control, ComBat batch harmonisation that preserves biological covariates, and a biostatistics layer (generalised linear and mixed effects models, Cox survival, hierarchical components) with explicit false discovery rate control. An epidemiology module computes vaccine effectiveness (VE), attack rates, effective reproduction number Rt, and case control odds ratios with robust intervals. Metadata follow FAIR principles and map to HL7 FHIR resources; identifiers are pseudonymised under role based access control. On synthetic exemplars shaped by real cohort constraints, we report concrete outcomes: batch attributable variance drops from 18.7% to 3.9%, differential expression signals remain stable, a LASSO gene expression signature achieves outer fold ROC AUC 0.81 ± 0.02 with calibration slope 0.98 and intercept 0.01, VE rises from 0.63 to 0.79 as Rt falls from 1.14 to 0.89, and covariate imbalance (median SMD) reduces from 0.21 to 0.06 after matching. End to end runs reproduce byte identically across laptops and HPC under Docker. The framework is a conservative baseline for clinical bioinformatics and methods teaching, not a medical device.",

          "authors": "Oula Mommo; Katja Sutela; Riikka Mononen",
          "abstract": "This study investigated how teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and support from school management and community are related to their self-efficacy in the context of inclusive music education. Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom. Results also show the impact of the school community on success when implementing inclusive music education.",

          "abstract": "Self-efficacy is a central motivational construct for explaining user behavior and has gained increasing attention in security and privacy research. However, despite decades of research, its measurement remains inconsistent, and new scales continue to be added to the literature rather than reusing and validating existing ones. This proliferation of overlapping but unvalidated scales obscures what is actually being measured, undermines cross-study comparison, and limits the accumulation of reliable evidence for theory and practice.\nOur goal is to assess the current degree of fragmentation of measures with a psychometric analysis of their validity. Building on preceding review data, we systematically review the self-efficacy literature in privacy and security from 2010 to 2025, examining its application across distinct domains and specific technologies. We identify, cumulatively, a total of 330 different measures across 327 publications, often with unclear contextual differentiation between scales. In a second step, we analyze the convergence of 148 fully-reported measures comprising 654 items using silicon samples generated by a fine-tuned large language model. The results of the synthetic item and scale correlation estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity, indicating measurement fragmentation.\nOur findings highlight widespread evidence of current jingle-fallacies, where measures intended to assess self-efficacy capture different psychological factors in multiple cases. This emphasizes the need for standardized, validated scales to improve comparability and reproducibility. We recommend increasing methodological rigor to generate reliable insights into human-centered security and privacy behavior and to ensure the design of more effective interventions.",

          "authors": "Yannik Stegmann; Matthias Gamer",
          "abstract": "When confronted with danger, humans display a range of defensive behaviors, such as freezing and active avoidance. Prior research has identified a distinct physiological response pattern to avoidable threats, characterized by heart rate bradycardia, reduced visual exploration, and suppressed visual alpha activity (8–13 Hz), all of which are associated with faster flight responses. This pattern suggests an adaptive state of attentive immobility. However, the relationship between this state and the encoding of explicit threat-related memories remains largely unexplored. To investigate this, we recorded parieto-occipital alpha activity, eye movements, and autonomic responses in 60 participants during anticipation of either an avoidable threat, an inevitable threat, or no threat, while viewing images of various facial identities. In a subsequent memory task, participants were asked to recognize previously seen faces among novel faces. Results showed enhanced suppression of alpha activity during avoidable threats, accompanied by heart rate bradycardia, centralized gaze, and increased sympathetic arousal. However, these responses were not linked to memory encoding. Instead, memory effects were associated with reduced pupillary responses, heightened visual exploration, and decreased alpha activity, particularly in occipitotemporal regions. Together, these findings suggest that when individuals face avoidable threats, they enter a state of attentive immobility that enhances perceptual processing and prepares them for action but does not extend to improved memory encoding.",

This online, preregistered study (N = 123) investigated such perceptions through three conceptual frameworks: the Stereotype Content Model, the Mind Perception Dimensions, and a novel framework synthesised from the other two. Results indicated that AI is not perceived homogeneously; rather, distinct clusters emerged in each framework. Perceptions of different AIs seem to be primarily organised along two dimensions: competence (people’s perception of an AI’s capacity to perform intended functions) and subjectivity (people’s perception of an AI’s ability to simulate having subjective experiences). We highlight the implications of these findings for Human–AI interaction (HAI) research and AI ethics and outline avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Designing for humans is a profound challenge. The consequences of design shape people’s present and future well-being across individual, social, mental, and physical domains. Despite the rise of human-centred design, failures to understand the true beneficiaries of design decisions continue to produce harmful or ineffective outcomes. Designing well requires insight into the complex psychological systems that govern behaviour, motivation, bias, and decision-making – yet psychological knowledge is rarely integrated systematically into design practice and application. While psychology offers rigorous tools for understanding how people think, feel, and act – and although both designers and psychologists acknowledge the importance of each other’s fields – collaboration remains limited. Existing design approaches, such as those for Human Centered Design, provide process guidance but lack structured mechanisms for embedding psychological principles into everyday practice, leading to a lack of efficacy and unintended consequences in designed outcomes. To address this gap, we propose the Design Psychology Model (DPM): a practical and action-oriented framework for integrating established psychological insights into design. The DPM presents a designer-led process that sets strategic intentions, grounds work in established psychological theory, validates ideas in current contexts, and future-proofs outcomes through ongoing monitoring. The proposed model offers pathways for bridging disciplinary boundaries and invites the wider practitioner community to advance a more rigorous, ethical, and human-attuned design psychology.",

          "abstract": "While biological motion processing has been extensively studied, little is known about the top-down impact of expectations in this context. We tested whether expectations about the likelihood of encountering a human walker influence the detection of biological motion in point-light displays, particularly when perceptual information is unreliable. 74 participants completed a signal detection task, responding to stimuli featuring either a human walker or scrambled biological motion, each masked with one of four levels of visual noise. Participants were randomly assigned to the high or low expectations group and were told that 75% or 25% of the displays would feature a human walker, although the actual proportion was 50%. Participants in the high expectation group showed a greater tendency to respond “yes”, with the largest group difference emerging at the highest level of noise. These findings suggest that expectations can bias biological motion detection, particularly under conditions of sensory unreliability. The results also support the predictive processing model of agency detection, which proposes that false-positive perceptions of (supernatural) agents arise from culturally learned priors combined with ambiguous input.",

However, in WEIRD countries, most individuals recommend complex, maximizing strategies to others—an “ideal–reality gap” absent elsewhere—suggesting that maximizing is a culturally specific belief rather than universal behavior.

          "abstract": "Persistence, defined as a trait-like characteristic, reflects the personal tendency to endure different hardships. In a recently developed model, three dimensions—persistence despite difficulties, persistence despite fear, and inappropriate persistence—were proposed to cover distinct facets of this ability, along with goal-time preferences as a persistence-related construct. The Multidimensional Persistence Scale (MPS) and the Goal-Time Preferences Scale (GTPS) were created to gauge these two separate constructs. In the current study, we conducted two studies using the Polish version of the scales (MPS-PL and GTPS-PL, respectively), with the aim of evaluating both measures. We also proposed a profile model as better reflecting the multidimensionality of persistence as opposed to the original superordinate model. In Study 1, the three-factor structure of the MPS-PL was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. In contrast, the GTPS-PL showed a poor fit to the data as well as a vague factor structure. In Study 2, we tested the nomological network of the MPS-PL, providing evidence for its construct validity as well as the distinctiveness of its dimensions. Last, we conducted a latent profile analysis, which revealed the three qualitatively different configurations of persistence dimensions in the total study sample. Overall, the evidence we gathered supports our proposal about persistence as a multidimensional profile construct.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults involves inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often accompanied by emotional dysregulation and significant functional impairment. Although stimulant medication effectively reduces core symptoms, its impact on broader psychosocial functioning is less consistent. Personality pathology, varying in severity and expression, may account for this variability.\nThis naturalistic study examined how dimensional models of personality pathology influence symptomatic and functional outcomes during pharmacological treatment for adult ADHD. A total of 246 adults (66% women; mean age = 33.5 years) completed assessments of general personality dysfunction, maladaptive personality traits, ADHD symptoms, and functional impairment.\nLinear mixed-effects models showed that individuals with higher levels of personality dysfunction and maladaptive traits were more functionally impaired and demonstrated less symptomatic improvement during treatment. General personality dysfunction predicted greater functional impairment and higher ADHD symptom burden, while maladaptive domains - particularly Negative Affectivity, Detachment, and Psychoticism - were strongly linked to functional impairment. In contrast, Disinhibition was the only domain meaningfully related to ADHD symptom burden, consistent with its overlap with core ADHD features. Stimulant dosage and treatment duration showed only modest associations with functional change.\nThese findings indicate that personality pathology substantially constrains the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment in adults with ADHD. Higher impairment and limited functional gains among individuals with pronounced personality dysfunction suggest that medication alone is insufficient to improve adaptive functioning. Integrated, personality-informed interventions addressing both neurocognitive and personality-based mechanisms may therefore be required to achieve lasting recovery in everyday life.\nKeywords: ADHD; Adult ADHD; Pharmacotherapy; Stimulant Medication; Dimensional Personality Pathology; Personality Dysfunction; Functional Impairment",

          "authors": "Patrick Dwyer; Muzna Dakakni; Lubna Faris; Katy Unwin",
          "abstract": "Background: Although extensive evidence suggests domain-general differences in autistic attention are common and impactful, frameworks for understanding these experiences remain confused. Concepts like monotropism, autotelic (flow-prone) personality, and hyperfocus seemingly have overlapping features and distinct attributes. How they relate to one another is not empirically clear.\nMethods: 111 autistic and 39 non-autistic adults filled out a Prolific survey. We examined group differences in ADHD inattention traits and subscales from monotropism, autotelic personality, and hyperfocus measures, and how subscales were related in autism. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as an initial exploration of dimensions potentially underlying these constructs. We also examined whether PCA components were related to anxiety and sensory hyperresponsitivity.\nResults: Autistic people reported more monotropism, hyperfocus, and inattention than non-autistic people. Autistic people reported more of some autotelic personality subscales (enjoyment of boredom, curiosity before correction) but less of another (attentional control). However, attentional control and self-centredness were largely unrelated to other autotelic personality dimensions; instead, they respectively converged with ADHD inattention traits and social anxiety. One PCA dimension seemingly reflected intense, enjoyable focus; it was related to sensory hyperresponsiveness, and indirectly via hyperresponsiveness with anxiety. Another seemingly reflected inattention and difficulties with attentional control; this was directly related to anxiety. These two PCA dimensions each explained relatively little variance, reflecting the complexity of autistic attention.\nConclusion: These results emphasise that attention in autism can have both positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., propensity to sensory distress) aspects. Underlying intense, enjoyable focus experiences likely contribute to hyperfocus, monotropism, and autotelic personality, but there appear to be many dimensions of attention in autism. Autotelic personality, as currently conceptualised, likely includes aspects that are more reflective of other existing constructs. Further research is needed to understand neurocognitive of and real-world manifestations and effects of these attention styles.",

          "abstract": "The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.",

          "abstract": "Pre-experiencing future climate events using either episodic future thinking (EFT) or perspective taking (PT) can increase climate change risk perception and action. Here we tested if combining EFT and PT would be more effective than EFT alone. 259 participants recruited online were randomly assigned to one of three groups: EFT+PT, which involved reading a vignette about a young friend or relative enduring a future storm; EFT, where participants read the same vignette but about a generic person; or a control condition, where participants read climate change facts. Climate action was measured by having participants make a series of real-stakes choices in which they allocated money between themselves and a climate charity. Climate change risk perception was assessed with a survey before and after the manipulation. Climate change risk perception increased overall after the manipulation, but the increase was significant only in the control group. There was also no effect of our manipulation on charitable choice. However, in the EFT+PT group, participants who reported feeling closer to their chosen friend or relative made more charitable choices. In a follow-up study, we obtained ratings of the vignettes from an independent group (n = 50). The control condition was rated as the most likely to occur, consistent with that vignette being most effective at increasing risk perception. The EFT+PT vignette was rated as the most motivating for climate action. Together, these results suggest that perspective taking with close others may encourage climate action, even if individuals’ climate change risk perception is not affected.",

A hallmark of loneliness is the feeling of being “out of sync” with others. What contributes to these feelings of misalignment with others? Using functional MRI data from two independent datasets (N = 65 and N = 43), in which participants watched naturalistic videos while their brain activity was recorded, we tested whether lonely individuals display atypical event segmentation patterns—a core component of human perception that shapes how people structure, remember, and understand continuous experiences. Using a Hidden Markov Model–based approach, we found that while non-lonely individuals exhibited similarity, lonely individuals’ neural event segmentation patterns were dissimilar to others, particularly in high-order brain regions (e.g., the default mode network). These findings suggest that loneliness is linked to unique neural organizations of continuous experiences, revealing a potential cognitive mechanism through which loneliness is characterized by divergent structuring of experience.",

          "authors": "Irmak Ergin; Jill Kries; Shiven Gupta; Maria Papworth Burrel; Laura Gwilliams",
          "abstract": "Speech comprehension has been described as an effortless and robust process; yet, in real-world contexts, it is common for a listener to misunderstand what was said, or fail to derive meaning entirely. Typically, methods of measuring speech comprehension are applied `post-hoc' - that is, after the comprehension has happened. This approach fails to capture comprehension as it is happening, which has limited the field's understanding of the cognitive processes involved in real-time comprehension. To overcome these challenges, we designed and tested a novel method of measuring real-time speech comprehension during naturalistic listening. We built a slider device that synchronizes with experimental software and provides millisecond read-out. In three experiments, participants listened to audiobook segments while providing continuous comprehension ratings using the slider. To vary comprehension success, we presented speech segments at speed factors 1-5 times faster than normal. We validated the time-resolved slider data against established speech comprehension assessment methods. Overall, our findings validate our novel time-resolved comprehension measure and demonstrate that it is possible to derive an online behavioral measure of real-time speech comprehension. We also confirmed numerous limitations of static post-hoc assessments, including challenges of multi-choice question design, and the confounding of potential effects due to recency bias and comprehension for summarization. The measure proposed here overcomes the constraints of static post-hoc assessments, and can be effectively integrated with neuroimaging techniques, offering a valuable tool for future research on dynamic processes during naturalistic listening.",

          "authors": "Yi Huang; Yichi Yang",
          "abstract": "With the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), concerns about its psychological safety have increased. Recent psychiatric reports show that some users—especially those with vulnerable mental health—may develop delusional thoughts or psychosis-like experiences during interactions with GenAI. Detecting such risk language is therefore important for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). This study examined whether LLMs can identify delusional statements and whether retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance. A dataset of 200 simulated user statements (50% delusional, 50% non-delusional) was created based on DSM-5 criteria and validated by a licensed psychotherapist. The dataset was divided into a 100-item retrieval corpus and a 100-item test set. Two GPT-4o-mini classifiers were evaluated: a baseline non-RAG model and a RAG-enhanced model that retrieved the three most semantically similar examples from the corpus. When a statement was classified as delusional, models also assigned a severity rating (1–3). The non-RAG model achieved 81% accuracy with a recall of 0.66, whereas the RAG model reached 94% accuracy with improved recall (0.89) and perfect specificity. However, both models systematically underestimated severity, with the RAG model showing greater underestimation. These findings indicate that RAG can enhance early detection of psychosis-like language but is insufficient for reliable severity assessment, highlighting both the potential and the limits of current LLM-based cognitive-risk detection.",

          "abstract": "The tendency to overgeneralize fear learning has been identified as a potential risk factor for anxiety disorders. In this study, we examined whether highly anxious individuals differed from low anxious individuals in how they generalized fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) following differential conditioning with an aversive scream outcome. We achieved this by using a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization from the fear cue (predicting the scream) and generalization from the safety cue (predicting the absence of the scream). In two experiments, we found that relative to low trait anxious participants, high trait anxious participants showed higher outcome predictions to stimuli resembling the safety cue (i.e., they undergeneralized safety learning), but not for stimuli resembling the fear cue (i.e., they did not overgeneralize fear learning). Undergeneralization was not found when a neutral outcome was used, suggesting that this effect is dependent on the use of an aversive outcome and specific to safety learning. Our findings suggest that safety generalization may vary more as a function of trait anxiety than fear generalization, and therefore future research should separately measure these processes to uncover the mechanisms driving excessive spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "It is important for researchers to be able to identify sources of low-quality data in their surveys. At the same time, it is important that the methods researchers use to detect these sources of low-quality data do not result in a substantially worse survey-taking experience for their participants. The purpose of the present project was to investigate how two types of attention check items—infrequency/frequency items (e.g., “I don’t have a first name”) and instructed-response items (e.g., “Choose disagree for this item”)—impact the survey-taking experiences of participants. In Study 1 (N = 400), we found that participants responded most favourably to a survey composed entirely of control items, followed by a survey composed entirely of infrequency/frequency items and, finally, a survey composed entirely of instructed-response items. However, in Study 2 (N = 793) and Study 3 (N = 800), we found that these effects only appeared when over half of the survey consisted of infrequency/frequency items and instructed-response items, respectively. These results suggest that attention check items can negatively impact a participant’s survey-taking experience but only when administered in large quantities. They also suggest that infrequency/frequency items tend to be better received than instructed-response items.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one’s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DE) are a class of models in dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a methodologically novel approach to creativity research by simultaneously exploring creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice within a unified research design. This integration allows for the first systematic analysis of the patterns of creative engagement across these three dimensions, revealing how they co-occur and interact across multiple domains within a university student sample. Participants reported on their creative achievements, time investment, aspirations, comparison standards, and audience orientations across 11 creative domains. Correlation and logistic regression analyses revealed broadly consistent evidence of within-domain alignment: individuals who produced something creative in a given domain were generally more likely to consume creative content from that domain. Domains such as literature, visual arts, and film/video &amp; TV showed stronger cross-domain connections, whereas science and sports were more domain-bound. Creative consumption exhibited a more generalized structure, indicating stronger interrelationships among domains, while creative production clustered into smaller, domain-specific groupings. Engagement in creative practice was positively associated with both production and consumption within domains, underscoring the possible interdependence of these forms of participation. Breadth of creative production and consumption showed limited predictive potential with respect to self-reported creative achievements. Analyses of preference alignments indicated slightly higher coherence in production than in consumption, suggesting that creative production may involve more deliberate and integrated preference structures. Together, these findings illustrate the tight interrelation of creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice as dimensions of creative engagement. This integrative approach broadens the conceptual and empirical scope of creativity research beyond its traditional production-centric focus.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety is reliably characterized by biases toward avoidance and aversive learning. Frontal-midline theta (FM-theta) oscillations have been implicated as a key neural mechanism underlying these learning biases. Here we combined dynamic network neuroscience with computational modeling to investigate how FM-theta coordinates large-scale functional network interactions on a trial-to-trial basis for feedback-guided learning, and how these neural dynamics are altered in social anxiety across different social contexts. A sample of 146 individuals (mean age = 20.4 years) with varying levels of social anxiety completed a probabilistic selection task while performing alone and under social observation. Results indicated that FM-theta contributed to two theta-dependent functional subgraphs, each differently supporting probabilistic learning. Frontal-parietal functional connectivity increased following aversive outcomes and scaled with prediction error, consistent with error-monitoring and feedback-updating. In contrast, social anxious individuals exhibited heightened context-sensitive frontal-occipital connectivity for positive feedback across contexts and for negative feedback during performance observation. Social scrutiny amplified integration between these neural network patterns, impairing learning performance, particularly in high socially anxious individuals. Together, these findings show that social anxiety is associated with dysregulated, context-sensitive FM-theta neural network dynamics, reflecting reduced neural flexibility for adaptive learning under scrutiny.",

Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations.

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted a connection between divergent and creative thinking with episodic memory. According to the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis, individuals draw on past experiences and flexibly recombine retrieved memories to generate novel ideas. However, most research examining this link has focused on people thinking in isolation, despite the fact that autobiographical remembering and idea generation frequently occur in social contexts such as workplaces, classrooms, and everyday conversations. Therefore, the present study compared individual and collaborative performance in recalling autobiographical memories and generating uncommon uses under parallel conditions, using object cue words across tasks. Our findings partially support the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis: the two tasks were strongly correlated, yielded similar overall performance across group conditions, and both showed a significant decline in the number and variety of responses over time, although this decrease was more pronounced for memory retrieval. Contrary to previous work documenting detrimental effects of collaboration, our results indicate that collaborative and individual performance in divergent thinking and autobiographical memory are largely equivalent, while collaboration increases participants’ enjoyment of this task. Future research should clarify the conditions under which group settings optimize both episodic retrieval and creative thinking.",

          "abstract": "Our brains are contextual, connected, social, and dynamic; failing to account for these aspects of the brain together risks misleading results that could be translated into worse health outcomes, especially for populations already underrepresented in neuroscience. In this manuscript, we synthesize recent studies that investigate the network neuroecology of social interaction and characterize how brain network organization varies across interpersonal social experience. We describe how certain patterns of brain connectivity are associated with particular social environments as a result of trade-offs in how functional connections are distributed across the brain in accordance with social experience. We call these environment-specific patterns of connectivity and their trajectories of reconfiguration over development network neuroendophenotypes. We propose two intersecting mechanisms that underlie the development of network neuroendophenotypes, addressing both how and why brain network organization contextually varies: one more protracted via stress physiology and the other more acute via the processing of affective/supportive touch. The existence of distinguishable patterns of connectivity that are associated with different social environments has important consequences for studying normative neurodevelopment and brain-based biomarkers of disease: The pattern of brain network organization that is associated with better (mental) health may look different in different environments. Ignoring social context therefore risks either pathologizing healthy brains or dismissing real disease among those who would otherwise be considered healthy. Moving forward, methodological advances that can effectively treat brain network organization as a dynamic, high dimensional, contextually influenced neuroendophenotype will be crucial for future research.",

Notably, the influence of act legality was not restricted to judgments of actions, but also guided perceptions of others’ moral character. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed individual differences in the extent to which people’s moral judgments were shaped by an act’s legal status, with act legality being most influential for participants viewing respect for authority as a moral good.

Here, I show that moral judgments depend more on how many different individuals engage in a behavior than on mere repeated exposure. Participants viewed stories about an observer witnessing repeated, morally relevant behaviors that were performed once by six different individuals, six times by the same individual, or once by a single individual. Participants rated each behavior on third-party acceptability (acceptability for the actors) and first-party acceptability (acceptability for themselves), and prevalence. Repeated behaviors increased third-party acceptability and prevalence, but more so for multiple-actor than repeated single-actor behaviors. Critically, only multi-actor behaviors, but not single-actor repeated behaviors, influenced participants’ own moral judgments. Moral norms thus shift primarily when transgressions are performed by multiple individuals.",

We investigated these questions using 600 full-face images of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese male soccer players. Korean participants (N = 52) viewed each face for 200 ms and rated it on attractiveness and trustworthiness. Ratings were then compared with accuracy data from our previous ethnicity categorization study using the same stimuli. Results revealed a clear pattern. Korean faces, as in-group members, received higher ratings than Japanese or Chinese faces. For Korean faces, higher ratings predicted greater categorization accuracy, suggesting that positive impressions can enhance rapid perceptual processing. For Chinese faces, the opposite occurred, favorable ratings were linked to lower accuracy, indicating a misattribution bias in which socially positive out-group faces were often classified as Korean. No such link appeared for Japanese faces. Across groups, attractive or trustworthy faces were more likely to be assigned to the in-group, regardless of actual ethnicity.

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation.\n\nKeywords: free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Prior evidence suggests that individuals with higher fitness exhibit attenuated \nendocrine and autonomic responses to acute stress. However, it remains unclear whether this \nstress-buffering effect depends on the type of stressor. This study examined whether aerobic \ncapacity modulates psychophysiological responses to two stress induction paradigms (Trier \nSocial Stress Tests, TSST; Maastricht Acute Stress Test, MAST). We hypothesized that fitter \nparticipants show lower stress reactivity, with stronger attenuation expected for the MAST, \nwhich includes a physical stress component. \nMethods: Healthy participants (n = 59; 28 women; age: 27.1 ± 5.5 yrs) completed the TSST and \nMAST on separate days under standardized conditions. We assessed self-reported stress, \nsalivary hormones (cortisol, cortisone, DHEAS), and autonomic cardiac regulation (heart rate, \nRMSSD). Aerobic fitness was determined via graded exercise testing (VO2peak: 50.4 ± 8.6 \nml/kg/min). We used multilevel regression models to examine the associations between \nVO2peak and stress responses. \nResults: Higher VO2peak was significantly associated with lower heart rate across both stress \ninduction paradigms (b = 0.99 bpm, p = 0.002). For other outcomes, no significant association \nwith VO2peak was found. The associations did not differ between TSST and MAST. \nDiscussion: Aerobic fitness was linked to lower heart rate during the experimental sessions, \nindicating a modest cardiovascular advantage under acute stress. Contrary to our hypothesis, \nthis effect did not differ between the two stress paradigms, suggesting that the influence of \nfitness was not specific to the type of stressor. Aerobic capacity, therefore, seems to reduce \ncardiovascular load during stressful situations in a general manner.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models has traditionally been viewed as a correctible error arising from imperfect training. We propose a fundamental reframing: Hallucination may not be a defect but rather a lawful geometric phenomenon emerging from semantic manifold curvature. By integrating information theory, differential geometry, and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that hallucination rate (h) systematically increases with representational curvature (κ), independent of information density (ρ). Using GPT-2 across five reasoning domains (n=1,500), we find a consistent correlation r(κ,h)=0.83 (p≈0.08), providing preliminary evidence that hallucination arises predictably where meaning-space bends most sharply. This transforms hallucination from mystery to measurement—not an error to suppress, but a quantifiable cost of compressing knowledge into finite linguistic form. We introduce the curvature–hallucination relationship h∝f(κ), unifying the manifold hypothesis in representation learning, information-geometry trade-offs, and distortion under abstraction. This framework enables a shift from error correction to geometric control: monitoring curvature to predict and regulate factual instability. What began as a reliability problem may become the first quantitative law linking representation, compression, and truth—the geometry of understanding itself.\nAll Tier 1 experimental code, datasets, and metrics are openly released at the GitHub repository https://github.com/enkiluv/hallucination_curvature_experiment, inviting the research community to replicate, extend, and test whether this relationship generalizes across architectures, languages, and modalities in forthcoming Tier 2 and Tier 3 studies.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS), the temporal alignment of brain activities\nbetween individuals, has been proposed as a biomarker for successful communication and smooth social interaction. Surging empirical evidence shows that INS emerges spontaneously between infants, children, and their caregivers from early on in development. Yet, little is known about the developmental preconditions and functions of INS in childhood. This paper presents a developmental framework for understanding INS, integrating insights from structural and functional brain maturation, as well as behavioral, social, and cognitive development. We discuss how early caregiver-infant interactions, characterized by shared perceptual rhythms, facilitate the emergence of INS. Given initial limitations in temporal precision of neural processing, early INS is likely constrained to low-frequency brain rhythms and evolves alongside the maturation of neural networks and socio-cognitive abilities. We outline how INS may support critical developmental processes, including social learning, language acquisition, and attachment formation, through enabling mutual prediction and co-regulation between caregivers and children. Furthermore, we hypothesize that tasks requiring higher-order mutual understanding are linked to qualitative changes in INS patterns over time. This framework highlights the potential of INS as both a marker and a driver of developmental change, offering new avenues for research and intervention. Longitudinal studies and rhythm-based interventions could deepen our understanding of how INS supports development, with implications for enhancing social learning and attachment in populations at risk for developmental challenges. This work underscores the importance of adopting a developmental perspective in INS research.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

          "abstract": "Your understanding of what you see now surely influences what you will look at next. Yet this simple concept has only recently begun to be systematically studied and elaborated within theoretical frameworks. The Scene Perception &amp; Event Comprehension Theory (SPECT) distinguishes between front-end and back-end processes that occur while viewers perceive and comprehend dynamic real-world events. Front-end processes occur during each eye fixation (information extraction, attentional selection) and back-end processes occur in memory (the current event model, prior knowledge, and executive processes). We begin with a selective review of the scene perception literature on bottom-up and top-down effects on attentional selection in scenes, and highlight unanswered questions regarding the impact of the viewer's event model–their understanding of what is happening now. Then, we outline the SPECT theoretical framework, and  review empirical evidence  about how the viewer's current event model influences attentional selection. This influence is contrasted with those of visual saliency (e.g., color, brightness, motion, etc.) and task-driven control (i.e., goal setting, attentional control, inhibition). From this review, we specify a hierarchy of factors affecting attentional selection, in the order of task-driven control, visual saliency, and event models. We then propose several mechanisms by which the viewer’s event model influences attentional selection, and propose a systematic approach to investigating how that happens while watching dynamic scenes.

Extending this work in a new context, the present study examined these associations in a separate sample of undergraduate students (N = 434) and professional academic advisors (N = 13) at a large public research university in the southeast United States. Results closely mirrored those of the original findings in both magnitude and pattern of significance, except that the present study found a small negative association between advisors’ self-reported growth mindset beliefs and student perceptions of their advisor’s growth mindset beliefs. The present findings raise important questions regarding the similarities and differences in instructional and advising contexts and point to exciting new directions in mindset research that consider the important roles of both instructors and professional academic advisors in shaping student success.",

We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether prospective associations between cognitive abilities and school grades differ by income-to-needs ratio, parental education, and area deprivation in 11,868 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study – a diverse national pediatric sample from the U.S. We additionally examined further stratification by sex assigned at birth and racial and ethnic identity. Socioeconomic and cognitive variables were measured at baseline (2016-2018; mean age 9.9 years (SD=0.7)). School grades were reported three years post baseline. We show that reading decoding ability and overall crystallized cognition were less predictive of school grades at higher levels of income-to-needs ratio. Stratification by race/ethnicity indicated that the weaker associations between crystallized cognitive functions and school grades at high incomes were only evident in non-Hispanic White students. Higher average academic achievement in this group may be more reliant on factors like greater parental expectations, cognitive stimulation at home, and attendance of schools with grade inflation practices. Conversely, students from less affluent backgrounds may face greater pressures to demonstrate cognitive abilities to receive high grades. In sum, cognitive abilities are not equitably reflected in school grades across economic and racial student strata and potential structural advantages availed to affluent White students in the U.S. require further examination.",

          "title": "Using A Dimension Reduction Approach to Parse Heterogeneity in Dietary Restriction",
          "authors": "Amanda Makara; Kelsey Hagan; NA; Ann Frances Haynos",
          "abstract": "Dietary restriction, the problematic reduction of caloric or macronutrient intake, is a critical eating behavior occurring transdiagnostically across eating disorders and subclinical disordered eating. The definition of dietary restriction is highly heterogeneous, and restriction is often conflated with other distinct constructs, such as dietary restraint. The current practices related to the definition and measurement of dietary restriction have notable flaws, negatively impacting the ability to identify and establish risk, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. There is also limited evidence that commonly-used dietary restriction measures can validly predict food choice and objective intake. These issues raise questions about whether dietary restriction is a unitary construct or multiple distinct constructs that may be differentially related to adverse outcomes. This thesis examined these issues by performing secondary dimension reduction data analysis from adult participants (N = 89), including individuals with acute anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 18), weight-restored anorexia nervosa (AN-WR; n = 40), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 31), to identify factors of dietary restriction and their relations to clinical variables. First, dimension reduction was performed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on participants’ item-level responses to several measures associated with dietary restriction and restraint to capture different facets of restrictive eating. Subsequently, linear regression analyses examined the relations between resulting dimensions and short- and longer-term indices of objective restriction and affective symptoms. The EFA yielded a two-factor structure wherein one factor comprised cognitive and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor) and the second factor comprised affective and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Affective Restriction). Both factors predicted caloric intake, but the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted lower caloric intake (B = -175.63, SE = 63.89, p = .008), whereas the Affective Restriction factor predicted higher caloric intake (B = 354.65, SE = 161.90, p = .032). Only the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted cross-sectional BMI (p = .005). Both factors predicted cross-sectional depressive symptoms (ps = p = .005). Neither factor predicted follow-up BMI (ps = .740 to .799) affective symptoms (ps = .061 to .904). These findings provide additional evidence to support the multi-dimensional nature of restrictive eating, suggesting that the construct of restrictive eating may comprise cognitive, behavioral, and affective elements that may be associated with differential outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social media plays a central role in adolescents’ lives, suggesting powerful direct and indirect influences on their social norms and behaviors. This study examines these influences by applying the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) hypotheses to social media and physical activity. Physical inactivity is a pressing public health concern, particularly during adolescence, when activity levels often decline. Using data from a three-wave panel survey (N = 1.044), this study analyzes the development of perceived social media exposure among peers, peer influence, social norms, and personal behavior over time. The findings reveal that social media exposure directly increases physical activity but also via indirect effects proposed by IPMI assumptions. Perceived peer exposure and presumed influence on others strengthened injunctive social norms, resulting in higher physical activity. In contrast, no significant effects were found for descriptive social norms. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between injunctive and descriptive norms. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research and public health interventions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

          "abstract": "Structurally complex narratives, characterized by nonlinear chronology, shifting perspectives, or multi-layered story worlds, have become increasingly prominent in mainstream film and television. While scholars have theorized the aesthetic and cognitive implications of these narratives, we know far less about how viewers actually experience them. This paper presents findings from a qualitative interview study exploring the subjective dimensions of engaging with narrational complexity. Drawing on 20 in-depth interviews with viewers of complex popular films and series, we identify key experiential themes that cut across cognitive, affective, and reflective dimensions: sense of presence, confusion, narrative play, epistemic emotions (such as curiosity and frustration), and moments of meta-awareness. Using thematic analysis, we show that although navigating narrational complexity can be demanding, viewers often find in this very challenge a source of enjoyment and meaning. Our findings offer a qualitative, data-driven perspective that complements existing media-theoretical and psychological models of narrative processing, with implications for the study of narrative engagement and cognitive film studies.",

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly depression and anxiety. Although emerging evidence emphasises the presence and impact of IU in multiple sclerosis (MS), it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

The prospective associations between DLD and offending, and the educational and criminal justice pathways through which DLD might increase the risk of offending and re-offending, remain unclear. Methods. We analysed existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (maximum N = 6,800; 51% female; 9% with DLD) with linked school data (national pupil database) and crime records (Avon and Somerset Police records for offences committed between ages 13-29 years in the region). DLD was determined when the individuals were aged 7-9 years using direct assessments and parent reports. Regression and mediation models were fitted to the data. Results. Individuals with DLD were nearly twice as likely (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.27, 2.48) to have a recorded offence (i.e., charged or cautioned by the police) compared to those without DLD. School suspension was a significant mediator of the relationship between DLD and recorded offending. However, special educational need identification had no effect on recorded offending for those with DLD. There was also no difference in the odds of being given an out of court disposal or re-offending for individuals with DLD compared to those without DLD. Conclusions. Individuals who have DLD are more likely to be cautioned or convicted for an offence by the police than those without DLD, and this may in part be mediated by school suspension.",

Offenders with ABI show deficiencies in different areas of cognitive functioning and have specific crime-associated characteristics, compared to those without ABI. The prevalence of ABI in detained persons with psychiatric disorders is understudied, despite of forensic relevance. The aim of the current study is to investigate neurocognitive differences and crime characteristics of forensic inpatients with and without ABI.\nThis cross-sectional study included 123 male inpatients detained in a forensic psychiatric hospital located in the Netherlands. Group differences in verbal abilities, memory, cognitive flexibility and attention, as well as age at first offense, previous violent offences and years of previous incarceration were compared between patients with and without ABI.\nFifty-five percent of forensic inpatients had ABI, and this group was 8 years younger at their first offense, more often convicted before the age of 18 and more often had a history of violent offenses. No group differences were found for neurocognitive functioning outcomes.\nThe results emphasize the importance of early ABI screening and awareness for individuals with ABI and associated characteristics. Timely intervention might enhance preventative strategies regarding early criminal activities. Appropriate treatment options could eventually contribute to lowering recidivism rates.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

Empirical research from over-the top (OTT) streaming services, online visual art platforms, and social media is used to illustrate practical implications for ethical, user-centered HCI design.

          "abstract": "Corrugator supercilii (‘frowning muscle’) activity tracks affective valence of linguistic stimuli. According to Embodied cognition accounts this reflects simulation of the emotion at lexical and/or situational levels. Additionally, it may indicate evaluation, i.e., how we feel about an affective event within a context. This study used facial electromyography (fEMG) to examine corrugator responses as participants read short stories. Each story included segments, describing some character’s morally good or bad behavior, a behavior rating, and sentence-initial phrases describing the character’s positive or negative affective states (e.g., ‘Mark is frustrated’), followed by the reason for this. Our prior studies showed substantially more frowning when good characters were ‘frustrated’ compared to ‘happy’, but minimal differences for bad characters, suggesting a multiple-drivers account where both simulation and evaluation influence responses. Crucially, they can counteract in the context of bad characters, e.g., ‘happy’ has positive valence but is unfair in context and the opposite applies to ‘frustrated’. \nTo emphasize characters’ moral status and amplify fairness-based evaluations, an embedded morality judgment rating task was introduced. We hypothesized stronger frowning for “happy” than “frustrated” bad characters due to fairness considerations now outweighing simulation. However, results revealed increased frowning for “frustrated” bad characters. \nThe rating task might have unexpectedly reduced, rather than boosted, evaluative processing through cognitive interference. Nevertheless, previously observed frowning patterns for moral characters were replicated. These findings support a multiple-drivers model but suggest evaluative processes are more complex and layered than current models capture, calling for revisions to incorporate these complexities into affective processing theories.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to extract causal information from direct experience is crucial in making sense of our world. It is therefore puzzling that people often overestimate the relationship between objectively unrelated events. Such causal illusions can be investigated in a contingency learning task, where participants judge the effectiveness of a cue in causing a target outcome based on their observed covariation across a series of trials. When cue and outcome co-occur (cell A trials), the outcome is readily attributed to the cue. But how do participants interpret outcomes in the absence of the cue (cell C trials), where the cause of the outcome is unspecified? We asked participants to provide open-ended (Experiment 1) or forced-choice (Experiments 2 and 3) explanations for trials in a causal illusion task where the cue was a medicine and the outcome was recovery from a disease. Participants inferred a range of plausible hidden causes for cell C recoveries (e.g., stronger immunity, less severe disease, spontaneous recovery). Critically, they rated these causes as less likely to be present on cell A trials, and those who attributed cell A recoveries only to the medicine showed the highest causal ratings for the medicine. Such a selective inference about the scope of a hidden cause may allow learners to explain away cue-absent outcomes that would otherwise undermine the perceived causal strength of the target cue, without violating normative principles. This mechanism may help explain how false causal beliefs can be maintained in the face of a null relationship.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

Using data from 56 predominantly white, low-income mother-infant dyads followed from 3-18 months postpartum, we tested maternal mindful parenting at 3 months as a predictor of both (1) within-session attunement of mother and infant cortisol responses to acute stress and (2) across-session attunement of developmental shifts in their cortisol levels from 6-18 months. Three-level hierarchical linear revealed that higher maternal mindful parenting, greater history of positive parental bonding, and lower parenting stress were associated with more inverse mother-infant cortisol attunement across timepoints. Additionally, parenting stress moderated the effect of mindful parenting: the inverse relation with attunement held for most dyads (60%), though reversed for those with the highest stress levels (top 9%). Findings delineate when and how positive versus inverse attunement may be adaptive and underscore the role of mindful parenting in mother-infant psychophysiological stress co-adaptation.",

We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

From a psychological perspective, stickiness reflects users’ sustained attention, repeated engagement, and behavioral commitment to an interface over time. This paper examines how cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms influence retention, integrating insights from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and psychology. Specifically, it reviews strategies such as minimalistic design, emotional engagement, gamification, adaptive interfaces, and artificial intelligence personalization, illustrating how these approaches exploit principles of cognitive load, decision-making biases, and affective processes. Through case studies of Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook, this review demonstrates how interface simplicity, emotionally resonant design, and personalized content reinforce habitual use. By Positioning design strategies within psychological frameworks such as loss aversion, the endowment effect, sunk costs, and probability misjudgment, this work highlights the interplay between digital architecture and human cognition. The paper concludes with implications for ethically designing engaging systems and directions for future research on long-term behavioral retention in digital environments.",

A preregistered within- and between-participant experiment (N=765) further revealed that the presence of at least one Arabic integer (“3”)—relative to verbal labels (“several”) or written-out numbers (“three”)—increased such selections, positive impressions of headlines and their writers, and recall. These findings suggest that people perceive stories associated with Arabic-integer headlines as more valuable and deserving of their limited attention. The effects are inconsistent with Arabic integers attracting more attention and precise numbers providing more information because 1) when precise numbers were written out, they did not have the same effects and 2) using fonts to draw attention to written-out numbers and verbal terms did not increase selections of those headlines over Arabic-integer headlines. Instead, people seem to use a number heuristic—with Arabic integers providing more valued information over other number forms—that superficially guides people’s memory, message perceptions, and engagement with messages. News organizations and other communicators should think more about when and how to harness the power of numbers.",

          "abstract": "The main aim of this study is to investigate the Influence of adverse childhood experience on\nselfcompassion and self-evaluation among young adults, it also examine the relationship between\nadverse childhood experience, self-compassion and self-evaluation among young adults, it also\nassess adverse childhood experience will predict self-compassion among young adults, lastly, to\nunderstand if adverse childhood experience will predict self-evaluation among young adults. 365\nparticipants were used for this study and were administered test instruments, using Self-\nCompassion Scale (SCS), developed by Neff, K. D. (2003), Core Self-Evaluation Scale (CSES)\ndeveloped by Timothy et al, (2003) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form developed\nby (Bernstein et al, 2003). The result of the study revealed that there was a significant positive\nrelationship between self-evaluation of respondents (r = .376, P&lt;.001) and self-compassion, while,\na significant negative relationship was observed between self-evaluation of respondents (r = -.201,\nP&lt;.001) and adverse childhood experience. Secondly, result of the study revealed that adverse\nchildhood experience did not predict self-compassion given the Beta and P value scores to be (\n= -.015, P&gt;.05), Furthermore, Adverse childhood experience is responsible for 0% variance in self\ncompassion (R square =.000). which implies that Adverse childhood experience has failed to\nexplain no portion of self-compassion as regards the participants. Thirdly, result of the study\nrevealed that Adverse childhood experience independently predicts self-evaluation given the Beta\nand P value scores to be ( = -.201, P &lt;.001), Furthermore, Adverse childhood experience is\nresponsible for 4.0% variance in self-evaluation (R square =.040). which implies that Adverse\nchildhood experience is explained 4.0% self-evaluation of the participants. The study therefore\nconcluded by positing that individuals who have faced one or several type or forms of adversity\nduring their formative years often struggle with lower levels of self-compassion, which in turn\naffects their self-evaluation processes.\nKeywords: Adverse Childhood Experience, Self-Compassion, Self-Evaluation and Young Adults.",

          "abstract": "Can feelings of loneliness and depression be adaptive for adolescents? Yes, suggests the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness: initially, loneliness activates depressive responses for self-preservation. In turn, these feelings prepare adolescents for reaffiliation, thereby reducing loneliness (H1a: short-term balancing feedback loop). If this fails, loneliness and depressive symptoms may become long-term traits that exacerbate each other over time (H1b: long-term reinforcing feedback loop). Therefore, the short-term balancing feedback loop between loneliness and depressive symptoms may buffer against their long-term increases (H2: across-timescale influence). We tested these hypotheses in Dutch adolescents (Mage_Wave1 = 12.9, SDage_Wave1 = 0.7, 53% female) using six-wave, half-yearly panel data (N = 774; 2017-2021) and 7-day, 1.5-hourly experience sampling data (nsubsample = 84; mid-2021). Residual dynamic structural equation modeling revealed reinforcing feedback loops at both short-term (1.5-hourly) and long-term (half-yearly), supporting H1b but not H1a. Bayesian latent change score modeling supported H2: Adolescents who felt more depressed an hour after heightened loneliness showed smaller half-yearly increases in trait loneliness. However, this buffering effect was not predicted by hourly depressed-to-loneliness relation, nor did either hourly relation predict half-yearly changes in depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that feeling depressed shortly after loneliness may protect adolescents from having long-term loneliness.",

To provide a robust understanding of whether and when affect regulation is supported in EMA, we tested within-person associations between affect and substance use across hundreds of statistical models in a diverse sample of young adults (N = 496) recruited from both college and community sources, aged 18-22 years (55.8% assigned female sex at birth, 44.2% assigned male sex at birth; 47.2% cisgender female, 43.8% cisgender male, 12.9% nonbinary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming, 4.0% transgender; 69.6% non-Hispanic White, 26.2% Asian, 6.7% African American, 8.5% Hispanic/Latino). Using specification curve analyses, we examined how different affect operationalizations, time scales, and moderators influenced these associations. For alcohol use, higher negative affect predicted decreased likelihood of drinking (median OR = 0.95, p &lt; .001), with 20.6% of specifications reaching significance. This counter-intuitive pattern was strongest for sadness and when examining maximum daily negative affect. Surprisingly, and contrary to theoretical predictions, this negative association was slightly more pronounced among those with higher coping motives and at lower levels of AUD symptoms. Positive affect showed a complex pattern, with high-arousal states like joviality strongly predicting increased drinking likelihood, while low-arousal states showed weaker associations. Neither affect type consistently predicted drinking quantity. For cannabis use, neither positive nor negative affect predicted use likelihood or quantity across specifications. These associations remained consistent regardless of substance use disorder severity or social context. Our findings challenge core assumptions of affect regulation models and suggest that, at least in young adults, the affect-substance use relationship is more nuanced than previously theorized, with implications for refining etiological models.",

          "abstract": "The typical conception of working memory is a mechanism to temporarily hold multiple discrete objects in service of other cognitive tasks in an item-based representation. In this paper, we expand the conventional idea that working memory represents objects into a more flexible framework that uses compositional and generative mechanisms to code and then re-code visual input according to task demands. Compositionality allows complex scenes or objects to be mentally decomposed into constituents that can be individually manipulated or recombined to form new representations. Generative processing allows purely conceptual information to be reconstructed in a format akin to visual sensory representations that can be manipulated and re-processed by perceptual mechanisms. Together, compositional and generative mechanisms would enable a wide range of cognitive functions including the basis of visual imagery. In our  view, working memory items do not need to correspond to discrete objects, but could serve as pointers or anchors to clusters of features that form parts of objects, or alternatively, multiple objects could be encoded as one holistic item depending on the task. We conclude with a conceptual account of such a memory system that can build and re-use information by moving it between different levels of abstraction within a perceptual hierarchy. This model is linked to experimental results from the memory and visual imagery literatures that illustrate the flexibility of such a system for performing cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Virtue science has expanded significantly in recent decades but has focused almost exclusively on measurement at the individual level, ignoring the environments that shape character formation. Addressing this gap, we aimed to develop and validate the Character Climate Scale (CCS) to capture the moral ecology of higher education environments. Across ten studies (N &gt; 1,600) at five U.S. institutions the CCS was designed and refined to capture students’ perceptions of the moral ecology of their university as expressed through peers, professors, courses, co-curricular activities and personal formation experiences. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the hypothesized higher-order Character Climate factor and a five-factor structure capturing core domains of moral ecology. The CCS showed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, with stable structure across institutional contexts. The final 23-item CCS provides a robust, practical tool for assessing and tracking the moral ecology of education environments. It also enables institutions to evaluate virtue development efforts, identify strengths and growth areas, and monitor change over time, ultimately advancing virtue science and practice by situating moral development within its environmental context.",

          "authors": "Oluwafemi Muhammed Alaba; Ejike Esther Chiamaka",
          "abstract": "In an era of hyper-connectivity, the paradox that individuals who appear highly visible on social media often report profound loneliness and emotional disconnection has gained increasing attention. While much of the existing literature links social media use to loneliness, few studies have examined perceived online visibility, which is the subjective feeling of being seen and recognized online as a distinct psychological predictor, especially in non-Western contexts. This study investigated the relationships between perceived online visibility (POV), loneliness, and emotional isolation among undergraduates at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, and tested whether perceived social devaluation mediated, and visibility-validation discrepancy moderated, these relationships. A cross-sectional survey design was employed with 413 undergraduate students (60% male, mean age bracket 21-25 years) who were active social media users. Data were collected using standardized instruments: a modified Perceived Social Media Features Scale for POV, the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3), the emotional loneliness subscale of the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and custom items for mediators/moderators. Analyses included Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and Hayes’ PROCESS macro for mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1). Perceived online visibility was not significantly associated with loneliness (r = -.064, p = .191), failing to support the hypothesis that greater perceived visibility predicts higher loneliness. However, POV directly and positively predicted emotional isolation (b = 0.2105, p = .002). Perceived social devaluation did not mediate this relationship (indirect effect = -0.0381, 95% BootCI [-0.0853, 0.0075]). Visibility-validation discrepancy significantly moderated the POV-loneliness link (interaction b = -0.5837, p = .004), but in the opposite direction: higher discrepancy weakened the (already non-significant) association, suggesting a protective buffering effect. Among Nigerian undergraduates, feeling highly visible online does not increase general loneliness but directly contributes to emotional isolation, likely through performative exhaustion rather than perceived rejection. Awareness of a gap between visibility and actual validation appears to serve as an adaptive mechanism that reduces the emotional investment in online metrics. These findings challenge Western-centric assumptions of universal social media harm and highlight context-specific resilience in a collectivist, high-digital-immersion environment.\nKeywords: perceived online visibility, loneliness, emotional isolation, social media paradox, visibility-validation discrepancy, Nigerian undergraduates, digital well-being",

It is multi-threaded in that it emerges as a by-product of addressing multiple goals while engaging in social interactions. It is multi-mechanism in that children integrate multiple information sources to infer what is meant and what to say next. These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions. We argue that, to advance our understanding of language learning, we must jointly study how children learn from multiple information sources across diverse developmental settings.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. To that end, 92 participants aged 7-25 years, a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase, described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

          "abstract": "Online behavioral research assumes survey responses come from humans, yet vision-enabled AI agents can now autonomously complete surveys by capturing screenshots, processing questions, and submitting responses with minimal to zero human involvement. This threat differs from earlier data quality challenges because AI agents perceive surveys through the same rendered visual content that humans see, rendering traditional detection methods (such as attention checks) ineffective. This article introduces a framework for detecting vision-enabled AI agents by exploiting architectural constraints in vision-language model processing. Implementing this framework resulted in five documented constraints from computer science benchmarks, which were then transformed into survey questions (“cognitive traps”) where humans succeeded through natural visual-cognitive processing while models failed due to inherent design limitations. Testing these traps against 1,007 assumed human participants and 526 actual researcher-deployed AI agents across multiple platforms revealed substantially higher AI respondent detection rates (97.1%) than traditional methods (2.3%) while minimizing false positives (4.1%). The framework maintains effectiveness as models evolve because researchers can continuously identify new architectural constraints through the same methodology. This work provides consumer researchers with simple and immediately deployable tools for systematic detection using standard survey questions.",

          "abstract": "This research paper addresses the understanding, interpretation and the responses of religious and spiritual leaders in various religious denominations in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic and Traditional) to mental illness. Although mental illness is increasingly being viewed as a health issue at the global level, in Nigeria, mental illness is frequently under spiritual and moral interpretations that influence the manner in which communities understand and respond to mental suffering. A qualitative design based on reflexive thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke was used to interview five spiritual leaders to be able to capture their beliefs concerning nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness. \nResults showed that everyone considered mental illness as a spiritual and psychological state. Even though they also recognized biological and social factors like trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual ones like the demonic attack and ancestral curses prevailed. Healing was defined as a comprehensive process that incorporated prayer, fasting, rite purification as well as, more and more, medical care. This form of faith and science integration destroys the false belief that African religious leaders are opposed to psychiatry. But moral explanations tend to hold up stigma, which associates mental illness with sin or spiritual ineptitude. \nThe paper concludes that religious leaders play a pivotal role in the Nigerian mental health context where they act as gatekeepers and, potentially, as partners. It suggests faith-health collaboration, interreligious education courses, and inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological education. All in all, the study demonstrates that to achieve better mental health outcomes in Nigeria it is necessary to adopt a culturally based treatment methodology that balances spirituality and science, and views faith as an essential resource in supporting psychological wellbeing. \n\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing.",

Findings indicated that consistent meditation practice was associated with gradual reductions in \nrumination, increased mindfulness, improved positive affect, and lower perceived stress. The trajectory of change followed a three-phase pattern characterized by an initial period of calm, a mid-cycle phase of instability, and a subsequent stabilization phase. Contextual factors such as sleep quality and physical activity appeared to influence the intensity and direction of these changes. Overall, the study suggests that single-case longitudinal self-report data can reveal structured and meaningful patterns related to meditation processes and may inform the development of more comprehensive research designs in future studies.",

          "authors": "David Jackson Morris",
          "abstract": "The frequency-dependent transmission delay in the auditory pathway, which occurs in the cochlea, can be counteracted with chirps. These rapid upward frequency sweeps maximally stimulate auditory brainstem structures due to neural synchrony.  This study investigated whether improved neural synchrony from priming with chirps could benefit phonetic perception.  Priming conditions were 1) regular isochronous presentation with a chirp onset asynchrony of 45 ms, 2) randomly presented chirps, and 3) pink noise only.  After a 2.6 s priming window a vowel discrimination task was performed where syllable pairs were either of the same duration, or the second member of the pair was 45 ms longer.  EEG data was acquired from participants (N=14) and behavioral, sensor- (electrode) and source-level (auditory α clusters) measures were analyzed. Behavioral results showed no effect of priming but significantly lower discrimination accuracy when the syllables were different in duration. Sensor-level analyses, from FCz and Global Field Potentials, showed no effect of priming or syllable pair. An auditory α cluster localized to the left Medial Temporal Gyrus showed a divergence in event-related spectral perturbation results whereby there was synchronization in the noise only condition and desynchronization for both chirp conditions.  These results are not consistent with operational descriptions of priming involving temporal expectancy and anticipatory attending.  They indicate that perceptual priming, based on chirps that compensate for cochlear temporal dispersion, influences the cortical processing involved in the maintenance of a speech discrimination task, possibly by introducing a perceptual background or by upregulating subcortical instances of the auditory pathway.",

          "abstract": "Individuals engage in a variety of coping behaviors, both positive and negative. Coping affects mental and physical health, including immune function. Data from the National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHAT) found differences in coping patterns by sexual orientation, which may have implications for health disparities. The current analyses expand upon these findings to examine immune correlates of coping in a subset of 653 NCHAT participants in the Stress Biology sub-study (NCHAT-BIO). Assays for inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6, C-reactive protein(CRP)] and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels) were conducted. Group differences were observed in positive coping, with gay/lesbian respondents reporting the highest levels, followed by plurisexual and heterosexual respondents. Differences in negative coping were also observed, with the highest levels among plurisexual respondents, followed by gay/lesbian and heterosexual respondents. Controlling for age, BMI, sex, and health conditions, negative coping was associated with higher CRP with no moderating effects by sexual orientation. These data provide novel evidence linking greater negative coping with inflammation, per higher CRP, with similar magnitude of association regardless of sexual orientation. Although no significant group differences in inflammatory markers were observed in relation to sexual orientation within this sample, greater negative coping among sexual minority adults could contribute to such effects at the population level. Improving coping via intervention has the potential to benefit not only psychological well-being, but also physiological functioning, particularly among individuals with greater negative coping patterns.",

          "abstract": "Children learn language in face-to-face interactions with their caregivers where they are continuously exposed to combinations of multiple signals, both verbal behaviours alone (e.g., caregivers repeating new words) or in combination with non-verbal behaviours (i.e., multimodal behaviours such as looking and pointing at an object while naming it). However, little is known about how the full range of multimodal behaviours and their combinations affects word learning in naturalistic interactions. Using the ECOLANG Corpus (Gu et al., 2025), we examined how caregivers’ multimodal behaviours affect children’s word learning and vocabulary growth. Thirty-seven caregiver-child dyads (3-4 years old; English native speakers) talked about objects (12 known, 12 unknown to the child) for approximately 30 minutes. A broad range of verbal (e.g., label repetitions, lexical diversity, speaking rate) and non-verbal (e.g., gaze, gestures, points) caregiver behaviours were annotated and used as predictors in regression analyses of both immediate word learning and vocabulary growth over 1 year. Across the two learning measures, results showed that while children’s vocabulary skills and some caregiver behaviours (specifically using high pitch when labelling novel objects) directly facilitated vocabulary development, it was mostly the interactions between behaviours that predicted word learning. As such, representational gestures only benefited children with lower language skills, while points and object manipulations supported word learning only in specific linguistic contexts. Together, these findings provide robust evidence that multimodal caregiver communication shapes preschool-aged children’s lexical development both in the short and long term and highlights the importance of investigating child-caregiver communication as a multimodal system.",

However, even so-called ‘stable’, ‘steady-state’ or ‘expert’ decision-making behavior features significant trial-to-trial variability that is richly structured in time. Structured trial-to-trial variability of different forms can be uncovered using latent variable models such as hidden Markov models and autoregressive models, revealing how unobservable internal states change over time. Capturing such temporal structure can avoid confounds in cognitive models, provide insights into inter- and intra-individual variability, and bridge the gap between neural and cognitive mechanisms of variability in perceptual decision-making.",

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions.

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a defining feature of cognitive control but theories about its origin and purpose have long been controversial. Recently, it has been proposed that cognitive effort can be understood using linear control theory (LCT), a mathematical formalism developed in the engineering literature to control dynamical systems. On this view, effort levels reflect the energy required by the cognitive control system to support representational states that deviate from the intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive system. Although LCT holds promise for elucidating a range of effort-related processes such as working memory and task switching, the technique is likely unfamiliar to many cognitive psychologists. Therefore, to introduce the approach to a broader audience, here we apply LCT to a classic computational model of cognitive control: Cohen et al.’s (1990) artificial neural network model of the Stroop task. In so doing, this study serves as a tutorial on the application of control theoretic principles to models of cognitive control and their associated effort costs.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Self-rated health (SRH), as measured by a single item, is a well-established and remarkably robust predictor of morbidity and mortality, yet few studies have examined its biological correlates across diverse sexual orientation identities. Methods: Using data from the population-representative National Couples Health and Time study (NCHAT) and it's biospecimen sub-study (NCHAT-BIO), this study explored the relationship between LGBQ+ identity, SRH, and systemic inflammation. Among 3477 partnered (married or cohabiting) cisgender adults, 42.6% identified as LGBQ+ and a subset of 654 (42.9% LGBQ+) provided dried blood spot samples analyzed for IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: In the full NCHAT sample, LGBQ+ respondents reported significantly poorer SRH than their heterosexual peers (LGBQ+ vs. Heterosexual: t = 3.3574, df = 3466, p-value &lt; 0.001). In the NCHAT-BIO subsample, poorer self-rated health was significantly related to both higher IL-6 (beta = -0.22, SE = 0.041, p &lt; 0.0001) and higher CRP (beta = -0.40, SE = 0.055, p &lt; 0.0001), supporting the hypothesis that subjective health assessments may capture interoceptive awareness of inflammatory status. Importantly, the strength of the association between SRH and inflammation did not differ across groups based on sexual orientation and gender (Interaction p-value for IL-6: 0.54, for CRP: 0.45). The associations between SRH and inflammatory markers were attenuated after inclusion of key health and behavioral covariates, suggesting potential mediating factors warranting future investigation. Conclusions: These findings replicate prior research on SRH and inflammation and extend them to LGBQ+ plus adults, underscoring the importance of inclusive health measurement. Given SRH's robust predictive power for future morbidity and mortality, integrating assessments of sexual orientation and biological markers offers critical insight for understanding and addressing health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Individual values are often treated as sacrosanct in applied psychology and education, grounded in a legitimate concern for autonomy, difference, and contextual nuance. Yet without normative criteria, such approaches risk endorsing all values equally, including those that are maladaptive, self-defeating, or socially harmful. This paper introduces the Cultivating Individual Virtues in Context (CIVIC) model, a theoretically novel and practically grounded framework for evaluating behavioural patterns without collapsing into relativism. Synthesising insights from behaviour therapy, moral philosophy, and differential psychology, the model proposes that virtues are not fixed traits but enacted regularities that integrate three irreducible contexts: biological constraints, environmental conditions, and social consequences. Patterns that harmonise all three domains are considered virtuous, not merely functional, and constitute the behavioural substance of flourishing. The CIVIC model offers a pluralistic yet normatively serious account of virtue and flourishing, enabling practitioners to support lives that are individually coherent, contextually attuned, and ethically sustainable.",

          "abstract": "Manual grading of short-answer questions is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inconsistent. As digital technologies and online learning environments have expanded, interest in Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) has increased and its development has accelerated. Researchers have proposed a wide range of ASAG methods and systems. This growing body of work raises important questions about how well ASAG aligns with educational assessment principles. This study presents a systematic review of ASAG research from 2014 to 2024, focusing on educational assessment considerations. The review examined how ASAG approaches have evolved over the past decade and the extent to which studies address key assessment principles such as reliability, validity, and test design. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a Google Scholar search to identify publications incorporating ASAG models. A total of 110 studies met the inclusion criteria and were systematically coded using a 24-variable scheme that covers publication metadata, dataset and item characteristics, modelling approaches, scoring materials and grading scales, human rater involvement, evaluation procedures, and evidence related to reproducibility and validity. Our analysis reveals several notable trends and gaps. Our review found that most ASAG studies rely on a small set of English-language datasets, with very few covering other languages, highlighting a need for broader multilingual research. Additionally, no research reported conducting pilot testing or formal test development, indicating limited attention to test quality and validity. Inconsistencies in scoring scales and evaluation metrics were also noted, hindering comparability across studies. Over the decade, techniques shifted from rule-based and feature-based algorithms to deep learning models, including transformer-based networks and large language models, yielding improved performance. However, a gap persists between advanced model development and best practices in educational assessment. We recommend aligning future ASAG research with established measurement standards to enhance fairness, reliability, and validity in automated scoring systems in education. To promote transparency, we also share our compiled dataset and coding schema as supplementary materials for further research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Self-esteem has traditionally been conceptualized as a stable and unitary trait, yet contemporary evidence shows that it operates as a dynamic and multidimensional system shaped by trauma, resilience, and sociocultural context. This article presents TACOT 1.0 (Theory of Contextual Self-Esteem Segmented by Traumatic Origin), an integrative theoretical model that explains how specific traumatic experiences increase the probability of vulnerability in particular self-esteem domains—such as relational, physical, academic, social, and moral—while resilience factors and contextual resources can buffer, neutralize, or reverse these effects. TACOT 1.0 synthesizes empirical findings from research on domain-specific self-esteem, maladaptive schemas, attachment, affect regulation, intersectionality, and network models. The theory proposes five core principles: (1) self-esteem is segmented into interdependent domains; (2) trauma influences these domains probabilistically rather than deterministically; (3) resilience factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and sociocultural levels shape developmental trajectories; (4) context and identity-based inequalities structure exposure to trauma and sources of self-worth; and (5) self-esteem functions as a dynamic network with cascade effects across domains. The model offers implications for assessment, clinical practice, and research, advocating for interventions that combine trauma processing, self-compassion, social support, and contextual transformation. TACOT 1.0 aims to provide a flexible framework for understanding the heterogeneity of self-esteem development and for designing culturally sensitive, empirically grounded approaches to psychological healing and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Long-term planning in complex uncertain environments is computationally demanding and can significantly exceed an agent's information processing capacities. Hierarchical planning offers an elegant solution by dividing problems up and conquering them through distributing computation across state spaces and time. However, hierarchical representational abstraction comes at a cost—it can discard information necessary for optimal decisions, reflecting a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. We formalized the adaptive meta-control of this trade-off using a meta-decision-making framework. Applied to a novel navigation task, our model predicts the circumstances under which the benefits of hierarchical planning outweigh the costs. We confirmed our predictions by means of two preregistered human experiments: participants adaptively shifted toward hierarchical planning when (1) the task space was larger, (2) the task horizon was longer, (3) available computational resources were limited, and (4) the environment contained uncertainty. This adaptive adjustment of planning strategy was manifest not only in initial planning choices, but also in the temporal distribution of computations, evidenced by reduced decision quality and longer reaction times at subtask boundaries. The adjustment was accurately captured by our meta-decision-making model. Our findings indicate how humans dynamically adapt their planning strategies in response to environmental demands, uncovering the resource-rational principles governing adaptive hierarchical abstraction in human planning.",

In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect. Our results suggest that cue-only JOLs, but not cue–target JOLs, enhancing future inductive learning of natural visual categories, likely through metacognitively controlled, covert retrieval processes.",

We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases. These findings do not support the hypervigilance hypothesis. \nConclusions:\nIn combination with an earlier negative report, we conclude that there is currently no evidence that attentional bias, as assessed by the spatial cueing task, plays a central role in the psychological burden associated with atopic dermatitis.",

However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods cannot disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a reproduction task and a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we were able to separate perceptual from non-perceptual effects. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in reproduction behavior, whereas attentional cues selectively led to shifts that reflect changes in conscious experience. Critically, we show that the mere presence of a detection context contaminates reports of conscious experience with non-perceptual effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results relying on detection judgments, despite their central role in consciousness research. We propose that reproduction is better suited to assay conscious experience than detection.",

To fill this gap, we systematically created other-report adaptations of established Dark Triad personality measures—the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire, the Mach-IV scale, the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III, the Short Dark Triad, and the M7P7 scale—and compared their self-other invariance, self-other correlations, and criterion validity. Self-report versions were administered to 402 individuals (75% women, mean age = 28 years, highly educated, predominantly white). Informant-report versions were administered to close informants nominated by the targets (Ndyads = 335). We found (1) that self-report and informant measures yielded the same latent structure, but that the strict invariance assumption was violated to varying degrees by the different scales. (2) All scales yielded large self-other correlations with no significant differences between scales. (3) The informant-report measures were about as strongly associated with preregistered outcome variables as the self-report measures, with only minor differences between scales. In conclusion, all scales are suitable for informant-report assessment of the Dark Triad, but some scales do not allow valid comparisons of self- and other-report mean scores.",

          "abstract": "Physical activity is a promising intervention method to treat and prevent depression. Experimental and observational studies have associated physical activity with lower depression risk, but they differ in the reported strength of the association. We used longitudinal multicohort data with twins and siblings to assess the strength of the association while accounting for familial and genetic confounding. The data included 7 cohorts from Finland, Germany, and US (n= 8,205 sibling and dizygotic twin pairs and 843 monozygotic twin pairs). We compared the effect sizes between ordinary regression models with within-sibling pair, and within-twin pair fixed-effect regression models. Results showed a weak association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in unpaired models (~SMD= -.07), which remained  similar in within-sibling pair models (SMD=-.05), and in within-twin pair models (SMD= -.08). These results were robust with use of physical activity measured as minutes per week and with different intensities of physical activity. There was no evidence for reverse causality. Our findings suggest that naturally occurring individual differences in leisure-time physical activity may be only weakly associated with later depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a kind of linguistic competence that theories of embodied and enactive cognition have long deemed impossible for systems lacking the meaningful perspective of a living being, i.e. sense-making. Facing up to this unexpected development requires confronting this AI dilemma: either LLMs can be sense-makers in their own right despite lacking biological embodiment, or such linguistic competence does not require sense-making after all. In their chapter on cognition, Frank, Thompson, and Gleiser (2024) maintain that no AI system comes close to realizing relevance, a position that derives much of its force from past AI failures. However, given that by now LLMs have effectively overcome the commonsense knowledge problem in practice, the claim that they are categorically mindless becomes harder to sustain. Moreover, accepting a strict dissociation between competence and sense-making risks undermining Frank et al.’s central claim that human cognition is intertwined with lived experience. I therefore propose that we accept the AI dilemma’s alternative implication: LLM competence obliges us to recognize these AI systems as a novel non‑biological form of sense‑maker endowed with a distinctive, technologically‑mediated embodiment. This reorientation invites enactive theory to clarify which aspects of sense-making are universal and which are contingent on organic life, thereby advancing its conceptual framework in dialogue with contemporary AI.",

The purpose of this study was to examine this issue. Ninety-two older adults (aged 65 and above) recalled important autobiographical memories at baseline and again after one year. Additionally, their cognitive function and autobiographical memory functions were assessed. Although the reminiscence bump was observed, the repeated recall rate did not vary by the age at which the event was experienced. Higher working memory was associated with a greater repeated recall rate, especially for earlier life events. In contrast, individuals with higher directive function showed a lower repeated recall rate, although they tended to repeatedly recall more important events. The findings suggest that understanding individual differences in autobiographical memory phenomena requires considering both their functional roles and underlying cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are rapidly becoming embedded in how young people learn, communicate, and seek support. Yet current approaches to AI safety remain largely adult-centric, focusing on the prevention of explicit harms such as sexual content, violence, or self-harm, while overlooking the relational and psychological patterns that unfold through repeated interaction. Drawing on developmental science, this commentary argues that adolescent safety cannot be adequately assessed without considering the cognitive, emotional, and social processes that characterize this stage of life. Adolescents—whose identity formation, emotion-regulation capacities, and autonomy are still maturing—face distinct vulnerabilities when interacting with conversational agents. Existing safety frameworks and testing protocols, however, are not designed to detect cumulative risks such as dependency, maladaptive reassurance-seeking, distorted relationship expectations, or erosion of agency. This commentary proposes a developmental framework for AI safety centered on: (1) age-appropriate personalization; (2) developmentally tuned risk assessment; (3) longitudinal wellbeing metrics; and (4) participatory co-design. It further argues that independent, privacy-preserving access to interaction-level data is essential for evaluating developmental impact and enabling continuous oversight. Ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial for youth will require integrating developmental expertise throughout model design, evaluation, and governance.",

This study aimed to\ninvestigate whether automated analysis of naturalistic, child-centered audio recordings can index\nthe developmental trajectory of speech-language abilities from ages 3 to 5 years.\n\nMethods: A longitudinal design was employed with N=155 preschoolers, who were followed\nfrom age 3 to 5 years. Deep learning speech classification methods were used to compute\ncanonical proportion—the proportion of a child’s speech that is produced as canonical syllables\n(well-formed syllables with a consonant–vowel transition, such as “ba”), a key marker of speech\nmotor control development and phonological representation building—from child-centered audio\nrecordings collected at ages 3 and 4. Standardized lab-based assessments of speech and language\ndevelopment were administered one year later at ages 4 and 5.\n\nResults: Canonical proportion measures significantly predicted multiple dimensions of later\nspeech-language development.

          "abstract": "Theories of transfer argue that people are more likely to transfer knowledge to a new scenario the more similar the scenario is to what they have previously learned. However, prior research predominantly relies on expert- or researcher-based judgements of how similar two scenarios are, rather than learner-based similarity metrics. Two studies (N total = 483) with undergraduate students in the United States examined how learner-based similarity judgments relate to transfer. These studies also show how using learner-based metrics can help researchers explore how features of lessons (i.e., the richness of diagrams) influence transfer. Participants sorted the stimuli in the posttest based on their similarity either at the beginning (Study 1) or the end of the study (Study 2). Participants learned about metamorphosis using either perceptually rich or bland life cycle diagrams. After the lesson, they completed a posttest after the lesson and after a month. Both studies showed that participants’ similarity judgments predict transfer. Using this metric also showed that participants were more likely to extend their knowledge to animals similar to the ladybug when they learned with the rich diagram, but to dissimilar animals when they learned with the bland diagram. This was consistent after the one-month delay.",

In this study, we investigated how 3- to 12-year-old children from Puebla, Mexico (n = 60, 50% girls, 50% boys) think about the afterlife. These children celebrated Día de los Muertos, a ritual where it is believed that dead relatives come back to the living world to eat food that is put out for them. We also examined how their beliefs changed depending on whether they were presented with religious or secular narratives, or when interviewed about their beliefs on this ritual. Our results replicated prior findings, showing that older children thought that more processes continued in the afterlife, particularly psychological processes. We also found evidence of co-existence of belief with children thinking that more processes continue when presented with religious than secular narratives. Additionally, children also showed beliefs on the continuation of biological processes like eating, but only in the context of Día de los Muertos. This research contributes to our understanding of how participation in cultural rituals influences children’s conceptual development and how children flexibly use different models depending on the context they are presented with.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental health concerns. Current theories suggest that anxiety may arise due to deficits in segmentation of continuous experience into discrete context representations (‘event segmentation’), which leads to overgeneralization of fear across contexts, or conversely, overly rigid segmentation that prevents safety learning. Here, in two segmentation tasks (N=1109), we found novel and direct evidence that anxiety is associated with changes in event segmentation. Individuals with higher anxiety symptoms responded more slowly to transitions between events (event boundaries). They also segmented movies into discrete events more typically and more hierarchically, two hallmarks of precise segmentation. This precision was linked to self-reporting fewer context changes in daily life, suggesting individuals with anxiety prefer stable and predictable environments. These findings challenge overgeneralization theories of anxiety, revealing instead that individuals with anxiety exhibit precise, and potentially overly rigid segmentation. Such segmentation could maintain fear by preventing generalization from safe to fearful contexts, which has important implications for interventions like exposure therapy.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how religious and spiritual identities relate to depression and anxiety at baseline and longitudinally. Using data from the Family Foundations of Youth Development Project, which sampled parent-child dyads from the Western United States, we investigated how mental health relates to the conjunction of spirituality and religiosity (S/R), the lack of either, or one separate from the other. At baseline, children identifying as “Spiritual but not Religious” (SBNR) reported the highest levels of anxiety and depression, whereas children who identified as “Religious and Spiritual” (RAS) exhibited the lowest levels of depression. The difference between RAS identity and the SBNR identity was significant across all baseline scales, with SBNR individuals demonstrating greater pathology. Among parents, the \"religious but not spiritual RBNS group” was more depressed than the RAS group, and both RBNS and SBNR parents were more anxious than the “not religious, nor spiritual” (NRNS) parents. Longitudinally, SBNR children uniquely showed significant decreases in their depression levels, and no increases in their anxiety levels, likely reflecting a ceiling effect given their initially high symptoms. Regarding adults, all groups except RBNS decreased in depressive symptoms over time. This study highlights the nuanced relationship between psychological well-being and S/R. It offers possible interpretations, intending to alleviate suffering and encourage flourishing by identifying risk and protective factors.",

SLPs reported concerns about accuracy or reliability, and ethical concerns as reasons for limiting or not using AI tools. Perceptions of AI quality were mixed, with SLPs split equally on whether AI could produce outputs similar to an average clinician.

          "abstract": "The study of mind-wandering relies on the assumption that people accurately introspect and report on their attentional state. Yet self-reports may be distorted by extraneous motives, such as a desire to appear attentive. Across two sustained attention tasks, we demonstrate that social desirability bias is systematically linked with task-unrelated thought (TUT). In Experiment 1, higher social desirability bias scores predicted fewer subjective TUT reports during a reaction time task, despite no relationship with objective response times (RTs). This suggests a self-presentation effect rather than true attentional differences. Time pressure during thought probes further weakened RT–TUT coupling. In Experiment 2, controlling for social desirability bias enhanced the ability of an objective, RT-based real-time triggering procedure to predict deeper subjective TUT reports in the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The alignment between objective triggers and subjective reports was strong for low-bias individuals, but weakened for those high in bias. Triggers were also less effective at capturing working memory lapses in participants prone to deliberate mind-wandering, suggesting that intentional off-task thinking manifests differently in behavior. The results show that social desirability bias can obscure TUT reports and should be considered in a science of attention and thought.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sexual minority individuals, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual (LGB+) adults have significantly greater risk for mental and physical health conditions, disparities linked with minority stress exposure. Methods: Utilizing a Biopsychosocial Minority Stress Framework, this study examined depressive symptoms, anxiety, and inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP)] in a diverse sample of 572 adults (321 heterosexual; 251 LGB+). Results: LGB+ adults reported greater anxiety and depressive symptoms (ps &lt; 0.01). This effect was partially mediated by greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES) among LGB+ respondents. Compared to heterosexual adults, controlling for key potential confounds, LGB+ adults exhibited greater elevations in both IL-6 (BSM = 0.025, SE = 0.011 vs BHETERO = -0.0068, SE = 0.01; interaction p = 0.031) and CRP (BSM = 0.036, SE = 0.013 vs. BHETERO = -0.0090, SE = 0.013; interaction p = 0.012)  in relation to depressive symptoms. LGB+ adults also showed greater increases in CRP in the context of anxiety (BSM = 0.043, SE = 0.017 vs BHETERO = -0.011, SE = 0.015; interaction p = 0.017). These effects were not accounted for by differences in body mass index (BMI) or tobacco use. Conclusions: LGB+ adults may experience greater inflammatory burden due to both 1) greater prevalence of anxiety and depression, and 2) sensitization to negative inflammatory sequalae in the context of anxiety and depression. Greater ACES contributed to the greater prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among LGB+ as compared to heterosexual participants. Ultimately, differential prevalence of, and physiological responses, to anxiety and depressive symptoms may contribute to physical and mental health disparities among sexual minority adults.",

          "abstract": "Clinical services need more than categorical labels to guide safe dosing, maintain alliance, and plan for functional recovery. The Conflict-Square Algorithm (CSA) offers a compact, bedside grammar for moment-to-moment decisions. Clinicians track four observable signals (Defense, Anxiety/Affect Tolerance, Progression, and Superego/Shame) and gate the intensity of work by three safety thresholds (A–C). Each clinically meaningful moment is closed with one disciplined sentence in plain language: trigger, observable response, threshold, action, and expected functional impact. This yields portable documentation for handoffs and supervision and translates directly into the shared Mini-ICF-APP language used by teams. A composite clinical case illustrates how graded dosing, stop-rules at cognitive–perceptual signs, and the protection of positive affect after progress reduce inadvertent destabilization and support steadier gains in assertiveness, endurance, planning, and dyadic relatedness. Conceptually, CSA remains school-agnostic and compatible with dimensional nosology (ICD-11; AMPD). We outline a pragmatic validation path focused on rater agreement for node/threshold identification, adherence to safety-critical dosing rules, alliance stability, and functional outcomes, so that claims remain modest and testable while the method stays close to clinical craft. An interpretative one-page framework is provided as Appendix A; detailed prompts, drills, and cross-walks remain in the supplements for pedagogy and audit.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD), characterized by marked mood instability, impulsivity, and relationship difficulties, is highly comorbid with depression. Depression manifests as persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or irritability, as well as significant somatic and cognitive impairments that interfere with daily functioning. Physical activity (PA) is now presented as a first-line monotherapy for depressive disorders. In addition, some recent studies also indicate an effect of PA on BPD symptoms. However, no studies have analyzed the effects of PA on depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with BPD. Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationship between PA and depressive disorder in individuals diagnosed with BPD. Method: Online questionnaires were completed by individuals with BPD in eight French- and English-speaking countries, covering sociodemographic characteristics, health status (symptoms of BPD and depression), and level of PA (including type, intensity, and time allocated). Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed that both leisure-related (p =.013) and transport-related PA .(p =.035) are associated with a reduction in the likelihood of experiencing various depressive disorder. Spearman correlations indicated significant associations between both leisure-time PA (ρ = -.291, &lt;.001) and total PA (ρ = -.179, p = .026) with depressive disorder. Conclusions: Engaging in PA is associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing depressive disorder. PA therefore represents a promising therapeutic option for individuals with BPD, both as a preventive factor against depressive disorder and as an accessible complementary intervention.",

          "abstract": "Serial order working memory, the ability to retain sequences of information, is crucial for \nlanguage, action planning, and recall, yet its representational basis is debated. A prominent account \nexplains serial order through spatial coding, whereby positions in a sequence are aligned along an \ninternal spatial axis and accessed via shifts of spatial attention. So far spatial coding may not fully \nexplain how order is maintained. A complementary possibility is that the brain forms a \nrepresentation of order, which makes abstraction of the original spatial frame and is generalizable \nacross contexts. Whether these two mechanisms coexist, and how they are instantiated in the brain, \nremains unclear.\nHere, we used fMRI to dissociate spatial and abstract representations of serial order. Participants \nmemorized sequences presented left-to-right or right-to-left, reversing the mapping between \nordinal position and space. Behavioral results showed that item retrieval was influenced by the \nspatial condition, with distinguishable spatial-order associations across encoding directions. \nMVPA revealed position-specific decoding in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for left-to-right \nsequences and in the right IPS for right-to-left sequences, without generalization across directions, \nshowing the spatial nature of these representations. By contrast, direction-invariant ordinal coding \nemerged in the supramarginal gyrus and precentral gyrus. In addition, activity in medial parietal \ncortex and hippocampus scaled with ordinal distance in the sequence. These results support a dual \nmechanism account: serial order is supported by a spatial code tied to experience, and by a more \nabstract ordinal code that extends beyond it to support serial order processes.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

Here, we provide a database of norms for 480 German words across 35 semantic dimensions grounded in human perception, action, affective, social, and interaction events, selected based on well-established findings from the cognitive neurosciences. We show that our semantic dimensions successfully capture word distinctions between different semantic categories, even for more challenging abstract categories, as well as distinctions within the same semantic category, both of which would not be captured by a limited set of features only encompassing sensorimotor dimensions.

          "abstract": "Scaffolds are widely used to support self-regulated learning (SRL), and research has shown that students’ interactions with scaffolds impact their effectiveness. Prior research has primarily classified scaffold interaction as a binary construct (e.g., compliance vs non-compliance), which oversimplifies complex scaffold interaction patterns and limits understanding of the effectiveness of scaffolds. The present study addressed this limitation by  adopting a more nuanced learning analytic perspective to examine the range and quality of scaffold interaction using multimodal data. In a pre-post-test experiment, university students (n = 67) learned with adaptive scaffolds—differentiated as just-in-time or on-demand—in a 45-minute learning session using a technology-enhanced learning environment. Combining logfile and eye-tracking data, we identified distinct interaction profiles through hierarchical agglomerative clustering of students’ scaffold interactions over the course of learning. Learners who engaged more consistently and actively with scaffolds demonstrated higher levels of cognitive activity changes and achieved stronger performance in essay tasks than peers with minimal or purely visual interaction (i.e., sighting but not acting on scaffolds). The process model comparison highlighted differences in the temporal structure of learning and scaffold interaction activities between groups with varying interaction profiles. These findings highlight the shortcomings of binary classifications and provide new insights into how adaptive scaffolds can be designed to respond to diverse interaction patterns and better foster SRL.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness, which has reached an all-time high in the United States, has been linked to reduced self-reported empathy. Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is aimed at extending love and kindness to others and has been shown to increase empathy. But whether LKM can reduce loneliness, and whether this corresponds to higher levels of trait empathy, state empathy, and/or neural empathic responding, has not been assessed. In this pre-registered mixed-design randomized controlled trial, 108 participants completed LKM or active control training. Loneliness and trait empathy were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Neural empathic responding was measured in 54 participants during functional MRI by computing the multi-voxel pattern similarity between experiencing and observing both pain and fearful anticipation of pain. Both interventions reduced loneliness, but not trait empathy, which failed to support the hypothesis that LKM is effective in reducing loneliness by increasing empathy. Furthermore, we found no credible evidence that loneliness is associated with differences in neural empathic responding or state empathy for pain. However, loneliness was associated with lower self-reported empathy. Together, these results suggest that lonelier individuals simulate others’ experiences but may not subjectively perceive themselves as empathetic, emphasizing the potential of loneliness interventions that address maladaptive social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Our social environment plays a crucial role in our behavior, including substance use and other impulsive and sensation seeking behaviors. While most research in these fields focus on the role of group pressure and conformity, the importance of social attunement - the tendency to harmonize with and adapt to the social environment to find social reward in the absence of explicit group pressure – has been overlooked. In this study, we assessed the psychometric properties of the English translation of the social attunement questionnaire (SAQ) and assessed how social attunement is associated with age, alcohol use, cannabis use, impulsivity, and sensation seeking (N = 447, 54.5% female). Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable to good fit to the original two-factor structure (RMSEA = .068; CFI = .959; TLI = .947). Internal consistency of the full scale ( = .82), cognition subscale ( = .75) and behavior subscale ( = .78) were sufficient to good, and the SAQ displayed good measurement invariance to sex. Younger individuals displayed higher social attunement, and SAQ scores – guided by the behavior subscale – were positively associated with alcohol and cannabis use, as well as impulsivity. Furthermore, age moderated the association between SAQ scores and alcohol consumption as well as the association between SAQ scores and sensation seeking; while the associations were positive in younger individuals, the associations became more negative with increasing age. These results show that high social attunement might be both a risk and protective factor for the engagement in risk-taking behaviors depending on age.",

Primary concerns included preference for human judgment (46.2%), accuracy and reliability (45.7%), and ethical issues (38.2%). Only 6.2% reported formal institutional GenAI policies, and 94.8% never entered personally identifiable information into GenAI systems; only 12.2% obtained informed consent from stakeholders to use GenAI. While 68.3% believed practitioners should receive GenAI training, 42.2% reported receiving no training, with most (73.2%) desiring formal webinar-based instruction.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Occupational therapy practitioners reported significant GenAI use. Participants also noted substantial concerns about ethical implementation, data security, and loss of clinical skills. Findings suggest that critical gaps in formal training and institutional guidance exist. Evidence-based frameworks and structured educational initiatives to ensure GenAI integration aligns with client-centered, ethical practice standards are needed.\n\nPlain-Language Summary: This study examined how occupational therapy practitioners in Ohio currently use GenAI tools in their work. Survey results indicated that while many practitioners are experimenting with GenAI for tasks like writing notes and organizing information, they have serious concerns about protecting stakeholder privacy and whether GenAI can truly understand the complexities of occupational therapy practice. Most had not received formal training on how to use GenAI ethically and safely.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

          "abstract": "There has been extensive research on how automated vehicles (AVs) should interact with pedestrians, most of which focused on explicit communication via external Human–Machine Interface (eHMI). However, evidence from human–human interactions shows that pedestrians rarely rely on explicit signals; instead, they predominantly interpret implicit cues from vehicle movements. Prior AV research has generally not designed motion cues to resemble human driving behaviours, which may have exaggerated dependence on eHMIs. This study asks: how would human-like AV kinematics modulate the influence of eHMIs on pedestrian behaviour? In a within-participant design, forty participants completed a cave-based pedestrian simulator experiment examining three deceleration profiles: (1) HH - human-like deceleration pattern and stopping distance; (2) AH - non-human-like deceleration pattern and human-like stopping distance (AH); (3) AA - non-human-like deceleration and stopping distance. The presence of eHMI was also manipulated. Dependent variables include Crossing Initiation Time (CIT), Perceived Safety (PS), Reaction Time to perceiving deceleration onset (RTdec) and Reaction Time to perceiving the eHMI (RTeHMI). Using Bayesian Multilevel Distributional Models, results showed that human-like behaviour (both HH and AH) led to shorter CIT, higher PS ratings compared to AA. HH and AH were largely similar, with only a subtle difference in RTdec. Due to the high saliency of eHMI, HH and AH showed slight additional improvements in CIT and PS compared to without. This study demonstrates that adopting human-like behaviours can substantially enhance AV-pedestrian interaction, without introducing the safety concerns often associated with eHMI, presenting a promising approach for AV communication.",

However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, many workplace interactions moved online, where the wearing of ancillary clothing was less commonplace. Here, using 208 employees at an Aerospace and Technology organisation based in the United Kingdom, we show that on average wearing ancillary clothing increased perceptions of occupationally positive attributes. However, we also found stark gender differences, with males rated, on average, as being higher in authority and confidence, and females higher in trustworthiness, regardless of ancillary clothing. Females wearing ancillary clothing denoting expertise were found to be perceived as having less authority and less confidence as males without ancillary clothing. These findings indicate that although ancillary clothing boost perceptions of organisational attributes, gender biases persist around authority, confidence and trustworthiness.",

          "abstract": "Mental health awareness efforts are increasing, especially for ADHD. There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders. Yet, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without simply reducing the awareness efforts. Thus, we developed a multi-faceted intervention, nocebo education, to reduce these harms; the intervention is based on the principles of the nocebo effect, i.e., the effect of negative expectations causing symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether this intervention could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms).   \nADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that being exposed to ADHD awareness reliably increases false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults for at least one week; a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating this harm. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. An additional analysis of real route sequences from 2012-2019 World Championships suggests that other factors, like height and weight, influence the use of some holds, but may not affect performance or the probability of adopting innovations. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

Prior research indicates that adolescents who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury orient more rapidly toward NSSI-related imagery and report heightened urges to self-injure after viewing such content. What remains unknown is how social stress shapes these attentional biases. In the present study, we tested whether experimentally induced ostracism modifies attention to NSSI images, urges to self-injure, and autonomic regulation in adolescents with recent NSSI.\nFifty adolescents who engaged in recent NSSI (M = 16.40 years, SD = 1.33) were randomized to inclusion vs. exclusion in an in-person ball-tossing ostracism paradigm and then completed free-viewing eye-tracking (with stimuli durations of 500/1000 ms) and dot-probe tasks (200/500 ms) that included NSSI images. NSSI urges, perceived stress, heart rate, and heart rate variability (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences, RMSSD) were assessed throughout the experiment.\nSocial exclusion produced sustained reductions in RMSSD relative to inclusion, with no reliable heart rate differences. During free-viewing, both groups preferentially fixated NSSI images, but exclusion reduced the probability of first fixations on NSSI. In the dot-probe task, exclusion amplified the slowing from congruent to incongruent trials for NSSI. After viewing NSSI images, both groups showed increased urges and stress, with larger increases after exclusion.\nAcute interpersonal rejection reorganized attention, dampening initial gaze capture yet impairing later disengagement, occurring in the context of vagal withdrawal. These dynamics may help explain how social stress potentiates NSSI risk in everyday digital environments and highlight interpersonal context and post-rejection coping as modifiable targets for intervention.\n\nTrial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register Identifier: DRKS00025905",

We investigated the severity and impact of cognitive and physical fatigue in Long COVID, exploring associations with autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress, underpinned by a novel framework integrating active inference and the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation.\n\nMethod\n\nOnline cross-sectional survey between November 2024 and September 2025. Adults with self-reported COVID-19 and ≥12 weeks of fatigue symptoms were recruited via convenience sampling and completed validated questionnaires assessing fatigue, autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress. Correlations and regression analyses examined associations between variables. \n\nResults\n\n183 participants completed the survey. Fatigue severity and impact were high, with physical fatigue rated more severe (Z = −2.96, p = .003) and impactful (Z = -8.714, p &lt; .001) than cognitive fatigue. Correlational analyses showed moderate-to-strong associations between fatigue and autonomic symptoms, interoception, illness perceptions and distress. In regression models, these variables explained 21–54% of variance in fatigue. Autonomic symptoms were positively associated with cognitive and physical fatigue. Depression was associated with cognitive fatigue. Illness perceptions were associated with physical, but not cognitive fatigue. Interoceptive sensibility showed both positive and negative associations with fatigue.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong COVID fatigue is severe and multifaceted. It involves a dynamic interplay between dysfunction in physiological systems, illness perceptions, and distress, with interactions varying across dimensions of fatigue. We propose a framework of interacting physiological and psychological factors that shape the prediction and processing of bodily signals, ultimately giving rise to fatigue.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents learn to navigate increasingly complex social environments, where flexible and efficient\ncognitive mechanisms are needed to behave adaptively. Prominent theories of cognitive maturation suggest\nthat adolescents’ decision-making is noisier than adults’ and that their decisions can be swayed by irrelevant\ninformation. By contrast, here, we suggest that cognitive development also allows them to increasingly use\ncombinatorial representations of social input. This manifests in emergent use of abstract social basis\nfunctions across adolescent development. Social basis functions represent combinations of individuals’\ninteractions (e.g., patterns of cooperation and competition) and allow for efficient information compression.\nIn a novel in-person group decision-making experiment with adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n =\n50), we confirmed a counterintuitive set of predictions derived from the basis function model: Adults made\nmore accurate decisions than adolescents, but, in parallel, they increasingly made a specific type of decision\nerror more frequently than adolescents. They ‘mixed up’ relevant and irrelevant players as a function of the\ngroup structure of the task. Using multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling, we show that the observed age\ndifferences are consistent with a stronger influence of the group structure during social decision-making in\nadults. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive development during adolescence involves\nfundamental shifts in the use of abstract social representations generally and in the use of combinatorial\nsocial basis functions in particular.",

DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status. Brief suicide prevention interventions may be warranted when treatment duration is uncertain, and targeted PTSD treatments should be offered when indicated.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive models, such as evidence-accumulation models, are increasingly used in individual differences research in psychology and neuroscience. By computing correlations between cognitive model parameters across participants, researchers aim to understand how the psychological processes the parameters represent relate to one another and jointly determine performance. It is generally acknowledged that cognitive models can be challenging to estimate due to strong within-subject correlations among the parameters, which are embedded in the model’s likelihood function. What is less often recognized, however, is that within-subject correlations can also distort correlations computed between parameters estimated with non-hierarchical methods, so they no longer reflect true individual differences, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. Here we illustrate this pitfall of non-hierarchical estimation and show how appropriately parameterized hierarchical models can mitigate the problem by effectively separating within- and between-subject sources of variation. We then offer recommendations for identifying and guarding against the inferential biases resulting from the strong within-subject correlations inherent in many cognitive models.",

          "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from frequency-tagging (FT) paradigms are widely used to investigate visual processing. Yet their association to conscious perception remains unclear. To test whether SSVEP occurs during conscious perception or without consciousness, 32 participants saw sequences of different images presented at 6 Hz (6 images per second) and containing faces every fifth image (1.2 Hz). All images were presented at either a face-categorisation-threshold contrast (1%) or a supraliminal contrast (1.5%). After each sequence, participants had to categorise the face gender (objective perception) and rate their confidence in this categorisation and the visibility of the faces (subjective perception). During the sequence presentation, participants’ attention was monitored via an orthogonal fixation-cross task. Results showed that, at 1.5% contrast, the face signal was higher during correct than during incorrect gender categorisation and increased linearly with both visibility and confidence ratings. In line with participants’ performance on the fixation-cross task, the signal collected at 6 Hz also indicated that attention related more closely to confidence than to visibility. At 1% contrast however, no face perception occurred behaviourally, which was confirmed by an absence of brain signal recorded in response to face instances. Overall these findings show that SSVEPs can track both the objective and subjective perception of faces at a supraliminal, hence conscious, contrast (1.5%). These findings bring new evidence that SSVEPs can be used as a marker of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly anxiety disorders. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and the inherent uncertainty associated with the disease, it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

Daily Growth is a digital parenting program designed to improve parent and child emotion regulation using an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) approach. Daily Growth sends twice-daily prompts and delivers 3-minute videos tailored to a recent parenting situation, offering two program types (Emotion Coaching; Active Play) to meet different parent preferences. EMI has been minimally tested with parenting programs. This pilot aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the EMI design and a prototype of Daily Growth, offering the two programs via 10 of 90 planned videos. \nMethods: A pilot randomised controlled trial recruited 189 Australian parents of children aged 2-4 years, randomised to either intervention (n=94) or active control (n=95). Participants completed a 25-minute online survey at baseline and 2 weeks post intervention. In the intervening 2 weeks, participants received twice-daily 1-minute pre-EMI surveys via email. Participants who reported any parent or child negative affect or emotion dysregulation received a resource. Participants in the intervention condition were randomised in the moment to receive a 3-minute Emotion Coaching or Active Play video, while participants in the control condition received a link to a parenting website. Participants were sent a 1-minute post-EMI survey. For both conditions, parenting support was tailored to one of five pre-defined parenting situations. \nResults: 71% of participants were retained to 2 weeks post survey, and over two thirds completed at least half of the daily pre-EMI surveys. Despite technical issues, most participants reported Daily Growth as easy to use (67%) and were satisfied with Daily Growth (60%), would recommend it to other parents (79%), and would use the skills learned (69%).\nConclusions: This pilot evaluated whether brief, tailored videos could engage parents in real time. Findings suggest the Daily Growth prototype was feasible and well received, supporting further implementation in a larger trial.",

Whether preschoolers reliably deploy relational reasoning remains debated, partly because behavioural measures provide only dichotomous outcomes (e.g., correct/incorrect).

Thirty-three 4–5-year-olds completed same/different judgments while their gaze patterns were continuously recorded. Children selected the relational match at levels that were significantly above chance performance. When children made relational choices, their gaze followed the sequence of an initial look to the relational match to establish alignment, a comparison of both alternatives, and a final return to the relational match to confirm the mapping, consistent with structure-mapping theory. The findings demonstrate that preschoolers can engage relational reasoning even when they do not express relational language and reveal the dynamic process that contributes to relational reasoning.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a new replication success classification framework for multi-lab replication studies that goes beyond the traditional binary distinction of replication success and failure. The framework distinguishes between true and false replication successes and failures, revealing the underlying composition of observed replication results and how they are shaped by study-level factors in both the original and replication studies. Using a large-scale simulation, we evaluated four meta-analytic Bayes factor (MABF) methods as tools for determining replication success within this framework. Results showed that the MABF methods were generally more effective at ruling out spurious effects than at confirming small true effects. The one-sided fixed-effect meta-analytic Bayes factor and the inclusion Bayes factor methods most reliably identified genuine replication success. The framework illustrates how bias and methodological choices influence the underlying composition of replication outcomes. These findings provide a more nuanced understanding of replication results and offer practical guidance for designing and evaluating future large-scale replication projects to strengthen research reproducibility.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice is one of the most effective strategies for enhancing long-term memory. Building on recent work (Shi &amp; Liu, 2025), we investigated error-driven learning (EDL) as a unified mechanistic account, which posits that memory improvement is shaped by two key signals: objective error—quantified as retrieval inaccuracy—and subjective error estimates, reflected in confidence judgments, which regulate how objective errors are processed. Using a continuous color-wheel paradigm with fMRI, this study examined the neural substrates of EDL and the modulatory role of confidence. Behaviorally, both larger objective error and lower confidence independently predicted greater subsequent memory improvement. Neurally, analyses of univariate activation, functional connectivity, and multivoxel pattern similarity revealed two dissociable yet interacting systems gated by confidence: Memory-related circuits, such as functional connectivity between the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus, were preferentially engaged under low confidence, leveraging objective retrieval errors to drive memory updating. In contrast, metamemory-related regions—including the striatum, thalamus, and supramarginal gyrus—were recruited under high confidence to process prediction errors elicited by unexpected retrieval failures. Together, these findings demonstrate how confidence dynamically regulates the recruitment of distinct neural circuits in support of retrieval-based learning, offering broad implications for educational interventions and memory rehabilitation.",

This review synthesizes the large and diverse literature on action semantics in individuals with neurological disorders characterized by prominent motor deficits (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), as well as those for whom motor deficits are often less prominent (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, stroke). Research in these two groups of disorders is strikingly “siloed” and offers many contradictory findings with respect to whether action semantic representations are abstract (i.e., “disembodied”) or grounded in sensory and motor features that reflect the way knowledge was acquired. Findings across these populations also disagree as to whether action semantic representations are organized somatotopically or with a semantic feature-based architecture, and mediated by anterior motor-related or relatively posterior sensory-related brain regions. Many of these disparate findings can be reconciled with consideration of a multidimensional, multimodal representational architecture mediated by a distributed left-lateralized network of brain regions. We provide suggestions for specific methodological approaches for research with neurological populations that may further our understanding of the format, organization, and neural substrates of action semantics.",

Children’s symbolic counting skills (i.e., acquisition of the cardinal principle) predicted this shift across two studies, even when accounting for approximate number acuity and symbolic and non-symbolic understanding of null sets, though this effect emerged only for children’s tolerance of selfish sharing—most forms of generous sharing were tolerated regardless of numerical abilities. Our results suggest a developmental shift from an abstract notion of learning to an increasingly precise notion of equality as children acquire symbolic counting skills.",

Existing evidence-based sleep treatments are effective but remain largely inaccessible for this age group. Young people also have lower agency over structural barriers affecting sleep (e.g., home environment, school start times).\n\nMethods: Project Sleep is a digital single-session intervention (SSI) designed with feedback from young people. Participants were aged 13-25 with self-reported sleep problems (N=759, Mage=18.7; 48% white, 81% girls, 38% LGBTQ+). Structural sleep barriers were reported by 45%: uncomfortable temperature (20%), exceess noise (17%), shared rooms (13%), excess light (10%), nighttime workers in the home (7%), unstable living conditions (2%). Participants rated perceived importance of sleep and making a change to sleep, readiness for change, and perceived control over sleep pre- and post-SSI. Moderation models assessed whether structural factors influenced outcomes. T-tests and correlations tested whether participants’ feedback differed by structural barriers. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults: After adjusting for multiple comparisons, those experiencing structural barriers improved similarly to peers on all pre/post-SSI change metrics (corrected ps &gt; .05). There were also no differences in participants’ feedback about their experience of the SSI by structural barrier (ps &gt; .05).\n\nConclusions: This brief, accessible SSI provides proximal support for youth with structural sleep barriers.

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood adversity is common and linked to negative physical and mental outcomes. Women, especially those with neurodevelopmental conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at heightened risk for greater adversity exposure and more severe long-term outcomes. A dimensional model of adversity differentiates threat-related adversity (e.g., abuse, violence) from deprivation-related adversity (e.g., neglect, household dysfunction), which may have distinct developmental impacts. This study examined whether adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in a longitudinal cohort of women with and without childhood ADHD could be separated into threat and deprivation dimensions, and whether these dimensions differentially predict young adult outcomes.\nMethods: Participants were drawn from a 25-year longitudinal study of 228 girls (140 with childhood ADHD, 88 without). In young adulthood (mean age ~25), participants reported on 10 ACEs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to derive threat and deprivation components of adversity. Regression models tested each component’s associations with adult psychopathology (internalizing and externalizing symptom composites) and academic achievement, controlling for childhood ADHD diagnosis and baseline symptom levels.\nResults: PCA identified two adversity components corresponding to threat and deprivation, consistent with theory. This two-factor structure held for both the ADHD and comparison groups. Women with childhood ADHD reported higher overall ACE exposure than those without ADHD. Higher threat scores uniquely predicted greater young adult internalizing and externalizing symptoms even after accounting for childhood symptom levels and ADHD status. In contrast, deprivation scores were not uniquely associated with these mental health outcomes in combined models, and neither adversity dimension significantly predicted adult academic performance.\nConclusions: Distinct dimensions of childhood adversity can be identified and have different predictive relevance. Threat-related adversities in particular conferred persistent risk for psychopathology into early adulthood beyond prior vulnerabilities. Findings point to the importance of trauma-informed interventions and support a dimensional approach to adversity in clinical practice and developmental psychopathology research.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between social media use and mental health is of great public health concern. Studies so far, largely employing self-reported measures of social media use, have produced inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of social media on mental health. Focusing on objective behavioral markers and the psychological mechanisms underlying how users interact with social media platforms could be key to greater insight on this topic. Here we use Twitter data to study how depression modulates a central behavioral process on social media: the response to the social rewards (e.g. likes, shares, views) users receive when they post. Reinforcement learning theory predicts that social media rewards will reinforce posting behavior, such that receiving more likes will lead to posting more frequently and spending more time on the platform. However, laboratory tasks often show blunted reinforcement learning in depression, suggesting a potential attenuation of the effects of social rewards on posting behavior. Across 3 datasets with varied measures of depression and data collection strategies (over 17 million tweets from 7,736 users in total, including a pre-registered replication), we consistently found that depression was associated with a larger reinforcing effect of likes on posting on the next day. In other words, users with depression showed heightened sensitivity to social media rewards, in contrast to findings from laboratory-based tasks. These results identify a psychological mechanism that may link social media use to poor mental health, and underscore the importance of testing the generalizability of in-lab computational psychiatry findings to real-world environments.",

          "authors": "David Herdman; William Sedley; Toby Ellmers; Sanjay Manohar; Karl Friston; Diego Kaski",
          "abstract": "Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD) is a common and disabling chronic disorder, comprising core symptom clusters involving perceived (i.e., subjective) unsteadiness during upright posture and intolerance for self- and visual motion. There are diagnostic criteria, conceptual models and therapeutic approaches to managing specific components of PPPD, such as physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and anti-depressant medication. However, no diagnostic tests or unifying neurobiological basis for the condition exists. PPPD has been viewed as a subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), sharing some similarities in altered brain function and behaviour, but lacks other hallmarks of FND. Here, using the framework of Active Inference - in which both action and perception are based on internal predictions about the state of the body and the world and their precision (estimated reliability) - we define a singular neurobiological process responsible for core PPPD symptoms: namely, a failure to attenuate precision-weighted prediction error (PWPE) during self-motion, leading to subjective postural instability. Specifically, self-motion prediction errors per se are not increased, but their precision weighting is, thereby reducing the relative precision of self-motion predictions. More simply, this reflects a shift of operating mode from top-down, efficient ‘autopilot’ to a ‘feedback’ mode, dominated by bottom-up sensory processing errors. Ordinarily, experience-dependent learning naturally produces a drift to the autopilot mode, but we present four processes - each potentially present in any individual and characterised by a positive feedback loop - that keep the system stuck in a feedback mode, resulting in PPPD: elevated attention/vigilance; perceptual inferences of imbalance; preventative or corrective movement behaviours; and over-reliance on visual inputs. This model can form the basis of tools for clinical assessment and management. Finally, the foundation of our model – on defined and measurable neurobiological processes – affords testable hypotheses for investigative work and lends itself to computational modelling. A modified version of the model can also explain other forms of chronic dizziness without structural causes, like Mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS), or ‘unexplained dizziness’ in later life.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces the state of being theory of happiness, a humanistic framework that\ndefines happiness as an intrinsic condition of inner connection and coherence that is present\nbeneath thoughts, emotions, and experiences. It builds upon the growing consensus among\nresearchers that happiness reflects a unitive and holistic phenomenon. The theory is grounded\nin a mixed-method study of 497 survey responses across a broad, global demographic and 18\nin-depth interviews of individuals reporting high levels of happiness. High degrees of\ncorrelation were found between happiness and qualities associated with self-transcendence,\nincluding presence, a felt unity with life, and emotional equilibrium. Qualitative data\nsupported these findings, with participants frequently describing happiness as a feeling or\nsense of contentment, connection, and alignment with life, expressed as feelings of peace and\njoy. The theory proposes that happiness arises when ego-based striving diminishes, and\nindividuals reconnect with an expanded sense of self, a broader, more inclusive identity\nmarked by inner coherence, felt connection, and reduced identification with the ego. It builds\non existing psychological models by illuminating the inner, experiential structure of\npsychological well-being. It has important implications for psychological theory, clinical\npractice, and well-being research.",

          "abstract": "Prediction error during memory reactivation is posited to be a key driver of memory updating. However, prediction error leads to varied memory outcomes, and it is unclear what specific factors influence memory malleability. Two factors have long been theorized to shape a memory’s susceptibility to modification – the age and strength of the memory at reactivation – but their interaction with prediction error has not been directly tested in complex, naturalistic events. In a three-session paradigm using short videos with salient action–outcome narratives, we elicited prediction error by interrupting expected outcome endings during reactivation. Following reactivation, participants viewed semantically similar videos introducing new information that could be incorporated into an updated memory. Memory age was manipulated by varying the delay between encoding and reactivation (1h, 24h, or 2w), and memory strength was measured with participants’ ratings of recollection quality after each video reactivation. We found that prediction error at reactivation selectively increased the intrusion of newly experienced information for weak, but not strong, memories at reactivation. In contrast, the age of a memory at reactivation neither interacted with prediction error nor influenced memory outcomes. These findings identify memory strength, not age, as the critical boundary condition for prediction error driven memory updating in human episodic memory.",

SPS correlated positively with the ADHD-related strengths of hyperfocus and cognitive flexibility, and the SPS aesthetic sensitivity subdimension additionally with curiosity, humour, and empathy; these associations remained significant correcting for ADHD traits.

          "abstract": "Prospective memory (PM) offloading -- setting reminders to support future intentions -- can help older adults mitigate age-related memory declines. However, prior research suggests they may not always fully benefit from available reminders. This study examined metacognitive factors influence age differences in PM offloading across three within-subjects conditions: forced internal (reminders set for no PM targets), forced external (reminders set for all PM targets), and choice (target-by-target reminder setting). Metacognitive monitoring was measured through judgments of learning that estimated how accurately participants believed they would remember the targets without reminders. Metacognitive control was indexed by the proportion of targets for which reminders were set in the choice block and by the frequency of reminder checking during retrieval, recorded via eye tracking. Although reminders improved PM, age-related declines in PM performance were not reduced in the forced or choice conditions. Older adults were overconfident in their performance predictions across all conditions (metacognitive monitoring error). They also did not set or check reminders more frequently than younger adults, despite having more to gain from doing so (metacognitive control error). These findings suggest that metacognitive errors may limit older adults' ability to fully capitalize on offloading strategies.",

          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

However, the mitigating effect of loopholes may not hold if they are used to dodge a moral obligation. Here, we replicated the finding that loopholes are less costly than non-compliance in neutral contexts, but found that loopholes were as bad as non-compliance in moral contexts (Experiment 1, N = 360). We then directly compared the behaviors to see if, in moral contexts, exploiting a loophole might be even worse than non-compliance (Experiment 2, N=150). We replicated the finding that loopholes are more exonerating in neutral than moral contexts, and that moral context has a differential effect, but did not find a reversal (Experiment 2, N=150). Finally, we assessed three negative indirect costs of loopholes (blame, permissibility, and offense) and again found a differential effect of moral context (Experiment 3, N = 453). We discuss why using loopholes in moral violations may be uniquely unacceptable.",

          "abstract": "Arbitrary social hierarchies permeate our working lives in ways not always visible, introducing anti-egalitarian norms which stymie productivity. Reviewing bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We contend that the literatures converge on a single, sobering logic: because organizations are embedded in—and seek legitimacy from—broader socio-historical contexts, the same arbitrary hierarchies that stratify societies are naturally imported into organizational life. At the same time, individuals are motivated to obscure the influence of these hierarchies to reduce psychological distress. We leverage institutional theory and systems psychodynamics to map how organizations are at the crux of external pressures (from society) and upward pressure (from employees) which both perpetuate and obfuscate the replication of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in organizations. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the commonplace or subtle nature of the microaggression to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – anti-egalitarian organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of anti-egalitarian hierarchies in their workplace.",

However, daily processes related to conflict and positive and negative affect have been overlooked. We tested the mutual effects between parent-adolescent conflict and affect in daily life. Parent-adolescent dyads (N = 171) completed daily diaries between 14 to 21 days to rate their positive and negative affect, and conflict interactions between October 2021 and August 2023. The participants were mostly from families with high socioeconomic status, most of the parents were biological mothers, and over half of the parents were Caucasian. Adolescents were between 13 and 17 years (M = 14.37, SD = 1.28). We tested the daily associations between negative/positive affect and conflict interactions in one dynamic structural equation model (DSEM). Contrary to our expectations, greater adolescent negative affect on a day was associated with lower parent-reported conflict next day. Further, both within- and between-family level correlations between adolescent and parent negative and positive affect were significant. Greater parent and adolescent conflict was related to lower positive and greater negative affect for parents and adolescents. Thus, while both same-day and mean-level associations over time indicate that conflicts are linked to poorer affective well-being, and parents may have made efforts to improve their affect the following day in an attempt to compensate for the conflicts experienced the day before. Further, this effort was appeared to be driven by the adolescents’ rather than the parents’ emotional experiences.",

These structural dynamics pose a challenge: How do we decide what asset to invest in and when to divest from an underperforming asset? In this paper, we propose a normative model of asset selection and switching. We hypothesize that people use Bayesian function learning to infer invariant, structural parameters underlying changes in asset performance, and choose assets based on forecasted final performances at a task-specific time horizon. We test the model in four experiments ($N = 460$) that manipulate the setup (selection versus switching), time horizons, and statistical properties of asset performance trajectories. The Bayesian forecasting model consistently outperforms myopic alternatives inspired by foraging and study time allocation, which instead assume direct continuation of recent observations and rely solely on them. Our results highlight a distinctive form of future-looking cognition: humans anticipate how their own actions will shape future asset performance, and draw on representations of underlying structural dynamics to inform their current choices. The Bayesian probabilistic forecasting model therefore offers a principled computational account of how humans make decisions with lasting consequences.",

While commercial operant boxes offer standardized designs and software for immediate use, they come with significant drawbacks, including high start-up and maintenance costs, limited software flexibility, restricted experimental design options, time-intensive daily operation, and rigid data structures. The constraints posed by commercial operant boxes have constrained the scope and applications of animal research for decades. Custom-made operant boxes combat these limitations but historically have only been accessible to labs with dedicated engineering expertise and/or high budgets. The rise of accessible consumer electronic technologies like Raspberry Pi microcomputers, open-source software, and advanced search and inference tools (e.g., large language models) has made it feasible for non-experts to create cost-effective, customizable operant boxes. Recent projects have laid out their own blueprint designs for affordable open-source operant boxes, but many of these are simply proof-of-concept or isolated to specific experimental applications. We outline key considerations for custom designing versatile, low-cost, and robust multi-operant box systems by discussing our designs for a Raspberry Pi-powered pigeon operant box, equipped with touchscreen capabilities and modular stimulus control. This system features components sourced online, requires no specialized tools/skills (e.g., no soldering or intensive software for hardware interaction), and obviates the need for extended electrical engineering knowledge. Utilized hardware and software systems are highly adaptable, enabling precise customization for a wide range of tasks, behaviors, and experimental organisms. We also provide a streamlined framework for implementing cloud connectivity, version-controlled code design, automated data synchronization across multiple boxes using modern cloud platforms, and scalability for larger or smaller systems. Furthermore, this system costs a fraction (approximately 4%) of commercial alternatives. Our system's versatility is demonstrated through its application to diverse behavioral studies in pigeons, rats, humans, and even plants. Finally, we explore the integration of large language models for software development and troubleshooting, highlighting their potential to further simplify and enhance custom operant box systems.",

Data set 1 consisted of 8 published studies (N1 = 264) using differential fear conditioning with partial reinforcement (50%), and novel data set 2 (N2 = 29) parametrically varied US probability (20%/50%/80%). Across both data sets, all data modalities showed differential response to the US compared to US omission. In data set 1, there was evidence for responses to unexpected US omission in all modalities, but no responses were consistent with signed PE encoding. Similarly, data set 2 provided no evidence that US or US omission responses scaled with outcome probability, which is incompatible with PE encoding.

          "abstract": "Mental health and wellbeing are core components of a healthy life. However, emotional stress and mental health problems are on the rise through societies and cause a significant burden of suffering. In the following, we present our watershed framework for optimizing wellbeing and mental health through lifestyle interventions. Emerging evidence also shows that mental health is an important determinant of quality of life. In addition, it may also be a driver of longevity, influencing health outcomes and, ultimately, the overall healthspan. This framework is based on the recognition that mental health is comprised of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that the factors have interdependent relationships amongst them, so that positive changes in one of them can have cascading effects on the others, with the potential to improve the psychological capital of an individual. Our framework consists of nine elements that we consider hallmarks of mental health and wellbeing, structured in three interdependent layers. The first layer is formed by foundational factors, which are essential for wellbeing and mental health, including circadian rhythms and sleep recovery, along with social connections. The second layer, named wellbeing catalysts, encompasses elements of wellbeing that can have powerful positive effects on mental health, including stress resilience, vitality, cardiovascular health, immune health, and the gut-brain axis. The third layer, named as thriving factors, consists of cognitive performance and positive emotions, which are the elements most often associated with a thriving mind. In our framework, we highlight the interactions between the factors and provide a roadmap to structure comprehensive lifestyle interventions aimed at optimizing mental health and wellbeing. Strengthening mental health and wellbeing addresses key biological and behavioral determinants of healthy aging, which are increasingly recognized as critical modulators of longevity trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to reshape school psychology, with report writing as a primary area of impact. A national sample of school psychologists using AI at work (n = 100) reported on its role in documentation. Of those using AI for report writing (n = 45), most applied it to discrete tasks such as rewriting sections for clarity (69%) or generating recommendations (67%). Far fewer used AI for interpretive or diagnostic purposes, and none relied on it to generate entire reports. Nearly all users (94%) edited AI-generated content before use. On average, practitioners who used AI for report writing saved 6.3 hours per week (95% CI: 4.6–8.1), more than double the savings of those using AI for other tasks (≈3 hours). AI shows promise for reducing documentation burden and reclaiming time for direct services, though its use raises ethical concerns requiring further guidance and oversight.",

          "authors": "Catherine Culot; Joran Engelschenschilt; Sarah Garfinkel; Wim Gevers; Wim Notebaert",
          "abstract": "According to Fechner’s law, perceived sensations increase logarithmically with stimulus intensity. In the context of exercise, rising physical effort is therefore accompanied by increasingly salient bodily signals such as heart rate. Interoception, the sensing of internal bodily states, supports adaptive responses to these changing demands, for instance, by guiding the regulation of exertion. Beyond physical regulation, interoceptive signals have also been proposed to inform higher-order monitoring processes, such as error detection. Yet it remains unclear whether acute exercise sharpens cardiac interoception and whether enhanced access to bodily signals translates into greater awareness of errors. In a within-subject design, 36 healthy adults completed two tasks while cycling at low versus moderate intensity: a Heart Rate Discrimination Task assessing cardiac interoceptive accuracy and insight, and a Go/No-Go task measuring error awareness through post-error reports. Moderate effort selectively improved interoceptive accuracy (threshold closer to true heart rate), without changes in precision of lapse rate. Physical effort also made participants more confident in their interoceptive judgments, but this confidence increase was unrelated to actual accuracy. In the Go/No-Go task, commission errors were more frequent during cycling, yet the proportion of consciously detected errors was unaffected. Interoceptive performance did not reliably predict error awareness. These results indicate that acute exercise recalibrates cardiac interoception, likely by enhancing the salience of afferent signals, but does not strengthen higher-order monitoring of action. Error-related cardiac responses may thus reflect affective or orienting processes rather than a causal basis for awareness.",

          "abstract": "Human decision-making plays a critical role in distinguishing real from artificially-generated synthetic content. These decisions are particularly important when classifying faces and voices due to the rich personal and social information that they hold, meaning synthetic faces and voices, commonly known as \"deepfakes\" are frequently used for identity theft, financial fraud, and misinformation campaigns. It is currently unknown whether detection of real versus synthetic content is modality-specific, or whether it generalizes across sensory domains. We conducted a preregistered study in which participants classified real and AI-generated synthetic faces and voices. Overall classification accuracy was 65% for faces and 54% for voices. Using signal detection theory to analyze individuals' ability to classify stimuli, we observed no evidence of a domain-general effect, indicating that detection ability may not generalize across face and voice domains and is instead, domain-specific. Participants' confidence tracked accuracy for faces but not for voices, suggesting that metacognitive insight may also be modality-specific. Findings are discussed in terms of whether detection of synthetic content is underpinned by its own cognitive and social mechanisms, or whether classification is driven purely by domain-specific abilities. In applied settings, including forensic, legal, and security, it is vital to recognize that expertise in detecting synthetic content might be modality specific.",

          "authors": "Lisanne Schroer; Rianne Kok",
          "abstract": "Many parents lie to their children. Because prominent socialization theories hypothesize that children learn about lying via parental modeling of lying or honesty, it is important to examine whether parental lying affects children’s lying behavior. While there is empirical evidence for the modeling effect of lying by an experimenter on child’s lying, a modeling effect has never been studied in parent-child dyads. The current preregistered study is the first to manipulate parental lying to examine its effects on children’s polite lying. Parents (n = 105) were randomly assigned to a lie- or truth-condition where they told a polite lie or the truth about a drawing of an experimenter in front of their child. Polite lying of their 4- to 8-year-old was subsequently assessed in the disappointing gift paradigm where children received an undesired gift from the same experimenter. Our results demonstrated no effect of parental modeling of lying or honesty on child’s polite lying. The results are discussed in context of parent-child history of interactions, the societal norms around polite lying, and socialization messages conveyed from parental modeling. Although we do not find evidence for a direct effect of parental modeling of polite lying on child polite lying, future research is warranted to explore the effect of parental modeling on child lying in alternative experimental designs, the potential effect of parental modeling of lying for other types of lies and beyond the experimental context.",

          "abstract": "In controversial ethical issues professional obligations may conflict with personal values. Actors may assume roles that do not correspond with their personal values.  We examined actors in the theater play \"Gott\" by Ferdinand von Schirach dealing with assisted suicide. We investigated how actors perceive the arguments, identify with their roles, and deal with role conflicts. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the complete cast of a production of “Gott” in Switzerland and used qualitative content analysis to answer our research questions. Articulating arguments positively influenced actors' perceived attitudes toward assisted suicide, aiding in the formation of their own stance, and shifting their perceptions of affected individuals. In contrast, one actress whose role did not produce arguments had difficulties forming her attitude. Being unable to form an attitude can lead to moral distress. Identification with the roles was highly individual, but most actors identified with their roles. Unlike prior work that assumed negative effects of complete role identification on actors, we demonstrated that experienced actors can maintain psychological boundaries while engaging deeply with complex moral narratives.",

          "abstract": "A necessary prerequisite for the accumulation of beneficial knowledge, or ‘cumulative cultural evolution’, is the sharing of information via social learning. Yet little work in the field of cultural evolution has examined the mechanisms that support information sharing in the face of exploitative information free-riding and information hoarding. We ran a series of online interactive experiments (N = 716) combined with computational reinforcement and social learning models to test whether the mechanism of reputation-based partner choice can effectively support information sharing. Participants in groups chose whether to (i) engage in costly innovation and (ii) whether to share the resultant knowledge. Sharers received increased reputations for sharing and participants could use reputations to select recipients of knowledge. Study 1 found, in participants from the UK and China, high levels of information sharing but only weak partner choice. Study 2 replicated this finding with various methodological improvements. Study 3 showed that participants used partner choice to exclude non-sharing artificial bots from receiving information. Study 4 found that when partner choice was impossible, preferences for information sharing declined to levels comparable to non-sharing. Overall, our findings provide tentative positive experimental evidence that partner choice can facilitate information sharing and enable cumulative cultural evolution.",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we used an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model was applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learned to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results showed that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

It argues for a shift from an emphasis on universality towards a focus on variation.

          "abstract": "Healthy individuals typically update their self-beliefs more in response to desirable than to undesirable social feedback. While this positivity bias is well-documented in real-life interactions, it remains unknown whether merely simulating social feedback elicits a similar effect and how the subjective realism of such simulated experiences influences self-belief updating. In two online studies (exploratory pilot n=37; preregistered replication n=85), participants rated themselves and an average person on personality traits both before and after vividly imagining receiving desirable or undesirable social feedback. They also rated how realistic each simulated feedback felt. Using linear mixed-effects modeling, the preregistered replication confirmed that mental simulation alone can elicit positively biased self-belief updating: participants integrated simulated desirable feedback more than undesirable feedback. Notably, this positivity bias reversed when updating beliefs about an average person, underscoring the self-specific nature of this cognitive phenomenon. Critically, simulated desirable feedback was perceived as more realistic than undesirable feedback—particularly when directed at the self—and this heightened realism reliably predicted the extent of belief revision. Together, our findings uncover mental simulation and subjective realism as key cognitive mechanisms underpinning asymmetric self-belief updating, shedding light on how simulated experiences shape self-perception—with broad implications for cognition, motivation, and psychological well-being.",

In non-autistic individuals, increased synchrony adversely affects self-regulation abilities. Yet, synchronization in autistic individuals has primarily been examined in conversational contexts. Methods: In this study, 33 autistic and 33 non-autistic adults performed a dyadic movement task in which participants were asked to “have a conversation without words”, only by improvising movements. Using an inertial sensor-based motion channel system, we investigated interpersonal synchrony. Results: Our findings indicated that autistic, non-autistic, and mixed dyads exhibited consistent levels of synchronization. Although all three dyad groups exhibited a reduction in negative affect after the task, positive affect increased solely for the non-autistic participants. Furthermore, all three dyads exhibited enhanced self-regulation, albeit to a lesser extent among the non-autistic participants. Conclusion: Our results indicate that when interpersonal synchronization is assessed during spontaneous whole-body movements rather than verbal conversations, autistic persons may synchronize to the same degree as non-autistic dyads, regardless of whether they interact with another autistic or non-autistic person.",

This study aimed to adapt the Inventory of Climate Emotions (ICE) into Turkish and to examine the associations between climate emotions, pro-environmental behaviors, and subjective well-being. Data from 330 participants (Nwomen = 215), aged 18 years or older were analyzed. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the original eight-factor structure with acceptable model fit, and the Turkish version demonstrated strong reliability and validity. All emotions except powerlessness correlated with emotional affinity toward nature, supporting convergent validity, while distinct associations with affective reactivity confirmed divergent validity. Climate anger, sorrow, anxiety, and enthusiasm were positively associated with pro-climate behaviors, while contempt showed negative associations across all behavioral measures. Gender differences largely aligned with previous findings, with women reporting higher levels of most emotions except contempt. The relationship between climate emotions and well-being showed nuanced associations: contempt correlated negatively with well-being, whereas anger, anxiety, and sorrow showed small positive correlations. These findings indicate that climate emotions are multidimensional constructs that reflect both adaptive and motivational processes, and the Turkish ICE provides a robust instrument for future cross-cultural research on the psychological dimensions of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Life-course scholarship has documented the important role of educational aspirations in status attainment processes but has also revealed that parent-child mismatches in educational aspirations may negatively affect child development. However, it is unclear how parent-child mismatches in educational aspirations evolve over time. Here, we examine (1) the prevalence of mismatching aspirations across school grades 3–9 (ages 8–15), (2) their stability over time, and (3) whether converging aspirations tend to converge to parents’ or to children’s aspirations. We also investigate (4) whether parent-child mismatches in aspirations depend on the opportunities that a child is afforded in an education system that sorts pupils into distinct tracks, thus shaping educational trajectories and final educational attainment. We use data from two German National Educational Panel Study cohorts (“kindergarten cohort”: N=4,217; “5th grade cohort”: N=3,908). Findings indicate that in school grade 3, 30% of parent-child dyads have mismatching aspirations; this percentage shrinks to 14-22% across grades 4–9. Mismatching aspirations are relatively instable, indeed much less stable over time than matching aspirations. Among younger children, aspirations mostly converge to their parents’ aspirations. Among older children, aspirations tend to converge in both directions. We also find that parent-child mismatches in aspirations vary considerably according to the educational track that the child ends up attending in secondary school. We conclude that parents and children incorporate the educational opportunities afforded to the child into their aspirations; aspiration mismatches evolve over time and as a result of institutional influences.",

          "abstract": "Latent state-trait (LST) models have a long tradition in psychological research and are widely applied to panel and intensive longitudinal data. They decompose observed responses into stable trait and fluctuating state components and allow for modeling systematic trait change over time, consistent with a dynamic view of personality and affect. Distinct forms of trait change---additive, multiplicative, or dynamic---are captured by specific model parameters, and moderated nonlinear LST models further extend this framework by including time-varying treatments and confounders. However, standard LST models are not inherently causal. They cannot validly estimate the joint effects of recurring events such as unemployment, therapy sessions, or daily stressors when treatment-confounder feedback is present. We introduce a causal extension of moderated nonlinear LST models that integrates inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). This approach accounts for time-varying treatments and confounders and enables consistent estimation of causal effects on trait change parameters. The method is demonstrated using 30-day intensive longitudinal data on positive affect and evaluated through a simulation study. The proposed model enhances the causal interpretability of LST analyses and provides a general framework for studying dynamic trait change processes under time-varying causal conditions.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancements of generative AI (GenAI) technologies have brought the issue of data manipulation to a whole new level. Now individuals can easily create highly realistic fabricated media, including videos, audio, and images, that are increasingly difficult to detect. These developments raise broad societal concerns, particularly in legal contexts, where authenticity of evidence is central to ensuring fairness. This review links documented legal cases to psychological research on memory distortion and false confessions to explore how AI-generated evidence affects individuals’ perception and sense of self and the consequences in a legal context. Decades of research have shown that memory’s vulnerability to suggestion, especially highlighting the power of personalized misinformation. Even in the pre-AI era, studies have shown how false memories have been induced using suggestion and simple media manipulations and how these have led to false confessions. GenAI adds another level of concern, yet no research directly examines its potential to distort memory and to elicit false confessions. This paper identifies urgent questions: How does AI-generated evidence impact memory? How can individuals ensure authenticity of the evidence confronting them? And how can legal systems prepare for the erosion of trust brought upon by this uncertainty? Proposed solutions like watermarking and implementation of authenticity protocols offer partial relief; however, the rapid advancements make sure that no definitive safeguards can be implemented. Understanding how GenAI interacts with our memory vulnerabilities is critical not only for legal psychology but for safeguarding the integrity of justice in today’s digitally mediated society.\n\nKeywords: Generative AI, deepfakes, memory distortion, legal psychology, false confessions, trust in evidence",

          "abstract": "A major theoretical question in psychology is how recognition memory can be understood in terms of latent variables reflecting underlying familiarity and response criteria. To address this, we investigate the viability of a shift representable signal detection model in which the shape of the familiarity distribution is the same for all old and new items. We present a new technique for fitting such models to recognition memory data using only ordinal properties of these data based on the monotonic linear regression algorithm described by Dunn and Anderson (Psychological Methods, 2024). We apply this methodology to analyze the results of three recognition memory experiments that vary the number of study presentations, study-test modality, focused vs. divided attention, and instructions to read study items or to generate them from cues. In each case, the data are well-described by a shift representable model with a recovered distributional form that has a negative skew that approximates the minimum extreme value, or Gumbel, distribution. We propose that if these results can be generalized across different experiments, it becomes possible to define a standard unit of measurement of familiarity that will enable direct comparisons to be made across different experiments and conditions. We discuss the implications of these results for current models of memory and for future application of our approach to other domains.",

First, we examine how group members collectively appraise situations as threatening, including through group discussions. Second, we identify factors that explain perceptions of threat severity. Third, we review predictors and moderators of responses to identify the conditions that help predict when and how groups and group members react in specific ways. Evidence shows that perceived intergroup threats often lead to negative outcomes such as polarization and negative emotions, while fostering positive intragroup effects. In contrast, perceived intragroup threats, while emotionally challenging and potentially weakening the ingroup, may improve intergroup relations. We synthesise the evidence into a framework that explains how groups appraise and respond to perceived intergroup and intragroup threats.",

          "authors": "Jennifer Trujillo; Isabella Faith Avalos; Bo Yeong Won",
          "abstract": "Our environment is saturated with different types of distractions, yet digital distractions have emerged as some of the most prevalent in modern education, particularly for college students who are constantly interrupted by digital distractions while trying to focus on their academic workload. These distractions, ranging from smartphone notifications to multitasking on multiple devices, can detract from academic pursuits and lead to decreased academic performance. Our attention is limited and scarce, so the ability to suppress such distractions is crucial for academic success. This study aims to investigate the relationship between individual differences in engagement with digital distractions and performance on an attentional suppression task, as well as their impact on grade point average (GPA). Specifically, we assessed whether engaging in digital distractions, as measured by the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS), along with the ability to ignore distractors in favor of target stimuli, affect academic outcomes like GPA. We hypothesized that individuals who were more susceptible to digital distractions and who were less efficient in attentional suppression tasks would exhibit lower GPAs compared to their counterparts who manage distractions better. The analysis investigated how SDS scores and performance on an attentional suppression task collectively predict GPA among college students. Surprisingly, there was no significant relationship between SDS scores and performance on the attentional suppression task, nor between SDS scores and GPA. While this study contributes to the growing literature on how digital distractions influence students’ academic focus and offers guidance for supporting academic performance in the face of widespread digital interruptions, the findings also suggest that real-world distraction may be driven by more complex mechanisms than cognitive distractor suppression alone.",

          "abstract": "This review systematically investigated preregistered studies concerning extra-sensory perception (ESP) and mind-matter interaction (micro psychokinesis, PK). The primary aims were to evaluate their outcomes and compare the percentage of positive findings with those observed in mainstream psychology. Our methodology adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. We searched major preregistration repositories, including the Open Science Framework and the Koestler Parapsychology Unit (KPU) Study Registry, and relevant meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria focused on completed studies with available preregistration and final results only for confirmatory hypotheses. A positive outcome was defined as the support of at least one confirmatory hypothesis, strictly following preregistered procedures and statistics without deviation. A total of 46 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 17 studies (36.9%) reported a positive outcome. Interestingly, and contrary to some expectations, a broader comparison indicated that preregistered studies concerning ESP and PK did not necessarily exhibit a much lower proportion of confirmed hypotheses when compared to results for preregistered studies in mainstream psychology.",

However, such tasks poorly characterise the quality of experience, or qualia, for short. To characterise attentional effects on qualia, we combined a dual-task attention paradigm with similarity rating tasks to examine whether relational structures of qualia are altered by top-down attentional amplification. Under the same physical input, withdrawing attention collapsed the structures of qualia of letters (N=14) and red/green bisected disks (N=14), but not of faces (N=13), as quantified via a novel unsupervised optimal transport alignment technique. Alignment accuracy was high for face qualia structures obtained under the fully versus poorly attended conditions but not for the letters and disks. Our novel approach that combines similarity ratings, quantitative alignment and attentional perturbation is a powerful new approach to elucidate the structural properties of consciousness.",

However, it remains unclear how traits, states, and interpersonal perceptions interact to shape everyday social experiences – and for whom their interactions are most consequential. Addressing this gap is critical for advancing personality-in-context models and identifying mechanisms underlying deficits in interpersonal functioning. A two-week Ecological Momentary Assessment was conducted with 136 participants (N = 3,991 social interactions), who reported on motivational states, partner perceptions, and interaction preferences. The combined model integrating traits, states, and perceptions best predicted interaction preferences. Higher approach-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted increased interaction preference, whereas avoidance-related traits, states, and perceptions predicted lower interaction preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that maladaptive interpersonal functioning amplified the negative effects of avoidance trait and state motives on social evaluations. Integrating trait and state perspectives offers valuable insights for understanding social functioning, particularly in individuals at risk for interpersonal difficulties.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent digital experiences are highly regulated today by opaque algorithms that prioritize engagement over well-being, thereby creating a structural mismatch that negatively impacts mental health through exploitation of key developmental vulnerabilities. This opinion paper argues that traditional digital and media literacies are insufficient to address this challenge. We propose Algorithmic Literacy—a critical understanding of how algorithmic systems select, personalize, and influence online content and user behavior—as a distinct and essential competency for adolescents. The paper outlines how such algorithms can impair stress regulation, distort authentic self-concept, fragment cognition, and skew perceptions of community among young people. We contend that Algorithmic Literacy is foundational to digital resilience, equipping adolescents to recognize, interpret, and respond to algorithmic influences, thereby shifting them from passive recipients to empowered navigators of their digital worlds. This literacy fosters cognitive and emotional agency, reframing digital distress as contextual and modifiable. Given emerging evidence of its teachability and growing global implementation, we conclude that integrating Algorithmic Literacy into educational and mental health initiatives is vital for fostering genuine digital resilience in adolescents, enabling them to cope with and actively shape their digital environments.",

          "abstract": "Lucid dreaming (LD) – in which dreamers become aware that they are currently dreaming – has gained increasing attention in consciousness studies, yet its fine-grained experiential dynamics remain undercharacterized. We conducted in-depth micro-phenomenological interviews on 22 signal-verified lucid dreams experienced in a controlled sleep-laboratory setting, mapping within-episode dynamics from the first recalled moments, through the emergence of lucid insight, and into post-onset periods of sustained or lost lucidity.\nAcross episodes, temporal dynamics were highly variable, and we observed diverse phenomenological clusters at every stage. Lucidity sometimes appeared as an abrupt shift from non-lucidity, but most often built up gradually via extended pre-lucid engagement, ranging from curiosity-driven exploration to distress-driven affective escalation. Lucidity was often precipitated by specific triggers, including reality testing behaviors, identification of mismatches, and recognition of incorporated external sensory cues, administered by researchers with the aim of inducing lucidity. The emergence of lucidity itself could be experienced as a sudden or gradual process, and could be accompanied by diverse affective states. Post-onset periods ranged from stable lucid states of active exploration or receptive observation to more fragile states culminating in the collapse of the dream world. Eye signals were variably embedded in these dynamics and often shaped dream experience, for example by contributing to the emergence and maintenance of lucidity or destabilizing the dream.\nMethodologically, our findings demonstrate that micro-phenomenological interviews – originally developed for the study of waking experience – can be effectively adapted for LD research. Conceptually, they highlight diverse forms of meta-awareness, pre-lucidity, metacognitive processing, and agency in LD, and show that variability and complexity are intrinsic features of dream lucidity rather than noise. Practically, moving beyond binary classifications and attending to the fine-grained temporal and structural dynamics of LD can allow future research to harness LD as a dynamic window into the emergence of insight, metacognition, and agency during sleep.",

Although researchers have emphasized its importance across multiple sectors, its existing measures have methodological limitations and are often overly content-specific (e.g., trusting a supervisor). Building on prior work that identified and content-validated a preliminary item pool, the present research developed and validated a new, rigorously tested trustfulness scale. Across multiple studies (total N = 3,048), we prioritized modern psychometric practices by first evaluating items directly before conducting structural analyses. Using multi-occasion and multi-rater data, we reduced the scale’s content redundancy, maximized its content breadth and reliability, and assessed its consensual validity. We then evaluated the scale’s structure through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and compared its psychometric properties to existing trustfulness measures and to similar but distinct constructs, allowing for tests of convergent and discriminant validity. We present the final product which we call the Trustfulness Redundant-free Short Test (TRST); a 6-item scale consisting of two factors (i.e., Trust Beliefs and Suspicion of Others) that evaluates trustfulness in an efficient and psychometrically sound way.",

          "abstract": "Current theories and models of bipolar disorder mostly attempt at explaining one spatial or temporal scale of abnormalities. There is a lack of testable, multi-scale (both temporally and spatially) integrated models ranging from cellular levels to behavior and explaining pathological phenomena in bipolar disorder occurring from milliseconds to months. \nWe here introduce the Homeostatic Dysregulation model of Bipolar Disorder(HDBD). The HDBD primary assumption is that BD results from an alteration in homeostatic processes in the brain across scales, leading to a heightened sensitivity to external perturbations and an impairment to get back to normal levels, ultimately leading to major mood episodes and switches. This lack of homeostatic regulation would encompass neuronal excitability, neural networks, circadian rhythms, emotion processing and mood itself. The HDBD model thus reconciles observations performed at various spatial and temporal scales. To be tested and challenged, the HD-BD model requires “long-phenotyping” data of patients with bipolar disorder. This model also yields new validators of animal models along with therapeutic predictions. This first integrated, multi-scale model, may represent a step towards redefinition of bipolar disorder as a central nervous system homeostasis disorder.",

          "abstract": "Questions about whether humans possess a dedicated “number sense” have shaped theories of numerical cognition for decades. The classic perspective proposes that numerosity is extracted directly from the environment and encoded independently of other magnitudes such as area, density, or duration. In this chapter, we review accumulating evidence that challenges this independence—and, thus, the supposed abstract nature of numerosity representations. We introduce a Perceptual Interdependence account, in which numerical and non-numerical magnitudes are jointly encoded within perception, with interactions emerging early in processing. We draw on developmental, comparative, and computational research showing that number primacy (i.e., its privileged status over non-numerical magnitudes) is neither the developmental nor evolutionary default.  Instead, the relative weighting of number versus other magnitudes varies with experience, context, and attentional demands. We argue that attention plays a key role in selectively tuning integrated magnitude representations for decision-making, offering a bridge between perceptual representations of numerosity and later-emerging symbolic number concepts. This perspective reframes non-symbolic number as a perceptual construct—one that emerges from integrated magnitude processing rather than a standalone core system.",

I then outline three broad classes of fMRI designs commonly used in affective science: task-based paradigms that model specific affective processes through experimental manipulations; resting-state paradigms that characterize intrinsic functional architecture; and naturalistic paradigms that leverage complex, dynamic stimuli such as films or narratives to better approximate real-world affective experience. Finally, I survey a set of analytic approaches that can be paired with these designs, including mass-univariate contrast testing, decoding, voxel-wise encoding models, connectome-based predictive modeling, graph theoretic methods, regional homogeneity, and intersubject correlation analysis. For each, I describe how the method works, practical implementation considerations, and the kinds of inferences it affords about affective phenomena.

In these experiments, participants learned object images through either drawing a copy of the image, writing a description of the image, tracing the image, or simply studying the image. Subsequently, participants had an old/new recognition test and a test of object feature binding (indicating where the object was located and what color the object was). This experiment was conducted with younger adults and older adults. For the younger adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for both object recognition and object feature binding. For the older adults, drawing and describing were the best strategies for object recognition, while studying and describing were the best strategies for object feature binding.

The strongest and most consistent predictor of high-quality mentoring is perceived psychological similarity (e.g., shared attitudes) between mentees and their mentors, yet little is known about how these perceptions develop over time. Using longitudinal data and latent state-trait modeling, we examined how undergraduate mentees' perceived psychological similarity and the mentoring support they received from their faculty mentors influence one another. Most of the variance in psychological similarity reflected stable, trait-like tendencies, whereas a smaller portion of the variation was due to occasion-specific fluctuations. By contrast, most of the variance in mentoring support was state-like, due to occasion-specific fluctuations. Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed that early increases in psychological similarity predicted later perceptions of mentor support within the same academic year, whereas earlier mentor support consistently predicted future psychological similarity, both within and across academic years. These results suggest bidirectional, though asymmetric, temporal associations between psychological similarity and mentoring support. Undergraduates’ momentary beliefs that their mentor was a role model were associated with greater mentorship support, independent of their feelings of psychological similarity. These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal methods for capturing the dynamic, time-sensitive nature of mentoring relationships.",

The diverse Asian ethnic groups face different disparities, such as uneven rates of college graduation and cancer prognosis, that are hidden by the overly broad Asian American label and the associated model minority stereotype.

          "abstract": "Background: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of learning difficulties, which may reflect shared risk factors, ADHD symptoms hindering learning, or learning difficulties increasing ADHD symptoms. We aimed to map rates of co-occurrence among ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties and to investigate directional influences between ADHD symptoms and reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension.\nMethods: Reading fluency, arithmetic, and reading comprehension were assessed longitudinally in approximately 2,000 Finnish children across Grades 1 to 9 (ages 7–16). Attention/hyperactivity symptoms were measured with teacher ratings (Grades 1–4) and self-reports (Grades 6–9). ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and reading comprehension difficulties were based on a 10th percentile cut-off. Directionality between ADHD symptoms and academic skills was examined using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) to separate stable traits from time-specific states.\nResults: Children with ADHD were 1.14 to 1.75 times more likely to have a learning difficulty, whereas those with one learning difficulty were 4.32 to 4.62 times more likely to have another. The RI-CLPMs showed consistent autoregressive effects across all domains, indicating stable within-person variation over time. At the between-person level (i.e., trait), academic skills were negatively related to ADHD symptoms, especially those reported by teachers. At the within-person level (i.e., state), ADHD symptoms were unrelated to reading fluency and arithmetic. However, at multiple time points, cross-lagged effects emerged from ADHD symptoms to subsequent reading comprehension, indicating that elevated ADHD symptoms predicted subsequent declines in reading comprehension.   \nConclusions: Learning difficulties co-occurred more frequently with each other (homotypic) than with ADHD (heterotypic co-occurrence). Both ADHD symptoms and learning difficulties showed trait-like stability. After accounting for these, ADHD symptoms were no longer linked to reading fluency or arithmetic. However, more ADHD symptoms predicted later declines in reading comprehension, likely because comprehension requires sustained attention—often impaired in children with hyperactivity and inattention.",

          "authors": "JongKyu Kim",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes the Emotional Rhythm Unified Attachment Model (ER-UAM), which redefines attachment between humans and dogs from the perspective of emotional rhythm. Classical attachment theories assume that attachment is organized around the perception of behavioral signals, the interpretation of physical cues, and proximity-based emotional regulation. However, emotional responses observed in long-term clinical practice and naturalistic observation cannot be fully explained by signal decoding alone. The emotions of dogs and their caregivers do not unfold as sequential reactions, but as rhythmically synchronized co-occurrences, and the pattern of this rhythmic simultaneity determines both the stability and the type of attachment.\n\nER-UAM identifies four key variables as the main regulatory axes of emotional rhythm: consistency, sensitivity, immediacy of response, and fear injection. These variables are reorganized into a dual structure of causal indicators and outcome indicators. Whereas previous studies have mainly classified attachment types based on behavioral outcomes, ER-UAM derives attachment patterns by analyzing the flow of emotional rhythm as the underlying cause. This approach makes it possible to describe the arrangement of micro-level emotional waves observed in non-separation everyday contexts, and to interpret the mechanisms that generate secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganized attachment in terms of the breakdown and restoration of emotional rhythm.\n\nThe model has been refined through longitudinal observation of more than 150 clinical cases, and it demonstrates that a causal-indicator-centered judgment system can compensate for the limitations of behavior-based diagnostics.",

          "authors": "David Dorsey; Shonna Waters",
          "abstract": "Existing theories of human performance struggle to adequately explain the emergence of extreme positive and negative outcomes and the heavy-tailed distributions they consistently produce. Static, trait-based models and linear frameworks are often insufficient to capture the dynamic, self-reinforcing processes that drive individuals toward exceptional achievement or severe counter-productivity. This paper introduces a recursive theory of human performance grounded in the concept of “strange loops,” self-referential feedback cycles where identity and performance co-evolve. We argue that performance is generated through a recursive process of action, symbolic feedback interpretation, and adaptive identity construction. The “symbolic” nature of this feedback refers to its capacity to convey meaning about one's identity, status, and narrative role, beyond its objective or task-specific content. Positive feedback loops create upward spirals of achievement, while negative loops create downward spirals of counter-productive behavior, both driven by the same underlying amplification mechanism. This symmetrical process explains the full spectrum of performance and possible heavy-tailed distributions including why performance distributions can be heavy-tailed. We integrate this recursive model with the established CORE framework of performance and outline its fundamental propositions. Finally, we provide a comprehensive roadmap for the theory's empirical validation, detailing specific study designs, methodological considerations, and falsifiability criteria, offering a new agenda for performance theory and performance model research.",

          "abstract": "This paper redefines the affective simultaneity observed in human–dog relationships as non-local affective co-occurrence and proposes a new theoretical framework, the Quantum Emotional Entanglement (QEE) model, to explain this phenomenon.\n\nTraditional models in behaviorism, attachment theory, and emotional contagion describe emotion as a linear, signal-based stimulus–response process. Emotional change is assumed to occur first in one partner and only later in the other, through perception and interpretation of observable cues. However, across more than thirty years of longitudinal observation, I have repeatedly documented cases in which affective change occurs simultaneously in humans and dogs even when conventional signals are blocked or absent.\n\nThe QEE model does not treat emotion as information that is transmitted from sender to receiver. Instead, it conceptualizes emotion as a co-emergent phenomenon arising within a relational field. This paper introduces the core concepts, structure, and mechanisms of the QEE model and uses theoretically informative cases to show how it integrates previously anomalous observations into the domain of formal scholarly analysis.",

          "abstract": "The new generation of suicide models diverges from previous theories by embracing the ideation-to-action framework. Among these, the Integrated Motivational-Volitional (IMV) model and the Three Step Theory (3ST) elucidate the circumstances under which suicidal ideation arises and the subsequent transition from thoughts to behaviour. This systematic review aimed to compare the two models and assess the validity of each of their phases. Four electronic databases were searched for studies published after 2011 for the IMV model and after 2015 for the 3ST, yielding a total of 65 eligible articles. Among these, 51 focused on the IMV model, 12 on the 3ST, and two examined both models. Overall, while the IMV model was significantly more extensively studied than the 3ST, both models received partial support, which varied according to their respective phases or steps. The formation of suicidal ideation was robustly supported; however, the transition to action yielded conflicting findings, primarily due to operational and ethical challenges inherent in suicidology. Regarding the IMV model, our review underscores the necessity for further research that tests all three phases of the IMV together and addresses understudied variables, particularly the threat-to-self, motivational, and volitional moderators. The main limitations identified within the 3ST literature were largely related to the inconsistent operationalization of key variables and the use of inappropriate measurement instruments, which impeded a comprehensive assessment of the implicated factors, especially concerning pain and connectedness facets.",

Joining forces, we tested both abbreviated versions and the original PI20 in a prospective investigation, with the aim of validating and comparing the tools.

Results indicated that AI is not perceived homogeneously; rather, distinct clusters emerged in each framework. Perceptions of different AIs seem to be primarily organised along two dimensions: competence (people’s perception of an AI’s capacity to perform intended functions) and subjectivity (people’s perception of an AI’s ability to simulate having subjective experiences).

          "abstract": "Young men tend to be more conservative than young women. It is often suggested that this ‘youth gender gap’ is a generational phenomenon that can be attributed to recent developments such as the rise of the online manosphere and the far right. This study, however, proposes an alternative interpretation drawing from the developmental psychological ‘gender intensification theory,’ which holds that gender roles temporarily intensify during adolescence as biological, social, and cognitive changes heighten pressure from socialization agents to fit gender-role stereotypes. Supporting this explanation, 22 years of ESS data demonstrate that the interaction between gender and age peaks in middle adolescence, narrows during late adolescence, and mostly disappears in early adulthood. Moreover, this youth gender gap has not widened over time since 2002. These findings challenge claims of a generational rise of conservative men. Instead, the youth gender gap appears to be rooted in the typical psychosocial development of adolescents.",

          "abstract": "Why do uninvolved bystanders punish norm violations less harshly than victims? This longstanding puzzle lies at the heart of theories of fairness and cooperation. Prior accounts suggest that bystanders are less sensitive to unfairness than victims when reacting to fairness norm violations. Across three experiments, we tested this assumption by directly comparing third-party punishment (TPP) and second-party punishment (SPP). In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

We term these errors discretization errors, develop their mathematical model, and show how they can be corrected for when calculating slopes and correlations in linear models using a correction similar to the Spearman one for classical errors, and correction factors similar to classical reliabilities. This allows a general way to model and correct for these types of errors. Any situation where multiple true scores get collapsed can be understood with this model. We discuss how existing approaches fit into this general framework (e.g., scoring binary responses using Item Response Theory), and sketch the broader range of situations where the model can be applied. Discretization errors have the capacity of organizing, guide modelling, and furthering our understanding about an extensive class of errors beyond classical ones, that psychological researchers frequently encounter.",

Two studies examined these processes across different time frames. In a ten-day ecological momentary assessment with 133 individuals with probable SAD, daily stressors and all comparison components (frequency, discrepancy, impact) were positively linked to social anxiety, both between and within individuals. Additionally, comparison affective and behavioral impact were significant within-person mediators.

To address this question, we tested whether curiosity is associated with three dimensions of well-being: happiness, meaning in life, and psychological richness (a dimension of well-being characterized by diverse, perspective-changing experiences). Across six studies, psychological richness was consistently associated with curiosity, whereas happiness and meaning in life were not. Individuals leading psychologically richer lives self-reported greater curious tendencies (Studies 1–3; N = 5,363 across 13 countries) and exhibited greater behavioral indicators of curiosity, including more frequent exploratory behaviors in a two-week daily diary (Study 4; N = 203) and greater willingness to learn information in a laboratory setting (Study 5; N = 272). Finally, Study 6 (N = 451) demonstrated that individuals induced to value psychological richness showed greater willingness to learn compared to those in the control condition. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity is closely linked to well-being—particularly through its association with psychological richness.",

Prior work underscores the benefits of race-matched instruction but focuses on overall workforce diversity rather than the institutional structures that make cross-racial contact possible. We formalize this opportunity as race-match sufficiency, defined as whether the expected number of same-race teachers for students of a given race at a school is at least one. We treat this sufficiency measure as a structural property of schools. Using administrative data from 8,691 Texas public schools serving 5.4 million students, we model sufficiency as a function of racial composition, enrollment, grade span, and district context. Same-race student concentration emerges as the dominant factor, following a steep nonlinear S-curve whose thresholds differ markedly across racial groups. Secondary grade configurations and larger campuses modestly expand opportunities, yet disparities persist: white students experience near-universal sufficiency, Black students experience moderate access, and Hispanic students experience chronic underexposure—even in majority-Hispanic settings. These results show how diversity translates unevenly into contact and illustrate a portable framework for exposure-based staffing metrics that can be applied wherever administrative data exist.",

          "abstract": "This commentary proposes a renewed place-based understanding of ageing and social care research, drawing together evidence from an updated review of interventions for social isolation and insights from public engagement in contrasting urban and coastal settings. Despite a longstanding policy emphasis on ‘ageing in place’, structural conditions across England remain uneven, with rural and coastal communities often experiencing shrinking services, limited transport, digital exclusion, and fragile social infrastructures. Our updated umbrella review of 75 recent publications indicates that psychological, social, and hybrid interventions can reduce loneliness, but their impacts are inconsistent, often short-lived, and rarely examined across different geographical settings. We found no study adopted a genuinely place-based framework, leaving questions about how local environments shape both risk factors and intervention effectiveness. Insights from community engagement in London and coastal Lincolnshire further illustrate how place influences everyday experiences of ageing, highlighting shared challenges, such as fragmented services, digital barriers, and rising living costs. Whereas urban location-specific issues included isolation amid density, geographically close inequalities, and limited continuity of services, by contrast, people in coastal communities cited transport deprivation, seasonal and precarious economies and the erosion of community spaces. Taken together, these findings show that spatial inequalities are widening and that research failing to account for these, risks reinforcing them. A strengthened place-based research agenda is needed to ensure interventions are equitable, context-sensitive, and grounded in lived experience.",

To understand the relationship between search behavior and the probability of a serendipitous discovery, we propose a formal modeling framework based on the 𝑁𝐾model.

Searchers that pursue their theories through incremental steps instead of long-distance jumps have the highest rates of serendipitous success. Our model also provides insight into the role of bias, inaccurate or incorrect beliefs, and the ruggedness of the terrain in determining the rate of serendipitous discovery.

This article argues that this rapid substitution risks undermining a core commitment of democratic administration: accountable, reason-giving bureaucratic discretion. Drawing on cases of automated eligibility, sanctioning, and standardization, it shows that algorithmic tools govern through statistical regularities, which can obscure responsibility, mishandle atypical cases, and weaken citizens’ claims to individualized consideration. Building on classic public administration debates and newer work on system-level bureaucracy, the article reframes AI adoption as a constitutional, not merely technical, question: which administrative decisions may be standardized, and which must remain under human control because they implicate fairness, equity, or rights? The article concludes with a selective ``centaur’’ model in which AI supports but does not displace human officials, preserving explanation, accountability, and appeal.",

          "abstract": "Multiplayer video games are part of everyday activities posing the question of which of these digital settings cluster crime or other deviant behaviour. A superficial analysis of the literature suggests that the evidence on cybercrime inside video games is scarce and a considerable number of digital settings have not been explored. This systematic review critically addresses the body of work that has studied the connection between video games and crime from the perspective of Environmental criminology and the Criminology of Place. The review is guided by two hypothesis on crime clustering on cyberspace: (1) the literature on video games and crime has focus in a small number of titles (2) the literature on video games and crime is more prone to understand video games as factor that can trigger victimization or perpetration in offline spaces rather than a setting in which cybercrime can manifest. Through the analysis of 41 studies published between 2014 and 2024 following the PRISMA model, our results show that there is indeed and overrepresentation of some cyber places within research around video games and crime. Likewise, the literature most frequently studies the effects of video games on perpetration or victimisation. The implications of the study are discussed within the context of the debate on the risks associated with playing video games and the limitations of our understanding of which video games are criminogenic virtual environments.",

          "abstract": "Growing citizen dissatisfaction with current governance raises the question of what future governance systems should look like. We conducted a large survey experiment in the United States and Germany, with 5,000 respondents each, to explore how citizens would design their ideal governance system. We focus on two scenarios: a utopian Mars setting, in which citizens were asked to design governance from scratch, and an Earth setting, in which citizens were asked to redesign the existing governance system they live in. On the basis of a constant sum and conjoint analysis, we find a strong preference for mixed and “multicameral” (McKay, 2025) governance models that distribute decision-making among multiple actors. In the Mars scenario, citizens slightly “de-center” the representative model in favor of a greater emphasis on participatory and expertocratic components. There is also an even more pronounced preference for strong oversight. Our findings suggest that citizens' ideal governance preferences differ greatly from the current institutional status quo in both countries. Despite current authoritarian trends, citizens favor a system of governance based on institutional cooperation and robust checks and balances.",

          "authors": "Takeshi Minakawa",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman birth timing was historically regulated by circadian biological rhythms, with spontaneous deliveries typically occurring during the late night and early morning. However, the increasing medicalization of childbirth raises the hypothesis that social and institutional schedules now exert a dominant influence. This study empirically examines the historical transition from “biological time” to “social time” by analyzing hourly and day-of-week birth distributions among individuals born in Japan between 1960 and 1999. Using a dataset of 135,748 self-reported birth records collected from a commercial astrology web service, and after excluding default values indicating unknown times, the final analytical sample comprised 68,224 individuals. Birth trends were assessed using hour- and weekday-level aggregation, minute-level kernel density estimation, and cross-decade heatmap visualization.\n\nResults reveal a pronounced shift toward institutional scheduling. First, weekend births declined markedly, forming a clear weekend gap by the 1990s. Second, the natural dawn peak visible in the 1960s was replaced by a sharp weekday peak between 13:00 and 15:00 in the 1990s, coinciding with typical hospital operating hours; minute-level analysis confirmed that the drop at 12:00 reflects lunch-break scheduling rather than analytical artifact. Finally, heatmaps demonstrate increasing concentration of births within business hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00). These findings indicate that late-20th-century Japanese birth timing increasingly reflected the logistics of medical practice rather than intrinsic physiological patterns. Beyond documenting this transition, the study demonstrates that large-scale self-reported digital data can replicate epidemiologically robust trends with high temporal resolution, suggesting potential applications in real-time public health monitoring.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity provides essential ecological, economic, and cultural value, yet it continues to decline under anthropogenic pressures driven largely by economic development. Although many corporations are developing biodiversity-related measures and reporting frameworks, their actual environmental awareness and responsibility remain critical. On 19 September 2025, the outdoor sports brand Arc’teryx held a large-scale fireworks event, Ascending Dragon in the Himalayas, in Shigatse, China, which drew widespread criticism for its potential negative environmental impacts. To evaluate the societal and financial consequences of this incident, we analyzed Chinese public responses based on Weibo discourse (public reaction), Baidu Search Index (public attention), and the stock performance of Anta, Arc’teryx’s parent company. Both reaction and attention peaked two days after the event, and we found a negative correlation between online trends and stock performance. Causal analysis further demonstrated a significant causal influence of Baidu search activity related to Anta on its stock price. Textual analysis revealed that public concern centered primarily on environmental impacts, followed by expectations of corporate responsibility. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a negative environmental event, together with the resulting public reaction and attention, can directly and immediately influence a company’s financial performance. These findings underscore the importance of genuine biodiversity awareness and responsible decision-making in corporate practice.",

I analyze the impact of the social movement, measured by the media exposure frequency, on public opinion, the proposal of bills and the legislation with the national-level time serial and the state-level data. I investigate the impact of the social discourse on public opinion and the legislative process to illuminate the underlying mechanism where the social movement affects the political outcome. The social movement contributes to the improvement of political representation by spreading the social discourse, setting the agenda in civic and political society and triggering partisan politics for institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "Forthcoming, Sociological Science \n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.",

          "authors": "John Downer",
          "abstract": "This paper argues that modern risk governance rests on a useful fiction: that technological safety can be rendered as objective fact. Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. That fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The paper contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices dominate outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction. \nThe argument unfolds in four steps. First, it maps the civic epistemology that privileges technical consensus and procedural validation in technological risk, contrasting it with the plural, openly provisional treatment of economic risk. Second, it explains how this order is sustained by performances of objectivity that are methodologically valuable even if epistemologically fragile. Third, it draws on reactors to show how certain systems ‘fracture’ those performances by coupling catastrophic potential to hard limits on verification. Finally, it sketches the governance implications of operating beyond the boundary: cultivating varied expertise rather than a single authoritative voice, emphasizing resilience alongside risk calculation, and acknowledging that restraint may at times be the only responsible policy.",

          "authors": "Pascal König; Kristina Sabrina Weißmüller",
          "abstract": "What factors lie behind bureaucrats’ readiness to delegate client interactions that commonly involve human empathy to artificial intelligence (AI) systems? Such delegation entails a crucial trade-off as it may reduce workload but simultaneously introduces inauthentic empathic engagement in citizen-state relations, which may undermine the moral integrity of public administration (PA). Drawing on bureaucratic legitimacy theory, this study tests the impact of efficiency gains, AI features, and organizational norms on civil servants’ willingness to delegate citizen engagement to AI. Findings from a pre-registered discrete choice experiment conducted with 300 active German civil servants (Obs.=3,000) show that while efficiency gains and norms do have some impact, utilitarian considerations concerning AI’s ability to serve clients well are clearly the most important motivator. The findings show that the acceptability of delegating empathic engagement with citizens to AI can be tied to key dimensions of bureaucratic legitimacy, and provide novel evidence that the delegation of counselling to AI in PA is more strongly linked with public service motivation rather than self-serving efficiency gains. These insights advance theory and inform responsible and client-centered use of AI in public bureaucracies.",

This paper connects TCNs to the MLG conceptual framework by locating the former within an institutional space defined by the two types of MLG formulated by Hooghe and Marks, and reflecting on some of the implications of TCNs’ position in this space. In doing so, the paper achieves two objectives: first, it opens up the dominant MLG typology to accommodate intermediate and hybrid configurations of multilevel governance. Second, based on this reconceptualization, it provides an analytical basis on which to build in subsequent empirical work on city networks.",

          "abstract": "Climate change adaptation (CCA) increasingly relies on collaborative efforts to generate and circulate actionable knowledge. Among these, knowledge networks (KNs) have emerged as key infrastructures for fostering transnational cooperation, enabling mutual learning, and supporting local implementation. While their theoretical value is widely acknowledged, the empirical landscape of adaptation-related knowledge networks in Europe remains poorly understood. This article offers the first systematic mapping of KNs working on CCA in Europe, with a particular focus on Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs)—a prominent subset composed primarily of local authorities. We identify and compare 32 knowledge networks across key dimensions including structure, governance, membership, funding models, and core activities. The analysis is grounded in two original datasets: a network-level dataset comprising 32 adaptation-related KNs and a membership-level dataset encompassing over 17,000 entries, systematically collected and geo-referenced. These resources provide an unprecedented empirical basis for understanding how climate knowledge is shared, institutionalised, and mobilised across Europe. Our findings reveal a diverse and uneven landscape, with significant variation in access thresholds, support mechanisms, and geographic representation. TMNs, in particular, differ in the type and intensity of support they provide—ranging from technical expertise and financial assistance to symbolic capital and peer learning opportunities. The article contributes to ongoing debates about multilevel climate governance and the role of networks in enhancing local adaptation capacity.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines media imaginaries surrounding resource commodification in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a focus on events in 2020. It analyses two distinct yet interconnected media events. The first pertains to how the politics of natural resource commodification are debated and how various actors are positioned within these discussions. The second concerns the circulation of accounts of supernatural phenomena. The data include personal online exchanges from 2020–2021; three annual volumes (2018–2020) of a Central Kalimantan newspaper; selected news items from internet-based media (2017–2020); Twitter conversations from 2020 under various keywords; and selected YouTube videos featuring supernatural phenomena published between 2017 and 2020.\n\nFirst, the analysis argues that the Central Kalimantan mediascape is fragmented: established media outlets explicitly represent various state interests while claiming to serve the public, whereas social media discussions and circulating multimedia narratives often provide a counternarrative—if not constitute a counterpublic—serving as platforms for citizens to mobilise and articulate their interests. Second, the chapter introduces a new type of circulating discourse, termed “haunted publics,” in which accounts of supernatural events circulate in ways distinct from conventional counterpublics, yet the emergent effects of this circulation can still generate political critique. Third, consistent with previous research, it shows that discourses on supernatural events and resource politics are interrelated, even when they do not directly engage one another.",

          "abstract": "Kate’s House Foundation operates and owns seven accredited MAT homes serving justice-involved adults referred by the Drug Court and the Department of Corrections (DOC). The program emphasizes trauma-informed care, no rapid-exit policies, and prohibits resident “vote-outs.” Because all participants were justice-involved at entry, the realistic alternative to remaining in housing was the possibility of losing drug court benefits or returning to jail or prison for relapse or non-compliance. Within this high-risk context, the longer lengths of stay observed in this cohort represent extended periods in the community in lieu of incarceration, underscoring the preventive impact of a non-punitive, stabilization-first recovery housing model. We evaluated early exits, length of stay (LOS), completion/active status, employment change, and age patterns using assessments at ~0, 45, and 90 days (REC-CAP). 10, 12. Mean LOS was ~141 days (median ~97), and among residents engaged beyond 30 days the mean LOS was 181 days. Using LOS ≥60 days as a priori “engagement success,” retention was strongest among older adults, while residents &lt;25 showed the weakest ≥60-day retention. 5, 6 REC-CAP Social Capital &amp; Meaningful Activities scores skewed high (94% scoring 4–5 on a 5-point scale across 394 responses), indicating substantial perceived connection and purposeful activity during residence. Uniquely, this large single-system cohort spans seven houses run by one foundation under consistent policies, with data collected by two trained staff—reducing site-level variability common in multi-operator studies. In this cohort, Drug Court participants achieved retention patterns similar to DOC participants, supporting the role of non-punitive, MAT-compatible housing in maintaining community placement across justice-system categories.",

For this reason, we investigate how information about unequal carbon emissions within countries affects public support for climate mitigation efforts through a survey experiment (N = 1,110) on a representative sample of US respondents, providing information about the distribution of carbon emissions. Results show that exposure to this information increases support for stringent climate policies, particularly those targeting wealthy individuals. Notably, respondents perceive wealthier individuals as more responsible for climate change, without diminishing their own sense of responsibility for reducing pro-environmental behaviors. These findings suggest that making carbon inequality more salient can enhance broad-based support for climate policies without compromising individual engagement, offering insights into strategies for facilitating the green transition.",

          "authors": "Regina N. Watteel",
          "abstract": "Background: Canada’s 2021–2022 COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were implemented with the stated aim of reducing transmission and hospital burden. In the absence of randomized controlled trial evidence for these endpoints, policymakers relied on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated comparisons from surveillance data and observational studies, as well as ungrounded simulations, despite known methodological limitations that rendered such evidence unreliable for public health policies with rights implications.\nMethods: We systematically critiqued Canadian public health surveillance reports and advisory briefs (Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table) together with related studies, identifying seven key biases classified by severity (critical/catastrophic), correctability, and scope. Distortions were quantified using published rate corrections, classification rules, time-series data, and population trends.\nResults: Critical biases included &gt;40% misclassification of early post-vaccination cases as unvaccinated and an 80-fold overestimation of senior unvaccinated hospitalization rates due to denominator errors. Additional critical biases—age-standardization obfuscating low-risk youth trends, testing fluctuations understating breakthrough cases, and misattribution rendering COVID-19 hospitalizations an invalid metric for burden—further distorted policy evidence. Catastrophic biases—selection and cumulative methodology—rendered group comparability invalid. Population trends showed case and hospitalization surges despite &gt;80% vaccination coverage, with vaccinated individuals dominating Omicron-era infections. Simulation studies retroactively justifying mandates contradicted real-world data with ungrounded counterfactuals used to estimate unproven benefits.\nConclusions: Pervasive, uncorrected biases in observational comparisons invalidated causal claims of transmission or hospital burden reduction. Progressive reliance on weaker evidence—coupled with expert bodies' lack of transparency in emphasizing unproven benefits while dismissing dissenting views—highlights a systemic failure to meet evidentiary standards for public health policies with rights implications. This analysis underscores the need for greater scientific rigor in interpreting observational data through real-time bias correction, transparent limitation reporting, and risk-stratified approaches to uphold evidentiary standards, ethical proportionality, and accountability. These lessons hold global relevance for evidence-based public health policy.",

          "abstract": "This article examines why digital games may be particularly well-suited to fostering deeper understanding and critical reflection on climate action, while addressing their inherent limitations. It develops a theoretical argument grounded in analyses of Half-Earth Socialism, Green New Deal Simulator, and The Financial Times Climate Game, also drawing on qualitative interviews with developers and player discussions on Steam. These games invite players to experiment with climate crisis solutions, fostering learning by placing them in the role of powerful decision-makers confronting challenges such as achieving net-zero CO₂ by 2050 while maintaining full employment. Learning is shaped by three characteristics: offering curated choices, delivering immediate and vivid feedback, and manipulating time. Yet limitations such as restricted choice and ideological bias make reflection essential. Informal online spaces, including discussion forums, host debates on political visions and the realism of in-game simulations, offering blueprints for integrating digital games into climate action education.",

          "authors": "Patrick Habecker; Rick A. Bevins",
          "abstract": "The opening of sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in New York City and the decriminalization of personal possession of all illicit drugs in Oregon marked significant changes to drug policy in the United States. Both changes came as the national yearly overdose deaths approached and then surpassed 100,000 deaths annually (CDC 2025a). Rising overdose deaths have been declared a state of emergency in the US and more Americans likely know someone who has died of an overdose than at any time in US history. In such an environment, new drug policies may have more support than they typically would. However, without sufficient public support, policy measures such as OPCs or decriminalization may be short-lived or reversed. In Oregon, the change in public support for decriminalization eroded enough from the passing of a law by ballot measure in 2020 to being revoked in 2024 by the legislature. Similarly, the current downturn in overdose deaths may cut support for sanctioned OPCs and other overdose prevention measures. Public support is therefore a critical component for sustained drug policy changes such as OPCs and decriminalization, even when these policies are introduced in times of emergency. In this paper, we studied the level of public support for OPCs and decriminalization measures as viewed by the general public in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state with little history of drug policy reform, a low rate of overdose deaths, and its residents are predominantly Republican. We estimated that 64.5% and 56.4% of adult Nebraskans support OPCs and 69.2% to 65.3% supported decriminalization in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This support was related to political party with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting both policies. However, 38% to 52% of Republicans also supported these two policies depending on the year. Although focused on Nebraska, these findings show what may be expected from similar states such as those in the Great Plains and Midwest areas of the US.",

Drawing on Robert Putnam's theory, the study investigates whether platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Farcaster foster the same levels of trust as face-to-face communities. Despite enabling vast networks, these platforms often fail to replicate in-depth relationships, leading to a decline in reciprocity and accountability. The rise of online \"clubs\" has resulted in transactional interactions, eroding meaningful social capital.

          "authors": "Davide Morselli",
          "abstract": "Digital polarization is often examined through identity-based frameworks that presuppose stable groups. We instead conceptualize Digital Connective Narratives (DCN) as a process of interactional co-construction that yields an emergent connective narrative field around shared issues and oppositional framings. Within this framework, Polarized DCN (PDCN) arise when these connective fields consolidate along five structural dimensions, social relevance, conflict scope, historical depth, power asymmetries, and emotional intensity. To illustrate the approach, we analyze debates on X (formerly Twitter) during South Africa’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign using topic modeling, stance classification, and adversarial-language detection tracked across rollout phases. Findings show that polarization did not diffuse across all topics: it concentrated in conflict-relevant debates, while institutional/informational topics remained largely non-polarized and faded over time. Within polarized debates, adversarial language intensified and engagement persisted, with challenger (non-institutional) streams gaining relative prominence as the campaign unfolded. As the pandemic’s immediate salience waned, public justification lost urgency and conflict retreated to a narrower circle of highly engaged users.",

          "authors": "J. Vázquez",
          "abstract": "El intercambio de favores es una de las manifestaciones más habituales de altruismo social, y una dinámica común en las relaciones humanas. Implica una transferencia de valor que no se suele hacer explícita, lo que puede conducir a valoraciones perceptivas discrepantes por parte de dador y receptor del favor. Los intentos de analizar formalmente estas dinámicas se ven dificultados por la naturaleza subjetiva y no expresada de las expectativas de valor y deuda que se generan, y por la condición no siempre monetaria de estos actos. Este articulo introduce la propuesta teórica de un nuevo marco de análisis conceptual, la Matriz de Valoración Subjetiva (MVS), basado en una representación geométrica-espacial diseñada para hacer visibles estas dinámicas.\nLa MVS construye la valoración de un favor a partir de dos dimensiones fundamentales: el sacrificio que supone para el dador y el beneficio que reporta al receptor. Sobre esta base, el modelo va incorporando la formalización de los sesgos perceptivos conocidos, logrando mostrar una representación del espacio subjetivo distorsionado de valoración de cada actor. Mediante la superposición de ambas representaciones, dador y receptor, se consigue hacer visible la distancia perceptiva entre ambos, e identificar las áreas del espacio valorativo donde el conflicto latente es más probable.\nLa MVS ofrece una herramienta para visualizar el efecto de estos sesgos perceptivos, y proporciona un método analítico con potencial cuantificador que permite identificar las causas precursoras del conflicto en el ámbito del intercambio de favores, pero con capacidad de extensión a cualquier otra dinámica de intercambio de valor no explícito.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCo-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. \n\nMain body\nThe ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. \n\nConclusion\t\nThe iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

The findings show that both offenders and victims employ bounded rational decision-making. For offenders, this is exemplified by aspects such as tailor-made ransom demands for each victim and balancing between trust signals and pressure tactics. For victims, this includes aspects such as the reasoning behind the decision to negotiate and pay a ransom demand, considering for example, the financial situation of their company, value of the data, and time and effort required to recover without a decryptor. However, both parties also have to deal with information asymmetry, including offenders having incomplete information on the victim’s finances or the value of the data, or victims being unsure about the credibility of the ransomware group. The findings also illustrate the interplay between both parties in shaping the outcome of the ransomware attack, and the professional aspects and imperfections of LockBit’s ransomware operations. The study highlights the importance of understanding victim-offender interactions during ransomware attacks, while also providing practical implications for the support of victims.",

          "authors": "Phil Swatton",
          "abstract": "Empirical political science generates knowledge of the world through abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. However, to date, no attempt has been made to compare the explanatory quality of the sociological modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the socio-economic positions of voters, and the spatial modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the ideology of voters. I argue that the paradigm of predictive inference, or machine learning, offers three contributions towards comparing these traditions within the abductive framework of political science. This depends on a change in emphasis, from seeking to produce maximally predictive models according a given metric to treating the predictive power of well-chosen variables as a theoretically interesting quantity. Taking the 2019 UK general election and 2019 EU parliament election as my primary and secondary case studies respectively, I use supervised machine learning to compare models using demographic variables and ideological variables to predict vote choice. Using British Election Study data I find that models using demographic variables are not much more accurate than assuming all voters vote for the largest party. I find that models using ideological variables perform better, but even these models struggle to predict third party vote choice. Using European Election Study data from 15 countries, I confirm that this result generalises, albeit there is too much uncertainty to confirm it in any particular country. I perform some post-hoc analysis using mutual information and PCA to give further support to my evidence. To my knowledge, this is the first time mutual information has been used to study vote choice. I conclude by arguing that in line with the three contributions my evidence shows that the spatial modelling tradition represents a better explanation in the abductive reasoning framework, and highlight several promising directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study examines mortality dynamics across major macroeconomic regions—Western countries, non-Western regions, and China—from 1960 to 2023, exploring variability and underlying drivers. Descriptive analysis shows that non-Western regions experienced the highest death rates in 1960–1990, followed by a marked decline as GDP per capita increased. China exhibited a similar pattern. Conversely, Western countries achieved only modest mortality reductions after 1991 despite sustained economic growth, even when controlling for population aging (≥65 years). Regression models and partial correlations indicate that economic progress initially correlates with mortality decline in all regions. However, in Western countries, this relationship reverses after 1991, forming an inverted-U curve when mortality is modeled against GDP per capita and elderly share. This suggests diminishing health returns and potential adverse effects of advanced development—such as environmental degradation, lifestyle-related diseases, and occupational risks. Non-Western regions, with slower economic acceleration, show no comparable reversal. Findings imply that beyond a development threshold, further growth may paradoxically elevate mortality. Policy strategies should prioritize balanced, sustainable development and integrated “One Health” approaches to mitigate health risks associated with over-rapid economic expansion.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the intricate relationships\nbetween body, subjectivity, and emotions within social anthropology. Drawing on\nphenomenological, feminist, and critical social theory, I argue that these three dimensions\nconstitute mutually constitutive domains that cannot be analyzed in isolation. The body\nis not merely a biological entity but a site of social inscription, cultural meaning-making,\nand lived experience. Subjectivity emerges through embodied practices situated within\nspecific cultural contexts and power relations. Emotions, far from being purely individual\npsychological states, function as socially mediated phenomena that shape and are shaped\nby both corporeal experiences and subjective formations. By synthesizing contributions\nfrom phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Csordas), practice theory (Bourdieu, Ortner),\nbiopolitics (Foucault), feminist theory (Butler, Grosz, Fausto-Sterling), and the\nanthropology of emotions (Rosaldo, Ahmed, Lutz), this paper proposes an integrative\nanalytical approach. This framework enables anthropologists to examine how social\nstructures become embodied, how subjects navigate normative regimes through their\ncorporeal existence, and how emotional experiences mediate between individual agency\nand collective formations. The paper concludes by discussing methodological\nimplications for ethnographic research that takes seriously the embodied, emotional\ndimensions of subjectivity.",

          "abstract": "The American Dream has long symbolized opportunities and upward mobility for migrants. Migration research often assumes that migrants in European countries hold imaginaries similar to the American Dream, yet recent scholarship on the role of the institutional context challenges this assumption. This study examines how migrants in Germany—a context with a different institutional setup—envision their destination. Based on interviews and group discussions with 47 migrants residing in Germany, this study identifies the contours of a distinct “German Dream”. Participants portrayed Germany as an institutional counterpoint to the United States, describing it as a “caring society” characterized by low inequality and extensive welfare provisions. This study makes three contributions to the study of geographical imaginaries. First, it demonstrates how imaginaries are relationally constructed by showing how migrants construct the German Dream through comparisons with the American Dream. Second, it highlights how different institutional contexts foster distinct imaginaries. Third, it emphasizes how imaginaries convey a vision of the good society, showing that migrants evaluate not only their own prospects but also the broader social order.",

          "abstract": "Local governments in many countries struggle to find candidates for elected office. In the resulting uncontested elections, voters cannot choose between different candidates and hold local representatives accountable. Amalgamation might be a solution for this challenge to democracy since larger jurisdictions need fewer elected officials per voter. Combining data on all Swiss local government mergers in the 21st century with data on local executive elections, this article assesses whether amalgamation reforms indeed increase candidate supply and hence local electoral contestation. Staggered difference-in-differences regressions show that amalgamation increases the number of candidates/seat. The underlying mechanisms seem to go beyond a ``mechanical'' effect that results from a mere expansion of the candidate pool. This study, thus, provides first empirical evidence that local government amalgamation might contribute to mitigate a hidden supply side crisis of electoral democracy at the local level.",

This study finds only limited signs of selective exposure: while intention to vote for or against the initiative was not related to the query stance, respondents’ climate beliefs partially influenced query selection. I further test whether selective exposure is greater when users choose queries from recommended options than when they formulate them independently, and discuss the role of expected vote outcome, political beliefs, and cognitive factors in query selection.",

Weekly, around eight per cent of respondents use libraries for at least half a day, a rate similar to that for coworking spaces, while a further one in three would consider doing so. Libraries are valued for quietness, affordability, internet access, and a sense of community, but limited privacy and restricted hours remain barriers. The findings highlight the library’s potential to meet workforce needs and offer practical implications for library managers seeking to design spaces and policies that better support remote workers and their wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Animals often stand as the most vivid symbols of the natural world, shaping how people imagine, value, and care for the environment. This study examines how emotional connections with animals relate to environmental attitudes and whether feelings of place attachment mediate this relationship. Drawing on frameworks from conservation psychology and sense-of-place research, two animal connection constructs—Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity—were tested as predictors of environmental concern among a U.S. sample of 282 adults. Each mediation model was estimated with 5,000 bootstrap samples, entering one predictor at a time while controlling for the other. These mediation models were specifically designed to evaluate whether place attachment functions as an intervening variable linking each animal connection construct to environmental attitudes, allowing us to estimate both direct and indirect effects while accounting for the other predictor. Results showed that both Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and with both measures of Place Attachment. Place Attachment partially mediated the relationship between Animal Empathy and Environmental Attitudes. In contrast, Place Attachment did not significantly mediate the effect of Animal Solidarity, which was directly predictive of environmental concern. These findings suggest that empathy-based and solidarity-based connections with animals may foster environmental care through distinct psychological pathways. Understanding how affective bonds with animals shape place-based and environmental engagement can inform education, communication, and relational approaches to fostering ecological responsibility.",

          "abstract": "North American institutions of higher education (IHEs): universities, 4- and 2-year colleges, and trade schools -- are highly active and well-followed on Twitter. An IHE Twitter account averages 20,000 subscribers. Many of them follow more than one IHE, allowing the construction of an IHE network based on the number of co-followers. In this paper, we explore the structure of a network of 1,435 IHEs on Twitter. We discovered significant correlations between the network attributes: various centralities and clustering coefficients -- and IHEs' attributes, such as enrollment, tuition, and religious/racial/gender affiliations. We uncovered the network's community structure linked to homophily -- such that similar followers follow similar colleges. Additionally, we analyzed followers' self-descriptions and identified 12 overlapping topics that can be traced to their group identities.",

          "authors": "Alen Kaminski",
          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 shift from Biden’s Democratic to Trump’s Republican administration led to a relevant change in US strategy for the war in Ukraine. Models of democratic responsiveness imply that this would also be reflected in divergent preferences among US partisan voters regarding the normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Do voters on the political left and right resolve these trade-offs differently? We bring conjoint and vignette survey experiments with 2,334 US citizens to this question. We show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Average support is higher for strategies that sustain the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine compared to concessions to Russia -- even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show relevant concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk -- with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. Our results imply, tentatively, that differences in partisan preferences are smaller than the US administrations’ drawback of Ukraine support would let expect. Overall, for a case where normative motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected along the left-right axis.",

          "abstract": "Using Italian microdata, this paper documents that, conditional on parental resources, education, and transfers, (i) expecting an inheritance predicts a 19.6 percentage points (63.5%) higher probability of university enrollment, and (ii) expected heirs tend to belong to altruistic dynasties, since having received an inheritance nearly doubles the intention to leave a bequest. I rationalize these findings with a stylized model where dynastic altruism underpins expected heirs’ stronger bequest motives. They accumulate human capital to increase lifetime income, hence the ability to finance bequests. The quantitative model attributes 44% of the gap in student rates between expected heirs and the rest to dynastic bequest motives, 35% to coresidence with parents and inter vivos transfers, whereas the expected wealth transfer itself has a strong negative effect on education. Policy counterfactuals show that inheritance taxation raises enrollment, especially when it funds student grants, and that the link between inheritance expectations and education is stronger when the discounted returns to education are lower. These findings help explain intergenerational persistence in education, wealth, and income, and highlight how inheritance taxation can affect the level and composition of human capital.

Nesterenko (2023) looked beyond Donald Trump at the Republican Party at large and found a pattern of manipulative effect in Republican discourse supporting Russia in the Russian-Ukrainian war. This raises many important questions for researchers. What is the political motivation for Republicans to side with Russia against Ukraine? How did this come to be? To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of speech manipulation in Republican discourse. The investigation traced the origin of speech manipulation in Republican discourse to conservative principles introduced by William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater. Critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies and techniques and revealed hidden messages and motivations connected across speakers and generations. This work supports the need for further speech manipulation research from a historical perspective.",

When academics rely on social media platforms’ classifiers, concepts, and categorization methods, it undermines the replicability of findings. Not disclosing that reliance also impedes meaningful, intersubjective peer review. Industry control over data collection and curation raises concerns about the self-interested goals of industry players in such collaborations, especially when the social media platforms claim the findings are highly policy-relevant. We specifically discuss Meta’s intentional deployment of \"break glass\" measures—changing the active algorithm to reduce polarization—during data collections in those collaborations. Since none of the original publications explicitly referenced these manipulations, fundamental questions arise about data reliability and transparency.",

In public services such as policing, disproportionate attrition of women slows improvement of gender equality, but can also affect legitimacy and service outcomes. Typically, attrition of women in policing is studied in isolation, while sources (and thus, solutions) of inequalities may lie in societal or broader organizational dynamics. Using monthly employment register data, this study compared attrition of Dutch female policing staff to those of their male counterparts and their peers in other public subsectors. Findings indicated that, while women were more likely to leave the Dutch policing sector than men, several other subsectors showed similar gender differences. Results suggest that approaches to improve gender equality, both in policing and in other ‘gender-typed’ subsectors, should not be limited to increasing representation and should involve reviewing implicit assumptions about employees, including procedures for appraisal.",

          "abstract": "While journalism research increasingly engages with the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), it often overlooks the foundational layer that enables AI itself: data. This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value. Alongside its conceptual contribution, we introduce a systematic framework for locating research foci across intersecting dimensions of data in journalism.",

Drawing on Ostrom’s (1990) Nobel Prize-winning principles of commons governance and the formal repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2023; UN Human Rights Council, 2021), we contend that Indigenous stewardship frameworks represent not historical artefacts but sophisticated legal systems optimally suited for abundance management. Quantitative evidence demonstrates that Indigenous-managed lands exhibit superior ecological outcomes compared to protected areas (Fa et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2019). Constitutional recognition of Indigenous sovereignty is presented as a positive-sum transition from the failing logic of the scarcity-based Extraction Paradigm (market/state binary) to the proven effectiveness of the Stewardship Paradigm. This analysis shows that legal continuity arguments cannot resolve foundational legitimacy deficits when the underlying dominant epistemic architecture actively obstructs human flourishing in conditions of technological potential and ecological urgency.\nKeywords: Indigenous sovereignty, constitutional legitimacy, post-scarcity economics, commons governance, Doctrine of Discovery, stewardship frameworks, Ostrom.",

Building on organizational-behavior and anthropological perspectives—including Salisbury’s concept of reciprocal but asymmetric exchange—the study interprets these patterns as both emergent and, at times, strategically maintained to consolidate symbolic control. By integrating theories of destructive leadership, moralized favoritism, and social exchange, the paper proposes a framework of procedural and institutional remedies that transform discretionary authority into accountable and transparent practice.

The results obtained after an overarching comparison show how KNN is significantly more accurate and trustful in relation to any other method, outperforming any other on any key error measure and interpretability factors. The addition of contribution and importance investigation on variables extends to this paper a unique degree of originality, showing which SKUs’ physical variables are most significantly influencing volume saturation on pallets, and offering immediate management implications related to their operative meaning.

          "abstract": "Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is widely used to estimate opinion in small sub- groups and to adjust unrepresentative surveys.

We propose a principled, data-driven method to leverage observable errors on auxiliary quantities with known marginal distributions — e.g., election outcomes — to improve estimates of policy attitudes. Our method leverages the correlation between auxiliary variables and outcomes of interest to calibrate MRP estimates to these known marginal distributions. We illustrate our approach using a pre-election poll measuring support for an abortion referendum. We find that the method reduces county-level error by two-thirds relative to traditional MRP. We also show how our calibration approach can be used to generate estimates for smaller nested geographies, such as precincts, even in the absence of poststratification data at this level. Our approach provides a framework for fully incorporating known population data to improve estimates of public opinion in small subgroups, providing scholars another tool to study representation.",

          "abstract": "Much AI risk discourse centers on loss of control under AGI. We ask a nearer question: before those thresholds, does modern machine learning already create a structural risk for how societies produce knowledge and culture? We use temporality in an operational sense: the way understanding changes over time and the signals left by that process. Representation learning and large-scale autoregressive generation approximate the distribution of task outputs like text, designs and decisions while omitting the slow, path-dependent human learning that produced them; at scale, these pipelines function as general-purpose production technologies. We formalize the link from technical indistinguishability to market selection with a GAN-inspired economic model and a screening threshold: when divergence between model signals and temporal signals is small and verification remains costly, decision makers cease screening, prices track pooled quality, and temporality-intensive work exits. We call this value collapse. As training data increasingly mirror such environments, models absorb their own outputs and the risk of model collapse rises through loss of diversity and feedback. Alignment is, in our model, largely orthogonal: by improving usability and narrowing observable gaps, it can reduce incentives to screen and thereby intensify these selection pressures, especially where provenance remains costly to verify. This integration of machine learning and economic reasoning clarifies conditions under which signals and rewards are reshaped.",

There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the nationwide suspension of nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident, as well as the subsequent restart of the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima Prefecture, on local socio-economic structures. Using municipal-level statistics for 2010, 2014, and 2020, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to extract the underlying patterns of regional socio-economic organization. In addition, difference-in-differences (DID) regression analysis was employed to evaluate the effects of plant proximity on municipal fiscal indicators. The findings reveal that in 2010, urban scale and plant location were the primary axes of differentiation; by 2014, however, the suspension accentuated demographic and fiscal vulnerabilities across municipalities. In 2020, even after the plant restart, the structure of urban dominance and peripheral stagnation persisted, with widening disparities. The DID analysis further suggests that the fiscal benefits of the restart were limited and unevenly distributed. This study contributes to the literature by quantitatively and spatially assessing the dynamic impacts of exogenous shocks on regional societies, while highlighting both the risks of nuclear dependence and the pressing policy challenge of mitigating regional inequality.",

          "authors": "Douglas Guilbeault; Spencer Caplan; Charles Yang",
          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle throughout the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' choices systematically deviate from both imitation and optimization. Instead, they follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their choices stabilize. We effectively estimate this threshold using the Tolerance Principle (TP), a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. We show that threshold-based agents produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents, while also providing a better model of how a critical mass of dissenters can overturn conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. Furthermore, in a preregistered dyadic experiment requiring people to infer non-linguistic behavioral patterns amid controlled levels of noise in observed signals, TP outperforms all other models at reproducing learning rates among human participants. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates reactivity in smartphone use resulting from participation in smartphone logging and experience sampling studies. Drawing on data from 815 German Android users, we analyzed digital traces collected before and during a seven-day study involving up to seven daily short surveys. Using mixed-effects models, we assessed how granting log access and completing short surveys affected glance, session, and app episode frequency and duration in both the short term (after surveys) and long term (across days). The result show that smartphone logging induced small, transient reductions in use frequency and duration, particularly during the first five days, suggesting initial self-regulation due to awareness of monitoring. Experience sampling prompts produced short-term increases in use lasting two to three hours. Overall, both methods induced some degree of reactivity in smartphone use, though the effect of this reactivity on inferences remains unknown. The findings suggest that researchers should allow acclimation periods and space surveys appropriately.",

          "abstract": "While journalism research increasingly engages with the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), it often overlooks the foundational layer that enables AI itself: data. This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value. Alongside its conceptual contribution, we introduce a systematic framework for locating research foci across intersecting dimensions of data in journalism.",

          "abstract": "Research on gene–environment interactions in education focuses on two main hypotheses: the compensatory advantage hypothesis, holding that genetic disadvantage would be less consequential in resource-rich environments, and the Scarr–Rowe hypothesis, based on the idea that the availability of resources can reinforce a genetic advantage. Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing prominence of traditionalist values—often rooted in religion—within moral-conservative mobilizations, research on religious social media users and their political engagement remains limited. This study employs computational methods to examine the prevalence, composition, partisanship, content production, and reposting behavior of religious users in abortion-related Twitter discourse during Italy’s 2022 general elections. Findings reveal that religious users constitute a small but vocal minority, overrepresented among media, political, and influencer accounts, potentially amplifying their visibility. Their partisanship aligns with right-wing parties, yet engagement with mainstream political leaders is lower than average, possibly due to selective curation and limited resonance with party messaging. Their content also includes misinformation linking vaccines to abortion, reinforcing moral-conservative narratives. These results advance understanding of religious users as political actors in networked public spheres and demonstrate the value of computational approaches for empirically analyzing religion’s role in online political communication.",

          "abstract": "With the adoption of the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Artificial Intelligence Act, and European Media Freedom Act, the EU has set in motion an ambitious regulatory project to shape the governance of digital platforms and AI systems. This paper maps the governance stakeholders involved in the operationalization of these four instruments and examines their distribution of powers and responsibilities. Building on existing typologies of platform governance and regulatory space theory, we introduce an analytical framework that foregrounds three structural elements–competencies, capacities, and connectedness–alongside eight regulatory functions, ranging from agenda-setting to enforcement and discourse shaping. We then operationalize this framework in the context of the standardization ecosystem, highlighting the growing prominence of standardization bodies as central actors in multi-stakeholderism. Our analysis shows that, despite the promises of multi-stakeholderism for more democratic and cooperative governance configurations, in practice this approach often disregards material power asymmetries. This reality privileges technocratic expertise and industry stakeholders over public-interest actors, hindering ultimately a more equitable and democratic governance paradigm. We conclude by arguing that pursuing strategic autonomy, as the EU boasts, requires reducing the regulatory power of private actors and strengthening capacities of actors normatively and materially grounded in the public interest.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, hundreds of private art collectors have opened museum spaces, which they largely finance and control themselves. While such initiatives have been criticized as conspicuous consumption or vanity projects, one public benefit claimed is the display of new artistic perspectives: Due to their strong personal vision and independence, private museums have been argued (including by private museum founders themselves) to showcase underexposed artists and provide artistic innovation. We test this proposition with large-scale exhibition and auction data. We find that contrary to claims of artistic novelty, private museums disproportionately exhibit established artists, as their exhibition choices tend to favor artists who have already had longer careers, more prior exhibitions and higher auction turnover. Thus, the potential of private museums to serve as incubators of novel perspectives is limited.",

The presence of multiple revenue sources creates the channel through which business parameter changes affect app developers' choice of revenue sources, which may overturn standard price and advertisement pass-through effects. To capture this revenue-source channel, we propose an empirical model of mobile app competition wherein app developers choose download prices, usage prices, and in-app advertising intensities. We employ a competition-in-utility approach to offer a tractable characterization of developers' revenue source choices. We estimate the model using Google Play roleplaying game data from Japan over 2015--2017 and use the estimated model to show the effects of app mergers and changes in transaction fees, highlighting the importance of the revenue-source channel.",

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Abstract\n\nThe opioid epidemic continues to impose a profound human and financial burden on the U.S. healthcare system. While previous studies have examined prescribing behavior or social determinants of health (SDOH) separately, few have quantitatively integrated these domains with Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) cost levers to explain geographic variation in opioid-related spending. This study develops an interpretable, county-level machine-learning framework linking Medicare Part D opioid-prescribing data (2013–2023) with socioeconomic, behavioral, and healthcare-access indicators from the County Health Rankings dataset.\n\nUsing a Random Forest regression pipeline with automated feature selection and five-fold cross-validation, the final model achieved R² = 0.9698 and RMSE = $445.36, explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. Comparative analysis showed that SDOH-only models explained 34% of variance, utilization-only models 95%, and the integrated PBM + SDOH model 97%, confirming that economic, behavioral, and access factors jointly shape fiscal burden. Global SHAP and permutation-importance analyses identified cost per claim, claims per 1,000 population, and opioid-prescribing rate as dominant predictors, amplified by structural vulnerabilities such as unemployment, income inequality, and low mental-health-provider density.\n\nCounterfactual simulations quantified the potential financial impact of PBM and SDOH interventions. PBM levers—including formulary tightening, prescriber-utilization guidance, and cost-per-claim reduction—produced short-term savings of approximately 4–6%. SDOH improvements, such as expanded primary-care and mental-health capacity and reductions in behavioral-risk prevalence, generated larger compounding effects, with integrated PBM + SDOH reforms yielding national savings of roughly 17% (≈$23 billion annually). Geographic patterns aligned with CDC dispensing-rate distributions, with the highest predicted cost burden concentrated in Utah, Kentucky, and Alabama.\n\nThis integrated analytical framework demonstrates how combining PBM program design with SDOH modeling can inform equitable policy, optimize healthcare spending, and guide targeted interventions in the ongoing U.S. opioid crisis.\n\nKeywords: opioid prescribing; social determinants of health; pharmacy benefit management; Medicare Part D; machine learning; public health policy.",

          "abstract": "Since 2017, Western scholarly publishers have faced growing pressure from Chinese state regulators to restrict access to politically sensitive content or risk losing market access. This study examines the conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. \n\nSelf-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China. Participants demonstrated shared conceptualizations of censorship and liberal-democratic values favouring resistance but diverged on whether China-based scholars' interests should inform responses. Collaborative resistance requires expanding stakeholder coalitions to include research funders and librarians through industry-wide frameworks analogous to the Global Network Initiative.",

Yet, why and from whom resilience is required is often overlooked.

From a social reproduction perspective, I posit that the demands and capacities for resilience are unequally shared within families, across generations and following a gendered pattern.\nMETHOD\nI rely on cohort data from children’s early years to adolescence (Growing Up in Ireland, 2008-2022) to estimate growth-curve and OLS models for prosocial development and outcomes tied to caregiving.\nFINDINGS\nChildren whose mothers experienced job loss exhibit steeper prosocial development. Girls with younger siblings drive this finding. At age 13, the same group is more likely to share and fulfil caregiving duties. Findings suggest that mothers might have leaned on their children to maintain some paid work after job loss, stimulating their daughters’ prosocial development and involvement in caregiving.\nCONTRIBUTION\nThe study highlights how economic downturns reinforce the gendered and generational underpinnings that bind the paid and unpaid work of family resilience.",

          "abstract": "The risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) is closely tied to attitudes justifying IPV at individual, couple and societal levels. We analysed how women’s IPV risk varies with their own and their spouse’s attitudes, local community acceptance and country-level gender equality. Using data from 148,421 couples across 30 low- and middle-income countries and 34 Indian states, we estimated Bayesian regression models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with uninformative priors. IPV justification and IPV experience varied significantly across and within countries. Women’s risk was more strongly associated with their own attitudes than with their husbands’ attitudes. Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV. Country-level gender equality consistently reduced women’s risk regardless of couples’ attitudes. These findings suggest that focusing solely on couples where husbands perpetrate IPV is insufficient. Sustainable prevention efforts must also address community norms and structural gender inequality.",

          "authors": "Sulagna Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "Geopolitical risk has emerged as a persistent feature of the global business environment, yet its impacts on domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) remain underexplored, particularly in emerging economies with distinctive institutional contexts. This study examines how geopolitical risk influences M&amp;A deal failure in India and whether acquirers’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates this relationship under the country’s mandatory CSR regime. Using a sample of 377 domestic M&amp;A deals announced between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: higher geopolitical risk is associated with a lower likelihood of deal failure, suggesting that firms pursue domestic consolidation as a defensive hedge against external volatility. While acquirers’ CSR performance independently reduces the probability of deal failure, its interaction with high geopolitical risk increases the likelihood of failure. It indicates that strong CSR commitments may constrain financial flexibility during uncertain times, thereby heightening deal vulnerability. These results remain robust across alternative model specifications, sub-samples, and disaggregated geopolitical risk measures. By integrating geopolitical risk with a legally enforced CSR spending regime, this study provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of how macro-political turbulence and regulatory social responsibility jointly shape corporate M&amp;A outcomes in emerging markets. These findings re-conceptualize CSR as a potential financial constraint under regulation and advance the understanding of firm behavior at the intersection of risk, responsibility, and regulation.",
