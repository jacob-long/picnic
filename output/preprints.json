          "authors": "Mare Knibbe; Sarah de Rijcke; Bart Penders",
          "abstract": "In order to build legitimacy, we argue that reform movements need to make their moral programmes visible and account for their value-prioritisation . To support such reflection on moral programmes, we compare moral programs of the protestant Reformation and the reform movement in science. We argue that moral programs play a crucial role in shaping science, and different moral programs offer different promises for sustained support of credible, reliable, fair, and equitable science. We primarily discuss the virtue and equity programmes and through interrogating both reform programmes in relation to the Reformation, we seek to display the relevance of sociopolitical contexts for how key values operate in science and how they generate orders of worth. These conversations will allow us to determine when and where which moral programme would serve us and others best.",

          "abstract": "This protocol aims to address two metaresearch questions: what do we know about the science underlying impactful legal decisions and how can we assess this evidence efficiently and accurately, such that it is usable for courts? To do so, this protocol describes our plan for a systematic review of the literature underlying whether there are reliable indicators of the manner of death in stab wound cases. Evidence of nature was recently found admissible at the High Court of Australia in Lang v The Queen. However, despite the High Court uncritically accepting this evidence, there has never been a systematic review that critically appraises the relevant literature. Beyond the review itself, we will fully document our process and all of the time-saving tools we rely on to provide knowledge about whether systematic reviews of this nature can be efficiently deployed in legal proceedings.",

          "authors": "Wen Wen; Hakan Aktaş; Acer Yu-Chan Chang; Jie Mei; Yosuke Suzuishi; Yukie Nagai; Satoshi Nobusako",
          "abstract": "The sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of controlling one’s own actions and, through them, external events. It is a crucial aspect of consciousness, indicating that an agent can understand the causal relationship between their actions and environmental changes and, more importantly, voluntarily influence the environment through their actions. There has been extensive debate about when children and which animals possess the sense of agency, primarily because they cannot easily report it. Observing actions might be a promising way to estimate the sense of agency without relying on introspection. However, despite actions containing rich information about human subjective feelings, there are very few ways to abstract such information. In the present study, we aim to clarify the relationship between actions and the sense of agency during control exploration using a dataset of 167 children (6-16 years old) acquired by Nobusako et al. (2022). We employ action plan analysis developed by Chang et al. (2024) to analyze motion sequences data which was self-generated by participants during a control detection task. The action plan analysis uses transformer-LSTM-based autoencoders to capture high-level, abstract representations of sequences of motor commands (referred to as action plans). This approach allows us to quantify action plan diversity that reflects control exploration behaviors. The results showed that action plan diversity can be a promising way to measure the sense of agency both within individuals and among them. This suggests that simply observing how actions change under different control conditions can quantitatively reflect the emergence of the sense of agency in children. The findings and methodology provide a highly novel and useful tool for studying the sense of agency in broader populations and species in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Psychological distress that stems from racial discrimination experiences may depend on how strongly individuals identify with their race. Existing findings across survey research and a small body of experimental research are equivocal on whether and how racial identity factors exacerbate or buffer the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination. This study included experimental and survey data to characterize the moderating roles of racial identity centrality, private regard, and public regard in the associations between racial discrimination and psychological distress. Participants were 240 young adults of color (Mage=23.27; 50.8% women; 37.5% Asian American, 35.4% Hispanic/Latino, 15.8% Black/African American; 56.7% college students). Findings generally converged across experimental and survey methods. Simulated racial discrimination predicted acute psychological distress and measured lifetime racial discrimination predicted general psychological distress, but racial identity factors did not moderate these associations. Considerations for these null results and future research directions are discussed.",

          "title": "The influence of sport expertise on response and cognitive inhibition",
          "authors": "Jack Brimmell; Naomi Lee; Matthew Spokes",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that sporting experts show better response inhibition. Less is known about how expert athletes use cognitive inhibition to ‘forget’ previous errors (termed expertise-induced-amnesia). Moreover, whether the relevance of sporting expertise is greater at high-pressure, compared to low-pressure is also unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine if sporting expertise predicted response inhibition (effectiveness and efficiency) and cognitive inhibition (error awareness) and the impact of pressure levels on these relationships. Forty-five participants completed a measure of sporting expertise and a modified Stop Signal Task under two pressure conditions (i.e., high- and low-pressure). Regression results suggested that expertise only significantly predicted response inhibition effectiveness and efficiency at high-pressure. Interestingly, error awareness at high- and low-pressure were independent of sporting expertise. Finally, change scores across pressure conditions were small and near zero for all participants, not just experts, suggesting that all individuals performed similarly across low- and high-pressure conditions. Sporting expertise appears to facilitate response inhibition at high-pressure but the exact methods in which experts ‘forget’ errors and maintain performance remains unknown (i.e., might not be cognitive inhibition).",

          "abstract": "[from introduction] Whenever people to talk—whether they are telling stories, giving directions, sharing gossip, teaching children, cooking food, or counting objects—they accompany their speech with meaningful body movements, or gestures. These gestures may be produced with the hands, arms, head, and face; they may be subtle or salient, idiosyncratic or culturally shared; they include points and shrugs, nods and winks, depictions of shapes and imitations of actions. While much is made of cultural differences in the amount of gesture, the fact is that human communication everywhere involves a steady hum of kinetic activity. New Guinea is no exception.",

          "authors": "Robin Karlin; Emily Tesch; dinglanTang; Yuyu Zeng; Caroline A Niziolek; Benjamin Parrell",
          "abstract": "Sensory feedback is crucial for maintaining accurate motor control. One process of movement correction is sensorimotor adaptation, or motor learning in response to perceived sensory errors. Recent studies have demonstrated that people can simultaneously adapt to opposing errors on a single movement (e.g., leftward and rightward errors on a reach) given some context that differentiates when each error occurs. In speech production, linguistic structure (e.g., the same vowel in different words) has been shown to provide sufficient context for adapting to opposing errors, but it is not clear whether this is restricted to the same effectors (i.e. lips, tongue, jaw in the oral cavity) or also includes movements of other effectors used in speech (i.e., the vocal folds in the larynx). While manual reaching studies have shown that contextual movements need not be produced with the same effector as the learning target, they have thus far only tested left-right effector pairs. We present the results of three simultaneous adaptation experiments in speech that examine whether laryngeal movements for pitch control can provide context for oral articulatory movements for vowels. In each experiment, the resonances that correlate with articulator position during vowels were perturbed in three different directions that were predictable given a pitch context. First, Mandarin speakers differentially adapted given pitch contexts that signaled differences in word meaning, suggesting that lexical uses of pitch provide context for vowels. Second, English speakers differentially adapted given different arbitrary pitch matching contexts on the word “head”, suggesting that even non-meaningful pitch movements provide context for vowels. Third, English speakers were unable to differentially adapt when simply listening to a contextual pitch, indicating that mere auditory input of pitch is insufficient. Together, these results indicate that sensorimotor context for learning can be provided by different effectors than the learning target.",

          "authors": "Gabor Csifcsak; Samy Mohammed Engebø Babiker; Federica Luzzi; Matthias Mittner",
          "abstract": "Pain negatively affects several cognitive abilities, but knowledge about its effect on reinforcement learning (RL) is limited. During RL, instrumental choices can be influenced by heuristic tendencies to approach rewards or inhibit actions when facing potentially aversive events, introducing “Pavlovian bias” in behavior. Recent studies suggest that compromised outcome controllability enhances Pavlovian bias, a phenomenon that may be linked to suboptimal decision-making in learned helplessness (LH). Since LH is common in chronic pain syndromes, this study sought to establish a link between experimental heat pain (EHP), uncontrollable reward/loss and RL performance in healthy adults. In addition, we investigated if intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the medial prefrontal/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/dACC) alleviates the deleterious effects of EHP on choice behavior. In a pre-registered, 2x2 between-group, double-blind study (N = 100), healthy adult participants underwent 3 blocks of an orthogonalized Go/NoGo task with two interleaved bouts of active or sham iTBS, and either EHP or warm skin stimulation combined with compromised outcome controllability during the task. Although EHP did not impact overall performance, it invigorated actions for rewards, reflecting enhanced Pavlovian bias. While two bouts of iTBS attenuated Pavlovian tendencies, this effect was counteracted by EHP, indicating antagonistic effects of pain and iTBS-modulated mPFC activity on Pavlovian-instrumental interactions. Surprisingly, EHP and iTBS exerted largely similar effects on other latent parameters of RL (go-bias, learning rate, exploration) in a manner that resembled LH. These findings shed light on the role of experimental pain and mPFC/dACC activity in LH-like choice behavior.",

          "authors": "Briana Shiri Last; Danielle Adams; Rebecca Mirhashem",
          "abstract": "As mental health treatment seeking has increased recently, U.S. public mental health therapists have been asked to do more with less. Facing growing work demands, many have left the workforce, exacerbating existing mental health workforce shortages and mental health inequities. However, a growing share of therapists have sought to improve their working conditions through labor organizing. This qualitative study explored how unionized public mental health therapists in New York City and Chicago experience and seek to address their workplace challenges. Participants (N = 30) were interviewed for 60-90 minutes to gain their in-depth perspectives; interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The research team identified four main themes. First, public mental health therapists described that their under-resourced and diverse patients have complex social service and clinical needs —needs therapists are highly motivated to address. Second, therapists described significant workplace challenges (e.g., staffing shortages, demanding workloads, low pay, insufficient clinical support). Third, therapists described that these workplace challenges negatively impact them emotionally and negatively impact the care their under-resourced patients receive. Fourth, therapists described reasons for and benefits to labor organizing including improving their work conditions and the quality of services. Findings revealed that public mental health therapists are intrinsically motivated to support their under-resourced patients, but that their labor conditions often hinder them from offering the high-quality care they feel their patients deserve. Public mental health therapists across both cities view labor unions as a vehicle through which they can improve their working conditions and the treatment conditions of their patients.",

          "abstract": "Across two studies, we examined the Imagined Cognitive Dissonance in a French context (ICD, Cooper et al., 2018). Specifically, Study 1 investigates the effect of vicarious ICD, the dissonance felt when the participant imagines an ingroup member acting counterattitudinally (Cooper et al., 2018). We failed to replicate the effect of vicarious ICD (N = 236) on behavioral intentions. In Study 2, we examined the personal ICD effect: can the mere act of imagining oneself acting counterattitudinally induce cognitive dissonance in subjects? The results are partially in line with the hypotheses of an effect of personal ICD on the subject’s pro-environmental behavioral intention (N = 252). We discuss these results, their implications, limits, and propose directions for future research on dissonance.",

          "abstract": "Historically, memory and language have been seen as separate cognitive functions and studied in isolation. To date, it remains an open question to what extent these cognitive domains are related. The central question in this paper is how we should see the relationship between the domains of language and memory. We discuss relevant empirical evidence from the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience and take a philosophical perspective on this central question, considering issues such as how to weigh different types of evidence and how to conceptualize the relationship between language and memory. We conclude that elucidating questions about the nature of the relationship between language and memory requires not only more empirical data, but also parallel conceptual development.",

          "authors": "Pirooz Falahi; Amir Jahanian Najafabadi; Reza Kazemi; Javad Hatami",
          "abstract": "The sense of agency (SoA) refers to the perception that one's actions are influential and that one assumes responsibility for their consequences. In coordinated joint actions, a sense of joint agency emerges, with interaction and cooperation being crucial for enhancing SoA. Prior research indicates that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is integral to monitoring social contexts of SoA, while the left angular gyrus (lAG) focuses on individual aspects of agency. This study examined the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on SoA and judgment of performance (JoP) in eighteen healthy young participants using a three-way crossover design that included inhibitory neurostimulation of the rTPJ, excitatory stimulation of the lAG, and a sham intervention on the Vertex. Participants completed musical tasks involving rhythmic coordination before and after neurostimulation, with self-reported scores for SoA and JoP collected via Likert scales, alongside performance metrics (action time error and number of errors) evaluated through software. While rTMS did not yield significant effects on SoA, JoP, or performance overall, notable correlations between these variables suggest that neurostimulation may influence the interrelations among them. These findings highlight the complexities of how neurostimulation impacts perceived agency and performance, warranting further exploration into their interconnected dynamics.\nKeywords: transcranial magnetic stimulation, right temporoparietal junction, left angular gyrus, sense of joint agency, musical rhythmic coordination, joint action",

In the literature, various factors are discussed as potential inclusion, exclusion, or limiting criteria in BC.\nMethod: Our aim for this interview study was to gain a deeper understanding of the factors psychotherapists consider when inviting patients to participate in BC. For this purpose, we interviewed seven psychotherapists with a psychodynamic and seven psychotherapists with a cognitive behavioral background who participate in a naturalistic trial on BC in routine outpatient psychotherapy. \nResults: Psychotherapists considered few fixed inclusion or exclusion criteria when considering which patients to introduce BC to. The basic technical requirements had to be met and the patients had to be fit for outpatient therapy. Psychotherapists found patients’ response to BC, like their motivation, to be a decisive factor when considering BC. \nDiscussion: Patient motivation for BC emerged as another potential bottleneck in its implementation. Therefore, a successful implementation strategy should focus on strengthening both psychotherapists' and patients' motivation to engage with BC. The openness of psychotherapists towards patient characteristics suggests that BC in outpatient care may target a broad patient population.",

In a correlational study (n1 = 1,447) and two digital field experiments (n2 = 494, n3 = 1,133), we examined whether (un)following hyperpartisan social media influencers contributes to polarization and misinformation sharing. We found that incentivizing Twitter/X users to unfollow hyperpartisan social media influencers improved feelings toward the out-party by 23.5% compared to the control group, with effects persisting for at least six months. Unfollowing also led participants to engage with more accurate news and increased satisfaction with their Twitter/X feeds—without reducing engagement. This study demonstrates the long-term causal impact of exposure to hyperpartisan influencers. Moreover, unlike other social media reduction interventions, unfollowing is a targeted approach: like a scalpel, it surgically removes a few harmful parts of one’s feed, allowing the beneficial aspects to remain.",

          "abstract": "Most work on working memory development has children remember a set of items as well as they can. However, this approach sidesteps the Extended Mind, the integration of external information with memory. Indeed, adults prefer to use external resources (lists, models) but will remember more as the ‘cost’ to access them increases. Here, in our Shopping Game, we investigated this trade-off in 5-8-year-olds. Using a touch-screen, children shopped in a virtual store. Their shopping list and the store were not visible simultaneously but could be toggled. We manipulated access cost by varying a delay (0 / 4 s) before the list’s reappearance. Across three preregistered experiments at two sites (US / China, N=141), a pattern emerged: when costlier, children revisited the list less often, studied it longer, and selected more correct items. Also, children recognized the costs, identifying the 0-delay condition as easier. Young children show a cost-dependent trade-off of external resource use versus working memory.",

          "abstract": "Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where victims are led to doubt their own thoughts, perception of reality, or memories. Despite the growing popularity of the term and purported harmful implications, empirical efforts to operationalize and define gaslighting remain sparse. This study aimed to define common features and themes of self-reported gaslighting experiences. Young adults (N=250) completed several questionnaires and open-ended prompts relating to gaslighting experiences. Using a variety of natural language processing techniques, we explore the gaslighting construct using a data-driven approach from the perspective of self-reported targets of gaslighting. These data confirm that gaslighting is a type of interpersonal manipulation aimed at making a person feel 'crazy' or doubt their memories. Romantic partners were reported to be the most common perpetrators of gaslighting, and both beneficial (e.g., awareness of manipulative people) and detrimental (e.g., self-doubt) consequences of experiencing gaslighting appear to be long-lasting. Additionally, we found that more severe, frequent, and long-lasting gaslighting experiences are associated with broader subjective memory deficits, even extending to other memories outside of the gaslighting event itself. This study highlights pervasive cognitive and psychological impacts of gaslighting, and underscores the need for further empirical research and informed clinical strategies.",

However, these chatbots may hallucinate, or generate incorrect but very plausible-sounding information, more frequently than previously thought.  Thus, it is crucial to examine strategies to mitigate human susceptibility to hallucinated output.  In a between-subjects experiment, participants completed a difficult quiz with assistance from either a polite or neutral-toned AI chatbot, which occasionally provided hallucinated (incorrect) information.  Signal detection analysis revealed that participants interacting with polite-AI showed modestly higher sensitivity in detecting hallucinations and a more conservative response bias compared to those interacting with neutral-toned AI.  While the observed effect sizes were modest, even small improvements in users' ability to detect AI hallucinations can have significant consequences, particularly in high-stakes domains or when aggregated across millions of AI interactions.",

          "authors": "Anirudh Tiwathia; Abdurakhim Rakhimov; Stylianos Syropoulos; Erik Thulin",
          "abstract": "Featuring climate content on screen is believed to be a highly efficient strategy for shifting audiences’ climate beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. With this objective, major studios and other media organizations have launched initiatives to increase the prevalence of climate content. Despite various psychological theories proposed for how climate content may influence beliefs resulting in climate action, many studies assessing the empirical evidence for this pathway rely on cross-sectional analyses with severely limited causal attribution and nearly all studies only measure the impact at a single point in time, limiting our understanding of the persistence of any estimated impact. In this study, we address these limitations through a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 1,014), estimating the impact of watching narrative climate content (a climate focused episode of the television series Madam Secretary) on a set of climate beliefs and attitudes, including belief in climate change, endorsement of government action, social norms around climate action, and other drivers of personal action. These measures were assessed at baseline, as well as three later points (immediately post-viewing, 3-5 days post-viewing, and 7-10 days post-viewing). We find that watching narrative climate content can significantly increase pro-climate beliefs and attitudes. While these positive changes tend to decline across time, they often persist 7-10 days post-viewing. This finding lends credible causal evidence for the claim that on-screen narrative climate fiction has the power to shift relevant climate beliefs and attitudes, even significantly post-viewership, and may be an effective tool supporting large scale social change towards climate action.",

          "abstract": "Languages exhibit a tremendous amount of variation in how they organise and order morphemes within words; however, regularities are also found. For example, gender and number inflectional morphology tend to appear together within a single affix. In the relatively rare cases in which they appear as two separate affixes, morphology encoding gender information tends to be placed closer to the stem than number morphology is. Alternative theories of gender and number have been designed (in part) to explain these tendencies. However, the typological data are very sparse, making it difficult to find clear evidence for the representations and mechanisms shaping the organisation of gender and number. Across a series of experiments, we use an artificial language learning paradigm to explore the inferences learners make about the order of gender and number affixes in the absence of any explicit information in the input. We show that language learners have a clear preference for placing nominal morphology containing gender information closest to the stem. This holds both for prefixing and suffixing morphology, and across different types of gender and number systems. Importantly, these biases are consistent across populations of participants with different L1 experience with gender morphology: English, Italian and Kîîtharaka speakers. These results provide a new source of empirical support for particular theories of gender, and in line with previous work, suggest that cognitive biases play a role in determining morpheme order in the world’s languages.",

          "authors": "Anne M van Valkengoed; Linda Steg; Goda Perlaviciute",
          "abstract": "Sustainable lifestyle changes are an important demand-side solution to reduce CO2 emissions. While sustainable lifestyles are increasingly included in integrated assessment models, modellers have so far not managed to realistically model what drives changes in lifestyles. Important questions about the feasibility and likelihood of lifestyle change, and how lifestyle changes can be accelerated or promoted thus go unanswered. Environmental psychology is a discipline dedicated to understanding environmental behaviour, and its theories and findings could therefore be instrumental to informing the modelling of lifestyle change in integrated assessment models. Yet, we identify two barriers currently hinder the systematic integration of this knowledge into integrated assessment modelling. The first barrier is plurality: there are many theories and findings that are potentially relevant to modelling lifestyle change, but guidance is lacking on which to apply when. The second barrier is ambiguity: many theories in psychology are not precise enough to unambiguously translate them into a mathematical model. To overcome the barrier of plurality, we introduce the Motivation, Agency, and Past behaviour (MAP) framework, which summarises and integrates the insights of 8 prominent behavioural theories used in environmental psychology and that can be used to determine which theories and determinants are most relevant for specific modelling applications. To overcome the barrier of ambiguity, we identify three areas where the precision of theorizing in environmental psychology can be improved, namely definitions and consistent use of constructs, the specification of relationships between constructs, and describing the strength and boundary conditions of these relationships. We urge for closer collaborations between modellers and environmental psychologists to successfully model the drivers and impacts of sustainable lifestyle change.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the use of diversity indices, typically employed in ecological studies, to measure verbal behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder. By drawing comparisons between species richness and abundance, we applied Shannon entropy and beta diversity measures to assess the diversity and distribution of a verbal repertoire over time. This analysis utilized the outcomes of three verbal operant experimental analyses that use a multi-element design to test for the occurrence of four elementary verbal operants. Using archival data, diversity measures were then used to conduct a detailed analysis of the richness and evenness of verbal responses. The results demonstrate that beta diversity and Shannon entropy effectively capture the richness and distribution of the verbal repertoire over time. These findings suggest that diversity indices can provide a robust framework for assessing language development and the effectiveness of interventions. This research underscores the importance of integrating ecological diversity models into behavioral science to better understand complex human behaviors like language. Future applications of this method may allow for more complex analysis of verbal behavior within and across individuals and interventions.",

This study tested whether these effects reflect task-effects or genuine word recognition processes, using the visual world paradigm in eye-tracking. Participants heard auditory stimuli of disyllabic Dutch stress pairs (e.g., VOORnaam vs. voorNAAM) with clear or ambiguous stress cues, while seeing videos of a talker in the center of the screen producing a beat gesture on the first or second syllable (or no gesture). Results showed that on stress-ambiguous trials, beat gestures guided word recognition in an on-line manner, similar to acoustic stress cues. For instance, a beat gesture on the first syllable biased looks towards VOORnaam before word offset. These results suggest that beat gestures – despite their limited inherent meaning – can affect on-line lexical access.",

          "abstract": "We conduct tests of a hybrid-similarity exemplar model on its ability to account for the context-dependent memorability of items embedded in high-dimensional category spaces. According to the model, recognition judgments are based on the summed similarity of test items to studied exemplars. The model allows for the idea that “self-similarity” among objects differs due to matching on highly salient distinctive features. Participants viewed a study list of rock images belonging to geologically defined categories where the number of studied items from each category was manipulated.  Following study, the participants’ old-new recognition memory performance was tested.  We also manipulated across experiments the nature of the encoding task used during the study phase:  Experiment 1 used a category-description matching task, whereas Experiment 2 used more neutral encoding instructions. Hit rates were markedly lower in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1 and participants relied less on the presence of distinctive features for recognizing old items in the second experiment.  With a minimum of parameter estimation, the hybrid-similarity model provided good accounts of a wide variety of fundamental benchmark phenomena across the two experiments.  These included changing levels of memorability due to contextual effects of category size, within- and between-category similarity, and the presence of distinctive features.  However, the hybrid model and a variety of extensions of the model fell short in accounting for the variability in hit rates within the class of old target items themselves.  We discuss future directions for potentially improving upon the current predictions from the model.",

Two experiments (N= 324) examined the role of selective attention in the emergence and prevention of learning traps. Participants learned to approach or avoid members of two categories that were associated with either gains or losses. A rule involving two visual feature dimensions predicted category membership, while a third dimension was irrelevant. Category feedback was provided only when an item was approached. Selective attention during learning was assessed using an eye tracker. Experiment 1 found that many participants fell into the trap of using a single-dimension rule to guide approach/avoid decisions and consequently missed rewards. Eye tracking confirmed that these participants narrowed their visual attention to a single dimension. In Experiment 2, we manipulated visual feature salience across three groups and found evidence for a causal role of selective attention in determining the emergence and prevalence of learning traps.",

          "authors": "Oliver Brady; Paul Nulty; LIli Zhang; Tomas Ward; David McGovern",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a wide range of everyday decision-making scenarios, transforming the way people make choices and interact with technology. However, despite their seemingly ‘superhuman’ capabilities, LLMs are not infallible and can exhibit pitfalls in their decision-making abilities if not deployed with caution. This review aims to analyse the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by comparing their abilities to humans through the lens of dual process theory. Guided by this framework, it is clear that LLMs can mimic both human-like System 1 thinking – exhibiting cognitive biases and relying on heuristics to support decision-making processes –  and slower System 2 thinking through prompting methods like chain-of-thought reasoning. As LLMs have advanced, they have become more adept at comprehending tasks; however, they can still exhibit biases and make errors, some of which appear similar to human cognitive biases. What remains unclear, however, is the extent to which the processes in AI systems that lead to decision-making biases are truly analogous to those in human cognition, or if they are primarily a byproduct of the human-produced data and algorithms used to train the models. Moreover, LLMs can exhibit their own unique, nonhuman biases, such as hallucinations and overconfidence, that currently limit their application to real-world decision-making applications. Nonetheless, these models hold significant potential to revolutionise the way we make decisions across a diverse range of sectors. Thus, we conclude the review by offering recommendations for future research and practical suggestions on how to leverage LLMs to augment human decision-making.",

          "authors": "Carolyn Kroger; Deborah R. Fu; Renee M. Banakis Hartl; Anahita Mehta",
          "abstract": "Pitch, timing, and space in auditory perception interact, causing changes in one dimension to distort judgments of others (Boltz, 1998; Henry et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2006). The auditory kappa effect exemplifies this, as larger pitch changes between sequential tones create an illusion of longer time intervals (Cohen et al., 1954). Traditionally studied with three-tone sequences (‘A-X-B’), this effect shows that varying the middle tone’s pitch relative to the first and third tones skews time interval perception. The prevailing auditory motion hypothesis (Henry &amp; McAuley, 2009) proposes that a “pitch velocity” is inferred from a consistent pitch trajectory. We tested this against the auditory grouping hypothesis, which proposes that feature similarity affects perceived timing. Experiment 1 tested the kappa effect under varying pitch separations, revealing slower pitch velocities produced larger effects, contradicting the motion hypothesis. Experiment 2 examined inconsistent pitch trajectories to challenge the stability of pitch velocity referents, and still found kappa effects, further supporting the auditory grouping hypothesis. Experiment 3 investigated the kappa effect in auditory space, confirming that sounds presented closer in space are judged as occurring closer in time. These findings suggest that the kappa effect results from the grouping of auditory events by feature similarity, opposing the auditory motion hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Nature benefits stress recovery. However, few studies have examined if individual differences in emotion regulation moderate the restorative effect of nature. I investigated to what extent experiential, physiological, and neural components of stress recovery during nature scene viewing are moderated by individual differences in the habitual use of expressive suppression in daily lives. Thirty-three college students were induced acute stress by a standard laboratory stressor (mental arithmetic). Then they viewed nature scenes with different sunlight conditions and a blank screen as baseline control, immediately after which they rated their relaxation levels. Simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals were used to derive functional coupling between prefrontal and posterior cortical regions in alpha oscillation, an indicator of visual attention. Peripheral physiology, skin conductance (SCR) and heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating sympathetic and parasympathetic activities, respectively, were also recorded. Results showed that experiential and physiological outcomes of nature scenes differed by individual differences in expressive suppression. Specifically, high expressive suppression was associated with lower relaxation and HRV in some nature scenes. SCR is invariant across nature scenes or expressive suppression. Furthermore, visual perception of nature scenes may require more involuntary attention; therefore, EEG alpha coupling was reduced. Alpha coupling during nature scenes predicted subjective relaxation, depending on expressive suppression. The present study indicates that individuals high in expressive suppression may not benefit to the same degree as those lower in expressive suppression during nature scene exposure. Future studies on stress processing by integrating environment, brain, body, and individual traits are valuable.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing recognition of the potential benefits of video games, the positive psychological impact of narrative role-playing games (RPGs) remains understudied. These games, with their immersive storytelling, are uniquely positioned to foster meaningful engagement. However, known protective factors for well-being such as positive emotions and character interactions - otherwise known as parasocial interactions - have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this study employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the design elements underlying positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs, combining an online questionnaire with open- and closed-ended questions completed by 100 participants and in-depth interviews with 10 individuals. Linear regression analyses demonstrated reciprocal predictive relationships between positive affect and parasocial interactions as well as positive affect and negative affect. Additionally, reflexive thematic analysis generated six themes that captured how players experienced these effects in narrative RPGs, ranging from the freedom of immersion to narrative soundness. Based on these insights, a set of research-informed recommendations targeted towards optimising player well-being was produced for developers of this genre. Overall, it is suggested that narrative-gameplay consistency, fantasy-reality balance, and negative but meaningful experiences stimulate positive emotions and meaningful parasocial interactions in narrative RPGs,\nproviding implications for the future research, design, and evaluation of this genre.",

          "abstract": "This paper addresses a problem that arises from the ontological commitments of Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 4.0, particularly its stance that only conscious entities truly exist. This position leads to the \"origin of consciousness problem\": if non-conscious entities do not truly exist, how could consciousness have evolved from non-conscious ancestors? We explore several responses IIT might offer, such as the co-origin of life and consciousness, or the idea that non-conscious ancestors might have been constituted by \"ontological dust\"—minimally conscious, intrinsic micro-entities collectively aggregated to form bigger objects lacking unified consciousness.  Our analysis shows that IIT’s ontological framework, along with scientific knowledge regarding biological evolution, prebiotic chemical structures, and physical cosmology, ultimately forces the theory into positing a form of  \"Big Bang consciousness\", that is, a primordial ontological dust constituted by minimally conscious elementary particles created soon after the Big Bang. Although IIT may accept this striking implication, we think that it introduces tensions with both the received scientific view of the evolutionary origin of consciousness and the cosmological understanding of early universe components. We also present but ultimately reject an alternative option based on what we call the “formless stuff hypothesis”, which might avoid the implication that consciousness originates from nothing as well as the necessity of a \"Big Bang consciousness”.  We conclude by suggesting that IIT's metaphysical commitments, especially the equation true existence=phenomenal existence, require re-examination to reconcile its framework with standard scientific knowledge, and in particular, with the received view about the phylogenetic origin of consciousness.",

We then conducted a quantitative user study involving 230 participants, who evaluated these responses by determining whether they were AI-generated and assessed their agreement with the responses. Human evaluators preferred LLMs’ assessments in moral scenarios, though a systematic anti-AI bias was observed: participants were less likely to agree with judgments they believed to be machine-generated.

          "abstract": "Visual narrative comprehension is essential for navigating modern society, where information, rules, and news are frequently communicated through images, diagrams, and visual stories. Encoding a coherent narrative from disparate elements is critical for all age groups. Although recent data indicate that stress levels have risen compared to previous decades, the impact of stress on visual narrative comprehension remains underexplored. This study explored how acute stress affects narrative comprehension in younger (N = 203, 18-57 years; M = 23 years; Experiment 1) and older adults (N = 212, 60-85 years; M = 67 years; Experiment 2). Participants were assessed under both acute stress and neutral conditions. A tool for inducing acute stress online employed mathematical and logical tasks under time pressure, along with elements that simulate social stress. Participants were presented with pictorial stories comprising three panels, where the second panel was intentionally left blank. Their task was to comprehend the stories and determine whether the presented pictorial inference for the missing event was correct or incorrect. Results revealed that acute stress negatively impacted narrative comprehension in younger adults, while the older adults' comprehension remained unaffected by acute stress. Similarly, younger adults demonstrated reduced confidence in their responses under stress, whereas older adults’ confidence levels remained unaffected. These findings highlight the relationship between visual narrative comprehension, stress, and aging, suggesting that, with age and experience, comprehenders may develop more differentiated event schemas, which makes their comprehension processes more resilient to stress.\n\nPublic Significance Statement: \nUnderstanding how cognitive and perceptional processes function under stress is crucial for daily life across all age groups. Our research demonstrates that acute stress leads to a decline in visual narrative comprehension only in younger adults, while older adults' narrative comprehension remains stable despite stress. This finding suggests that older adults may employ more effective coping mechanisms, which helps maintain their cognitive stability in the face of stress. Consequently, narrative comprehension appears to be more resilient compared to other fundamental cognitive skills. These insights could inform interventions and strategies to support cognitive health across different age groups.",

          "abstract": "Daily events like a relationship conflict, a work-related success, or a pleasant meeting with a friend can significantly influence people’s well-being and mental health. To fully understand their psychological effects, different theories stress that people’s subjective perception of daily events must be considered. However, a systematic examination of the perceived characteristics of daily events is still missing, which has led to jingle-jangle problems and the negligence of their perceived characteristics in existing research. To overcome these problems, we conducted a systematic literature review and four empirical studies (Ntotal = 1,468) to develop a taxonomy that systematically captures the perception of daily events on eight dimensions: positive emotion, challenge, relevance, threat to self, predictability, duty, sociality, and external control. Furthermore, we validated a measure – the Daily Event Questionnaire – to reliably and validly assess these perceived characteristics of daily events. Applying our taxonomy and measure, we found that the perception of daily events systematically differed from the perception of everyday situations. Moreover, the perception of daily events predicted fluctuations in daily and weekly well-being over time. We discuss how this dimensional taxonomy of perceived event characteristics may advance future research and theory development regarding the effects of daily events on well-being and discuss similarities and differences between our taxonomy and taxonomies of the perception of situations and major life events.",

          "abstract": "The “Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test” (RMET) is one of the most used tests of theory of mind. Its principle is to match an emotion word to the corresponding face image. The performance at this test has been associated with multiple psychological variables including personality, loneliness and empathy. Recently, however, the reliability of the RMET has been questioned. An alternative version of the test has been tested using eye-tracking (Russell et al., 2021) in addition to manual responses and was hypothesized to be more reliable. Here, we put this hypothesis to the test by attempting to reproduce already-assessed correlational results between the performance at the classical RMET and the self-reported personality, loneliness and empathy, now using eye-gaze as an RMET performance index. Despite a marked eye-gaze bias towards the face image corresponding to the target word, the eye-gaze pattern correlated with none of the self-reported psychological variables. This result highlights the interest in using eye-tracking for theory of mind tests, while questioning the robustness of the association between psychological variables and RMET performance, and the reliability of the RMET itself.",

          "abstract": "Similarity in mental, linguistic representations modulates the degree of recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms, which have been linked to neurocognitive adaptations in bilingual populations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its coverage is limited, as testing is geared towards WEIRD communities that use sizeable, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. We assess the role of distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank. Analyzing data from 56,122 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect. Our results suggest that moderators such as language distance can shed light on the cognitive divide between language and dialects in a way that addresses the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that unemployed people bear a stigma that builds on the stereotype of \"the unemployed\" and is associated with many adverse individual and collective outcomes. Several studies have described their stereotype and compared it to other groups, but none has done so using the dimensions and facets of the most recent integrated framework of stereotypes. In Study 1 among university students (n = 241), we show that unemployed people are rated lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of their stereotypes, as well as on the facets of capacity, assertiveness, morality and friendliness. In addition, we also show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In study 2, we replicate and extend these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same target of employed people and to the same high-high and low-low occupations. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on the horizontal and the vertical dimensions, as well as on the capacity, assertiveness and friendliness facets but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, that they are overly despised and that unemployment is so disregarded that not having a job is considered worse than having a devalued job.",

          "abstract": "Painting and drawing are symbolic representations that visually transform natural scenes into line and colour expressions. These artworks undergo a series of modifications when transmitted between individuals/communities, known as cultural transmission. The dynamics of cultural transmissions has been investigated experimentally, revealing structured linguistic and musical expressions as their outcomes. Cultural transmissions have also been modelled mathematically, proving a strong influence from a prior knowledge of transmitters. Here, we investigate an emergence of structured colour expression in painting via cultural transmission. We experimentally transmitted colouring books, wherein the participants memorised and reproduced the colour patterns of the book they saw; then, their response was presented as the memorization target for other participants. We expected the outcome of these transmissions represents the prior knowledge about the colour perception of the objects of the colouring books. Our results revealed a certain type of structuring in the last generation of the transmissions, indicated by the consistent use of fewer colours for recognizable segments/objects, compared to the random patterns in the first generation. However, naturalistic colour patterns (e.g. green for leaves) were observed only in some of the transmission chains. These results suggest that, like language and music, colour representations become structured during cultural transmission.",

Employing Item Response Theory, we validate the construct validity of both scales in a pre- registered study in the Netherlands (N = 2,060). Using the same dataset, we also demonstrate their predictive validity. Importantly, the PPIS and NPIS uncover substantial differences in political attitudes and behaviors both between and within individuals who identify as politically (dis)interested. Recognizing political (dis)interest as a social identity enriches our understand- ing of the concept and its implications for politically relevant attitudes and behaviors, while also informing interventions to foster political interest equally across all citizens.",

          "abstract": "The recent review of a new drug application for MDMA-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder by the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) highlighted epistemological and methodological challenges for evidence assessments. Similar challenges will also be faced in reviews of other compounds in early- and late-stage development, like psilocybin for depression. \nThe regulatory demand for two successful phase 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) seems problematic, given a current lack of agreement on what constitutes “success”, particularly when psychoactive drug administration is concomitant with (psycho)therapy. These complex arrangements challenge the internal validity of estimated average treatment effect through comparison with conventional control conditions. \nThis paper reviews the assumptions behind RCTs’ current “gold-standard” status in the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Recapitulating known epistemic limits of randomisation and blinding, it emphasises the urgent need to avoid the extrapolation fallacy. \nThe resulting argument is that the degree of trustworthiness that efficacy — reported in RCTs — will reliably predict effectiveness — in target populations outside RCTs — depends on what type of psychedelic treatments will be regulated. If “stand-alone” drugs for large scale prescription and consumption, trustworthiness should be graded low. On the other hand, for regulation of drug-assisted (psycho)therapies, the degree of trustworthiness can be considered high. The reason being that these two treatment approaches are based on different causal claims with distinct external validities. Therefore, careful assessment of support factors in each is recommended to prevent detrimental consequences, from potential rejection of effective therapies up to medical reversal of eventually approved drugs.",

          "abstract": "A substantial portion of waking life consists of mental experiences that arise involuntarily, including mind-wandering, spontaneous thought and rumination. Given that these experiences are fundamental to cognitive function and mental health, there has been growing scientific and clinical interest in using measures of brain activity to model and predict the momentary occurrence of these various forms of involuntary thought. In the most common machine learning approach in neuroimaging and electrophysiology research, model training data include neural features derived from a population of individuals, and testing is performed on held-out data in one or more individuals. However, sources of idiosyncrasy, such as individual differences in the nature of thought and brain functional organization, raise critical questions regarding whether population-derived neural models can generalize to individuals. In this article, we describe how an idiographic (person-specific) approach has potential to improve theory and practice in predictive neural modeling of involuntary thought. This approach emphasizes dense-sampling of individuals so that a diverse set of brain states and mental experiences can be modeled within a single individual, and rigorous tests of cross-subject generalizability can be performed. We review the advantages and shortcomings of both nomothetic (population-based) and idiographic predictive modeling approaches, including recent insights from dense-sampling neuroimaging studies that demonstrate person-specific brain-based predictions of mind-wandering. We discuss implications for developing personalized clinical biomarkers, strategies to overcome the practical challenges of an idiographic approach, and neuroethical concerns that must be considered as person-specific models may enhance the potential for accurate brain-based predictions of involuntary thought.",

          "abstract": "Many autistic adults report negative long-lasting consequences of their early childhood therapy experiences, and caregivers of young autistic children report that these services do not meet their child’s needs. Additionally, therapies in research contexts will often be implemented in family-centered programs such as Early Intervention (EI), but the child-focused nature of current therapies fail to help caregivers understand and support their child. This demonstrates the misalignment of autism therapy research with the goals of autistic people and caregivers, and the contextual demands of EI. This manuscript reports the outputs of a collaborative project in which 17 autistic adults, autistic caregivers, and non-autistic caregivers of autistic children developed research priorities and guiding principles for future early childhood autism research. These principles and priorities will provide a foundation for autism researchers to develop therapies and supports that are aligned with community needs and priorities, resulting in more equitable and effective practices for the diverse families served through EI and other early childhood therapy programs.

          "abstract": "Across eight pre-registered studies with both convenience and representative samples of American adults (N = 6,464), we provide strong evidence of widespread support for Initiatives for Future Generations (IFGs)—institutions and policies designed to ensure political representation for future generations. Despite broad bipartisan support, Americans significantly underestimate how much their peers favor these initiatives, a phenomenon known as pluralistic ignorance. Nonetheless, providing accurate information about actual levels of IFG support corrects these misperceptions and boosts individual support. Additionally, interventions targeting intergenerational concern—frequently used in the field—effectively enhance support for IFGs without increasing pluralistic ignorance as an unintended consequence, suggesting that such interventions are a promising approach to fostering support for pro-future institutions and policies. Nonetheless, merely correcting pluralistic ignorance offers a promising avenue for boosting support as well, opening avenues for future research to investigate whether interventions as simple as correcting misperceptions may inspire more vocal support for IFGs and engagement in pro-future collective action. In sum, our findings suggest that policymakers have a clear opportunity to act by recognizing the broad public support for IFGs and implementing policies to protect future generations, ensuring long-term welfare without alienating any demographic.",

The oversight of same-sex couples, and relationships with female abusers and male victims, has led to inconsistent findings in the literature. This incoherence might be explained by a lack of theoretical understanding of people’s beliefs and assumptions about IPV. Thus, this study aims to assess the structure of IPV prototypes of different binary victim-perpetrator gender combinations. Using a mixed-methods approach, a US- and UK-based sample (N = 161) gave open-ended responses on what they believe are common assumptions and beliefs about IPV scenarios. A psychometric network modeling approach was used to provide representations of the prototypes of the different IPV scenarios. Specifically, Gaussian graphical models of the responses were constructed, characterizing the correlations between the contents of participants’ responses. The findings show surprisingly strong global similarities between the prototypes, yet strikingly clear local differences in the domains of perpetrator, victim, relationship, and abuse.",

In a pre-registered study using T = 6,918 observations from N = 144 listeners, results showed that mood, music selection, and algorithmic curation varied substantially from situation to situation. However, we found no effects between mood and music choices that would confirm MMT’s selection hypotheses, yet small mood-congruent music effects on mood.

          "abstract": "Improving patient outcomes will be enhanced by understanding “what works, for whom?” enabling better matching of patients to available treatments. However, answering this “what works, for whom?” question requires sample sizes that exceed that of most individual trials. Conventional methods for combining data across trials, including aggregate-data meta-analysis, suffer from key limitations including difficulty accounting for differences across trials (e.g., comparing “apples to oranges”). Casually interpretable meta-analysis (CI-MA) addresses these limitations by pairing individual-participant-data (IPD) across trials with advancements in transportability methods to extend causal inferences to clinical “target” populations of interest. Combining IPD across trials also requires careful acquisition and harmonization of data, a challenging process for which practical guidance is not well-described in the literature. To fill these gaps, we describe methods and work to date for (1) harmonization of the largest IPD dataset available from 28 randomized controlled trials for pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  treatments, along with target data from a clinical sample of treatment-seeking youth ages 4-20 with OCD and (2) the application of CI-MA to facilitate an understanding “what works, for whom?”.

          "abstract": "Bayesian inference is becoming an increasingly popular framework for statistics in the behavioural sciences. However, its application is hampered by its computational intractability -- almost all Bayesian analyses require a form of approximation. While some of these approximate inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), have become well-known throughout the literature, other approaches exist that are not as widespread. Here, we provide an introduction to another family of approximate inference techniques known as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We show that SMC brings a number of benefits, which we illustrate in three different examples: linear regression and variable selection for depression, growth curve mixture modelling of grade point averages, and in computational modelling of the Iowa Gambling Task. These use cases demonstrate that SMC is efficient in exploring posterior distributions, reaching similar predictive performance as state-of-the-art MCMC approaches, in less wall-clock time. Moreover, they show that SMC is effective in dealing with multi-modal distributions, and that SMC not only approximates the posterior distribution, but simultaneously provides a useful estimate of the marginal likelihood, which is the essential quantity in Bayesian model comparison. All of this comes at no additional effort of the end user.",

          "authors": "Annie O'Brien; Margarita Panayiotou; Neil Humphrey; Joao Garcez Aurelio dos Santos; Suzanne Hamilton",
          "abstract": "There is theoretical support for, and emerging empirical evidence that, implementation variability (e.g., fidelity, dosage, quality) influences outcomes of school-based social-emotional learning (SEL) interventions, yet this relationship remains underexplored. This review aimed to (1) examine the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes and (2) identify and assess the quality of the methods used to establish this relationship, to reduce the research-to-practice gap and advance evidence-based practice. \n\nMethods. British Education Index, ERIC, PsycINFO, ASSIA, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science were searched, initially identifying 2,987 studies. A quality appraisal checklist was developed to assess the quality of research statistically examining the implementation-outcomes relationship. Extracted data were grouped according to the implementation dimension(s) assessed, the outcome domain(s) examined, and the statistical method(s) used. \n\nResults. Thirty-one studies met the review inclusion criteria. Quality assessment classified fourteen studies (45%) as low quality, fifteen (48%) as medium quality, and 2 (7%) as high quality. The most frequently examined implementation dimensions were dosage (n=16), fidelity (n=12), quality (n=10), responsiveness (n=6) and reach (n=3). Inferring the relationship between implementation variability and outcomes was hindered by the poor quality of studies and the heterogeneity, complexity, and resulting small sample size of comparison groups; calculation of meta-aggregative effect sizes was therefore not possible. \n\nDiscussion. This review reveals the paucity of high-quality research examining the relationship between SEL implementation variability and student outcomes. Accordingly, we propose the use of the aforementioned quality appraisal checklist to support and guide future research in this area, alongside recommendations to advance implementation science.",

          "abstract": "Although a number of studies have challenged the traditional assumption that there are truly homophonous words, they are exclusively based on English, a language in which duration is not phonemic.  This study extends research on the phonetic properties of homophonous words to Japanese, a language in which duration is phonemic. Based on a corpus of spontaneous Japanese speech, we found that 1) homophonous words differed in duration among the members of the homophonous group, 2) durations of homophonous words were positively correlated with degrees of certainty about the predicted word forms predicted from the word meanings, and 3) mora duration was sensitive to the contextual predictability of the mora within the word, while word duration was not sensitive to its contextual predictability.",

          "authors": "Tamara Kastorff; Jörg Henrik Heine",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted academic performance, exacerbating disparities among students from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. This study investigates SES´s influence on scientific literacy, essential for societal engagement in an increasingly science-driven world. Using linear models and meta-analytic techniques on 2018 and 2022 PISA data across 34 OECD countries (N = 438,688), results show a positive association between SES and scientific literacy (ß = .26 CI[.22, .28]). Additionally, a notable interaction effect between SES and the PISA cycle highlights potentially exacerbated educational disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic (ß = .06, CI[.03,.08]). The main novelty of the present paper lies in the combined analysis of two cross-sectional datasets from international large-scale assessments (LSA).  The results (1) deepen our understanding of educational inequalities and the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) demonstrate a new method to study effects via a quasi-longitudinal analysis of combined cross-sectional LSA datasets, and (3) highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SES-related inequalities in academic literacy.",

          "abstract": "Many perceive their digital media use to be out of balance and cope by recalibrating and reducing their use. One prominent goal of such digital disconnection is to improve well-being, yet past studies have yielded inconsistent results on whether this is an effective strategy. We test the associations of digital disconnection with a set of positive, negative, and social indicators of well-being in a two-week experience sampling study. N = 237 digital media users reported on T = 12,407 situations in their daily lives. Results show that in situations in which participants disconnected more than usual, they reported higher levels of affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness (within-person effects). In contrast, those who generally disconnected more than others reported no differences in well-being (between-person effects). Intrinsic motivation for disconnection positively moderated the associations with affective well-being, energy, and social connectedness between persons. Disconnection was not related to perceived stress, neither within nor between persons. The study further explores whether well-being effects differ depending on the aspects of digital media participants disconnected from. Overall, findings demonstrate how disconnection can be understood as a dynamic calibration of digital media (non-)use to achieve momentary – but not necessarily lasting – improvements in well-being.",

          "abstract": "Digital addiction has become a widespread phenomenon worldwide. Based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, the current study investigated the associations between mindful parenting and digital addiction in school-age children, as well as the mediating role of child individual executive function and the moderating effects of supportive coparenting, which reflect family relationship contexts. Participants consisted of 739 parents of school-age children, with the children aged between 7 and 10 years old (Mean age 8.27 ± 0.99 years old; 49.8% were boys). This study found that that mindful parenting was indirectly associated with children’s digital addiction through the role of children’s executive function. Additionally, mindful parenting interacted with supportive coparenting to influence children’s executive function. The present study can advance our understanding of how mindful parenting can alleviate children’s digital addiction. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed.\nKeywords: Digital addiction; Mindful parenting; Executive function; Supportive coparenting; Moderated mediation model",

In this space, health advice, misinformation, cat videos, and similar content compete for users’ limited attention. This study explored the hypothesis that content biases support the spread of nonadaptive information online. To test this, we analyzed 1,022,526 instances of engagement (reactions, comments, shares) generated by 356 misleading Facebook posts. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of visual material, cognitive factors of attraction (social, threat-related, intergroup-related information, positivity, and negativity biases), and engagement scores by fitting a Bayesian negative binomial model. Cognitive attractive features were present in 92% of the posts, but only visual material, intergroup-related information, and positive and negative sentiment increased engagement. The findings suggest that the specifics of social media, such as the visibility structures of platforms and competition from salient, accurate information, may moderate what gets transmitted.",

          "abstract": "Opinions of others influence behavior and decision-making, with important consequences for health. An unaddressed question is whether and how social influence can generalize across different situations or decisions. From a learning perspective, generalization is the transfer of previously acquired information to new stimuli and can be based on both perceptual and conceptual similarity. Here, we test whether social influence generalizes to new choices based on shared conceptual features, such as the healthiness and tastiness of different food items. We conducted three studies (total N = 468), in which healthy participants rated how much they would like to eat different food items and were subsequently presented with the ratings of several other people (‘social ratings’). Unbeknownst to our participants, they were randomly assigned to social ratings that either reflected a mainly health-driven valuation of food items (‘health group’) or to social ratings that reflected a taste-driven valuation of food items (‘taste group’). The results in all three studies showed that participants’ food ratings became more influenced by healthiness in the ‘health group’ than in the ‘taste group’. In one study, these effects further transferred to food choices in a naturalistic supermarket task. Our findings provide first evidence of generalization of social influence effects based on inferred social health norms. Futures studies could test conceptual generalization of other types of social and non-social learning and characterize the brain mechanism underlying these effects.",

A potential mechanism for these relations is that parents citing autonomous motives toward physical activity are more likely to support their child’s autonomous motivation to be active.

          "authors": "Martin Vinck; Cem Uran; Tommaso Tosato; Marius Schneider",
          "abstract": "Theories suggest that cognitive processes like attention have a rhythmic nature, however there is rising controversy surrounding the empirical findings supporting this theory.  The controversy centers around the statistical methods employed by studies to test for rhythms in accuracy time courses (ATCs) around a behavioral event.  To detect rhythms, previous studies surrogates via shuffling-in-time, and then evaluated if significance occurs in a narrow frequency band (i.e. the presence of a spectral peak). \nIn a recent critique, which challenged the methodological foundations of an entire research field, Brookshire (2022) argued that the shuffling-in-time procedure does not effectively distinguish between periodic and aperiodic processes. Brookshire therefore proposed a new method to test for rhythmic modulations, by creating surrogates via a 1st-order autoregressive process (AR(1) method).  Strikingly, Brookshire reports that his AR(1) method does not replicate previously reported evidence for rhythmic modulations in all of 23 analyzed datasets, challenging a significant body of empirical work and a major theory of behavior and cognition. Here, we show that the evidence and arguments provided by Brookshire (2022) against the shuffling-in-time procedure are flawed.  Moreover, Brookshire's proposed AR(1) method has a low sensitivity making it irrelevant for the use cases it is designed for. Hence, the reported null-findings by Brookshire (2022) need to be reassessed.  We briefly outline a new method  (APECS - APEriodiC Surrogate testing) that addresses the shortcomings of  previous methods.",

          "abstract": "Do mono- and bilingual children differ in the way they learn novel words in ambiguous\nsettings? Listeners may resolve referential ambiguity by assuming that novel words refer to\nunknown, rather than known, objects –a response known as the mutual exclusivity effect. Past\nresearch suggested a bilingual disadvantage with regard to this disambiguation strategy,\nperhaps because, across languages, bilinguals’ experience contradicts one-to-one mappings of\nlabel and referent. Another line of research suggested a bilingual advantage in resolving\nreferential ambiguity, based on bilinguals’ advanced pragmatic skills. Here, we examine both\nthese claims in a preregistered study with comparable samples of mono- and bilingual 3-yearolds\n(n=74) and adults (n=86). We tested referent disambiguation and retention in two tasks:\nIn the Mutual-Exclusivity task, a speaker used a novel label in presence of a known and an\nunknown object. In the Pragmatic task, she used another novel label in presence of two\nunknown objects and participants could infer from the pragmatic context that the speaker\nreferred to the object that was new in their discourse. Mono- and bilinguals were equally\nsuccessful in inferring the correct label-referent links in both tasks and retained them after a\ndelay. These findings indicate that children with different language backgrounds can develop\nthe same strategies and pragmatic skills to learn novel words, highlighting the importance of\ntesting comparable samples of mono- and bilinguals. Children can use their lexical knowledge\nand socio-cognitive skills to infer the meanings of novel words, irrespective of whether they\nare acquiring one or more languages.",

Social psychological research has provided a nuanced understanding of the different psychological and behavioural tendencies of powerholders. We add to this literature, suggesting that powerholders can differ in their construal of where their power originates from. Specifically, we differentiate construing the origin of one’s power as being based on personal merit and achievement (i.e., achieved power construal) from construing the origin of one’s power as being granted by others (i.e., entrusted power construal). We predicted that entrusted more than achieved power construal would increase powerholders’ psychological other-orientation - the tendency to put oneself into another’s shoes and to feel what they feel - and their altruistic behavioural tendencies. Using a multi-method approach, we tested these predictions across three studies (N = 926). We found that powerholders who adopted an entrusted compared to achieved power construal increased their psychological other-orientation and their altruistic behavioural tendencies. We discuss how our findings can be applied to the training of future powerholders and educate them about the reciprocal nature of power.",

Results confirmed that birth order was negatively associated with vocabulary, yet exhibited a U-shaped pattern. A ‘child-to-caregiver ratio’ in the household was introduced, in which old-enough siblings are considered caregivers for their younger siblings. This index explained variance in vocabulary better than birth order, and suggested that female siblings may adopt a caregiving role 1–3 years earlier than males, indicating sex differences in the age at which siblings contribute, rather than deplete, available resources. A child-to-caregiver ratio might better capture the interplay between language learning resources and demands within households.",

          "abstract": "Background: Evidence suggests that peer victimisation is related to suicidality and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, there is limited understanding of the association at the within-person level over brief periods, representing the most proximal effects of peer victimisation. \nMethods: Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) we explored the within-person reciprocal associations between various forms of peer victimisation—specifically physical, verbal, social manipulation, social rebuff, attacks on property, and electronic victimisation—and both active and passive suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and NSSI in adolescents over a brief (2 week) interval. Participants included 1,769 adolescents (46.0% male, 53.9% female, aged 13 to 18), recruited from academic and vocational high schools in China, participating in 3 measurement points. \nResults: Results indicated reciprocal within-person associations between verbal victimisation and subsequent active suicidal ideation and vice versa. Additionally, paths were observed from property victimisation to active suicidal ideation, from active suicidal ideation to social manipulation victimisation, from NSSI to verbal and social rebuff victimisation, as well as from suicide attempts to social rebuff victimisation. After adjusting for depression, several of the observed associations remained significant, including paths from both verbal and property victimisation to active suicidal ideation, from active suicidal ideation to verbal victimisation, and from NSSI to verbal victimisation. \nConclusions: These findings underscore the complex, short-term dynamics between different forms of victimisation and suicidality/NSSI, highlighting the importance of short-term monitoring and interventions that target both victimisation and suicidality and are sensitive to their short-term interrelations to improve effectiveness. The findings also suggest the need for future research with shorter timescales to capture the proximal effects of victimisation and better understand short-term predictors and fluctuations in suicidality and NSSI.",

In Experiment 2, participants completed the task twice, once with the Same/Different response options and once with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches, and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. Whereas we found no evidence that face identification decisions were influenced by the framing of response options, we found evidence of a robust base rate effect.

Here, I attempt to assemble these pieces into an overall picture, creating an integrative framework. Based on a large-scale behavioral experiment that consists of 40 million responses to 10,000 color patterns, a quasi-comprehensive exploration model of visual working memory, termed QCE-VWM, has been constructed. Despite its markedly reduced complexity (57 parameters as opposed to 30,796), the QCE-VWM outperforms neural networks in data fitting. This model provides an integrative framework for human visual working memory, reconciling previously conflicting concepts such as “slot” and “resource.” It modifies traditional methods, including Bayesian integration and the von Mises distribution, and identifies new mechanisms like “red advantage,” “red disadvantage,” “Matthew effect,” and “crosstalk.” This study underscores the value of large-scale behavioral experiments in crafting comprehensive models of cognitive mechanisms.",

The present study is an experimental design that seeks to investigate the effect gender has on the presence of negative tattoo stigma.  Participants (n = 114) were asked to rate their perceived competence of a clinical psychologist, their feelings toward the psychologist shown in their profile, and their attitude toward gender balance. Results indicated that there were no main effects of gender and tattoo presence on the participants' perceptions of a mental health care provider. There were also no significant interactions between the gender of a psychologist and the presence of tattoo stigma. This may suggest that people are becoming more accepting of body modifications as well as different genders in professional occupations, which is contrary to prior research.",

We reassessed the ontogeny of co-representation in 2-4 years old human children with a language-free task developed for nonhuman primates. Co-representation was already present and strongest in the youngest age class, and not constrained by Theory of Mind and inhibitory control. Together with the primate results, this suggests co-representation emerges spontaneously and automatically, and that not co-representation per se, but the flexibility to adjust when to merge and when not is the fundamental challenge for cooperation success. We show that human children and the most cooperative primates, the cooperatively breeding marmosets, rely on coordination smoothers (marmosets: mutual gaze; children: mutual gaze and communication) to achieve that.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence research focuses on machine reasoning and knowledge-based problem-solving. Yet, Einstein observed that knowledge stagnates without human imagination. \"Imagination,” he said, “is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”  In this study, we examined whether machines can have the potential to improve innovation. We employed the validated Divergent Association Task (DAT), an objective and reproducible measure of the ability to generate solutions that diverge from known or taken-for-granted solutions already in use. Our experiments indicated that, contrary to speculations, machines are no more creative on average than diverse human samples. Further, human creativity surpasses that of large-language model (LLM) in the right-hand tail of the distribution, indicating that humans collectively possess more creative brilliance relative to machines. When we collaborated with LLM partners by instructing LLMs to take the DAT as if they were creative geniuses like da Vinci, Curie, or Jobs, or from the perspective of different demographic groups such as a black person or a female, DAT scores significantly dropped relative to independent human or baseline LLM scores. Moreover, when we repeatedly instructed LLMs to think more creatively, machines were unintentionally and unwittingly pushed to create fake solutions that could mislead uninformed human partners. These findings were based on about 10,000 human observations from diverse international, educational, and cultural backgrounds, and hundreds of thousands of test results from different LLMs. The findings suggest machine creativity differs substantially from knowledge-based problem-solving and that human-machine creative partnerships may potentially inhibit innovation.",

          "authors": "Hayato Idei; Keisuke Suzuki; Yuichi Yamashita",
          "abstract": "Mindfulness has established psychological benefits such as stress reduction and emotional regulation; however, the underlying computational mechanisms, particularly in contrast to mind-wandering, remain unclear. This study aimed to present a hierarchical recurrent neural network-based agent model grounded in the free-energy principle to explore these processes within the framework of allostasis. The model integrates interoceptive, proprioceptive, and exteroceptive predictive processing, which minimizes the variational free energy throughout the past and future contexts. Simulations of resting state showed that inferred (mentally simulated) homeostatic context modulated attentional shifts between a “being” mode (focused on present interoceptive perception) and a “doing” mode (involving proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensorimotor loops). Further, we identified a meta-attentional parameter that controls these shifts by influencing cognitive attitudes towards internally generated beliefs across network modules spanning the past to the future. By manipulating this parameter, we replicated mindfulness states in which attention remained focused on the present interoceptive state despite minimal sensory prediction errors. This study offers insights into the computational dynamics of mindfulness and mind-wandering, laying the groundwork for the future exploration of consciousness and pure awareness, which is a state of consciousness devoid of content.",

          "authors": "Danaja Rutar; Fausto Carcassi; George Deane",
          "abstract": "The active inference framework is increasingly influential as a unifying model of perception, action, and cognition. However, it is unclear how higher cognition, thought, and concept formation should be understood within active inference. In this paper, we argue that active inference has the resources to deliver an account of the Language of Thought. The Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH) posits that cognitive processes are underpinned by a symbolic system of internal representations akin to a language (Fodor, 2010). This \"mentalese,\" as it is sometimes referred to, supports the notions of systematicity and productivity, suggesting that thinking operates via syntactic rules and structured symbols, allowing for the capacity to produce and understand novel cognitive constructs (Fodor, 1998). While LoTH fell out of favour, it has had a recent resurgence, and a particularly promising version of it is the probabilistic Language of Thought (pLoT) which adds probabilistic processes to the LoT picture. We argue that the fundamental features of conceptual representation posited by the pLoT can be accounted for in active inference when we consider concepts as built up sequentially through a series of mental actions, or mental action policies articulated in active inference. Once constructed, concepts can be compressed, are then amenable to rapid deployment and can serve as primitives in the construction of more complex concepts.",

In two well-powered studies (Study 1: N=1,199; Study 2: N=1,475), we find overwhelming support: 65-70% of Americans say that they want Hollywood to feature more climate-friendly actions in TV shows and movies in order to help fight climate change. Support is high for showcasing green energy, green jobs, low-carbon transport and electric vehicles, and for showing the impacts of climate change. However, we also find and replicate evidence of varying-levels of hesitation across respondents about the inclusion of content that features either plant-based meals or vegan/vegetarian characters. Despite the caveats about representations of plant-based diets, the data suggests that - despite polarization in many other domains - a large proportion of Americans are strongly supportive of the entertainment industry using its cultural power to grant greater visibility to both the impacts of climate change and the range of actions that we can take to mitigate and adapt.",

          "abstract": "Forming new memories requires a focus on the external world; retrieving existing memories requires attention to our internal world. Computational models propose that the hippocampus plays a central role in resolving the tension between encoding and retrieval by alternating between states that prioritize one over the other. We tested two opposing hypotheses about whether encoding and retrieval states in the hippocampus are associated with a behavioral trade- off or behavioral coupling between encoding and retrieval, with retrieval operationalized as the use of existing memories to make predictions about the future. Across 3 Experiments (N = 197), participants viewed a series of scene categories that contained structure (e.g., beaches are followed by castles); this structure enabled memory retrieval to guide prediction. After structure learning, participants completed a simultaneous prediction and encoding task. They were shown trial-unique category exemplars and asked to make predictions about upcoming scene categories. Finally, they were given a surprise memory test for the trial-unique images. This allowed us to test whether there was competition vs. coupling between encoding of trial-unique images and prediction of upcoming images. We consistently observed coupling between encoding and prediction: accurate predictions were associated with better encoding, and factors that hurt prediction also hurt encoding. This coupling could not be explained by generic on- vs. off-task states. Together, these findings suggest that distinct encoding and retrieval states in the brain need not be associated with a tension between encoding and prediction in behavior; instead, these cognitive states may be cooperative rather than competitive.",

          "abstract": "According to the traditional medical model, “social deficits” are hallmark characteristics of autism. Some have suggested that this necessarily limits autistic people’s kindness. However, recent research suggests that those closest to autistic people often say that kindness is among their most distinctive traits. We interviewed ten autistic adults to seek their views on relationships between autism and kindness and ask them why others might think that autistic people are distinctively kind. Qualitative analysis suggested that there are multiple possible conceptualisations of kindness; that autistic people are often highly concerned about others’ experiences and preferences; that autistic people often use internalised rules of ‘appropriately kind behaviour’ to try to avoid ‘doing the wrong thing’ when reacting to their kind feelings and inclinations; and that autistic people often find implementing kindness most straightforward and rewarding when directed towards others who have apparently clear needs and routes to effective help-giving, e.g., close relatives, other autistic people, or loved animals or objects. Finally, participants also noted that others were sometimes distressingly unkind to autistic people, which could further complicate autistic people’s own kindness. Our findings potentially offer improved ways of understanding kindness and the ways that it can manifest.",

          "abstract": "Belief in conspiracy theories can be highly detrimental not only for the affected individual, but also for the wellbeing of society as a whole. Despite the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to their prevalence, we currently lack an integrated characterization of which underlying cognitive factors render an individual vulnerable to such beliefs. To address this gap, we utilized a battery of six cognitive tasks targeting distinct but overlapping cognitive attributes spanning different aspects of information processing from information perception, information seeking, and the evaluation and integration of information to make decisions. We then administered this task battery to a large online cohort. When integrating across tasks using unsupervised machine-learning and multivariate statistical methods, we find evidence to suggest that conspiracy believers exhibit a relatively specific but domain general deficit in the ability to effectively integrate and utilize empirical evidence, as well as an increased tendency to misattribute the consequences of their own actions to the interference of others.  These effects were found to be associated with conspiracy beliefs even after controlling for the effects of other psychiatrically relevant symptom dimensions such as schizotypy, anxiety, worry and depression. Our findings thus suggest the existence of a specific cognitive phenotype underlying susceptibility to conspiracy beliefs, which in turn could point the way toward more targeted interventions to mitigate their influence.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Prosthetic hand devices are frequently abandoned as they are difficult to use and impose high mental workload upon users. However, researchers are yet to establish whether personality factors might contribute to these negative prosthetic hand experiences. In this study, we examined whether key prosthetic hand outcome measures were associated with the trait inclination for conscious movement control – a phenomenon termed “reinvestment” that can impair motor performance and deplete cognitive resources. \n\nMaterials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to a sample of upper-limb prosthesis users. Thirty-six respondents answered demographic questions and completed three questionnaires related to device satisfaction, trait reinvestment, and mental workload.\n\nResults: Correlational analysis revealed that a greater propensity for movement specific reinvestment was associated with lower prosthesis satisfaction, higher mental workload, and lower levels of perceived device predictability. It was also found that mental workload mediated the relationship between reinvestment tendencies and both device satisfaction and hours of prosthesis use per day.\n\nConclusions: This study provides the first evidence that trait reinvestment is negatively implicated in the control and satisfaction of prosthetic hand use. We suggest that training interventions for prosthetic hand use should aim to limit conscious control of movements.",

While the benefits of optimism have been extensively researched, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding the direct impact of optimism training on the mental health of college students. This study aims to address this gap by exploring optimism training as a novel intervention method to improve mental health within an academic setting.\nMethods:\nA quasi-experimental design was employed, featuring pre-test and post-test measurements. The study involved an experimental group that received optimism training and a control group that did not. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was utilized as the primary tool for assessing symptoms of depression. Statistical analyses, including repeated measures ANOVA, were conducted to compare mean differences between the experimental and control groups across different study phases.\nResults:\nThe results demonstrated that optimism training significantly reduced depression symptoms in the experimental group. The mean depression score in the experimental group decreased from 17.19 in the pre-test to 13.57 in the post-test, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group.\nConclusion:\nThe findings underscore the effectiveness of optimism training as a low-cost and accessible intervention to enhance mental health among university students. This approach suggests potential integration into university counseling services to support students' mental health.",

Prior work emphasises the practical implications of super-recognisers for important real-world decisions, such as when comparing a passport to a traveller or recognising a suspect in CCTV footage.

Yet, theoretical models of EF and tasks used to measure them were developed mainly for highly educated young adults from developed countries. Here we assessed EFs in a diverse cohort from a rural town in Brazil (Baependi Heart Study: N=1253; 753 females), in which age (18-88 year) and schooling (0-23 years) varied widely. Based on a popular theoretical model of EF (the unity diversity EF framework), which describes the pattern of inter-associations of three specific types of EFs (inhibitions, shifting and updating), we developed a short, nonautomated, open-access EF test battery adapted for use in samples with varying schooling and age that included EF indicators obtained from three tasks (Plus-Minus, Trail Making and Random Number Generation tasks). Using Confirmatory Factor Analyses we found a good fitting three-correlated factor solution confirming the fractionation and inter-association of the three EF domains that was invariant (except for one of eight indicators) to age, schooling and sex. More years of schooling was related to higher latent traits in all domains, older age to worse shifting and women scored lower in latent shifting and inhibition. We conclude that the unity-diversity EF framework can be determined across adulthood in diverse samples with tasks adapted for these populations, allowing the theory-oriented investigation of sociocultural and demographic factors that influence EFs.",

Regarding usage of the BC platform, 534 patients (91.6%) received at least one online chapter, with M = 7.26 (SD = 7.01) online chapters assigned on average. \nDiscussion: In real-world applications of BC, therapists have considerable flexibility in integrating digital interventions with therapy sessions. Our findings suggest that the benefits observed in more controlled BC settings may not fully translate to routine care, possibly due to variations in implementation and adherence to BC.",

          "abstract": "Purpose\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with elevated rates of mental health difficulties and executive function challenges. There is emerging evidence that executive function is associated with mental health. However, less is known about a) everyday inhibitory control difficulties among autistic adults; b) the influence of sex assigned at birth and co-occurring attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) features on inhibitory control challenges; and c) relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms.\n\nMethods\nDrawing upon data from 732 autistic adults aged 18-83, this study examined self-reported inhibitory control in autistic adults and the influence of assigned sex and suspected co-occurring ADHD on the degree of inhibitory control challenges experienced. In addition, this research examined relations between inhibitory control challenges and anxiety symptoms, and the moderating role of assigned sex and suspected ADHD status in this relationship.\n\nResults\nAutistic adults endorsed significantly more challenges in inhibitory control relative to published norms. Participants assigned female at birth reported more difficulties in inhibitory control relative to sex-adjusted normative expectations than participants assigned male, and participants suspected to have co-occurring ADHD reported more inhibitory control challenges than those not suspected to have ADHD. Greater endorsement of inhibitory control challenges was associated with greater anxiety symptomatology; this relationship was moderated by suspected ADHD status, but not by assigned sex.\n\nConclusion\nInhibitory control is an area of difficulty in this group and is associated with anxiety symptomatology, suggesting that inhibitory control may be a valuable intervention target to improve emotional well-being in autistic adults.",

          "authors": "Daisy Fancourt",
          "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been increasing observational research into the impacts of arts and cultural engagement on health, drawing on the surprisingly rich phenotyping of these behaviours in observational studies. This, alongside a broader growing evidence base, has led to recent calls from the World Health Organisation for the arts to be formally recognised as a health behaviour. However, access to the arts is not equitable, so a key challenge in observational research is disentangling any causal effects from this social gradient in engagement. In this paper, we consider five of the key methodological challenges in epidemiological research on arts and health and propose solutions by combining causal inference approaches with a new theoretical framework on the determinants of arts and cultural engagement (RADIANCE), which uses a socio-ecological approach to identify multi-level factors influencing patterns of arts behaviours. We end with recommendations for researchers incorporating questions on arts and cultural engagement within the design of longitudinal cohort studies.",

But there is a full process by which money, the desire we feel for it, and even how we end up trading it, can emerge naturally from the dynamics of natural selection and human interaction, with a basis in real value, and happening repeatedly and reliably, even if a group of people all agree that money or precious metals are worthless.

Others have said that the value of money depends on the way it facilitates trade, but even that doesn't explain where the value emerges before people agree to use money to trade. In actuality, there's a real value to gold, silver, and other forms of money that makes them reliably gain worth to people, and will emerge eventually even if everyone in a society does not like or believe in those precious metals or possessions. This is because possessing scarce objects has real reputational value among people, since having those objects indicates that we can go outside the known territory, and we instinctively collect and want things that have known scarcity. When that scarcity combines with other traits like transferability, durability and so on, we can see that money naturally emerges in society. We can use this idea to also see the real value and desire that people have for new forms of money like cryptocurrencies, and to know what will or won't emerge and last as a form of money in the future.",

          "abstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to changes in healthcare. Government and regulatory bodies have advocated the need for transparency in AI systems with recommendations to provide users with more details about AI accuracy and how AI systems work. However, increased transparency could lead to negative outcomes if humans become over-reliant on the technology. This study investigated how changes in AI transparency affected human decision making in a medical screening visual search task. Transparency was manipulated by either giving or withholding knowledge about the accuracy of an ‘AI system’. We tested performance in seven simulated lab mammography tasks, in which observers searched for a cancer which could be correctly or incorrectly flagged by Computer Aided Detection (CAD) ‘AI prompts’. Across tasks the CAD systems varied in accuracy. In the ‘Transparent’ conditions participants were told the accuracy of the CAD system, in the ‘Not Transparent’ they were not. The results showed that increasing CAD transparency impaired task performance producing an increase in false alarms, decreased sensitivity, an increase in Recall Rate and a decrease in Positive Predictive Value. Along with increasing investment in AI this research shows that it is important to investigate how transparency of AI systems affect human decision making. Increased transparency may lead to over-trust in AI systems, which can impact clinical outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The cardinal meanings of the first few number words are often assessed with the Give-N Task, and children’s knowledge of number words can be represented by “knower-level”, with N-knower representing children who have acquired cardinal knowledge of number words up to N. In the current study, we sought converging evidence for knower-levels by examining the correspondence of knower-level classifications between the Give-N Task and the Point-to-X Task. In Study 1, we tested 69 preschool-aged children and found that children at the higher knower-levels often did not receive the same classification across tasks. Further, children who were classified as having acquired the cardinal principle on the Give-N Task were more likely than subset-knowers to count on the Point-to-X Task, but they did not count very frequently. In Study 2, we conducted secondary data analysis on an existing study that included a Point-to-X Task with different stimuli and more trial types. We again found that children’s knower-level assessed with Give-N was not always associated with above chance performance for that number on the Point-To-X Task. These data suggest that knower-levels may adequately capture cardinal number knowledge for very small numbers but not for higher numbers. We discuss the practical implications of these findings and highlight a need for future studies to adopt a multi-method approach to establish a robust pattern of children’s number word acquisition.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "authors": "Yi Yang; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "As a social species, making redistribution decisions about how to allocate or reallocate resources across different individuals or groups is crucial for human’s survival and well-being at both micro (e.g., disaster relief distribution, charity donation, household income budget) and macro levels (e.g., national budget allocation, public support to wealth redistribution policies) of human society. Dictator games, among other economic games, have been used intensively to study such decisions regarding resource (re)allocation. In a typical dictator game, there are two players: a dictator and a recipient. The dictator decides how to redistribute an endowment, which the recipient cannot reject. Various factors, including dictator personality traits, recipient identity, and endowment transfer actions, have been found to influence dictators' decisions. Several models have been proposed to explain why dictators make certain redistribution decisions in dictator games. While insightful, existing models often oversimplify complex factors, such as task economic structure (e.g., source of endowment, price of transferring endowment between dictators and recipients) and partner identity (e.g, group membership, social closeness), hindering a holistic understanding of redistribution decisions. In this narrative review, we present an integrative framework categorizing factors into four main categories: task structure, dictator trait (trait), recipient identity (identity), and framing. We discuss potential interactions between task economic structure, dictator trait, and recipient identity. We also discuss how framing may influence redistribution decisions through multiple domains. This Structure-Trait-Identity Relation (STIR) framework provides a systematic approach to analyzing decision dynamics and resolving empirical inconsistencies. Future directions are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Recently, there have been growing efforts in developing fair algorithms for treatment effect estimation and optimal treatment recommendations to mitigate discriminatory biases against disadvantaged groups. While most of this work has primarily focused on addressing discrimination due to individual-level attributes (e.g., race/ethnicity), it overlooks the broader impact of societal structures and cultural norms (e.g., structural racism) beyond the individual level. In this paper, we formalize the concept of multilevel fairness for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects to improve fairness in optimal policies. Specifically, we propose a general framework for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects under multilevel fairness constraints that incorporate individual-level sensitive variables, cluster-level sensitive variables, and their combinations. Using this framework, we analyze the trade-off between fairness and the maximum achievable utility by the optimal policy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework through a simulation study and a real data study on advanced math courses using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009.",

          "abstract": "Weber’s Law states that the ability to distinguish different stimuli depends on the relative magnitudes of those stimuli. When applied to quantity judgments, this means that the numerical ratio between two quantities (small amount / large amount) will underlie the ability to distinguish the quantities. Ratio-dependent quantification is a hallmark of Weber’s Law that has been demonstrated across a range of species, including dogs. However, other factors such as numerical difference (large amount - small amount) are confounded with ratio but would not support Weber’s Law. Most work on dog quantification abilities has only considered ratio and not difference. Here, we offer dogs a food quantity preference task where we varied both difference and ratio in quantity pairs to investigate which of these factors influences preferences. To address this, dogs could choose to eat one of two plates of food with different quantities of treats on them. We found that, when analyzed separately, both difference and ratio predicted whether the dogs chose the larger quantity of treats. However, when analyzed together, only difference predicted choice when controlling for ratio. This finding does not support the ratio-dependence required for Weber’s Law, raising questions about its importance for quantity preference tasks in dogs.",

We first review aspects of pain-related decisions and the circuits that support different aspects of pain. We then discuss the common neural pathways that support pain and reward, as well as evidence of their interactions. Next, we introduce how pain might be viewed from a neuroeconomic perspective, focusing on the value of pain. Finally, we address hypotheses and outstanding questions for those at the intersection of pain and neuroeconomics.

          "abstract": "Spacing, distributing practice over time rather than in a single session, often benefits long-term memory of simple material. However, it is less clear whether spacing is effective for more complex material. As more educators harness the spacing effect, it is important to know under what conditions it is most effective. We investigated the impact of procedural complexity on the efficacy of spacing, by varying the number of steps in arithmetic procedures. Participants were taught two procedures, either in a single session (massed) or over three sessions spanning three consecutive days (spaced). Experiment one compared learning a two-step with a three-step procedure. Spaced practice led to significantly higher performance, relative to massed practice, with no evidence for a difference in the spacing effect as a function of procedural complexity. However, there was also no evidence for a difference in performance between the two procedures, suggesting the three-step procedure was not sufficiently more complex than the two-step procedure. Experiment two compared learning a two-step with a five-step procedure. We again saw a significant spacing effect, as well a main effect of complexity, with performance in the five-step procedure being significantly lower than the two-step procedure. As in Experiment one, we found no evidence for an interaction between procedural complexity and the spacing effect. Our results show that spacing benefits the learning of arithmetic procedures. Critically, we also show that the spacing effect is not negatively impacted by the procedural complexity of the procedure learnt.",

Longitudinal evidence is still lacking to characterize the interplay between emotional well-being (EWB) and cognitive function over time. Using positive affect (PA) as the primary index for EWB, we examined the longitudinal, reciprocal relationships between the three EWB constructs (PA, meaning and purpose [Purpose], and life satisfaction [LS]) and the cognitive domains of recall memory and retrieval fluency. Methods: Based on 4583 participants who completed three waves of data in a large-scale national survey from 2008 to 2018, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models  were used to examine the concurrent and cross-lagged relationships between each of the three constructs (PA, Purpose, and LS) and the two cognitive domains (recall memory and retrieval fluency) across the three time points adjusting depression. Results: PA and Purpose had significant reciprocal, within-person associations with memory and retrieval fluency. Random intercepts were significantly correlated, indicating that older adults with higher PA and Purpose typically had better recall memory and retrieval fluency. Conclusion: PA and Purpose had positive feedback loops with recall memory and retrieval fluency. Future studies should further explore the potential mechanisms and pathways of these observed relationships.",

          "abstract": "As an exploration of machine learning strategies applied to behavior analytic investigations, we sought to predict the likelihood that particular children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) would develop echoic verbal behavior. After retrieving 143 case records of children assessed with the VB-MAPP from a data repository, we reserved 22 case records for holdout analysis. Through iterative development, the model achieved 100% accuracy in predicting the presence or absence of an echoic repertoire. While the functional value of predicting a known outcome might be questioned, it is only possible to gauge the accuracy of any prediction technique when known outcomes are available. Thus, rather than trying to predict a completely unknown outcome, our experimental preparations were directed at gauging the multilayer perceptron’s (MLP) ability to predict at high levels of precision, sensitivity, specificity, and overall prediction accuracy while accessing a limited dataset from one children’s healthcare setting. We discuss procedures for employing this machine learning strategy in conjunction with a receiver operator characteristics analysis of our findings. We developed this study as a general guide for using one of several quickly evolving neural network methodologies for behavior analytic researchers, and we examine specifics regarding MLP functions and operations as they relate to providing more efficacious treatment for children with ASD.",

          "abstract": "Do  we  preferentially  learn  from  positive  rather  than  negative  decision  outcomes? Previous  studies  indicated  that  such  bias  characterises  learning  during  simple  reward learning  tasks.  However,  no  research  has  yet  confirmed  whether  learning  bias  is  also present  during  sequential  decision  making  under  uncertainty.  To  fill  this  gap,  we utilised  a  complex  yet  ecologically  valid  paradigm,  the  Balloon  Analogue  Risk  Task (BART),  which  measures  risk-taking  propensity  under  uncertainty  in  everyday  decision making.  Comparing  learning  from  positive  and  negative  outcomes  in  the  BART  has been  made  possible  by  the  Scaled  Target  Learning  model,  which  characterises  both risk-taking  propensity  and  sensitivity  to  wins  and  losses.  For  the  first  time,  we  applied this  model  to  a  modified  BART  paradigm  with  different  levels  of  perceived uncertainty.  Crucially,  our  analyses  revealed  learning  bias  during  high  levels  of uncertainty,  under  which  condition  bias  was  negatively  tied  to  task  performance. Furthermore,  increased  sensitivity  to  wins  compared  to  losses  was  linked  to  more risk-seeking  behaviour  across  all  conditions,  suggesting  that  learning  bias  could mediate  risky  behaviour.  Overall,  our  results  contribute  to  a  more  accurate characterisation  of  reward  learning  behaviour  and  suggest  that  learning  bias  arises when the level of perceived uncertainty surges.",

We are interested in whether such variations are more than random, and whether they can be accounted for by observed variables. The availability of large longitudinal datasets, such as UK Biobank (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), offers a unique opportunity to study these variations at scale. However, such datasets bring a high risk of bias (e.g. confounding) and danger of over-interpretation. It is therefore important to be transparent about our causal thinking. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are graphical representations of the hypothesized causal relationships between variables. They are used to identify the smallest set of variables that need to be adjusted for to remove confounding bias in estimating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. However, use of DAGs in pain research is not common, despite their potential to guide study design and data-analysis. In this paper we present a workflow for building a DAG using domain knowledge from three different sources: researchers, people with lived experience, and the literature. We created a DAG for the putative effect of executive function on the maintenance of chronic high impact pain. The resulting DAG provides a valuable framework for guiding future research on the role of executive functioning in pain and it underscores the broader potential of using DAGs to improve causal inference in pain research.",

We fitted a latent growth model of BMI and examined associations between changes in fast-food restaurant density and walkability with changes in BMI (n=2735) as well as interactions of changes in fast-food restaurant density and walkability with genetic risk (n=1676).\nResults:\nChanges in fast-food restaurant density (e.g., Δ 2010-2006: β=-0.04, 95% CI: -0.11 to 0.03) and walkability (e.g., Δ 2010-2006: β=-0.05, 95% CI: -0.14 to 0.05) were not associated with BMI change. Additionally, genetic risk did not moderate these associations.\nConclusions:\nWe found limited evidence that moving to fast-food denser or less walkable neighborhoods was associated with BMI development or that genetic risk moderated these associations. Our findings suggest that associations between the built environment and BMI change during the transition into young adulthood are likely small.",

          "abstract": "The peak shift effect in generalization, a robust phenomenon where the maximal response occurs to stimuli shifted away from the conditioned stimulus in the direction opposite the inhibitory stimulus, has been predominantly attributed to associative learning. However, recent findings point to biases in stimulus representation as an alternative mechanism. Our research, comprising two experiments (Experiment 1: N = 76; Experiment 2: N = 234), investigated whether the peak shift effect could emerge from a stimulus contrast effect, independent of associative learning. By comparing stimulus identification patterns between simple and differential conditioning groups both after stimulus exposure and following associative learning, we found that shifts in the identification of conditioned stimuli were primarily driven by a stimulus contrast effect, rather than associative learning per se. This representational shift was closely associated with the peak shift phenomenon observed in post-learning generalization patterns, with identification errors strongly impacting generalized responding. These results underscore the importance of considering stimulus representations as an independent process in understanding learning-based behavior, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying generalization phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Statistical models are becoming increasingly complex with more parameters to explain complex dependency structures among larger sets of variables. Regularization techniques (such as penalized regression) are ideal to identify the most important parameters by shrinking negligible effects to zero. The resulting regularized solutions are parsimonious and often show good predictive performance. Currently however regularization techniques have mainly been developed for standard modeling designs even though regularization techniques are also very useful for more complex modeling designs. Moreover, even though Bayesian regularization algorithms are competitive (and sometimes superior) to their classical counterpart, classical regularization techniques (such as the lasso) are still most common in applied research. To address these shortcomings, the current paper presents a fast and flexible approximate Bayesian regularization procedure. A Gaussian approximation is used for the integrated likelihood of the (large) set of parameters which is then combined with a Bayesian shrinkage prior to obtain a parsimonious solution with many (approximately) zero estimates. The method is implemented in the R package ‘shrinkem’. The general applicability of the methodology is illustrated in various applications including linear regression models, relational event models, mediation models, factor analytic models, and Gaussian graphical models.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experience (MPE) refers to the simplest form of conscious experience, characterized by the absence of time, self, and sensory content, where only pure awareness or consciousness remains. In this paper, we present a com- putational neurophenomenological account of minimal phenomenal experience within the active inference framework. We propose a generative mechanism that allows active inference agents to leverage capacities akin to those in generative adversarial networks, which use a dual framework of data generation and discrim- ination to improve perceptual accuracy. Our hypothesis posits that the brain continuously generates synthetic data to fill perceptual and cognitive gaps, and we provide a computational mechanism within the active inference framework to support this. We explore how synthetic data generation, when amplified by meditation, psychedelics, or other altered states, can the brain to ‘defabricate’ entrenched conceptual structures and approach pure consciousness. We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — ’seeing as’ — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.",

          "abstract": "To synthesize evidence on the relations among multiple constructs, measures, or concepts, meta-analyzing correlation matrices across primary studies has become a crucial analytic approach. Common meta-analytic approaches employ univariate or multivariate models to estimate a pooled correlation matrix, which is subjected to further analyses, such as structural equation or network modeling. In practice, meta-analysts often extract multiple correlation matrices per study from multiple samples, study sites, labs, or countries, thus introducing hierarchical effect size multiplicity into the meta-analytic data. However, this feature has largely been ignored when pooling correlation matrices for meta-analysis. To contribute to the methodological development in this area, we describe a multilevel, multivariate, and random-effects modeling (MLMV-REM) approach, which pools correlation matrices meta-analytically and, at the same time, addresses hierarchical effect size multiplicity. Specifically, it allows meta-analysts to test various assumptions on the dependencies among random effects, aiding the selection of a meta-analytic baseline model. We describe this approach, present four working models within it, and illustrative them with an example and the corresponding R code.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) represent states of consciousness reduced to their most fundamental elements, posing a unique challenge and opportunity for modeling consciousness. This paper introduces a novel computational framework based on Bayesian and active inference to model MPEs. We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

Trauma can have a range of effects on individuals over time, including the potential for positive changes in favorable outcomes commonly referred to as posttraumatic growth. The posttraumatic growth literature has been criticized for various methodological limitations and has largely neglected the exploration of factors that may strengthen or weaken posttraumatic growth trajectories. The present study contributes to this literature by investigating trajectories of five dimensions of posttraumatic growth during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderating effects of health and financial difficulties on these trajectories. Method. Longitudinal data were collected monthly between July 2020 and December 2022 from a sample of employed adults in Germany, involving N = 1,678 participants over 30 time points (Nobservations = 29,552). Results. Results suggest that certain dimensions of posttraumatic growth showed significant increases (i.e., relationships) or decreases (i.e., spirituality, possibilities) over time, and that trajectories of three dimensions (i.e., relationships, appreciation, and strength) demonstrated distinctive patterns of interaction with health and financial difficulties. Conclusions. Findings are discussed in the context of the pandemic as well as dynamic theories of personality and identity, with implications for advancing posttraumatic growth theory and research.",

Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Undergraduate students report a high level of trait anxiety, which is a risk factor for further psychological decline if unmanaged. Common psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioural therapy are highly effective in improving symptoms of anxiety for those who are motivated to engage in psychotherapy, but they can be costly. Music-based interventions are cost-effective and have been found to improve indices of anxiety, specifically lower self-reported distress, reduced cortisol, and higher heart rate variability. More recently, music with auditory beat stimulation (ABS) has been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety to a greater extent than music alone. While there is limited empirical evidence, music interventions with ABS may also be effective at targeting neurophysiological markers of anxiety.  In this exploratory trial, fifty undergraduate students will be randomized to participate in a single session of music with ABS or pink noise. They will be asked to complete measures of self-reported anxiety. In addition, they will be asked to provide saliva samples (salivary cortisol), and wear electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the wrist (heart rate variability) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap (frequency band power measures of anxiety). It is hypothesized that those assigned to the music with ABS condition will experience a reduction in subjective and physiological indices of anxiety. A secondary exploratory aim of this research will be to test potential neurophysiological mechanisms of actions, including neural entrainment and differences in HRV and frequency band power, that may clarify the effect of music with ABS on anxiety.",

          "abstract": "This study explored the psychometric properties of the Farsi version of Parents' Beliefs about Children's Emotions Questionnaire (PBACE) in the Iranian setting. The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Findings from the bifactor model indicated that the measure could be considered unidimensional with some multidimensional features. Although the poor fit and lower Omega coefficient for the Parental Knowledge subscale suggest that it should not be used, the PBACE is recommended for research and clinical purposes in Iran due to its sound psychometric properties.",

Mentalizing—our ability to make inferences about the mental states of others—is \nimpaired across psychiatric disorders and robustly associated with functional outcome. \nMentalizing deficits have been prominently linked to aberrant activity in cortical regions \nconsidered part of the “social brain network” (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal \njunction), yet emerging evidence also suggests an importance of cerebellar dysfunction. In the \npresent study—using a transdiagnostic, clinical psychiatric sample spanning the psychosis?autism-social anxiety spectrums —we examined the role of cerebellum in mentalizing and its\nunique contributions to broader social functioning. \nMethods. 66 participants (42 with significant social dysfunction secondary to psychiatric illness\nand 24 non-clinical controls without social dysfunction) completed a mentalizing task during \nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear model analysis, latent variable modeling, \nand regression analyses were used to examine the contribution of cerebellum activation to the \nprediction of group status and social functioning.\nResults. Mentalizing activated a broad set of social-cognitive brain regions, including cerebral \nmentalizing network (MN) nodes and posterior cerebellum. Increased posterior cerebellum \nactivation significantly predicted group status (i.e., individuals with psychiatric disorders versus \nnon-clinical controls). Finally, cerebellar activation accounted for significant variance in social \nfunctioning independent of all other cerebral MN brain regions identified in a whole-brain analysis.\nConclusion.

          "abstract": "Michotte (1946/1954/1963) showed that visual impressions of causality can occur in perception of simple animations of moving geometrical objects. In the launching effect, one object is perceived as making another object move by bumping into it. In the entraining effect, the two objects move together after contact and the first moving object is perceived as pushing or carrying the other one. There has been much further research on the launching effect in particular, and citations of Michotte's pioneering work have increased rapidly in recent decades, underlining its importance in contemporary psychology and neuroscience. However, many of the experiments reported Michotte's book, exploring conditions under which launching and entraining do and do not occur, have never been replicated. The methodology, involving mostly a few knowledgeable observers and no statistical analysis, indicates that replication and extension would be desirable, to assess the reliability of the results reported by Michotte and to inspire further research on aspects of these perceptual impressions that have been neglected in more recent research. In this pre-registered replication study, fourteen experiments are reported that replicate and, in some cases, extend experiments reported by Michotte (1946/1954/1963). Some findings reported by Michotte were replicated, others only partly so, and in other cases results were different from what Michotte reported. Extensions to Michotte's experiments revealed numerous new findings and open up prospects for much more innovative research. The results also have significant implications for possible explanations for perceptual impressions of causality.",

Common tests of MI are not suitable for many groups and cannot be used during the development of measurement models. In addition, popular network-based alternatives to latent variable modeling lack established methods for MI testing. Therefore, we propose Exploratory Graph Analysis Trees (EGA trees) that apply the idea of model-based recursive partitioning to correlation matrices and combine it with EGA - which can be used instead of exploratory factor analysis. In a simulation study, we test the approach regarding its ability to detect configural or metric non-invariance in common factor models given numerous covariates and illustrate its usefulness in conditions with severe violations of configural invaraince based on diverging numbers of factors. The results demonstrate that EGA trees can be a valuable tool for the exploration of MI when constructing scales and working on measurement models.

Therefore, pathogen detection mechanisms arguably categorize a broad array of atypical features as indicative of infection, which gives rise to negative affect toward people with atypical features. We will test a key hypothesis derived from this explanation: specific appearance-based prejudices are associated with tendencies to make false alarms when estimating the presence of infectious disease. While this hypothesis is implicit in much work on the behavioral immune system and prejudice, direct tests of it are lacking and existing relevant work contains important limitations.

          "abstract": "Living with pain that persists over months or years can take a significant toll and requires the use of different strategies to manage the pain in everyday life. Yet how individuals cope with chronic pain and why some people show better functional outcomes is not clearly understood. Previous literature on coping has often focused on describing different coping strategies and their comparative effectiveness, often with the assumption that some are overall less adaptive than others. Existing theoretical models of coping often lack descriptions of how factors unfold over time and often assume relationships between factors remain stable. However, pain coping is not only influenced by continuously changing internal and external contextual factors, but by changing interactions as the process repeats over time. Moreover, the short- and long-term efficacy of different coping approaches depends on individual appraisal of the momentary coping process. In this review, we first systematically synthesise previously published theoretical frameworks that have conceptualised the coping process in health- related stress and pain. Then, we present the ‘Dynamic Interaction Model of Coping in Chronic Pain’ outlining how five central factors: 1) controllability, 2) predictability, 3) pain salience, 4) personal resources, and 5) motivation, interact in a dynamic coping process in chronic pain. The model outlines putative pathways of moment-to-moment and long-term adaptations to pain, and potential targets for intervention are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Performing movements in simulated environments (e.g., virtual reality) can be advantageous in training scenarios and when experimentally separating visual and proprioceptive limb representations. However, compared to real physical environments, virtual environments differ in how the limb is represented (e.g., animated hand or cursor) and in the timing of the visual feedback (i.e., latency in rendering the tracked movement). Thus, the current study sought to explore the influence of both representation differences and additional visual feedback delays on sensorimotor control when moving in a virtual reality environment. Participants performed aiming movements in an environment in which they had vision of a cursor representing their index finger or vision of their actual upper-limb. Further, vision was available either only prior to movement onset (i.e., feedforward) or throughout the movement (i.e., online guidance). In the feedforward condition, only representation differences were present between effectors. In the online guidance condition, however, there was an additional feedback delay when aiming with the cursor (at least ~17 ms). Performance was quantified using efficiency (bits/second) calculated using amplitude, effective target width, and movement time. Movements were less efficient when aiming with vision of the cursor compared to vision of the upper-limb in both the feedforward and online guidance conditions. Further, the magnitude of the cursor-limb efficiency difference was larger in the online guidance condition compared to the feedforward condition. Overall, the results suggest that differences in representation and visual feedback delays can combine to produce less efficient movements when aiming in virtual compared to real environments.",

Loss of a spouse and child yielded higher HRs, compared loss of a parent or a sibling. The strongest associations were observed for postpartum mental disorders in relation to stillbirth (HR [95% CI]: 25.97 [24.60, 27.42]) or multiple losses during the perinatal period (HR [95% CI]: 16.92 [13.72, 20.86]). Family loss during the perinatal period was most strongly associated with stress-related disorders (HR [95% CI]: 16.90 [16.10, 17.75]), but also with depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Loss of a family member was associated with increased risks of first-onset perinatal mental disorders, particularly if the loss occurred during the perinatal period. Bereaved women may benefit from enhanced monitoring and screening for mental disorders during the perinatal period.",

          "abstract": "The current pair of highly-powered, preregistered studies estimate the associations between personality/temperament and youth psychopathology, and evaluate the generalizability of these associations across diverse populations and research designs. \nIn Study 1, a multilevel meta-analysis of 147 studies (N = 46,369) quantified the associations between Five-Factor Model personality traits and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology dimensions among subjects aged 1.5 to 18. All traits but openness evidenced small-to-medium bivariate associations with both psychopathology dimensions (z = |.18 - .46|). After adjusting for the covariance between internalizing and externalizing, each dimension showed a distinct personality profile. Internalizing was associated with neuroticism (β = .42) and negative-extraversion (β = -.37). Externalizing was associated with extraversion (β = .30), negative-conscientiousness (β = -.46), and negative-agreeableness (β = -.50). Most variance was driven by informant effects, particularly within the externalizing dimension and when personality and psychopathology were informed by the same person (i.e., mono-informant). \nStudy 2 was a preregistered replication and extension of Study 1 in a large cohort of youth (N = 10,414) using individual-participant, item-level data. Most of Study 1’s associations were replicated for higher-order scales (e.g., Effortful Control) and for their lower-order scales (e.g., Activation Control). Again, mono-informant effects were more pronounced than cross-informant effects. \nTaken together, these studies provide the first quantitative synthesis of associations between personality/temperament and psychopathology in youth. These preregistered quantitative findings are largely consistent with decades of theory (e.g., Tackett, 2006), evidence a robustness of effects across populations, and highlight the impact of mono-informant effects.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for identifying minimally sufficient neurocognitive mechanisms of selfhood. It focuses on extracting context-independent mechanisms from computational models and neuroimaging data of states with disrupted self-specifying processing. A proof-of-concept is demonstrated using active inference models of meditative non-dual awareness and psychedelic ego-dissolution. The resulting predictions suggest that the hierarchical nature of neural systems may be a core mechanism for generating selfhood. The hypothesis posits that flattening the hierarchy in a system allows one to experience qualia without the psychological sense that they are given to a subject. This hypothesis is then implemented in a current computational model of selfhood (Reichle &amp; Boag, 2024). The paper provides two insights: (1) how to deduce core mechanisms of selfhood, and (2) specific guidance on which parameters to modify in computational models of consciousness or selfhood to simulate selflessness.",

Grounded in two postulates—that we live in a four-dimensional block universe where all moments coexist and that conscious experience of the present moment is real—the essay introduces the multitrack consciousness conjecture to reconcile these views. It suggests that multiple versions of our conscious selves exist simultaneously across time, with each version only capable of experiencing a single \"now.\" The concept of information meshes briefly addresses questions of identity, memory, and shared experiences within this framework. This conjecture offers a new perspective on time, consciousness, and the self, inviting further interdisciplinary exploration.",

To examine predictive features by treatment type, Lasso Regression models were built separately for youth who completed individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family CBT (FCBT), sertraline alone (SRT), and combination of SRT and CBT (COMB). Automatic relevance determination (ARD) emerged as the best performing model in the harmonized (RMSE = 1.84, R2 = 0.28) and external validation datasets (RMSE = 1.87, R2 = 0.11). Predictive features of poorer outcomes were primarily indicators of symptom severity and trial effects, although predictors varied within treatments (e.g., caregiver psychopathology was predictive for FCBT; depressive symptoms were predictive for COMB).

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, human decision-making often involves adaptively leveraging different strategies to maximize gains. These strategic shifts, however, are overlooked by many traditional reinforcement learning models. Here, we incorporate parallel evaluation systems into distribution-based modeling and propose an entropy-weighted dual-process model that leverages Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent frequency and value-based decision-making strategies, respectively. Model simulations and empirical tests demonstrated that our model outperformed traditional RL models by uniquely capturing participants’ strategic change from value-based to frequency-based learning in response to heightened uncertainty. As reward variance increased, participants switched from focusing on actual rewards to using reward frequency as a proxy for value, thereby showing greater preference for more frequently rewarded but less rewarding options. These findings suggest that increased uncertainty encourages the compensatory use of diverse evaluation methods, and our dual-process model provides a promising framework for studying multi-system decision-making in complex, multivariable contexts.",

          "abstract": "The deployment of spatial attention generates distinct neural signatures that can be detected at the scalp. Here, we use multivariate pattern analysis of EEG data to decode the deployment of spatial attention, and ask if this is modulated by repetitive movements. 'Stimming' movements (also known as repetitive stereotypies), are widely reported in autism, but also present in some neurotypical individuals. Stimming has historically been viewed as a problematic behaviour, but many individuals claim that stimming benefits attention. We first validated our paradigm (a Posner-style cueing design), demonstrating above-chance classification of cue direction from around 300ms post-cue onset. We then investigated whether stimming modulates decoding accuracy and task performance. Our results, consisting of data primarily from neurotypical participants, do not suggest that stimming has a negative impact on an individual's ability to attend, unless the individual does not typically engage in stimming behaviours. This suggests interventions aiming to reduce stimming behaviours are not necessarily warranted and highlights the need for further research into the potential benefits of stimming specifically within the autistic population. Future research might also consider the potential overlap between autistic stimming and the fidgeting behaviours which are characteristic of ADHD, to help understand the significant overlaps between the characteristics of the two conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Pediatric major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a leading cause of disability worldwide in children and adolescents, while its underlying pathophysiology remains largely elusive. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are considered intertwined regulatory systems crucially implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. This study explores the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between the ECS, specifically anandamide (AEA), and the HPA axis with its main effector cortisol and MDD status and severity in children and adolescents. \nMethods: Utilizing data from the omega-3-pMDD trial, a phase III Randomized Clinical Trial assessing the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in pediatric MDD, we examined hair AEA and cortisol concentrations in 124 children and adolescents aged 8-17 years, with MDD. Associations between MDD, symptom severity and hair AEA and cortisol concentrations were explored across four measurement time points (baseline, week 6, 24 and 36). Additionally, 127 healthy children and adolescents were examined once to enable cross-sectional comparisons between MDD cases and healthy controls.\nResults: Baseline comparisons for the 251 children and adolescents showed lower cortisol and AEA levels in hair of children and adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls. Longitudinal multi-level analysis over all time-points further corroborated negative longitudinal associations between hair cortisol and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with MDD.\nConclusions: Reduced baseline AEA and cortisol levels emerge as robust biomarker in depressed youth, while the negative longitudinal association between hair cortisol and depression symptoms might provide useful for therapy monitoring purposes. These results hold implications for early detection, diagnosis, and therapeutic response prediction in pediatric MDD.",

(2024) also highlight that some of these differences have important clinical implications for differential diagnosis and treatment planning for sleep-wake disorders. In this response to their commentary we consider our points of agreement, points of difference with minor implications for the patterns of symptom overlap described in the target paper, and one point of difference with more substantial implications (i.e., splitting vs. lumping several different insomnia symptoms). Overall, it seems likely that the different aims of our studies (mapping the patterns of repetition throughout the DSM vs. creating an inventory of symptoms from a clinical sleep medicine perspective) led us to err on different ends of the lumping versus splitting spectrum.",

          "abstract": "As a culture-sensitive theory in moral psychology, Moral foundations theory (MFT) has generated a considerable volume of studies since its inception. The theory has very recently been refined by splitting the Fairness foundation to Equality and Proportionality, leading to the introduction of a second version of its corresponding questionnaire, namely, Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2 (MFQ-2). Given the low internal consistencies of a number of moral foundations in the former version of the questionnaire (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire-1), the present study aimed to examine psychometric properties of the Persian MFQ-2, including its relation to MFQ-1. Data were collected from two separate samples (N1 = 381, N2 = 989). Internal consistencies of the subscales were acceptable and comparable to those from cross-cultural studies, in addition to showing an improvement over MFQ-1. Exploratory factor analysis led to four factors, with Loyalty, Authority and Purity loading on one, and Care, Equality and Proportionality each loading on a separate factor. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested acceptable fit for the proposed six-factor model and a number of second-order two-factor models. Subscales were most strongly related to their corresponding MFQ-1 subscales, confirming their convergent validity. We also replicated and went beyond the existing literature on sociodemographic correlates of moral foundations by investigating the relations between the revised set of moral foundations and both religiosity and political orientation in the context of the non-Western Iranian culture. Proportionality had the weakest relations to sociodemographics among all foundations. We close by discussing implications of the findings for the content validity of MFQ-2 foundations and justifiability of labelling them as individualizing and binding foundations.",

          "authors": "Inés Abalo-Rodríguez; Paco Calvo",
          "abstract": "Plants have traditionally been viewed as passive organisms, primarily reacting to environmental stimuli. However, research over the past century has revealed that plants exhibit a range of sophisticated abilities, such as integrating multiple sources of information, anticipating environmental changes, and communicating with other organisms. This has led to the emergence of plant neurobiology, which argues that physiology alone is not enough to fully comprehend the vast capacities of plants. Consequently, terms like ‘behaviour’, ‘intelligence’ and ‘cognition’ are applied to the plant kingdom, prompting ongoing discussions. As these notions pertain to the psychological realm, this paper incorporates the perspective of behaviour analysis to illuminate the current debate. This framework adopts an emergentist view of psychological phenomena, defending their irreducibility to physiological processes alone. Furthermore, behaviour analysis understands both behaviour and the ‘mind’ as psychological concepts that require learning processes for full comprehension, thereby highlighting their irreducible to physiology due to their distinct nature. Therefore, this approach emphasizes the importance of studying learning processes in plant neurobiology and addressing the methodological challenges it entails. In summary, this paper argues for the relevance of behavioural analysis in broadening our understanding of plant capabilities and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration. By integrating insights from behavioural analysis and plant neurobiology we can advance our understanding of plant intelligence and behaviour, challenging traditional views and enriching the scientific discourse on cognition and interaction in the plant kingdom.",

Both correlated seven-factor and second-order individualizing-binding two-factor models showed good fit, particularly for separate Relevance and Judgement sections. The majority of MAC-Q, especially Judgement, subscales correlated significantly and most strongly with their corresponding external scales. Alphas were generally higher for Relevance than Judgement subscales. Moreover, MAC-Q, especially Judgement, made significant improvement over MFQ in predicting most external scales.

In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "It is a well-established finding that more informative optic flow (e.g., faster, denser, or presented over a larger portion of the visual field) yields decreased variability in heading judgements. Current models of heading perception further predict faster processing under such circumstances, which has, however, not been supported empirically so far. In this study, we validate a novel continuous psychophysics paradigm by replicating the effect of the speed and density of optic flow on variability in performance, and we investigate how these manipulations affect the temporal dynamics. To this end, we tested 30 participants in a continuous psychophysics paradigm administered in Virtual Reality. We immersed them in a simple virtual environment where they experienced four 90-second blocks of optic flow where their linear heading direction (no simulated rotation) at any given moment was determined by a random walk. We asked them to continuously indicate with a joystick the direction in which they perceived themselves to be moving. In each of the four blocks they experienced a different combination of simulated self-motion speeds (SLOW and FAST) and density of optic flow (SPARSE and DENSE). Using a Cross-Correlogram Analysis, we determined that participants reacted faster and displayed lower variability in their performance in the FAST and DENSE conditions than in the SLOW and SPARSE conditions, respectively. Using a Kalman Filter-based analysis approach, we found a similar pattern, where the fitted perceptual noise parameters were higher for SLOW and SPARSE. While replicating previous results on variability, we show that more informative optic flow can speed up heading judgements, while at the same time validating a continuous psychophysics as an efficient method for studying heading perception.",

Our goal was to unpack this association through the lens of a novel theory: The Model of Excellencism and Perfectionism. Results of Study 1 (N= 273) showed higher test anxiety, fear of failure, and mistake rumination for perfection strivers compared to excellence strivers. Results of Study 2 (N= 248) replicated these findings. Also, they showed that perfection strivers are more likely than excellence strivers to catastrophize about small mistakes, use reassurance seeking safety behaviors, and underperform in their exams. Excellencism and perfectionism are related but different pursuits, and their differentiation is essential to unveil the unhealthy role of perfectionistic standards in the nomological network of test anxiety.

          "abstract": "According to Frege’s principle of compositionality, the meaning of a complex expression is determined as a function of its constituents and the type of construction that combines the constituents. For a given expression, the compositionality refers to the degree to which the expression fulfils this principle, in particular when determined for complex words such as BLACKBIRD or GLOBALISE. Here, we present an overview of studies providing compositionality estimates for complex words, by defining a classification system that includes (1) the type of expression (compound nouns, particle verbs, derivations), (2) the language, (3) the level of description (i.e., focusing on individual constituents vs. the entire complex word), and (4) the information source providing the estimate (human judgments vs. computational models). Typical applications for compositionality estimates are discussed.",

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, focusing on how different phases of the cardiac cycle (systole and diastole) influence external stimulus processing. This is often studied by synchronising stimulus presentation with participants’ cardiac phases. However, there is considerable inconsistency in how these phases are defined across studies. As in biomedical disciplines, some studies use participants' electrocardiograms (ECGs) to define cardiac phases: systole is the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave, while the rest is classified as diastole. Other studies use a time-based heuristic approach, in which cardiac phases are defined based on the estimated arrival of baroreceptor afferent signals to the brain; however, conclusive evidence for this cardiac-driven effect is lacking. The variation between and within these methods has led to a confusing characterisation of systole and diastole, e.g., systole in one study can be considered diastole in another study, and vice versa. This heavily undermines interoception research and the interpretation of findings. We address this issue by outlining the current state of research on the effect of cardiac phases on stimulus processing, discussing the confusion caused by time-based heuristic approaches based on baroreceptor activity, and highlighting methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases. Rather than focusing on individual study findings, we emphasise the challenges these inconsistencies create, such as issues with replicability and interpretation, and provide recommendations for standardising methodologies to improve the reliability and comparability of future research.",

          "abstract": "Interaction effects are commonly investigated in psychological research. Spurious interaction effects can occur, for instance because the outcome variable is related in a nonlinear way to an independent variable. Our study had two objectives: (1) to evaluate to what extent interaction terms in linear models can approximate non-linear phenomena, and (2) to assess how well linear models capture non-standard moderation effects. \nIn Study 1, we created population data where the outcome variable was either monotonically or non-monotonically related to a predictor. In Study 2, we created population data sets, in which effects of one predictor on the correlation between outcome and another predictor were present. In both studies, we varied the correlation between the predictor variables, the signal to noise ratio, and the sample size. We applied linear regression models, both with and without an interaction term. We assessed the Type-1-Error rate, the sample effect size of the interaction effects, and the explained variance of the estimated model in the sample and in the population.\nFor study 1, we found that traditional interaction terms were associated with increased Type-I error rates, but small effect sizes. For study 2, we found that if the effect is non-monotonic a traditional interaction term in a linear model does not sufficiently capture such effects.\nWe conclude that relying solely on traditional interaction terms in linear models can be misleading. It may be beneficial to consider alternative modeling approaches or more flexible methods to better capture and understand non-linear and irregular dependency effects.",

          "abstract": "Sleep plays a role in memory consolidation. However, there is considerable debate about whether all memories, or only certain memories, benefit from consolidation during sleep. Previous investigations of sleep-dependent memory consolidation have explored top-down mechanisms on memory selection (e.g., future relevance) or utilized stimuli that are easily differentiated by participants (e.g., emotional stimuli). Here, we tested the role of bottom-up influences on sleep-dependent consolidation, specifically testing whether the intrinsic memorability of a stimulus is related to how likely an image is to be remembered after sleep. We found that sleep selectively consolidated only high memorability images. Previous work has shown that participants could not reliably predict image memorability, suggesting that our observed benefit for high memorability images reflected an automatic selection process. We provide the first evidence that one mechanism of selective memory consolidation during sleep is based on perceptual features, suggesting that unconscious “relevance” at encoding impacts subsequent consolidation.",

          "abstract": "Political science research increasingly relies on text classification to gauge subtle concepts like toxicity or anger. However, common methods treat words and phrases in isolation, ignoring the relational dynamics where meaning is embedded in the interaction between phrases and their textual environment. Recent transformer-based language models overcome such limitations, but are rarely used in published political science articles, possibly due to misconceptions about their data and computational requirements. This article explains the pretrain-finetune paradigm for transformer-based language models and its potential to improve text analysis in political science by harnessing robust models trained on extensive datasets while requiring relatively small amounts of labeled data and computational resources from researchers. To demonstrate its effectiveness, I employ the approach to identify toxic language in conversation threads following US Senators' tweets.",

We have strong evidence that climate activism shifts public opinion and media coverage in a pro-climate direction, but this varies by context and the tactics employed. We have more moderate evidence that activism can pressure policymakers to communicate more about climate change, encourage voters to vote in a more pro-climate direction, and financially pressure carbon intensive companies. We review suggestive evidence that protest can influence emissions and environmental policy. Although these studies cover a wide swath of outcome variables, a majority examine intermediate variables, rather than long term impacts. Generalizability is challenged by a bias towards the U.S. and Western Europe. We call for greater focus outside those geographic areas and more attention to activism's impact on public policy and emissions.",

          "abstract": "Citizens are expected to hold corrupt politicians accountable. However, while observational studies and field experiments often find corrupt politicians re-elected, survey experiments show that citizens are unlikely to vote for corrupt candidates. This contradiction may arise because previous studies have not accounted for how citizens navigate political information in the real world. In this paper, we propose a model of corruption accountability that considers how citizens selectively engage with political information. We test this model using a PICA experimental design fielded in Spain. The results indicate that information selection can explain the limited consequences of corruption scandals, as not all citizens expose themselves to corruption information, and their likelihood to hold corrupt politicians accountable depends on their information preferences. These findings suggest corruption accountability may be increased not by informing those who select out of counter-attitudinal information, but by reaching inattentive citizens generally not exposed to political information.",

          "abstract": "Illegal dumping, the unauthorized disposal of waste in public spaces, poses significant environmental, social, and economic challenges, particularly in Ontario, Canada. This study investigates the drivers behind illegal dumping, with a focus on rural and urban communities in Ontario. Using a mixed-methods approach, including household surveys and interviews, we examine self-reported instances of dumping, attitudes towards waste management, and perceived barriers to legal waste disposal. The results reveal that inadequate waste collection infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, and high disposal costs are primary motivators for illegal dumping. Additionally, a lack of awareness regarding proper disposal methods exacerbates the issue. While most respondents recognize the immorality of illegal dumping, rural participants show less guilt and are more likely to engage in the behavior. The study provides actionable insights for policymakers, including the need for improved waste infrastructure, targeted educational campaigns, and increased enforcement efforts. By addressing these key factors, Ontario can mitigate the environmental and public health risks posed by illegal dumping, while fostering a culture of responsible waste disposal.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the rally-round-the-flag phenomenon of public opinion has increased in studies on reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In the same period, a separate research line has focused on political polarization and the strengthening of radical right parties in many countries. This study brings these two lines together by asking how public opinion in deeply polarized countries responds to violent international conflicts, which, under lesser polarization, would have likely led most citizens to close ranks behind the government and its war policy. To answer this question, we analyzed original panel data collected in Israel before and after the October 7 massacre and during Israel’s retaliation in Gaza. The findings reveal mixed patterns that we label “segmented rally:” The vast majority supported the war and trusted the security forces, but only a minority trusted the government and the prime minister. The analysis identified distinct sets of mechanisms of opinion formation. Rallying behind the war and security forces was motivated by feelings of threat, humiliation, and rage. In contrast, trust or mistrust of the government and the PM depended on whether respondents blamed the government or anti-government protests for the security crisis, an assessment driven by respondents’ preexisting views about the government’s “judicial reform” initiative. The paper concludes by discussing the mutual impacts of polarization and public reactions to crises.",

The concentration of HBE scholarship in English-speaking countries has led to missed opportunities to engage other partners in testing and expanding human behavioral ecological models of human behavioral and life history variation. In this review, we describe opportunities for broader human behavioral ecology-driven scholarship in the Chinese context. We introduce human behavioral ecology holistically, including its history, methodological frameworks, pet topics, recent integration with related fields, with a special emphasis on its recent integration with Chinese social, archaeological, and life sciences scholarship. We address potential criticisms of human behavioral ecology and how to ensure a robust and careful application of human behavioral ecology principles in the study of human behavior in China, past and present.

Here, we operationalize critical thinking skills into 6 measurable concepts (i.e., causation and correlation, independent data and replicates, reproducibility, credibility of sources, experimental control, and significance), and we explore whether teaching these 6 concepts enhances scientific literacy and/or resilience against fakeness (fake tweets) and misinformation. Mixed results from our study reveal that: 1) in a small group game on misinformation, critical thinking training significantly improves accuracy and speed in assessing the truthfulness of scientific information online; 2) in a large, preregistered, randomized trial, understanding and application of critical thinking skills concepts strongly correlates with participants’ ability to identify fake tweets and misinformation; however, critical thinking training with recorded videos does not enhance participants’ proficiency in detecting fakeness and misinformation. There is a need to develop innovative interventions to prepare people to respond to misinformation, which is fast-evolving. Tools to support misinformation-specific critical thinking skills have been largely unexplored, and we anticipate such tools might be a valuable contribution to help the public navigate infodemics.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing need to maximise the social benefits achieved from public investment in infrastructure, particularly with the transition to net zero economies. Project Delivery Models (PDMs)—the contractual agreements that set out roles and responsibilities for infrastructure project partners—can underpin the delivery of social benefits, yet the processes involving their selection are largely opaque. In this paper we explore how social considerations inform PDM selection and how this is facilitated by policy. We interviewed highly experienced procurement professionals from the sector about how social benefits and risks are considered. We also examined how the associated regulatory environment supports social considerations through documentary analysis of auditing guidance documents. We found that not only are social benefits sidelined in early project decisions, but social risks are inadequately considered. An entrenched gap in social expertise contributes to this situation while project compartmentalisation presents challenges for inclusion and transparency in decision-making. Current auditing processes provide little incentive for social benefit consideration and reinforce both risk framing and compartmentalisation of major infrastructure projects. The paper offers new and important insights into this early project stage and distils five recommendations for improving social benefit creation from infrastructure investments, particularly in developed economies.",

          "abstract": "Recovery efforts of existing South Korean watchtower sites have been conducted as part of local tourism efforts and have contributed to public interest in the conservation and study of said sites. An additional 21 sites have been excavated in 2023, deemed important enough for reconstruction efforts (Yang, 2023). However, while significant research exists on the archeological sites themselves, there is scarcely any public recognition of the soldiers that manned the stations and their subsequent socioeconomic standing. Popular culture has abbreviated depictions of Joseon-dynasty watchtowers to a similar level: (significant for) “an extensive communications network to deliver information about enemy forces, that also employed horseback riders as an emergency backup” (Ntl. Institute of Kor. History, 2024).  I argue this depiction is overly generic and implies equivalence to Eurocentric watchtower practices, ignoring the cultural nuances that made the position of the average Joseon-dynasty watchman significantly challenging and fundamentally divergent from then-contemporary watchmen in European countries. This paper subsequently attempts to discern and critically evaluate the sociocultural status of soldiers stationed at Joseon watchtowers (Bonghwa), comparing them against European watchtowers and their socioeconomic conditions. Specific sites include Caernarfon Castle and Cheonlim Bonghwa Watchtower at the site of Cheonlim Mountain, the latter of which has been accompanied by more thorough artifact and observational fieldwork analysis. Recovered artifacts include living quarters, barriers, and tools. Further literature analysis was conducted to discern the socioeconomic standing and practices of Bonghwa watchmen in context of mid-century Joseon dynasty caste systems. In combining fieldwork and sociocultural analysis, I develop a multidimensional account of Joseon watchmen and prove that the soldiers assigned to Joseon watchtowers, Bonghwa, are representative of an underrepresented social dynamic, as well as providing insights into the philosophical and theological differences between the Western sphere through material conditions.",

A topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127) shows this longstanding Romantic understanding has largely disappeared; today, Apocalypticism is by far the dominant genre for conceiving them. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive evaluations of leisure and consumption opportunities. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. The approach used here is novel, replicable, focused and non-reactive and can be transposed to other national contexts.",

          "abstract": "This chapter provides an ethnographic account of how content creators present cancer cures on TikTok. It assesses the quality of cancer cure videos algorithmically recommended by TikTok, the radicalization pathways afforded by short video platforms like TikTok and their potential to cause online harms. Content creators commonly feature contrarian doctors and draw on a conspiratorial worldview to present various miracle cures as intentionally concealed and stigmatized by the establishment. This framing gives credence to creators’ claims and the cures they promote. It also presents TikTok as a more reliable platform from which to access health information censored by the mainstream. Since TikTok is used as a search engine by younger demographics, it becomes a key means of accessing health information. Using TikTok to access health information poses significant risks: First, the technological affordances of TikTok render the app susceptible to radicalizing users. While radicalization is not technologically determined by simply viewing content, radicalization can occur through the endless scroll of conspiratorial content algorithmically recommended to users searching for cancer cures on the platform through a gradual process of socialization. Second, short form videos can become a gateway to radical views because these videos commonly direct users to personal bios, websites and ecommerce stores. Third, radicalization and online harms can be facilitated by TikTok because the app provides accessible avenues for monetization that incentivize content creators to profit from fake cancer cures. This research has important implications for content moderators because the risk of cancer misinformation is not limited to the content uploaded the platform, but the ways in which short videos become a gateway to harmful products and more extreme, conspiratorial content.",

          "abstract": "War is rare, less because states peacefully settle disputes, but more because they have nothing to dispute. To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I propose a concept of claimability, defined as the appropriateness of making a claim. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, self-determination, and maritime sovereignty), I construct a new dataset of states’ claimable areas for 1946–2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this concept by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increase interstate conflicts only when they are discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as a “most-similar” case study, provide further credence.

          "authors": "Ingrid K van Dijk",
          "abstract": "In historical the Netherlands, child mortality was distributed unequally between families and this inequality persisted across generations. Using family reconstitution data for the province of Zeeland (LINKS) containing over 200.000 children born 1835-1914, I show that mortality was higher among children under age 5 whose parents lost siblings before age 5. This intergenerational persistence of child mortality existed independently from socioeconomic differences in child mortality. Inequalities accumulated, as child mortality was highest for low-SES children whose parents originated from high-mortality, low-socioeconomic status families. Intergenerational transmission in child mortality persisted even when child mortality had declined in the early 20th century.",

          "authors": "Jill R D MacKay",
          "abstract": "Autoethnography is a methodological approach which seeks to provide depth of experience and understanding of a phenomena through the researcher’s analysis of their own personal experience. As a veterinary researcher with a focus on different methodologies, I elected to apply the autoethnographic approach to my experiences adopting my cat, Athena, from a shelter in 2014. I knew I had experienced feelings of regret and considered relinquishing Athena in the immediate post-adoption period, and I was interested in using this as a case study into the formation of a successful human companion-animal relationship. Through my analysis of my own experiences, I have three main reflections which may be able to aid the veterinary and shelter industries in supporting successful adoptions. First, the highly individual nature of each individual companion animal relationship must be recognised and supported, with veterinary and shelter advice being tailored to the specific needs of the owner and animal. Second, the transition to pet owner requires more active and realistic management, without following a ‘recipe’ for a perfect owner and pet relationship. Finally, I reflect on how my own mental health impacted the process of adoption in light of research surrounding the beneficial impacts of companion animals on pets. Overall, I found the autoethnographic process to be a challenging, but useful lens onto the phenomenon of pet relinquishment, and highlight some considerations for its use in veterinary research.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter we review accumulating research on the social learning mechanisms that power cultural evolution. We begin by outlining some adaptive challenges that learners face, emphasizing cases of individual learning. Many of these challenges are shared with social learning, but it also helps highlight the circumstances under which social learning is particularly valuable. We then turn to the specific inferential challenges that must be addressed by cognitive mechanisms for social learning. We review several proposed heuristics that humans and other animals use to extract information from conspecifics, while considering how they deal with each inferential challenge. We finish by describing some of the big debates regarding the cognition underlying cultural capacities in humans and how they provide avenues for future research.",

          "authors": "Christian König; Katja Salomo; Marcel Helbig",
          "abstract": "Exposure to environmental burdens, such air and noise pollution or the lack of available green spaces, has been linked to a multitude of detrimental outcomes. Previous evidence indicates that poor residents and foreign minorities in European cities are disproportionately exposed to environmental burdens. However, there are substantial but ill-understood differences between European countries and between cities within countries. To address this limitation, we utilise fine-grained 1km-by-1km neighbourhood grid data on objective air and noise pollution as well as green space availability, enriched with administrative data on poverty rates and foreign minority shares from all German cities with at least 100,000 inhabitants in 2017. We examine whether poor residents and foreign minorities are more often affected by environmental burdens, how their exposure to environmental burdens differs between cities, and what city-specific contextual factors contribute to these between-city differences. We find evidence that foreign minorities are more likely to be exposed to environmental burdens, but poor residents are predominantly not. However, there is considerable variation between cities. The strongest explanatory factor for this variation is the extent to which disadvantaged groups live in central neighbourhoods, less so residential segregation of poor and foreign residents, or the scarcity of ‘clean and healthy’ neighbourhoods in a city. Against these results, we further explore empirically how the current wave of inner-city gentrification might ease environmental inequality in German cities.",

          "authors": "Jürgen Beyer; Katharina Legantke",
          "abstract": "This study examines the divergent development of the platform-based food delivery sector in Germany, focusing on why the ideal-typical gig economy model based on self-employed couriers has not taken hold. Unlike other countries, Germany stands out as an exceptional case where large food delivery platforms classify their workers as employees, providing them with rights and benefits such as minimum wage, paid vacation, and sick leave. The study uses a historical-sociological case study approach to reconstruct the development of the sector and the decision-making processes that have influenced this development. Drawing on historical institutionalism, the analysis examines different heuristics for divergent paths: self-reinforcing path dependence, self-induced reactive sequences, critical junctures, mindful path creation, and transformative incremental change. The study finds that early market shaping by the pioneering company Bringdienst.de (later called Pizza.de), which focused on equipping restaurants to deliver online orders without taking responsibility for the delivery itself, significantly influenced the market environment. In addition, a court ruling in 2020 has increased the risk perception of bogus self-employment among platforms, leading to the abandonment of the gig worker model with self-employed couriers. The study concludes that the critical juncture heuristic, combined with a shadow of the past effect of market constitution, best explains the unique development in Germany.",

          "authors": "Joseph Alexander Freire",
          "abstract": "This study conducts an epistemic and exegetical analysis of the early writings of the young Søren Kierkegaard, situating them within the intellectual context of Denmark's Golden Age (1834-1841). During this period, Denmark experienced a cultural revival marked by the widespread influence of German philosophical thought, especially the ideas of Kant, Hegel, and the Romantics. The central objective of this research is to explore how the discussions on Romantic irony, subjectivism, and the cultural crisis shaped Kierkegaard's philosophical development. The analysis focuses on the main intellectual figures of the era, such as Johan Ludvig Heiberg, Hans Lassen Martensen, and Poul Martin Møller, and how their contributions influenced Kierkegaard's formative years. This work challenges the traditional view that isolates Kierkegaard from his contemporaries, proposing instead that he actively engaged with and responded to the ongoing debates of his time. By contextualizing his work within the broader cultural transformations of Denmark's Golden Age, the study aims to illuminate Kierkegaard's early philosophical positions and the origins of his concept of irony.",

Through a detailed analysis, it presents best practices in education, infrastructure, community engagement, and policy frameworks.\n\nKey recommendations emphasize the importance of resident education through workshops, clear signage, and the distribution of welcome kits. The report also advocates for infrastructure improvements, such as convenient bin placements, appropriate bin sizes, and space optimization. Additionally, community engagement is highlighted, with the formation of resident committees and the use of recognition and reward programs as effective methods to increase participation.",

          "abstract": "In examining Italy's low fertility rates, recent studies emphasize the role played by socio-economic factors, uncertainty, and welfare state. However, emerging research highlights a potential downward revision of fertility ideals among younger generations. Our study analyses fertility desires, expectations, and the perceived value of having children among young adults in Italy from 2012 to 2022. Findings reveal a growing tendency of being childfree and not expecting to have children in life. In particular, they indicate a nuanced demographic gradient: we observe a decline in fertility desires and expectations with age, and a significant increase in the likelihood of not desiring children for women. Educational background, which was positively associated with fertility desires at the beginning of the observational period, in post-pandemic shows a negative or null relationship. Our study highlights the need for robust, harmonized cross-country surveys to better understand new fertility ideals across different socio-demographic contexts.",

          "abstract": "The mountain communities of late-first millennium BC Italy have been regarded as non-urban societies that reverted to city life mainly owing to Roman intervention. A growing body of archaeological evidence is uncovering the diversity of settlement forms and dynamics in the region’s pre-Roman past, which included sites encompassing a range of functions and social agents. This article presents an indepth, microscale analysis of one such site, Monte Vairano in Samnium, drawing on perspectives from comparative urbanism. Monte Vairano developed urban characteristics such as a complex socioeconomic profile and political cohesion, as well as potentially more unique features such as an apparently balanced distribution of wealth. These results can shed further light on the diversity of ancient urbanization and its sociopolitical implications in late-first millennium BC Italy and the Mediterranean.",

          "authors": "Christian Oswald",
          "abstract": "Conflict forecasting has seen two recent developments: a shift to predicting continuous variables and a debate about the value of structural and procedural variables. This paper contributes to these efforts and proposes the category of salience variables in the form of Google Trends and Wikipedia data. Internet searches can be precursors of conflict intensity as a result of e.g. an increase in protests, violent behavior, or public announcements. Data are readily and openly available, updated in real time, and provide global coverage which makes it ideal for near-real time forecasting. Prediction targets are the number of security-related incidents and battle-related, non-state, and civilian casualties. I demonstrate the value of salience variables using various out-of-sample windows and performance metrics on the country- and province-month level. I find evidence that salience variables have considerable predictive power, outperform other commonly used variables, and are thus a valuable addition to the conflict forecasting toolkit.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Hannu Lehti; Niko Eskelinen; Simo Arhippainen",
          "abstract": "A fundamental concern in studying social inequalities is understanding how socioeconomic advantages and disadvantages are passed down from generation to generation. However, previous studies have not adequately distinguished between the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to socioeconomic disadvantage. In this paper, we use Finnish register data on twins born from 1975 to 1986, considering a total of 7,628 pairs, to analyze how genetic and environmental factors are associated with dropout from secondary education, unemployment, and the receipt of social assistance during early adulthood. The results of the twin design show that not only environmental but also genetic factors play a role in all measured socioeconomic disadvantage outcomes. For school dropout and, particularly, unemployment, genetic components explain more than shared environment. Conversely, for the receipt of social assistance, the shared environment component is larger than the genetic component. This result indicates that living in impoverished economic conditions is more dependent on factors related to social resources than those related to genetic inheritance. Of all the measured indicators, the unique environment is the most important, indicating the influence of stochastic life events regarding socioeconomically disadvantageous outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Although economic inequality and economic segregation represent fundamental challenges of\ncontemporary societies, their causal and empirical connections remain unclear. In particular, the\ndirection of causality, causal pathways, and temporal relationship are not apparent in the literature.\nThis stems from two observations: 1/ the discussion is dominated by a handful of studies from the\nUSA originating from the 2000s. This comes at the expense of a more plural and complex\nunderstanding of phenomena in the rest of the world. 2/ the literature on inequality and that of\nsegregation are segmented by disciplines operating at different scales with corresponding theories,\nactors and mechanisms. To address these issues, I conduct an extensive systematic literature review\nof articles linking economic inequality to economic segregation across multiple languages and\ndisciplines. Starting from 20,000+ references, I identify 80 research articles. Most conclude that\nvariations in economic segregation follow differences in economic inequality in the short term and\nthat reverse causality is more probable in the longer term. The housing market is the most cited\nmediator between economic inequality and economic segregation, and a diversity of theories are\nmobilized to explain their empirical connections. Many articles are not presently comparable, but\ncompatible definitions and measurements of inequality and segregation are rising.",

Trades driven by soft-information acquisition are profitable, resulting in superior performance by these managers, especially in their holdings of stocks rich with soft information.
