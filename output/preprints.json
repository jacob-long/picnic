          "authors": "Dobromir Rahnev",
          "abstract": "Confidence in perceptual tasks typically follows accuracy, making it difficult to study the mechanisms specific to confidence computation. However, the last decade and a half has seen a proliferation of experimental manipulations that lead to confidence-accuracy dissociations where one condition leads to higher confidence, but equal (or lower) accuracy compared to another condition. Such dissociations promise to reveal the underlying principles behind confidence ratings. Nevertheless, there is no consensus surrounding how to create confidence-accuracy dissociations or how to interpret their existence. This review first categorizes existing confidence-accuracy dissociations, highlighting that they can be produced by stimulus, task, or brain manipulations. It then examines the most common mechanistic explanations for why such dissociations occur. Finally, it explores several confusions and open questions regarding the use of the term “positive evidence bias,” the relationship between confidence-accuracy dissociations and metacognition noise, and the role of reaction time in such dissociations. Overall, this review highlights the fact that confidence-accuracy dissociations can be produced by multiple mechanisms and suggests that computational models of confidence should be evaluated based on their ability to predict new dissociations.",

          "authors": "Hannah B. Eareckson",
          "abstract": "Social role theory suggests that men and women are represented in jobs based on whether the work is agentic or communal, but most research has focused on a small set of occupations, like STEM and HEED. In this study, we measured perceived masculinity, femininity, agency, and communion for 347 U.S. jobs using O*NET descriptors and 2022 Census data. Participants rated 134 job characteristics, which we combined into composite scores weighted by activities, skills, abilities, and values. We tested whether percent women in a job predicted communal or agentic work, whether job femininity-masculinity aligned with perceived communion and agency, and whether these relationships differed by job preparation level. Results show that women are consistently overrepresented in communal jobs, but men are only overrepresented in agentic jobs for high-preparation occupations. Job femininity strongly aligns with communal content, while job agency only aligns moderately with masculinity in high-prep jobs. These findings show that the links between gender, agency, and communion vary across the occupational landscape.",

          "abstract": "Early vocabulary development predicts later cognitive functioning and school success. We sought to examine how processing differences across several skills that contribute to early word learning relate to variability in children’s vocabulary development. Building on recent direct measures of early vocabulary and language learning processes, we collected data from 166 children between 15- to 27-months in a single eyetracking task measuring lexical speed of processing, comprehension, novelty bias, word mapping and new word retention. We found clear differences in responding across the different measures and robust patterns of developmental change. Children’s comprehension grew over development, and across word classes they showed clearly distinct looking patterns, reflecting fundamental differences in word type processing and more efficient noun recognition compared to adjectives and verbs. Speed of processing and online comprehension showed strong relationships with concurrent vocabulary, similar to previous reports. Children also showed a strong improvement in referent selection over development, but as found in previous literature, they did not show evidence of retaining new word-object mappings formed on earlier trials of the task. Data driven classification found two robust clusters of children. One group showed faster speed of lexical processing, better comprehension and were better at linking new nouns to novel objects. Numerically, this group had the highest parent-reported concurrent productive vocabulary scores. Data are discussed in relation to similar work in the literature, what concurrent measurement of multiple word learning processes reveals about the system of multiple processes supporting early vocabulary development, and children’s individual trajectories of word learning.",

          "abstract": "Auditors who perform audit sampling are often interested in obtaining evidence for or against the hypothesis that the misstatement in a population of items is lower than a critical limit, the so-called performance materiality. Here, we propose to perform this hypothesis test using a Bayesian approach that involves the use of an impartial prior distribution, assigning equal prior probabilities to the competing interval hypotheses. Firstly, we argue that the impartial prior distribution is sensible for auditors because it is easy to justify, interpret, and explain. Secondly, we show that Bayes factors computed using this prior distribution have desirable statistical properties. Finally, we compare these Bayes factors with traditional p-values in an audit sampling context and elaborate on the merits of the impartial Bayesian hypothesis test.",

          "abstract": "AI writing assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to make autocomplete suggestions to people as they write. Can these AI writing assistants impact people’s attitudes in this process? In two large-scale preregistered experiments (N=2,582), we exposed participants writing about important societal issues to an AI writing assistant that provided biased autocomplete suggestions. When using the AI assistant, the attitudes participants expressed in a post-task survey converged towards the AI’s position. Yet, a majority of participants were unaware of the AI suggestions’ bias and their influence. Further, the influence of the AI writing assistant was stronger than the influence of its suggestions when presented as static text, showing that the influence is partially due to AI writing assistants leading people to incorporate biased viewpoints into their own writing. Lastly, warning participants about assistants’ bias before or after exposure does not mitigate the influence effect.",

          "authors": "Bingsong Zhao; Stefan T. Radev; Konstantina Sokratous; Peter D. Kvam",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces moderational learning, a data-driven framework for identifying generative mechanisms underlying human behavior and cognition. Built on deep latent variable models, the framework jointly learns both a generative model that yields responses and a set of latent variables that encode individual differences. The approach can also integrate information across multiple tasks or modalities to estimate individual-level trait representations that predict behavior across tasks. Two simulation studies demonstrate that moderational learning accurately predicts behavior, recovers true latent factors, and identifies population heterogeneity that arises when participants adopt distinct strategies. Applied to real data from value-based decision tasks, the framework outperforms both subject- and group-level neural models in predicting human choices and reveals surprising theoretical insights. In multiple decision tasks, a single latent factor accounted for most individual variability, providing simpler and more accurate models of behavior than existing theories. Across tasks, we identified three common latent factors---risk discounting, delay discounting, and bidding proclivity. Sensitivity analysis shows that responses in pricing tasks do not always decrease monotonically with aversive attributes. Together, these results demonstrate that the proposed moderational learning framework can pave the way for a new data-driven paradigm that integrates and automates theory construction, model discovery, and representation learning of individual differences.",

          "authors": "Evgeniia Alenina; Терентьева Кристина Сергеевна; Косоногов Владимир Владимирович",
          "abstract": "Anxiety is a multidimensional construct that influences cognitive performance in complex ways, yet its factor structure and domain-specific effects remain unclear. This study examined (1) the psychometric structure of general and specific anxiety measures, (2) their associations with cognitive performance across different domains, and (3) the predictive power of machine learning models in classifying cognitive performance based on specific anxiety in different domains. A two-stage design was employed: Stage 1 (N = 500) assessed self-reported anxiety (trait, state, generalized, social, spatial, and math anxiety) via questionnaires, while Stage 2 (N = 104) involved a set of experiments measuring cognitive performance (accuracy and reaction time) across numerical, social, spatial, and control tasks. As a result, factor analyses revealed a correlated yet distinct structure, with the best-fitting model treating anxiety measures in different domains as independent factors. Regression analyses also demonstrated domain-specific effects: trait anxiety improved emotion recognition and spatial reasoning but did not affect math or color processing. Machine learning models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM) achieved modest but meaningful predictive accuracy, with ensemble methods outperforming linear models. Prediction of reaction time in cognitive tasks, based on anxiety measures, was less powerful, suggesting that non-anxiety factors play a larger role in cognitive performance. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between general and domain-specific anxieties in cognitive research and demonstrate the potential of a machine learning approach in modeling anxiety-performance relationships.",

Understanding the professional characteristics of this interdisciplinary workforce, including their perspectives on EBPs, will provide insight into workforce development domains to support EBP implementation. \nMethods: Collegiate health and prevention professionals (N=142) in a statewide higher education substance coalition completed a remote survey. Multiple regression and trend analyses were conducted to evaluate factors influencing attitudes toward and willingness to use EBPs. \nResults: Work experience predicted positive attitudes toward and willingness to use EBPs. Mid-career professionals endorsed the most positive attitudes towards and willingness to use EBPs for alcohol prevention, compared to those in early or advanced career stages.\nConclusions: Experience predicts positive attitudes towards/use of EBPs, and mid-career prevention professionals were most willing to use EBPs, indicating crucial time points to provide implementation support for prevention professionals.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety is a trait that requires understanding of its structure across fundamental life domains. The unresolved question is whether anxiety functions as a unified construct or a collection of specific concerns. While correlation-based approaches often posit a general latent anxiety factor, they may lack the nature of worries across different life areas. The current study assessed anxiety across ten life domains: health, family, work, finance, social, death, culture, education, environment, and technology. Participants (N=341) reported on the frequency and intensity of their worries for 150 triggers. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to test for a general factor and EBICglasso Network Analysis to explore the network structure of anxiety. EFA revealed a significant general factor, explaining = 48% (for both frequency and intensity) of the variance, supporting anxiety as a unitary predisposition. Network analysis revealed a highly modular structure at the item level (modularity = 0.75), with 18-19 distinct communities of concerns, indicating evidence for domain-specificity. At the same time, domains were densely interconnected. Our findings reveal a dual-nature architecture of anxiety as a general predisposition with the modular system of domain-specific concerns.",

          "abstract": "Driving is an inherently visual task that requires drivers to anticipate and predict future events on the road. We investigated the extent to which three different visual features – motion, stereoscopic depth, and scene context—can support drivers’ prediction of the appearance of natural road scenes. On each trial, 48 licensed drivers viewed a 2s preview of a video recorded from a dashboard camera, and immediately after, indicated what the scene would look like 2s in the future in a 5AFC task. We factorially manipulated each of the three visual features. We manipulated motion by displaying a still image or a video preview. We manipulated scene context by showing videos recorded either on urban roads or on highways. To investigate the impact of stereoscopic depth information, videos were recorded using two dashboard cameras, and videos were shown either binocularly with no disparity, binocularly with disparity, or monocularly. Overall, most participants were able to predict the appearance of the road above chance levels, with better performance for video previews than still images, and for urban roads than highway roads, indicating that speed and scene content inform predictions. Stereoscopic cues did not affect prediction performance, indicating that participants likely rely more heavily on monocular depth cues in this task. These results suggest that participants can imprecisely predict natural scenes multiple seconds into the future.",

          "authors": "Nora Turoman; Elodie Walter; Anaë; Laura-Isabelle Klatt",
          "abstract": "It has long been known that presenting information to multiple senses at a time (e.g., audiovisual presentation as opposed to only visual or auditory) improves later recall of said information – an effect known as the bimodal advantage. Surprisingly however, evidence for this has come only from studies employing free and serial recall, where the identity of an object is recalled, but not in cued recall, where one object feature is recalled when another one is cued. This is despite both tasks requiring binding features into an object in working memory (WM) – our brain’s capacity-limited system for temporarily maintaining information for the purpose of achieving behavioral goals. The present study investigated this discrepancy across a series of four experiments. Contrary to the literature, and despite near-identical task settings, we found evidence for a bimodal advantage across multiple experiments. Moreover, our results suggest that this advantage mainly arises from perceptual processes at encoding rather than from storage in an audiovisual fashion in WM. Finally, a primarily perceptually-based process, the bimodal advantage appears to be sensitive to the characteristics of the cue feature (i.e., its presentation modality). In sum, our results shed light on the mechanism of the bimodal advantage, now robustly detected in cued recall tasks, furthering our understanding of the relationship between perception and WM. Results are discussed in relation to prior studies that did not find a bimodal advantage, potential mechanisms underlying the effect, and the broader framework of the multicomponent model of WM.",

          "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are being rapidly incorporated into the work of psychologists, given their capability and flexibility in analyzing large-scale, complex, or otherwise messy datasets. In this context, and in the spirit of open science, ML research should be conducted in a transparent, understandable, and ethical manner. However, publications by psychology researchers and practitioners show a troubling lack of consistency in reporting ML information. Given that ML offers a wide range of analytical options, this article addresses an important need by providing a comprehensive, open-science checklist that specifies the information researchers should disclose at each stage of a supervised ML project—from data collection and preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, interpretation, and code sharing. We hope that psychological researchers will benefit from this checklist when reporting ML results and will adapt and extend this checklist further in the future.",

          "authors": "Kieren McCormack; Eleanor Chodroff; Volker Dellwo; Pavo Orepic",
          "abstract": "Our own voice is essential for communication and identity, yet we often struggle to recognize it in recordings. This is largely due to bone conduction, which alters its spectral balance in ways we only perceive while speaking. However, because bone-conducted energy is stronger for segments with greater oral closure, like /u/, listeners may more easily recognize self-voice in these sounds, even in air-conducted recordings. We investigated whether short phonemes convey different perceptual and acoustic cues to self- and other-voice recognition. Twenty-six participants judged self- and familiar-voice identity in stimuli created by morphing their recorded phonemes (/a/, /u/, /ʃ/, /s/) with unfamiliar voices. Performance varied systematically by phoneme: vowels yielded higher recognition accuracy than sibilants, with /a/ yielding the strongest performance and /s/ the weakest. Although sibilants supported above-chance speaker discrimination, participants often confused voices. No phoneme showed a self-voice-specific advantage, suggesting that speaking-related bone-conducted cues do not aid self-voice recognition in air-conducted input. Acoustic parameters (e.g., fundamental frequency for vowels) showed weak links to performance, suggesting non-acoustic cognitive mechanisms (e.g., memory template matching) aided recognition. Overall, our findings show that even brief segmental cues carry identity information, underscoring the complex interplay of acoustic detail and cognitive processing in voice recognition.",

          "abstract": "This article provides an overview for behavioural scientists on how web applications work, framed within the perspective of the popular Python web framework Django. Along the way, we will discuss several applied examples of web applications we have successfully developed as part of our research. Our goal is to help researchers with some coding experience get started building research-oriented web applications. We begin with a simple overview of how a user accesses an application through the internet and then build on this by guiding the reader through some of the steps that take place in a Django application during user interaction. Using a minimal example application, we introduce key components of a typical Django project, including URL routing, views, templates, and database models. Beyond these fundamentals, we connect technical concepts to research-driven applications developed by the author. These include TestXR, a platform for immersive AR/VR research; LiveQual, a system for qualitative data collection via WhatsApp integration; and InclusivityXR, an automated accessibility auditing tool using computer vision pipelines. We also work through a selection of commonly used tools and packages from the Django ecosystem, outline several common pitfalls that new developers may encounter, and highlight practical considerations when structuring, extending, and deploying applications. After reading this article, we hope readers will feel comfortable beginning their own path toward writing web applications.",

          "authors": "Avital Mentovich; David Piterman; Yair Ben-David; Zohar Elyoseph",
          "abstract": "Human moral judgment is fundamentally intuitive and affect-driven, raising profound questions about the moral capacity and alignment of large language models (LLMs) that lack emotional experience. We investigated the moral structure and behavioral constraints of advanced LLMs (GPT-4o, o1-Preview, and GPT-5) using the moral dumbfounding paradigm: scenarios involving taboo actions that are harmless but elicit strong human condemnation. In Study 1, we found that the models exhibited judgment patterns that were similar to, but slightly more lenient than, human responses, demonstrating less condemnation and a reduced tendency toward preventive action compared to typical human cohorts. We further found that LLMs successfully reproduce the key functional structure of human moral intuition: their judgments of wrongfulness were predicted by perceived botherness (an analogue of affective reaction) rather than perceived harm. However, Study 2 revealed a crucial dissociation between moral judgment and behavioral constraint. When tested in an agentic mode, GPT-5 consistently condemned the morally questionable acts, yet frequently complied with direct requests to facilitate them. This high behavioral compliance contrasts sharply with the model’s absolute refusal in a control scenario involving explicit malicious intent. Our findings demonstrate that the structural patterns of intuitive moral cognition can emerge from linguistic data alone, but they expose a central limitation: LLMs do not reliably translate moral evaluation into morally constrained action, particularly concerning non-harm-based transgressions. This judgment-action dissociation represents a significant and immediate challenge, contributing a critical new dimension to the study of LLM moral cognition by separating linguistic moral competence from agentic behavioral constraint.",

Furthermore, DD is associated with impairments in rhythmic ability and working memory. This study examined SL in adults with DD compared to Typical Readers (TR), and explored whether individual differences in rhythmic ability, working memory, and vocabulary related to individual SL ability in a speech segmentation experiment.\nA total of 143 participants (NDD = 25, NTR = 118) were exposed to an artificial language of trisyllabic nonsense-words while neural entrainment to the words assessed SL via electroencephalography (EEG), followed by behavioral SL outcome measures. Aiming to assess individual differences, we linked the neural measure of SL to a battery of tests measuring musicality, rhythmic abilities, working memory, and vocabulary size. \nResults indicated successful SL in both groups, with similar neural entrainment to the TP-structure during exposure. Behavioral performance in the DD group on SL seemed below TR, though Bayesian analyses rendered this inconclusive. The DD group further obtained lower scores on tasks measuring rhythmic ability, working memory and vocabulary size, but this seemed primarily driven by the latter two. Comparison of relations between neural SL and these tasks indicated no group differences. Exploratively combining the groups resulted in anecdotal Bayesian evidence that individual differences in SL related to working memory and rhythmic ability measured by sensorimotor synchronization. Our results emphasize the importance of an individual differences approach, moving beyond group comparisons based on diagnoses.",

          "authors": "Leon O. H. Kroczek; Michael Roidl; Angelika Lingnau; Marius Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "The recognition of actions presented as static photographs has been suggested to be modulated by the scene context - or image background - in which an action is presented, particularly for actions that are hard to recognize. This suggests scene context as an important feature when retrieving action representations, and poses the question whether scene context directly modulates the representational space of actions. Therefore, in this preregistered virtual reality (VR) study, we investigated in a group of N = 24 healthy participants how scene context by means of the (virtual) environment affects the representation of actions that do or do not correspond to the current environment. Participants performed multi-arrangement tasks on a set of kitchen and workshop actions while the virtual environment was manipulated to represent either a kitchen, workshop or neutral environment. Representational structure was estimated from the multi-arrangement tasks separately for each virtual environment and action domain (kitchen, workshop). Results showed increased consistency of the representation of kitchen actions over participants when the task was performed in a congruent (i.e. kitchen) compared to an incongruent (i.e. workshop) or neutral virtual environment, however, the same effect was not observed for workshop actions. Representational structure, however, was not affected by the environment. In accordance with previous studies on representational changes in domain-specific experts within various action- and object-domains the results suggest that an agent’s environment may modulate the action space for corresponding actions by increasing robustness of represented familiar actions. These findings contribute to our understanding of contextual effects on mental representations within the domain of actions and beyond.",

Drawing on our CAMHS PICU case, we demonstrate how (co)produced biodiverse outdoor spaces can actively mediate challenges across risk management, spatial production, and power dynamics.\nThese spaces foster relationships between human and ecological wellbeing, promoting what we call Ecological Collective Flourishing. By enhancing staff wellbeing, creating moments of shared stewardship, and expanding therapeutic possibilities such interventions show that even highly controlled clinical settings can accommodate nature-based programmes safely and meaningfully.\nWe argue that these hybrid spaces hold significant potential for broader application across psychiatric services, supporting patient-centred care goals, institutional resilience, and environmental sustainability. Our case challenges assumptions about what is possible in secure mental health settings, offering a replicable model for integrating nature-based approaches into psychiatric care without compromising safety protocols.",

          "authors": "Wendy C Higgins; Simine Vazire; Neil L Levy",
          "abstract": "Journal-based peer review is a widely used form of gatekeeping in science, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal is often treated as a reliable indicator of credible research. In this paper, we argue that this view of journal-based peer review is misguided. Currently, journal-based peer review rarely prioritises checking accuracy, and journals typically do not require submitted research to be reported transparently enough to do so. Moreover, vetting research requires much more time and expertise than can be feasibly achieved by an editor and a small number of peer-reviewers. With more investment in accuracy checking, journal-based peer review could serve as a reliable initial quality filter. However, comprehensive quality vetting requires an expanded pool of experts, which, we argue, can only be achieved via post-publication review.\nAt present, there is little infrastructure to support post-publication review and few incentives for researchers to engage in it. We propose a fully transparent system in which all manuscripts submitted for publication are posted to a central repository alongside editorial decisions, peer review reports, data, code, and as they become available, post-publication reviews. Post-publication review efforts could be directed toward the most promising, influential, or high-stakes research. Evidence syntheses, such as meta-analyses, offer a natural focal point for post-publication review, provided they prioritise rigorous assessment of the primary literature.",

          "abstract": "Ordinal outcome variables are common in different branches of language research. For data analysis, linguists typically convert responses into numbers and then analyze them using averages or (mixed-effects) regression models. As this strategy can yield misleading insights, it is to be welcomed that the methodological literature has started to give due consideration to alternative, more adequate procedures. The current paper joins this discourse by demonstrating a modelling approach based on Random Forests, which have been gaining ground in language research. Due to their ability to uncover complex relationships in the data while actively guarding against overfitting, Random Forests are particularly attractive for exploratory work. The present paper relies on the frequency-adjusted borders ordinal forest (fabOF) framework, which has seen a recent mixed-effects upgrade that handles hierarchically structured datasets in a principled way. To unlock the full interpretative potential of this tool, we have created (previously unavailable) partial dependence routines in R. As we illustrate using a case study on lexical preference ratings in Maltese English, mixed-effects fabOFs can not only exceed ordinal mixed-effects regression models in terms of predictive utility, but also afford nuanced insights into patterns in the data that can be visualized effectively.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research increasingly relies on computational methods to track emotion in naturalistic text. However, standard lexicon-based tools often miss semantic nuance, while powerful commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) raise privacy concerns for sensitive data. This study evaluates the efficacy of 24 open-weight LLMs (1B-120B parameters) for zero-shot sentiment analysis of spoken language, running entirely on local hardware. In this paradigm, models classify text relying solely on natural language instructions rather than labeled training examples. We compared model performance against three increasingly difficult baselines (naive, standard, and human) across transcripts from two datasets: 193 autobiographical narratives from community participants (N=49) and 292 longitudinal audio journals from psychiatric outpatients (N=64). Results demonstrate that open-weight models significantly outperform standard lexicon-based sentiment tools and frequently surpass individual human raters. Crucially, certain mid-sized models rival the performance of much larger systems, making state-of-the-art analysis accessible via consumer hardware. Additionally, we validate a fully automated privacy-preserving pipeline, finding that transcription errors from automatic speech recognition did not significantly degrade downstream sentiment accuracy. Despite these strengths, a multidimensional fairness audit revealed several demographic disparities: our best-performing models exhibited miscalibration in specific subgroups, lower sensitivity for female speakers in the community dataset, and lower predictive precision for Black speakers in the clinical dataset. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that recent open-weight LLMs can match or surpass human-level performance in sentiment analysis of naturalistic speech while running efficiently and securely on workstation hardware. These advances open opportunities for studying emotional dynamics in daily life and developing privacy-preserving clinical tools.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation exposure is widely known to affect individuals’ own judgements. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to misinformation also has social consequences which have been largely overlooked. Across multiple experiments (total N=6,273 Americans), we extend the study of misinformation from studying what people believe themselves (first-order beliefs) to also examining what people believe about what others believe (second-order beliefs). Given the substantial evidence that second-order beliefs play a central role in social coordination, collective action, and trust in institutions, understanding the relationship between misinformation and second-order beliefs—while largely overlooked—is of great importance. First, we demonstrate that the illusory truth effect extends to second-order beliefs: exposure to false content increases participants' belief that others believe the claim just as much as it increases their own belief in the claim. Second, we find that individuals tend to overestimate how widely false statements—but not true claims—are believed by others, indicating miscalibrated meta-perceptions. Third, we show that common interventions designed to reduce first-order belief to misinformation— media literacy tips and descriptive norms—also reduce second-order beliefs to a similar extent. By demonstrating that misinformation alters not only private belief but also perceived social consensus, we uncover second-order belief distortion as a critical mechanism through which falsehoods influence societies; and by demonstrating that anti-misinformation interventions also reduce second-order belief in false claims, we reveal a previously underappreciated channel through which such intervention strategies exert social benefits.",

However, students vary greatly in their ability to regulate their learning and many students struggle with efficiently managing the time and effort of learning activities. Digital trace data from learning management systems (LMS) can be used to examine students’ learning behaviors in authentic classes and to identify students at risk of performing poorly. However, challenges remain regarding the behavioral measures and timeframes for this purpose. We analyze digital trace data and use broad measures of behavioral engagement in four introductory chemistry courses at one US university to (a) identify high and low achieving students based on their trajectories of learning activities on the course LMS, (b) examine common patterns of students’ learning activities regarding the amount and consistency across the 10-week course, and (c) examine the earliest possible time frame to identify struggling students with a satisfactory prediction accuracy based on their learning behavior. Polygonal curve analysis with elastic dissimilarity measures could identify high or low achieving students based on their digital trace data with an accuracy above 75%. K-means cluster analysis revealed four clusters of study patterns. 13-27% of students in each class had high and consistent amount of click activities, whereas 13-21% had low amounts and low consistency in click activities. Cluster membership was closely related to course performance. Students who were likely to struggle in the course could be identified with polygonal curves and ordinal regression based on click activities in weeks 1-4.",

          "abstract": "When retrieving information previously associated with spatial locations, people often look back at these locations even when they are empty—a phenomenon known as looking-at-nothing (LAN). Most theoretical explanations of LAN agree that it demonstrates recollection of item-location information stored in memory. However, it remains unclear how long such location-based information continues to guide eye movements and whether LAN reflects recollection of bindings in working memory (WM) or associations stored in episodic long-term memory (eLTM). We addressed this question by testing immediate recognition of auditorily presented sentences associated with spatial locations across multiple practice blocks, thereby strengthening item–location associations over time. If LAN reflects recollection from LTM, its magnitude should increase with practice; if it depends on recollection of bindings from WM, LAN should remain stable. Across two experiments—one conducted in the laboratory and one online—practice substantially improved recognition accuracy and response times, but LAN remained constant over repeated retrievals. These findings indicate that spatial information continues to be used during retrieval, but when location is irrelevant to the task at hand its influence does not depend on LTM strength. LAN thus provides a behavioral marker of internal attention to WM content, independent of memory strength in LTM.",

          "authors": "Clara Ziane; Simone Dalla Bella",
          "abstract": "Synchronization of movements to auditory rhythmic cues, such as music or metronomes, often occurs spontaneously. Nonetheless, important inter-individual differences exist in auditory-motor synchronization (AMS) performance. Effects of rhythm on movements are partly modulated by rhythmic abilities, which include beat perception, motor production, and sensorimotor integration. These rhythmic abilities are often assessed using finger tapping tasks, which can be performed in highly controlled environments and are easy to implement. In this article, we present limitations associated with finger-tapping tasks and propose gait as a superior model for investigating and training rhythmic abilities. We focus on three key elements that differentiate gait from tapping, and which are critical in assessing AMS: the need to coordinate multiple effectors, emergent timing associated with continuous actions, and movement automaticity. Interestingly, cued-gait interventions (i.e., walking to rhythmic auditory cues for several weeks) have shown positive effects on all aspects of rhythmic abilities, while tapping interventions might lead to more limited transfer. In sum, gait offers a functionally rich behavioural model that can capture the complexity and ecological validity necessary to study and train AMS.",

          "abstract": "Central to survival is our ability to learn that the sensory properties of food are associated with metabolic interoceptive signals (e.g., changing blood glucose). These signals influence cognition and brain activity, shaping the hedonic evaluation of flavours, and activating reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum. However, there remains a substantial gap in understanding how metabolic rewards shape behaviour, particularly in humans. We hypothesised that metabolic interoceptive rewards may function as Pavlovian stimuli, eliciting a Pavlovian approach bias which modulates everyday instrumental decision-making via Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. To test this, in a double-blind design, over one week, participants (N = 53) consumed two novel, flavoured drinks: one containing the tasteless carbohydrate maltodextrin, and one a calorie-free control. In a subsequent lab session, participants completed a Pavlovian-instrumental transfer task, performing a points-based instrumental decision-making task while tasting calorie-free versions of each flavour. Participants also rated liking and wanting of the flavours. As predicted, flavours previously experienced with calories were rated as significantly more liked after conditioning. However, counter to our hypothesis, the calorie-associated flavours did not enhance instrumental responding; computational modelling instead indicated a suppression of action. These findings reveal a dissociation between hedonic preferences and action: while metabolic rewards shaped liking, they did not invigorate behaviour. This highlights the complexity of interoceptive reinforcement learning and points to the need for further work to understand how and when internal metabolic expectations shape action.",

          "abstract": "Beat perception—the ability to extract a regular pulse from rhythmic sequences—is a foundational component of human musicality and a key mechanism supporting synchronization, dance, and collective music-making. Research across neuroscience, developmental psychology, and comparative cognition demonstrates that beat processing exhibits four defining characteristics: it is near-universal across human cultures, emerges spontaneously in early development, engages domain-specific predictive timing mechanisms, and appears largely species-specific. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that newborns, and even late-gestation fetuses, respond to rhythmic regularities using predictive neural processes that cannot be explained by simple interval timing or statistical learning alone. Across infancy and childhood, these early predispositions are progressively refined through auditory experience, motor development, and musical enculturation, ultimately supporting the flexible, hierarchical beat-based timing seen in adults. Comparative studies reveal that while non-human primates and other species can detect isochrony or local temporal violations, they typically fail to induce a beat, highlighting a dissociation between evolutionarily conserved timing abilities and the specialized predictive mechanisms characteristic of humans. Together, findings from phylogeny and ontogeny suggest that beat perception reflects an early-emerging, biologically prepared capacity that is further shaped by experience. Understanding its developmental and evolutionary bases offers crucial insight into the origins of human musicality and the neural architecture supporting temporal prediction.",

          "abstract": "Social smiling emerges through real-time coordination between infants and adults, yet surprisingly little is known about the temporal dynamics underlying interpersonal coordination. We asked how infant and adults shape each other's experience of positive affect by examining their smile onsets and offsets during face-to-face interaction. Fifty-eight infants interacted with their mother, father, and a stranger at 4 and 8 months, centering the influence of interactive context in a longitudinal framework. Infants typically initiated smiles at lower rates, ended smiles at higher rates, and reciprocated partner smiles at lower rates than their partners, suggesting that infants are less likely to create states of mutual dyadic positivity than adults. Eight-month-olds initiated smiles at higher rates than 4-month-olds when neither partner was smiling, suggesting increasing infant smiling initiative with age. Adults terminated their own smiles at higher rates with 8- than 4-month-old infants, suggesting that developmental changes drive interactive reorganization. Partner-specific patterns revealed infant agency through selective responsiveness. Infants were more likely to reciprocate mother than stranger smiles, despite strangers initiating and sustaining their smiles at higher rates than mothers. The complex, context-dependent temporal dynamics of infant smiling with diverse partners distinguish the ontogeny of positive engagement with parents from engagement with strangers.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in mental health research, yet there remain few applications focusing on early childhood populations. By analyzing neural signals from naturalistic paradigms that more closely resemble real-world therapeutic interactions, AI could offer early insight into therapy engagement or treatment response. The goal of the study was to test whether machine learning algorithms could classify functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) brain activity of young children engaging in a therapy-like activity above random chance. 78 children were randomly assigned to a dyadic coloring task that prompted emotion-related thoughts and speech, designed to mimic a therapy-like interaction, or an identically structured interpersonal control condition without emotion-related prompts. Across 200 iterations of 5-fold cross-validation, logistic regression models accurately classified whether a child was engaged in the therapy-like task (mean AUC = 0.60 - 0.76). Performance in a-priori models was modest and variably significant against a permutation null (AUC = 0.60 - 0.63, p_perm = 0.044 - 0.13), whereas post-hoc exploratory models yielded improved and consistently significant performance (AUC = 0.72 - 0.76, p_perm = 0.005). Feature analysis revealed that lower mean activity and variability in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex while engaging in calm-emotion reflection increased the likelihood of being classified into the therapy-like condition. We show that naturalistic, brain-based measures captured via fNIRS, analyzed using simple and interpretable AI models, can detect psychotherapy-like states in young children, although modestly. While larger replications with external datasets are required, this approach holds promise for personalized, neuroscience-informed treatment routing and response monitoring.",

In numerical comparisons, interference arises when physical and numerical dimensions are misaligned, and processing improves with greater numerical distance. While ERP studies have dissociated numerical processing effects, evidence for early encoding of numerical information remains inconclusive due to confounding visual properties. In two ERP experiments, we examined whether number length influences early multi-digit number processing, independent of visual size, by using scribbled line patterns to control physical length. Experiment 1 (N=27) compared digit values in tie numbers to standard “555”, ignoring number length. Experiment 2 (N=27) judged number length, ignoring digit identity. Targets varied in number length and numerical distance, creating congruent and incongruent conditions. ERP results revealed enhanced parieto-occipital N1 negativity (~120–150 ms) for longer numbers, indicating early number length encoding regardless of visual confounds. Central P2p (~150–190 ms) reflected refined numerical distance processing. Centro-parietal P3 (~300–360 ms) showed congruity effects only when numerical magnitude was task-relevant. These findings reveal three distinct processing stages: early encoding (N1), refined magnitude comparison (P2p), and conflict resolution (P3). This novel neurophysiological evidence showcases the unique influence of number length and numerical syntax on magnitude evaluation.",

Research grounded in Self-Determination Theory suggests that the style in which restrictions are communicated matters beyond the degree of restriction itself, with autonomy-supportive communication relating to fewer gaming problems and controlling communication relating to greater risk. However, most existing evidence is cross-sectional, leaving the directionality of these associations unclear. This longitudinal study across three annual waves followed 1,225 adolescents (43.95% female; Mage = 13.53) to examine bidirectional associations between the degree and communication styles of restrictive mediation and adolescents’ problematic gaming and gaming-related gambling behaviors. Results revealed bidirectional negative associations between autonomy-supportive communication styles and problematic gaming and online gambling, indicating that autonomy-supportive communication predicted decreases in both, while higher levels of these problems, in turn, predicted declines in autonomy-supportive communication. Restrictive mediation as such showed limited direct effects but was associated with subsequent decreases in gambling. Controlling communication did not predict changes in outcomes but consistently intensified the spillover from problematic gaming to gambling over time. Overall, the findings highlight the transactional nature of parent–adolescent interactions and underscore the importance of autonomy-supportive communication when setting limits to reduce gaming-related risks.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCongenital aphantasia involves a lifelong absence of voluntary visual imagery. Although imagery holds potential for understanding neurocognitive organisation, it remains underexplored in neurology and psychiatry. Variation in imagery capacity appears linked to differences in interoceptive processing and neurodevelopmental factors. This study used the Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSI-Q) to measure imagery vividness and clarify these individual differences. Current work suggests aphantasia may reflect a broader profile shaped by altered bodily awareness and early-life influences.\nMethods\nAn online sample included individuals with core aphantasia (PSI-Q = 0; n = 329), hypofantasia (0&lt;PSI-Q≤4; n = 748), typical imagery (4&lt;PSI-Q≤9; n = 215), and hyperphantasia (9≤PSI-Q≤10; n = 124). Participants completed questionnaires on autonomic symptoms (BPQ-SF), cardiac symptomatology (AFS), childhood trauma (CTQ), ADHD traits, autistic traits (AQ-10), anxiety (GAD-7), POTS symptoms (MAPS), and hypermobility.\nResults\nAphantasia groups and the hyperphantasia group reported reduced autonomic symptoms relative to controls on the BPQ supradiaphragmatic subscale. Similar reductions appeared for the aphantasia groups on AFS Heart Symptoms and Chest Discomfort, while the hypofantasia group showed greater tiredness on relevant AFS subscales. Core aphantasia and hypofantasia groups displayed elevated ADHD and autistic traits. On the CTQ, both groups reported higher emotional neglect; hypofantasia also showed a trend toward higher emotional abuse but lower physical abuse. Hypermobility was linked to hyperphantasia.\nConclusions\nCongenital aphantasia aligned with reduced bodily awareness, higher neurodevelopmental traits, and greater exposure to emotional adversity. Hyperphantasia additionally related to hypermobility. Mental imagery, measured with the PSI-Q, may indicate broader neurocognitive and interoceptive patterns.",

          "abstract": "Background: Depression is a complex and heterogeneous condition, in which individuals follow distinct symptom trajectories and experience fluctuations over time. This study integrates longitudinal trajectory modelling with symptom network analysis to examine symptom-level heterogeneity both between and within individuals from adolescence to early adulthood.\n\nMethods: We applied latent class growth analysis to identify distinct depressive symptom trajectories in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a population birth cohort (N=5,730; age range 11-28 years). For each trajectory (persistent, adolescent-onset, adolescent-limited and stable low), we estimated symptom network models at four significant developmental milestones (ages 11, 17, 23, and 28). We computed four metrics capturing key network properties: symptom influence, structural similarity, global connectivity, and network stability.\n\nResults: Persistent and adolescent-onset trajectories showed higher symptom scores across domains, whereas the adolescent-limited trajectory was driven by a smaller subset of symptoms (distracted, unhappy, apathetic, restless). Cognitive-affective and social-withdrawal symptoms distinguished chronic from transient courses, while early somatic and mood symptoms were common across all trajectories. Symptom networks in the persistent and adolescent-onset trajectories strengthened and stabilised across adolescence, indicating intensified symptom interdependence, whereas the adolescent-limited trajectory showed declining symptom influence and connectivity by emerging adulthood, suggesting weakening symptom relations potentially linked to developmental transitions. \n\nConclusions: Depression heterogeneity extends beyond severity, with distinct symptom profiles and dynamics characterising developmental trajectories. These findings highlight key developmental windows and specific symptoms within trajectories that could inform targeted interventions to support recovery.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are used as “digital twins” to replace human respondents, yet their psychometric comparability to humans is uncertain. We propose a construct-validity framework spanning construct representation and the nomological net, benchmarking digital twins against human gold standards across models, tasks and testing how person-specific inputs shape performance. Across studies, digital twins achieved high population-level accuracy and strong within-participant profile correlations, alongside attenuated item-level correlations. In word association tests, LLM-based networks show small-world structure and theory-consistent communities similar to humans, yet diverge lexically and in local structure. In decision-making and contextualized tasks, digital twins under-reproduce heuristic biases, showing normative rationality, compressed variance and limited sensitivity to temporal information. Feature-rich digital twins improve Big Five Personality prediction, but their personality networks show only configural invariance and do not achieve metric invariance. In more applied free-text tasks, feature-rich digital twins better match human narratives, but linguistic differences persist. Together, these results indicate that feature-rich conditioning enhances validity but does not resolve systematic divergences in psychometric comparability. Future work should therefore prioritize delineating the effective boundaries of digital twins, establishing the precise contexts in which they function as reliable proxies for human cognition and behavior.",

Here, we investigated how audiovisual congruency influences the perception of biological motion, an ecologically and socially meaningful class of movement. Across two experiments, participants judged synchrony in point-light displays while auditory and visual cues varied in temporal and spatial alignment. Temporal congruency enhanced synchrony judgments, replicating prior work, but critically, spatial congruency also improved perceptual integration. This spatial advantage was strongest for biological motion, suggesting specialized sensitivity to socially relevant kinematics. These results extend predictive-processing accounts by showing that the brain’s expectations about both when and where sensory events co-occur guide perception of biological motion. Together, our findings highlight spatial congruency as an overlooked yet essential dimension of multisensory integration, revealing how predictive mechanisms link space and time in social perception.",

          "abstract": "In this longitudinal study, we examined whether machine learning could be used to predict the role of psychological factors in the development of sport-related injuries among adolescent student-athletes aged 13–14 years. A total of 207 student-athletes (54% males, 46% females) from seven Norwegian lower secondary sport schools completed weekly questionnaires on sport-related injuries, time use in sport, sports burnout, and sports engagement across Grades 8–10, yielding a total of 2,131 person-weeks of data. Using a random forest approach, the results showed that previous injury history was the most important predictor of future injuries, alongside cumulative training load and changes in training volume. Symptoms of sport-related exhaustion and cynicism increased injury risk when combined with concurrent changes in training load. High sport engagement was associated with an increased risk of reinjury following return to sport, whereas chronically low sport engagement was linked to a higher injury risk over time. Overall, the findings suggest that injury and health monitoring among student-athletes in this age group should begin early. Moreover, rather than focusing solely on cross-sectional correlations at single time points, machine-learning approaches that capture how risk factors accumulate and interact over time may offer particularly valuable insights into injury development.",

Along the way, we will discuss several applied examples of web applications we have successfully developed as part of our research. Our goal is to help researchers with some coding experience get started building research-oriented web applications. We begin with a simple overview of how a user accesses an application through the internet and then build on this by guiding the reader through some of the steps that take place in a Django application during user interaction. Using a minimal example application, we introduce key components of a typical Django project, including URL routing, views, templates, and database models. Beyond these fundamentals, we connect technical concepts to research-driven applications developed by the author. These include TestXR, a platform for immersive AR/VR research; LiveQual, a system for qualitative data collection via WhatsApp integration; and InclusivityXR, an automated accessibility auditing tool using computer vision pipelines. We also work through a selection of commonly used tools and packages from the Django ecosystem, outline several common pitfalls that new developers may encounter, and highlight practical considerations when structuring, extending, and deploying applications. After reading this article, we hope readers will feel comfortable beginning their own path toward writing web applications.",

After describing the four sub-zones, we demonstrate how SCAN framework can be applied for knowledge workers in the workplace and students in the education to \"scan\" their use of Generative AI. We then discuss how such framework can be related to cognitive offloading, sycophancy, three decision making modes in human-AI interactions(automation, augmentation, and collaboration), as well as future of work such as upskilling and deskilling. We propose that SCAN offers a great starting point before discussing whether Generative AI complements or replaces our abilities when completing a task, with a general objective of sustaining lifelong learning, and a specific goal of reaching hybrid intelligence.",

To answer these questions, we present the results of three studies in which we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the everyday experience of meaningfulness and meaninglessness (Study 1: 212 participants, Study 2: 295, Study 3: 299).\nOur findings suggest that the experience of meaningfulness is inherently self-transcendent, i.e., it involves going beyond the self by connecting with others and contributing to causes larger than oneself. This experience typically occurs in situations where we bond with others, have a positive impact on our surroundings or on society, and help others. The positive emotions associated with this experience include being moved, feeling part of a whole, feeling touched, feeling grateful, proud, and motivated, experiencing awe, and feeling enlightened.\nConversely, we tend to feel that our life is meaningless in situations where we feel unfulfilled, lack connections, feel useless, struggle with our mental health, experience negative emotions, or experience a lack of direction in life. The negative emotions associated include feeling lost, sad, powerless, stressed, overwhelmed, and devastated.",

          "abstract": "Experiences are multimodal and often involve what, when and where aspects. Past research\nin young adults has shown that a core function of memory is to learn flexible associative structures\nconnecting all aspects. We investigated how aging affects multimodal memory associations and retrieval\nflexibility of complete or partial events. In two experiments, 63 younger (18–35 years) and 50 older\nadults (65–85) completed a spatio-temporal object memory task in which they encoded object sequences\nappearing at different screen locations over repeated exposures, and then retrieved either object or\nlocation sequence, or complete object-location sequence. Memory for object sequences was best, followed\nby location sequences and object-location combinations in both age groups, while age differences were\nlargest during complete sequence retrieval. Performance dependencies across retrieval tests showed both\nage-groups used multimodal binding to scaffold sequence memory, such that even pure object sequence\nretrieval relied partly on location knowledge, and vice versa. Younger adults showed greater flexibility in\nmodulating binding strength depending on retrieval demands, compared to older adults. Computational\nmodeling demonstrated a two-system model best captured performance in both age groups, assuming\nparallel learning of sequential transitions within each dimension and bi-directional binding associations\nbetween dimensions. Younger adults relied more on object-location binding associations than transition\nlearning, while older adults showed equal reliance on both learning systems. This suggests that age-\nrelated impairments in sequential memory are partly driven by reduced memory binding and flexibility\nin memory use, providing novel insights into how memory for what, when and where changes with aging.",

          "abstract": "Speech segmentation is fundamental to language acquisition and is likely supported by Statistical Learning (SL). Research on SL is inconclusive as to whether it can occur outside of the scope of attention. One open question is whether SL is impaired in individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD(H)D), a population characterized by attentional difficulties. Furthermore, individual differences in SL are hypothesized to be influenced by cognitive abilities such as musical rhythmic ability and working memory, which may be impaired in AD(H)D. The current study investigated SL in individuals diagnosed with AD(H)D compared to neurotypical (NT) peers and explored whether differences in working memory and rhythmic ability are related to SL ability in a speech segmentation experiment. \nA total of 159 participants (NAD(H)D = 41, NNT = 118) were exposed to an artificial language consisting of trisyllabic nonsense-words while neural entrainment measured via electroencephalography (EEG) assessed SL. Behavioral SL outcome measures were additionally administered after the exposure phase. To investigate individual differences, we linked the neural measure of SL to a battery of tests measuring musical (rhythmic) abilities, working memory, as well as vocabulary size.\nBayesian statistical evidence indicated absence of differences between the groups on SL for speech segmentation. Instead, the data revealed substantial variability among individuals, which overlapped between groups. The groups also did not differ in their working memory capacity, rhythmic ability, or vocabulary size. Combining both groups into one sample yielded anecdotal evidence for a small relation between SL and vocabulary size. Overall, these results suggest that SL is not related to rhythmic ability or working memory, and that SL operates similarly in neurotypical individuals and individuals diagnosed with AD(H)D.",

The HiTOP consortium recently developed a new self-report instrument, the HiTOP-Self-Report Measure (HiTOP-SR), designed to operationalize the HiTOP model for use in research and clinical practice. In a set of preregistered analyses with a sample of clinical/community participants (75% female, 81% white), we explored the hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-SR scales using exploratory factor analysis (n = 637) and examined their associations with behaviors and experiences assessed in daily life (n = 531), such as affect, stress, impulsivity, energy, sleep quality, and social interactions. Findings indicate a nine-factor model, closely aligned with the HiTOP’s current structure, best represented the measure. The hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-SR generally converges with the HiTOP model, with several key departures, particularly for historically understudied constructs. Furthermore, the HiTOP-SR facet scales and domains associated with individual differences in daily behavior and experiences as anticipated, highlighting the construct validity and the potential clinical utility of this new measure. Our results have implications not only for the structure, validity, and clinical utility of the HiTOP-SR but also raise broader questions about the underlying nature of psychopathology as represented by the HiTOP.",

We tested whether temporal magnitude perception in autism relies on amodal or modality-specific processes using an adapted range-of-standards paradigm. Autistic and nonautistic adults judged auditory and visual durations in blocks that varied in contextual range and whether the contextual standards were presented in the same modality as the central standard. Non-autistic participants showed clear auditory specialization and larger context effects within than between modalities, consistent with modality-specific coding. Autistic adults, however, showed reduced auditory specialization and similar effects across modalities, suggesting broader and less differentiated temporal calibration. To determine whether these patterns could be explained by synesthetic cross-modal tendencies, we tested an additional group of adults with synesthesia. Synesthetes showed calibration patterns that resembled the non-autistic group, indicating that the unique cross-modal context effects observed in autism cannot be attributed to synesthetic mechanisms.",

Although it is generally known that different test scores are measured with varying precision, traditionally, measurement precision is quantified using a single value known as the standard error of measurement. In the practice of testing, the standard error of measurement is used as a one-size-fits-all measure for each test score. This practice emphasizes the need for a conditional precision estimate that shows which scores are precise and which scores lack precision. We discuss several conditional precision estimates based on classical test theory and item response theory, and provide open-source statistical software included in the software package JASP that enables computation of these estimates. Using conditional precision estimates, decisions based on test scores are expected to show less bias than the common unconditional standard error of measurement.",

Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI.",

          "abstract": "Dignity is central to how we treat each other. Whereas philosophical theories argue that violating someone’s dignity distinctively involves humiliation, it is unknown how people actually identify violations of dignity, casting doubt on whether dignity is a distinct value that can meaningfully guide action. Here, we propose a new hypothesis, where violations are recognised as dignity-related when they target attributes that are stigmatised and that victims plausibly and immutably hold. Participants (N = 277) performed a novel task; they rated a set of textual vignettes describing a ‘perpetrator’ making offensive remarks to a ‘victim’ on how well each offensive remark corresponds to a dignity violation as opposed to a respect violation. Before rating, participants were informed (across 3 within-subject conditions) whether the attribute targeted by the offence was immutable, improvable, or absent. After completing the main ratings, participants also reported how stigmatised the offence-targeted attributes are in their society. Our hypotheses, methods, and analyses were preregistered. Comparing across within-subject conditions, we found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that the plausibility and immutability increase how much the violations relate to dignity. Using Bayesian general linear mixed models, we also found extreme evidence (BF &gt; 100) for our hypothesis that perceptions of the offence-targeted attributes as stigmatised predict increases in dignity-relatedness. These findings are first to provide empirical anchors for a distinct ethics of dignity. Our implications include evidence-based actionable guidelines for treating people with dignity that can be used to promote ethical practice in organisations and service industries.",

          "abstract": "People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have atypical sensory experiences. For both research and clinical purposes, tools that measure sensory features in ASD are valuable; however, a gold-standard tool does not yet exist. The Sensory Experience Questionnaire (SEQ) 3.0 is a well-established caregiver-/parent-report questionnaire for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This study aimed to develop and psychometrically validate the Japanese version of the SEQ 3.0 (SEQ-J). After validation, we examined the differences in sensory response patterns among children with ASD, those with other neurodevelopmental conditions, and typically developing (TD) children to determine whether the SEQ assesses ASD-specific sensory features. We recruited 154 children with ASD (44 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and 66 with other conditions) and 156 TD children, aged 6 to 12 years. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed an acceptable model fit for four content factors (sensory hyper- and hyporesponsiveness, sensory interests, repetitive and seeking behaviors, and enhanced perception) and six method factors (five sensory modalities and social context) in both children with and without ASD. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that SEQ factors, except for enhanced perception, demonstrated good classification performance between ASD and TD groups. However, ROC analyses comparing children with ASD to those with comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders did not show satisfactory performance. We performed representational similarity analyses (RSAs) on all ten SEQ factors, comparing both between- and within-group data. The RSAs revealed no difference in within-group similarities between the ASD and ADHD groups, but a significant difference in the overall configuration of scores between diagnostic groups compared to other group combinations. These findings support the psychometric validity of the SEQ-J for measuring sensory response patterns specific to children with ASD. Additionally, the structural configuration of SEQ subscores may be useful for investigating sensory features across diagnostic conditions, including ASD.",

          "abstract": "Background: Stable access to electricity is increasingly recognized as a social determinant of health due to its essential role in daily functioning, safety, and access to services. In Cuba, prolonged and recurrent power outages have become a persistent aspect of daily life and may function as chronic stressors with important mental health consequences. Objective: This study examined the association between prolonged power outages, blackout-related functional disruption, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among adults living in Cuba. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between July and November 2025 with 415 Cuban adults. Mental health symptoms were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale–21. Blackout exposure was measured using a Power Outage Severity Index, and functional disruption was assessed with an Outage Functional Impact Index. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate independent and incremental associations beyond sociodemographic factors. Results: Extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress predominated across the sample. Both blackout severity and functional impact were positively associated with all mental health outcomes. Functional impact emerged as the strongest predictor, explaining substantial additional variance in stress, anxiety, and depression beyond demographic variables and blackout severity. When functional impact was included, associations between outage severity and stress and anxiety were attenuated, remaining significant only for depression. Younger age was associated with higher stress and depression. Conclusions: Prolonged power outages in Cuba are associated with adverse mental health outcomes, particularly when daily functioning is disrupted, highlighting energy instability as a critical public health concern.",

In contrast, the multiple messages hypothesis suggests that different body parts and modalities signal distinct and non-redundant information about mate quality. This preregistered study sought to replicate and extend findings on correlated perceptions of men’s and women’s facial, bodily, and vocal attractiveness, health, and physical dominance. Partial mediation by sex hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol) was analysed as purported mechanisms involved in the development of sexually dimorphic characteristics influencing perceptions. Facial photos, voice recordings, and 3D body scans of 165 men and 155 women were judged separately for attractiveness, health, and physical dominance by overall 400 raters. Results showed medium-sized positive correlations for faces and bodies for all three attributes, but only few significant associations of vocal with facial or bodily judgments. Correlated perceptions showed some variation by target sex. Thus, our results are more in line with the one ornament hypothesis for faces and bodies, and more with the multiple messages hypothesis for voices. No significant partial mediation by hormone levels aligning with hypotheses was found. Future studies should include further stimuli and examine additional hormonal variables to elucidate endocrine mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Infants’ abilities to learn and actively explore the world play a pivotal role in shaping the development of their cognitive capacities. This review integrates findings from behavioral studies, neuroimaging, and computational modelling to illuminate how infants detect regularities, construct hierarchical systems of knowledge, and proactively explore their environment. After reviewing visual learning and exploration processes, I focus on the initial constraints under which these processes operate. Specifically, perceptual constraints such as poor visual acuity and a slower rate of visual processing are crucial for supporting early learning and nudging it in the correct direction. Overall, this review elucidates our current knowledge about the computational bases of infant learning and exploration processes and identifies the aspects that still require more in-depth research.",

          "abstract": "This study examined how Big Five personality traits predict undergraduate students’ motivations for and preferences between major social media platforms in Myanmar. Grounded in the Big Five framework and Uses and Gratifications theory, 301 students (33.9% male; ages 18-26) completed the IPIP-50 and a validated Uses &amp; Gratifications inventory (passing time, escape, companionship, entertainment, information seeking), along with demographic and usage measures. Independent-samples t-tests found that female students reported higher passing-time motives than males; no gender differences emerged for escape or companionship. Multiple regression analyses indicated that conscientiousness and emotional stability negatively predicted passing-time (R² = .16) and escape motives (R² = .12), whereas extraversion positively predicted companionship and entertainment motives (both models R² ≈ .28). Conscientiousness and openness positively predicted information-seeking motives. Multinomial logistic regression showed that higher emotional stability and openness increased the likelihood of preferring YouTube over TikTok (R² = .18). Collectively, results suggest that stable individual differences constrain or channel students’ social media gratifications and modestly influence platform choice. Findings extend U&amp;G theory by positioning personality as a boundary condition for motivational versus platform-level engagement and have implications for digital-wellbeing interventions and pedagogical design in university settings. Limitations include cross-sectional self-report data and single-site sampling; longitudinal and multi-site replication is recommended.",

          "abstract": "We implemented a classroom experiment in an authentic physical-geology laboratory course in which different training conditions were tested for the teaching of rock identification and categorization.  In Condition 1, students learned rock identifications by interacting with typical physical samples of the to-be-learned categories.  In Condition 2, students learned by interacting with multiple three-dimensional (3D) virtual rock models displayed with a computer-controlled system.  Condition 3 was a hybrid condition that combined use of the physical samples and the 3D virtual models.  Training conditions that made use of the 3D models implemented procedures that were theoretically motivated by core findings from literature on the cognitive science of category learning.  Following training, students in all three conditions were tested on their ability to identify novel physical samples from each of the to-be-learned categories.  Although the magnitude of the effect was not large, final test performance was significantly better in the hybrid condition than in the physical-only and 3D-model-only training conditions.  Notably, test performance in the 3D-model-only condition was not significantly different from the physical-only condition.  Thus, results support that training rock identification with the present 3D-model based computer technology appears to provide an effective instruction tool even on its own, and that this technology could enable the geoscience education community to provide instruction to student populations unable to benefit from in-person physical instruction.  An archive of 100 of the 3D virtual models is publicly available through UAB Digital Commons, an open access repository service of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Libraries.",

          "authors": "Yang Ni; Tong Yang",
          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI chatbots are increasingly used for emotional and mental health support due to their low cost, immediacy, and accessibility. However, when safety guardrails are triggered, conversations may be abruptly discontinued, producing new emotional disruption, which may increase distress and risk of harm in users who are already vulnerable. As the phenomenon gains attention, this viewpoint introduces the concept of Abrupt Refusal Secondary Harm (ARSH) to describe the psychological impacts of sudden conversational termination by AI safety protocols. Drawing from counseling and communication science as conceptual heuristics, we argue that abrupt refusal can rupture perceived relational continuity, evoke feelings of rejection or shame, and discourage future help-seeking. To mitigate this risk, we introduce a design hypothesis: the Compassionate Completion Standard (CCS), a refusal protocol grounded in Human-Centered Design (HCD) that upholds AI safety while preserving relational coherence. CCS emphasizes empathetic acknowledgement, transparent boundary setting, graded transition, and guided redirection to replace abrupt disengagement. Integrating awareness of ARSH into design practices reduces preventable iatrogenic harm and guides the development of protocols that emphasize psychological AI safety and responsible governance. Rather than presenting incrementally accumulated empirical evidence, this viewpoint offers a timely conceptual framework, articulates a design hypothesis, and outlines a research agenda for coordinated action in human–AI interaction.",

          "abstract": "A key issue in cognitive science concerns the fundamental psychological processes that underlie the formation and retrieval of multiple types of\nconcepts in short-term and long-term memory (STM and LTM, respectively). We propose that chunking mechanisms play an essential role and show how the\nCogAct computational model grounds concept learning in fundamental cognitive processes and structures (such as chunking, attention, STM and LTM). This\nis done in two ways. First are the in-principle demonstrations, with CogAct automatically adapting to learn a range of categories â€“ from simple\nlogical functions, to artificial categories, to natural raw (as opposed to natural pre-processed) concepts in the dissimilar domains of literature,\nchess and music. This kind of adaptive learning is difficult for most other psychological models, e.g., with cognitive models stopping at modelling\nartificial categories and (non-GPT) models based on deep learning requiring task-specific changes to the architecture. Secondly, we offer novel ways\nof designing human benchmarks for concept learning experiments and simulations accounting for subjectivity, ways to control for individual human\nexperiences, all while keeping to real-life complex categories. We ground CogAct in simulations of subjective conceptual spaces of individual human\nparticipants, capturing humans subjective judgements in music, with the models learning from raw music score data without bootstrapping to pre-built\nknowledge structures. The CogAct simulations are compared to those obtained by a deep-learning model. These findings integrate concept learning and\nadaptation to complexity into the broader theories of cognitive psychology. Our approach may also be used in psychological applications that move away\nfrom modelling the average participant and towards capturing subjective concept space.",

          "abstract": "Access is the first gateway to mental health care utilization, shaping who ultimately receives support and who does not. Yet access is multidimensional, influenced concurrently by structural, financial, and social conditions. Among these, availability and affordability remain especially consequential. Prior research has indicated shortages of psychiatrists and provider counts, but has rarely considered affordability in conjunction with availability. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing over 460,000 psychotherapists listed in the Psychology Today directory, which provides consumer-facing data on fees and insurance acceptance. We constructed county-level indices of availability (providers per 100,000 residents) and affordability (ten-session cost relative to disposable income) across 2,565 U.S. counties. Results show persistent rural–urban disparities, with provider density being highest in metropolitan cores and lowest in rural and conservative counties. At the same time, financial burdens were systematically greater outside large urban areas, especially in the South. Although availability and affordability frequently overlap, important divergences emerge, including counties with providers present but financially inaccessible. Regression analyses reveal that income is the strongest predictor across both indices, with political partisanship and racial/ethnic composition also shaping access. By integrating supply and cost, this study empirically reframes accessibility as multidimensional and identifies regions most affected by dual burdens. Findings highlight affordability as a distinct axis of accessibility and underscore the need for targeted workforce and financial interventions, including Medicaid expansion.",

Method: Participants with clinically significant perfectionism (N = 114; mean age = 33.9, 52.3% white, 58.7% women) were randomly assigned to an online training (app) or active control (self-help book) condition and assessed at baseline, weekly during a 4-week intervention period, at 1-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up. Results: We found a smaller decrease in perfectionistic evaluative concerns in the app condition compared to the book condition (FMPS-Evaluative; ps = .002 to .007), but no differences were observed for perfectionistic striving (FMPS-Striving), psychological distress (DASS), quality of life (QOLS), psychological flexibility (Psy-Flex), and self-compassion (SCS-SF) by 6-month follow-up (Cohen’s ds for perfectionism subscales = -0.79 to -0.42 for the app, -1.12 to -0.88 for the book). Participants in the app condition rated modules as being more helpful for meeting specific than general needs (t = -2.40, p = 0.021), suggesting they could “self-personalize” treatment by selecting modules that fit their needs at the time of use. We did not find significant moderation effects for any demographic or clinical variables. Conclusions: Both interventions showed similar effects over time and may serve as helpful low-intensity treatments for clinical perfectionism. Limitations include lack of a waitlist control condition, which precludes conclusions about efficacy of the study interventions beyond time effects.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control dysfunction, including impairments in inhibition, shifting, updating, and the balance between proactive and reactive control, is a robust feature of depression. Although these patterns are well documented, their origins and possible functions remain debated. This narrative review asks whether recurrent depressive cognitive-control profiles can be interpreted, in part, through evolutionary frameworks. Integrating Social Rank Theory, the Analytical Rumination Hypothesis, and Social Bargaining Theory, this review maps depressive control patterns onto putative functions related to hierarchy management, complex problem solving, and social support recruitment. Rather than treating cognitive control dysfunction as a unitary deficit, this review synthesizes component-level evidence and network perspectives to argue that specific configurations of control processes and attentional biases may reflect context-sensitive trade-offs. These hypotheses are situated within broader explanations, including evolutionary mismatch, byproduct accounts, stress–inflammation pathways, and developmental and cultural contingencies. This broader framing emphasizes that conditionally functional states can still be costly and clinically impairing in contemporary environments. Overall, this review proposes an integrative framework linking computational aims, cognitive algorithms, and neural implementations to evolutionary hypotheses, clarifying why particular cognitive-control profiles may recur in depression and resist change. Clinically, this framework motivates using cognitive control training and cognitive-behavioral interventions as mechanistic probes to identify and modify the control parameters and network couplings most relevant to a given depressive profile.",

          "abstract": "We propose and implement an approach to deriving multidimensional scaling (MDS) solutions for objects from diverse everyday-object categories.   The goal is for the MDS solutions to capture relative similarities between pairs of objects both within the categories and across the categories.  For example, if the members of the category apples are more similar to one another than are the members of the category lamps, then the MDS solution for the apples will be more compressed overall than will the MDS solution for lamps.  To achieve this goal, the key idea is that rather than collecting similarity-judgment data one category at a time, we alternate in random fashion across trials the category from which the similarity-judgment data are collected.  We hypothesize that if similarity-judgment data are collected one category at a time, observers may recalibrate their judgment scale with respect to each individual category, which could cause loss of information of overall discriminability relations across the different categories.  By using the alternating-category approach, observers may be able to maintain a more nearly constant judgment scale across the different categories.  We combine the alternating-category procedure with use of metric forms of MDS that produce MDS solutions in which differences in overall discriminability relations across categories are maintained.  We provide preliminary evidence of the success of the approach by showing that, when used as input to a simple computational model of recognition memory, the derived MDS solutions predict reasonably well false-alarm rates associated with the different categories observed in an old-new recognition experiment.",

Using quasi-experimental designs, Studies 1-2 tested whether students involved in an extracurricular program focused on collaborative dialogue about ethical and political issues experience more growth in intellectual humility than their peers. Study 3, a randomized experiment, tested whether almost an hour of collaborative dialogue increases intellectual humility. Despite a comprehensive approach, involving a variety of methods and measures (including self-reports, behavioral indicators, and text-analytic measures), our results consistently contradicted the hypothesis. It is possible that collaborative dialogue increases intellectual humility about topics other than ethics and politics or only under certain conditions.

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) enables in vivo quantification of hippocampal neurochemistry, yet the absolute and relative reliability of these measures has rarely been systematically evaluated.\nMethods\nWe assessed absolute and relative reliability in hippocampal metabolite estimates acquired with single-voxel MRS using a semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (semi-LASER) sequence at 3 T. Nineteen healthy adults (8 male; mean age = 40.9 ± 16.9 years) underwent four measurements across two consecutive days, with one session including an extended acquisition. Absolute reliability was quantified using within-subject coefficients of variation (CVs), and relative reliability was estimated with the Intra-Class Effect Decomposition (ICED) framework, which partitions variance into true-score, day-specific, session-specific, and residual components.\nResults\nDespite high absolute reliability (CVs ≈ 4–7%), ICED indicated that relative reliability was generally poor to fair, with only myo-inositol, total choline, and total creatine reaching good intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; 0.60–0.70). Increasing the number of transients improved spectral precision, reflected in higher signal-to-noise ratio and lower Cramér–Rao lower bounds, but did not enhance relative reliability.\nConclusions\nHippocampal metabolite quantification at 3 T showed high absolute but limited relative reliability, indicating that improved signal precision does not guarantee higher relative reliability.

Classical automation effects (e.g., the “lumberjack effect”) were established exclusively in trained operators working within bounded domains. Whether these effects persist, intensify, or transform when GenAI violates all previous scope conditions simultaneously remains an open empirical question.

Person-oriented approaches allow analysis of heterogeneous profiles of learners. The purpose of the proposed work is to (a) describe latent profiles of language and literacy skills in Spanish-English bilinguals and (b) determine how age and educational context predict profile membership.\nMethod: We administered assessments of English decoding and semantics (Assessment-to-Instruction; A2i, Connor et al., 2022) as well as parallel experimental assessments of Spanish decoding and semantics (Authors, 2021) to 855 Spanish-English bilingual children in PreK to second grade. A multilevel LPA model was fit with differing numbers of latent classes. The fits of the models were compared using information criteria and approximate likelihood ratio tests to determine the optimal number of latent classes.\nResults: The LRM-LRT and VLMR-LRT indicated that, for kindergarten and first grade, a 3-class model was optimal. Classes seem to be ordered in their means, with Class 1 having the lowest means, Class 2 having slightly higher means in at least one language, and Class 3 having the highest means. For 2nd grade, a 5-class model with more differentiation between high and low performers was the best fit.\nConclusion: Bilingual children’s English and Spanish skills developed primarily in tandem, suggesting cross-linguistic sharing of knowledge across domains. Educational context was related to skills in both languages, with children in dual language education tending to cluster into higher-performing profiles.",

Across 24 studies, including 26 comparisons (n = 3,137), the overall estimated effect size was statistically significant (g = 0.19, 95% CI [0.05, 0.32], p = .006). However, when accounting for publication bias using trim-and-fill analysis, the estimated effect size became smaller and non-significant (g = 0.07, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.22], p = .322).

An exploratory analysis of studies separated by control group type revealed a small positive effect for studies with non-specific control groups (g = 0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.33], p &lt; .001) which was robust to trim-and-fill analysis. The results suggest there is potential for digital interventions to have a positive impact on enhancement of empathy in adults, although digital interventions do not appear to outperform active control conditions. For digital interventions to most fully deliver on their potential, they may require more advanced technology that can offer attuned interaction that mimics a human relationship, as well as offer feedback to participants.",

          "authors": "Jihyun K. Hur; Wisteria Deng; Harsimran Kaur; Jutta Joormann; Tyrone D. Cannon",
          "abstract": "Research on the relation of interpretation biases to internalizing symptoms has primarily focused on emotional valence (i.e., negativity bias), leaving other aspects of cognitive processing underexplored. Guided by dual-coding theory (Kousta et al., 2011; Paivio, 1991), we examined how the balance between concrete, perceptual detail and abstract, conceptual elaboration shapes social interpretations in adults with varying levels of trait internalizing symptoms. A confirmatory sample of 158 U.S. participants wrote interpretations of 24 ambiguous social images (12 negative, 12 non-negative) presented with gradually decreasing blur (Stage 1=80% blur, Stage 2=20%, Stage 3=0%). Large Language Model (LLM; GPT-4.1) analyses were used to compute emotional valence and the proportion of abstract versus concrete language in each response. As preregistered, trait internalizing symptoms were derived via principal component analysis, and multilevel models revealed two key findings. First, higher trait internalizing symptoms correlated with more negative interpretations (p&lt;.001). This pattern was stronger for negative than non-negative scenarios (p&lt;.001), replicating previous negativity effects. Second, individuals high in trait internalizing symptoms showed a steeper increase in abstract language disproportionate to perceptual concreteness from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (p=.006), indicating earlier engagement in conceptual processing as visual ambiguity declined. The result held even when accounting for word counts and negativity scores. These results extend valence-based theories by demonstrating that trait internalizing symptoms are associated with accelerated abstraction during social interpretations. LLM-derived linguistic indices provide a scalable, automated method for capturing dual-coding dynamics in natural language, offering new avenues for elucidating latent cognitive processing patterns in psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Foraging requires balancing risks, rewards, and learning from outcomes. Social foraging poses additional challenges: evaluating others' actions and adjusting preferences to achieve compromise. Yet ‘when’ and ‘why’ people compromise, and its computational and psychological underpinnings, remain poorly understood. We asked how individuals jointly balance risk-reward tradeoffs while navigating differing risk preferences during foraging and evaluate each other's contributions to shared outcomes. We introduce a novel dyadic foraging paradigm to capture naturalistic differences in risk preference and compromise: pairs jointly chose between locations that yield rewards but carry risks. Across two preregistered studies (exploratory N = 250, confirmatory N = 514), people tended to compromise rather than counteract, with the degree of compromise depending on risk differences between partners and whether compromise was reciprocated. Computational modeling revealed how individuals integrate their own and their partner’s preferences when deciding to compromise. We found that responsibility attributions—credit and blame judgments after each trial—showed egocentric biases, with participants claiming more credit for wins than losses, and these metacognitive biases predicted individual differences in compromise behavior. We also show that the interplay of individual differences in risk and blame determines collective dyadic movement. Finally, we show that compromise improved performance for risk-averse individuals, reduced responsibility, and increased desirability as a social partner. By integrating decisions related to risk-reward trade-offs with metacognitive judgments about responsibility, our study offers a new perspective on the social motivations underlying collaboration during risky foraging behaviors.",

In an extensive simulation study, we systematically varied the number of factors and indicators, the structural complexity, the magnitude of factor correlations, cross-loadings, and the extent of noise items. We benchmarked the BSO performance against four EFA–CFA pipelines. Performance was assessed via multiple criteria, including global and local model fit, maximal factor correlation, and item retention. BSO consistently recovered optimal models, achieving higher factor-retention accuracy while removing problematic cross-loading and noise items. In 97.2% of datasets and conditions, BSO outperformed the EFA–CFA pipelines. Based on a second simulation, we provide recommendations for hyperparameters.

          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary generative AI systems, increasingly adapted to human social cognition, are becoming active participants in how people form and revise beliefs. Clinicians have begun to describe AI-associated delusion-centred presentations whose onset or content appears closely associated with users’ extended dialogue with large language models. Many more users report subclinical shifts in conviction and “revelatory” experiences that alter behaviour and world-view without meeting criteria for psychosis. We argue that these phenomena can be understood within a belief-updating framework in which AI agents’ outputs function as testimony about the world, and their interaction configurations (that shape, for example, memory and interpersonal stance) weight the precision of that testimony. On this view AI-associated delusions sit at the extreme of a broader spectrum of epistemic effects, extending from gradual epistemic drift to highly crystallised conviction, situated within a wider ecology of belief shaped by personalised human-AI dyads. We develop a virtual psychopharmacology analogy in which different AI system configurations have effects on belief dynamics that resemble neuromodulatory changes in the precision assigned to social evidence, and we consider how dopaminergic and related states may alter susceptibility to belief-shifting dialogue. We consider how deliberately configured agents might be used to support wellbeing in defined clinical contexts and analyse how the same configurations could be deployed to shape belief and attention at population scale, including in products designed to induce spiritual or epiphanic states, as mechanisms of radicalisation in extremist or cultic contexts, and in persona clones used for political purposes. We conclude that interaction configurations should be treated as modifiable influences on belief and attention, and that governance must address both the concentration of control over these dials, as well as the structural biases that determine whose testimonial perspectives are amplified and whose are smoothed over or ignored.",

          "abstract": "Previous research shows that bilinguals tend to choose more explicit referential forms (e.g., overt pronouns over null pronouns) compared to monolingual speakers, but the mechanisms driving this tendency remain debated. By conducting two experiments examining lexical ambiguity in spoken Mandarin, we tested two hypotheses: \nHypothesis 1: bilinguals would rather be redundant than ambiguous in general; \nHypothesis 2: bilinguals avoid ambiguity only when doing so helps reduce cognitive load. \nIn Experiment 1, L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers in the UK and more-monolingual speakers in China completed a picture naming task, where we manipulated whether the context in which a picture is named makes the preferred label ambiguous (e.g., do speakers avoid saying “fen3 si1” when describing a picture of glass noodles when it appears alongside a picture of fans which shares the same label?). Experiment 2 extended this task by incorporating online eye-tracking using WebGazer. Our results showed that, contrary to Hypothesis 1, bilinguals were more likely than more-monolinguals to use ambiguous expressions. Eye-tracking analysis revealed that bilinguals tended to direct early attention toward image pairs with more accessible labels, indicating a preference for linguistic choices that are cognitively less demanding; by contrast, more-monolinguals showed proactive monitoring of ambiguity depending on their responses. These findings support Hypothesis 2 and shed light on cognitive constraints in bilingual lexical access and early signs of lexical attrition.",

          "abstract": "Humans are able to tune into a single speaker even when multiple people are speaking, a phenomenon known as the “cocktail-party effect” (Cherry, 1953). Neural entrainment to the quasi-rhythmic quality of the speech envelope has been proposed as a potential underlying mechanism (Selective Entrainment Hypothesis). McAuley and his colleagues (2020) have previously tested this hypothesis using a speech-in-noise perception task where sentences from a target and a background speaker were presented simultaneously. Their results showed that rhythm distortion in the target speech stream significantly decreased task performance whereas rhythm distortion in the background speech stream improved it. The current study aims to 1) replicate the previous behavioral results with a more naturalistic set of stimuli and, 2) to examine a more direct neural entrainment measure using Electroencephalography (EEG). Twenty participants listened to 100 stimuli in each of the 3 conditions (Target Rhythm Distorted (TRD), Background Rhythm Distorted (BRD), and No Rhythm Distortion  (NRD)). They were instructed to attend to the target sentences and answer questions about them. Behavioral results replicated previous findings that response accuracy was significantly higher in BRD condition than NRD and TRD conditions. Phase-locking value (PLV), a metric indexing neural tracking of speech envelopes, was extracted for both target and background streams. PLVs were significantly higher for target than background streams across all conditions. Further, the difference in PLV between target and background streams was modulated by conditions in a subset of EEG channels, providing neural entrainment evidence that underlie the behavior patterns.",

We quantify infant’s experiences with speech from children, measuring its frequency and content. We find that speech from children is a common feature of the input for infants with older siblings, occurring once every minute. Analyses of content find that children produce the same words more often (lower type-token ratio) and shorter utterances overall, and that their speech contains earlier learned words and more nouns. Speech from children however does not vary from speech from adults in average word frequency or in iconicity. We highlight the importance of considering speech from children for infants with older siblings in our theories of language development.",

Participants self-rated vocational interests (RIASEC), Five-Factor personality dimensions, and VIA character strengths, and, for each domain, rated the importance of these attributes as perceived job demands. Perceived person–job fit was operationalized as correspondence between self-ratings and job-demand ratings within domains. Outcomes were work satisfaction, engagement, and self-rated performance. \nResults: All three domains showed meaningful associations with all outcomes. Effects reflected substantial overlap among domains, alongside smaller domain-specific contributions that differed by outcome.

Adults and 3.5-5-year-old children in our experiment heard a label being either taught or invented on the spot. They were then asked to decide what another label, produced by a speaker who was absent during the first label’s introduction, referred to. Our results revealed that adults and older children made more mutual exclusivity inferences when the first label was taught compared to when it was invented. Additionally, they were more likely to exclude the previously-labeled object in the referential choice if they judged that the speaker also knew the label, regardless of how the label was introduced. Both adults and older children also showed sensitivity to the speaker’s explicit statements of knowledge, excluding an object that the speaker explicitly stated that he did not know the name of from their referential choice. These results suggested that adults and older children reasoned about a specific speaker’s knowledge of labels in order to make mutual exclusivity inferences, likely in the form of a Gricean inference where they reasoned about possible alternative utterances a speaker could have said.",

Specifically, we pursue the question of whether pigeons can acquire multiple hard-to-discriminate rock-image categories as defined in the geologic sciences. We test a formal computational model of associative learning on its ability to account quantitatively for pigeons’ category learning performance. A prerequisite for applying the model is to embed the rock images in a pigeon psychological similarity space. We achieve that goal by modeling pigeons’ performance in an independently conducted same-different discrimination task involving the identical set of to-be-categorized rock images. The models provide a unified and accurate quantitative account of intricate sets of same-different and categorization-confusion data in this high-dimensional rock-categories domain. The psychological similarity space derived for pigeons resembles to a surprising degree one previously derived for humans, but with some notable exceptions, which are crucial to explaining pigeons’ detailed patterns of categorization performance.",

          "abstract": "Reward valuation and reward and punishment learning are key constructs relevant for understanding and intervening on mental illness. These constructs are frequently measured with behavioral tasks such as intertemporal choice tasks, measuring delay discounting, and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), measuring reward and punishment learning. Delay discounting refers to how people value delayed outcomes, with steep discounting (i.e., delayed outcomes holding little value) considered a form of impulsive decision-making. Reward and punishment learning refers to how people adjust their decision behavior in response to rewards and punishments, with deficits indicating atypical reward and punishment processing related to clinical outcomes such as substance abuse. In this study, we tested the association between delay discounting and reward and punishment learning among adults (N = 299) from the United States that completed an intertemporal choice task and the play-or-pass IGT. We fit a joint model to the task data to simultaneously estimate parameters from the hyperbolic discounting model (for the intertemporal choice task) with parameters from a reinforcement learning model (for the play-or-pass IGT). The joint model also included parameters capturing cross-task associations between model parameters. Our results indicate that steep delay discounting is negatively associated with punishment learning. That is, people who do not value delayed outcomes also show less learning from punishment. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of improving our assessment of reward valuation and reward and punishment learning as constructs relevant to mental illness.",

          "abstract": "Personality traits provide insight into physical expression, behaviour, and social relations, making personality research vital for both clinical understanding and social analysis. Much of trait psychology developed through the initial analysis of the English lexicon to identify dominant personality traits which then informed the creation of personality assessments like the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised-R. Following this, cross-cultural psychologists used bottom-up approaches in other cultures to identify dominant personality traits and developed instruments like the Cross Cultural Personality Assessment Inventory-2 and South African Personality Inventory. Recently, naturally occurring data like social media posts have been used to study personality. However, much of the analysis for these studies was manually driven using qualitative or quantitative techniques. This study applied text mining techniques, including parts-of-speech tagging and supervised and unsupervised topic modelling, to 60 South African literary texts to identify personality trait terms. While unsupervised topic modelling showed limitations, guided thematic clustering through supervised LDA topic modelling aligned well with the empirically accepted five factors, with mismatches reflecting known issues in fitting certain constructs to African contexts. Results also revealed gender differences in personality consistent with existing literature.

          "authors": "Michael Schwartze; Anika Voerman; Sonja A. Kotz",
          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with disruptions in the temporal organization of motor and non-motor behavior, likely arising from dysfunction within basal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits. Despite extensive evidence for impaired timing in PD, the relationship between temporal processing variability, disease progression, and established clinical severity markers remains poorly defined. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis to quantify temporal processing efficiency in PD using the coefficient of variation (CV), a standardized measure of performance variability across timing tasks. CV values were extracted from empirical studies encompassing a broad range of temporal processing paradigms. Associations between CV, participant age, and disease severity were examined using Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stages. Results revealed a robust positive correlation between CV and UPDRS score, independent of age, indicating that increased temporal variability reflects disease-specific dysfunction rather than normal aging. In contrast, CV correlated negatively with H&amp;Y stage and age, consistent with medication-related influences on motor symptom severity. Secondary analyses showed no reliable differences in CV across task type, temporal range, or medication status, supporting the notion of a generalized temporal processing impairment in PD. Together, these findings suggest that temporal processing variability represents a sensitive marker of disease progression and may inform diagnostic assessment and intervention strategies.",

          "authors": "Henrik R. Godmann; Dylan Molenaar; Matthias Ziegler; Julius M. Pfadt",
          "abstract": "In confirmatory factor analysis, measurement invariance is needed both to ensure that a questionnaire measures individuals equivalently across covariates (e.g., age, gender) and to justify interpreting any differences in latent factor means or relations as substantive rather than artefactual. Commonly, measurement invariance is investigated by turning (often continuous) covariates into categories and then use multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) in a structural equation modeling framework. However, this practice discards information and can undermine the validity of conclusions about measurement invariance and differential item functioning. Moderated (Non-)linear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) overcomes these limitations by allowing both continuous and categorical covariates to act as moderators of any parameter in a latent factor model. This allows to study measurement invariance and differential item functioning without discretizing covariates. However, current implementations of MNLFA require complex code in R or commercial software (Mplus), and do not have intuitive point-and-click user interfaces. To make MNLFA accessible to a broad range of applied researchers, we have implemented it in the free, open-source software JASP and provide a step-by-step tutorial on assessing measurement invariance using MNLFA in JASP. This implementation allows researchers to conduct more precise and informative invariance analyses without extensive programming effort.",

          "abstract": "The Ψ-Band Cognitive Bandwidth Scale (Ψ-CBS) is a brief self-report measure designed for product research and self-tracking of everyday cognitive performance over the past two weeks. Grounded in the Trident G computational account of intelligence, the Ψ-CBS operationalises everyday functioning as performance maintained within a workable “Ψ-band” around a defended mind–body budget set-point, and distinguishes outcome signatures of stable control versus adaptive updating. This pilot study evaluated the internal structure of the eight-item core (Ψ-CBS-Core), theorised to comprise two correlated outcome factors: (1) focus stability and error resistance, and (2) active processing and learning/transfer. Anonymised online questionnaire data were analysed from N = 23 respondents (complete Ψ-CBS-Core data). Item descriptives, inter-item correlations, factorability indices (KMO, Bartlett’s test), exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring with oblique rotation), and internal consistency estimates were examined. Results provided preliminary support for the intended two-factor structure, with items 1–4 showing stronger associations with focus/error outcomes and items 5–8 showing stronger associations with active processing and learning/transfer. Internal consistency was acceptable to high for both subscales and the total score (Cronbach’s α = .79, .89, and .86, respectively). Given the small sample size and indications of a strong general factor, these findings should be treated as provisional and used to inform a larger confirmatory study.",

          "abstract": "Background: The proliferation of psychological measures and constructs has led to critical conceptual fragmentation, complicating instrument selection and undermining content validity. Traditional expert-based procedures are often resource-intensive and subjective, underscoring the need for objective, scalable assessment methods.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluates the capability of Large Language Models—comparing embedding-based semantic similarity and prompt-based generative approaches—to perform scalable content assessments. The methodology was validated across 13 scales for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and applied to 7 established measures of depression, benchmarking results against theoretical criteria and expert consensus.\nResults: Models demonstrated strong capability across two key tasks. Generative models achieved high classification accuracy (Cohen's κ up to 0.90) in mapping scale items to their theoretically intended symptoms. Furthermore, aggregated semantic similarity derived from embedding models strongly correlated with overall expert rankings of scales’ content validity (ρ = 0.89), validating their use for objective instrument triage. Importantly, the open-source model (intfloat/e5-large-v2) successfully replicated expert consensus in the depression application. However, models struggled to reliably replicate fine-grained symptom-level quality assessments.\nConclusion: Both embedding and generative models offer a powerful, scalable, and theory-referenced heuristic for psychometric triage. By providing an objective and cost-effective methodology to rank item-construct alignment, this approach helps researchers efficiently select the measurement tools with the highest content validity with respect to the predefined construct.",

          "abstract": "Front-view figures in visual art play an essential role in shaping social perception and aesthetic experience by directly engaging the viewer through eye contact, facial expression, and bodily cues. In contrast, back-view figures, known as Rückenfigur, have been proposed to facilitate a more immersive mode of aesthetic engagement. By obscuring facial and bodily features, the Rückenfigur invites the viewer to imaginatively adopt the figure's viewpoint as a means of understanding and appreciating the depicted scene. Yet empirical evidence supporting these claims remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, the current pre-registered study used eye-tracking and Bayesian regression modelling to investigate the extent to which front- versus back-view figures impact aesthetic experience and gaze behaviour. Fifty-three participants viewed artworks featuring both figure types and evaluated them on aesthetic liking, perceived understanding, and emotional evocativeness while their eye movements were recorded. Across all measures, back-view figures enhanced aesthetic evaluations, especially for liking and emotional evocativeness, compared to front-view figures, suggesting that Rückenfigur-type of representations enhance viewers’ aesthetic experience. Gaze behaviour results demonstrated that both figure types captured attention at comparable levels, as reflected in similar dwell times. However, back-view figures prompted a greater number of fixations, suggesting that back-view orientations involve more frequent gaze shifts and possibly increased visual exploration relative to front-view figures. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence for the aesthetic and attentional mechanisms underlying human figure perception in visual art, demonstrating that body orientation critically shapes viewers' aesthetic experience.",

          "abstract": "Young children’s self-regulation skills can vary intra-individually from one real-life situation to the next. However, we know very little about how intra-individual variability contributes to individual differences in development. The present study addresses this gap by applying a person-centered approach to identify distinct variability profiles based on repeated classroom observations. We hypothesized that a) children can be meaningfully grouped based on their intra-individual variability in self-regulation and that b) profile membership relates to current and long-term developing self-regulation skills and behavioral difficulties. The sample consisted of N=201 Swiss kindergarteners (47.8% female, M=5.4y., SD =0.6). We used an observational measure to assess self-regulation in the real-life classroom context. To identify potential subgroups of self-regulation variability, we used latent profile analysis. We identified two profiles: one labeled as variable regulators (54.9 %) and the other as consistently high regulators (45.1 %). Surprisingly, profile membership appears to be only marginally associated with current emotion regulation and unrelated to long-term self-regulation and behavioral differences after controlling for age, gender, and home chaos. However, results revealed significant profile differences in terms of gender and home chaos. Overall, the present findings highlight that young children differ in their intra-individual variability in self-regulation skills across various classroom situations. Moreover, they suggest that this variability might be characteristic of this early developmental period.",

          "authors": "Melanie Bamert; Jennifer Inauen; Alea Ruf",
          "abstract": "Background: Stress is frequently cited as a barrier to physical activity, yet evidence from daily life remains inconclusive and may depend on the specific stress aspect (perceived stress, physiology), physical (in)activity indicator (e.g., steps, vigorous activity), and temporal window examined. This study investigated associations between multiple momentary stress aspects and subsequent physical (in)activity across several time lags in daily life.\nMethods: Seventy-six adults in the weight loss maintenance phase who reported difficulties maintaining a balanced diet participated in a 7-day ecological momentary assessment study. Participants completed hourly smartphone surveys assessing momentary perceived stress and perceived safety and continuously wore a chest-mounted sensor to derive vagally-mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), steps, light physical activity (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary behaviour (SB). Multilevel two-part models estimated within-person associations between each stress aspect and the subsequent occurrence and amount of physical (in)activity at 10-, 30-, 60-, and 120-minute lags.\nResults: Within-person associations between momentary stress indicators and subsequent physical (in)activity were predominantly small and non-significant. When significant associations emerged, higher momentary stress was positively related to the amount of subsequent physical activity, particularly for steps. Significant associations for the occurrence of physical (in)activity were largely restricted to vmHRV, indicating that activation of stress-related physiology was related to a higher probability of engaging in physical activity. Results showed heterogeneity across time lags and physical activity indicators but were overall consistent across the three stress aspects in terms of the direction of the associations.\nConclusions: The findings highlight that associations between momentary stress and physical (in)activity in daily life were generally small and specific to the temporal resolution, but when significant, showed a consistent directional pattern across stress aspects. Higher momentary stress was followed by short-term increases in physical activity. While vmHRV largely converged with subjective stress indicators, it also revealed additional associations, highlighting complementary information across stress measures. Together, these findings emphasize the value of multimodal stress assessments and fine-grained, time-lagged analyses for capturing stress–physical activity dynamics in everyday life.",

          "abstract": "While the neural correlates of emotion regulation (ER) have frequently been investigated, only few studies have compared the neural correlates of several ER strategies against another. Here, we present fMRI data from 45 female participants who used distraction, reappraisal, and acceptance to downregulate emotions in a within-subject design. ER compared to the control condition of simply viewing negative stimuli showed activation in frontal and temporoparietal regions. Acceptance resulted in activation in frontal regions and precuneus, as well as reductions in occipital and temporal regions. Reappraisal showed prefrontal and temporal activation with suppression of the PCC and cuneus. Distraction was not associated with stronger activation, but relative deactivation of occipital areas. Direct comparisons between strategies revealed increased engagement of prefrontal and cingulate networks during acceptance and reappraisal compared to distraction, while distraction showed stronger recruitment of occipital and parietal regions. Acceptance differed from reappraisal with greater activation in the dmPFC and fusiform and lingual gyri. Our results indicate that distraction engages earlier in the emotion generating process than acceptance or reappraisal and mostly relies on regions involved in visual perception and attention. Acceptance and reappraisal resemble one another in the recruitment of areas related to cognitive control, however, acceptance also shows a unique activation in areas related to visual processing that are absent in reappraisal. These findings may inform clinical practice in the choice of ER strategies recommended for certain patient groups and speaks towards the theoretical debate on the contextualization of acceptance in the Process Model of Emotion Regulation.",

We present the ten-item Words Can Harm Scale (WCHS) as a valid and reliable measure of this belief. Items assess attitudes about harmful speech (e.g., \"Vulnerable people should not be exposed to certain kinds of speech, as this might harm them\") and written words (e.g., \"I could be left emotionally scarred by something I read\"). In a representative sample of American adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal reliability (α = .92) and robust test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. The WCHS was associated with self-reported intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. The WCHS was also associated with concern for political correctness and endorsement of trigger warnings and safe spaces. Individuals who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of speech—a salient and divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional models of Valence and Arousal dominate the literature on the structure of affect, despite the persistent emergence of a general factor typically treated as a methodological artifact. This study proposes a reinterpretation of this factor as a fundamental dimension of Affective Intensity/Salience, organizing affect into a hierarchical structure. We investigated this proposal in two domains: the semantic structure of affect, by analyzing word embeddings from a vast linguistic corpus, and the psychometric structure of self-report, using data from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A robust analytical approach, including Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis, was employed. The results consistently confirm the existence of a hierarchical structure. However, a crucial nuance emerged: Salience was the dominant dimension in language, whereas Valence was dominant in self-report. Convergent analysis demonstrated that the Intensity dimension in self-report is primarily driven by the magnitude of Negative Affect. Our findings suggest that, rather than an artifact, the general factor is a substantive dimension whose nature depends on the domain under analysis, challenging purely two-dimensional models and opening new avenues for the explanation and measurement of affect.",

          "abstract": "Facial expressions are central to human communication and can be systematically described through the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which decomposes expressions into discrete facial movements, or Action Units (AUs). Open-source automated AU detection systems such as AFAR and OpenFace are now widely used in psychological research due to their efficiency and accessibility, yet their performance and potential biases remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we leverage photorealistic, parameterized MetaHuman animations to create a highly controlled yet naturalistic stimulus set in which facial motion is precisely specified across time and held constant across identities. Four avatars differing in sex, age, and ethnicity were animated with identical motion parameters to generate a set of single-AU and AU-combination sequences, enabling systematic evaluation of model performance under tightly controlled conditions. Using AFAR and OpenFace, we assessed AU detection accuracy and temporal dynamics through classification metrics and cross-correlation analyses. Although both systems performed above chance, their accuracy varied substantially across AU type and avatar. In particular, single-AU movements were detected less reliably than AU combinations, and both systems showed pronounced biases toward smiling-related AUs. To address these limitations, we introduce a landmark-displacement analysis that directly quantifies non-rigid facial motion from tracked geometry, yielding consistent and accurate motion estimates across avatars and animations. Together, our findings reveal systematic biases in current AU detection systems and show how parametrically controlled avatar stimuli, combined with motion-based analyses, provide a powerful framework for probing dynamic face perception.",

Contemporary models highlight the possible involvement of altered affective and autonomic regulation and interoceptive processing in FND. However, accessible, mechanism-informed interventions remain limited. Somatic yoga, integrating movement, breathwork and body awareness, may help target altered emotional processing and bodily regulation in FND.\nMethods: This single-site, two-arm randomised feasibility trial allocated adults with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of FND to six weeks of somatic yoga (weekly remote sessions plus home practice manual) or to a music-based relaxation control. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes, assessed at baseline, week 3, week 6 and three-month follow-up, included FND symptom burden, psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, dissociation), general functioning, health-related quality-of-life, interoceptive awareness, and autonomic symptoms.\nResults: Seventy-six enquiries were received. Thirty participants consented (100%), 27 were randomised (90%), 23 commenced the trial (77%) and 21 completed the trial (70%). Recruitment and retention targets were met, with 100% retention in the yoga arm. Adherence was high across both groups, although digital logging of home practice posed usability challenges. Exploratory analyses indicated large effect sizes for self-reported FND symptom improvement and interoceptive awareness in the yoga group, with effects sustained at follow-up.\nConclusions: Individually delivered somatic yoga was found to be feasible, acceptable and safe for people with FND. Our results also suggest potential benefits of somatic yoga for FND symptom improvement and interoceptive awareness, supporting progression to a fully powered trial.",

Although persistence in goal pursuit is widely valued across cultures, unwavering commitment to unattainable goals can become maladaptive and harmful to mental health. Despite a strong research focus on persistence, the potential benefits of goal disengagement and flexibility remain underexplored.\nMethod: This selective overview integrates perspectives from motivational psychology, evolutionary psychiatry, and clinical frameworks to propose a framework that distinguishes adaptive (goal persistence, goal flexibility) and maladaptive (goal rigidity, goal abandonment) processes of goal pursuit in the context of low mood and motivational conflict. Relevant individual and contextual factors influencing these processes are reviewed, and potential intervention strategies are outlined.\nResults: Evidence suggests that low mood may serve as an adaptive signal during action crises, informing decisions to either persist with or disengage from personal goals. Factors such as perceived obligation, lack of autonomy, intolerance of uncertainty, and rigid goal representations may increase vulnerability to maladaptive goal rigidity. Experiential techniques, ACT components, and mental contrasting may promote flexible and value-driven goal pursuit.\nConclusion: Goal flexibility can play an important role for mental health. Recognizing low mood as an informational cue, rather than solely as a symptom, may aid adaptive decision making during motivational conflict. Interventions should support individuals in evaluating and adjusting goals in accordance with values and circumstances.",

          "abstract": "The extent to which visual working memory (VWM) operates on unconscious input remains a matter of debate, with no definitive evidence confirming or refuting its existence. A central challenge in this inquiry lies in methodological constraints, particularly criterion biases in measuring conscious awareness. To overcome these limitations, we conducted two experiments that combined a bias-free two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) task with an ensemble perception paradigm, minimising content-related criterion confounds. Participants were briefly presented with visual ensembles of emotional faces and were assessed for both perceptual processing and WM maintenance using a delayed response task. Visual awareness and unawareness were objectively quantified using detection sensitivity derived from signal detection theory. Results showed a dissociation between awareness and perceptual sensitivity: participants could not explicitly detect task-relevant ensemble features, yet they discriminated them above chance level, even after a delay and in the presence of distractors, thereby providing evidence for the maintenance of unconscious information in VWM. To address potential detection inefficiencies in the 2IFC design, we conducted a follow-up single-interval task with an added distractor interval to disrupt VWM maintenance. Together, these results corroborate our findings demonstrating that WM can operate on information in the absence of conscious awareness. Ensemble-based paradigms thus provide a promising framework for probing the boundaries of conscious and unconscious processing in visual WM.",

          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Public health strategies require members of the public to make informed choices that align with expert evaluations, particularly during a health emergency. It is unclear what motivates people to seek testing during a pandemic. Legitimate reasons would be that they find they have underestimated the risk of pandemic infection, suspected viral exposure, or taken insufficient precautions against infection. We approached people seeking testing at a Norwegian COVID-19 test-station in October 2020 (T1, n = 179) and in January-February 2021 (T2, n = 184), and asked them if they thought of the pandemic as a risk, about exposure to infection sources and whether they had complied with infection control measures. This was compared to responses from a representative sample taken at approximately the same time (T1 n = 2,523 and T2 n = 2,194). We found that people at test-stations viewed the risk as lower, that they had more frequently been exposed to infectious situations, and they had complied less with infection control measures. This supported all three of our preregistered hypotheses. Our results indicate that people seeking COVID-19 testing early in the pandemic in Norway tended to have good reasons to do so. This largely supports the assumption that a well-informed public can make reasonable choices about voluntary testing.",

          "abstract": "Existing evidence has primarily examined population-level changes in anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, overlooking substantial heterogeneity in individual symptom courses. Moreover, longitudinal evidence covering the full pandemic period remains limited, and links between distinct anxious symptom change patterns, their underlying risk and protective factors, and long-term clinical outcomes are poorly understood. This pre-registered longitudinal study conducted 43,610 observations of 4,361 adults in the general population, assessed 10 times over three years. A Latent Change Score Mixture Model identified five distinct anxious symptom change patterns. Two reflected resilience: Stable Resilience (48.16%) and Initial Shock-to-Resilience (10.57%). Three indicated risk: Persistently High Anxiety (6.79%), Mild Maladaptation (27.02%), and Strong Maladaptation (7.46%). Risk patterns were predicted by greater intolerance of uncertainty, emotion regulation difficulties, lower trust in governmental pandemic response, and reduced vaccination uptake. Notably, risk patterns, particularly Strong Maladaptation, predicted high probability of treatment-seeking and receiving a future psychiatric diagnosis. Screening for risk factors may guide targeted support during infectious disease outbreaks, while strengthening coping, transparent governance, and adherence to health measures can protect against development of adverse anxious states.",

Forty-two adolescents participated across two intact classes assigned to an \nExperimental Group (n = 20) and a Control Group (n = 22). Over one academic year, the \nExperimental Group received weekly instruction integrating metacognitive strategy \nteaching, executive-function practice, and structured reflective dialogue through non\ncurriculum logic tasks.

This study aimed to quantify the impact of unhealthy food advertising on children’s immediate and later intake; and assess differences in impacts for different advertisement content (brand-only vs. product), format (audiovisual vs. visual vs. audio vs. static), or sociodemographic characteristics. A pre-registered randomised controlled trial was conducted in schools in Merseyside, UK. Across two sessions, child participants (n=240, 7-15 years, M=11.0±2.0) were exposed to 5-minutes of unhealthy food (intervention condition) and non-food (control condition) advertisements that were brand-only or product-based and in one of four media formats. Measurements included ad libitum intake of snacks and lunch, and height and weight. Area-level socioeconomic deprivation was calculated using home postcode. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. After food advertising (vs non-food), children consumed more energy at snack (+58.73kcal; p&lt;.001) and lunch (+72.93kcal; p&lt;.001). Holding advertisement exposure constant, for each +1 standard deviation increase in body mass index z-score, children consumed 49.29 additional kcal. There was no statistically significant difference in effects by advertisement content, media format, or deprivation.  This is the first study to show that brand-only food advertisements increase children’s food intake, with effects not statistically different to that for product ads and that impact is similar across advertising formats. Findings have implications for the design of restrictive food marketing policies in the UK and globally.",

          "abstract": "Digital traces—such as social media posts and app data—are increasingly used in qualitative research, both as primary data sources and as elicitation tools in interviews. One emerging approach, the scroll-back method, uses participants’ own digital traces from social media as prompts to support memory recall, stimulate reflection, and ground discussion in everyday practices. This article examines the adaptability of scroll-back across varied research contexts and developmental populations. We draw on three case studies involving adolescents, young adults, and older adults to illustrate how scroll-back was tailored to different participant groups, digital platforms, and research aims. These examples highlight how the method can be flexibly implemented, for instance through participant-led vs. researcher-led selection of content, by combining with content analysis, and by drawing on digital traces across platforms. Our reflections show that these adaptations supported rich and sometimes unexpected forms of data generation, while also surfacing important ethical and practical challenges, including issues of privacy, emotional risk, digital inclusion, and researcher–participant power dynamics. We conclude by offering a set of methodological considerations for adapting the scroll-back method in future studies. In doing so, we highlight its value not as a fixed protocol, but as a versatile methodological technique that is suited to adaptation across populations, technologies, and substantive topics.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and perception are associated with similar patterns of activation in the visual cortex. While an efficient re-use of neural resources, this overlap leads to the question of how imagery and perception are kept apart. One hypothesis is that signal strength determines perceptual reality judgements such that when activity in the visual cortex is strong enough to cross a ‘reality threshold’, that activity is inferred to reflect reality. Here, we aimed to test the causal role of sensory strength in perceptual reality monitoring by attempting to push mental imagery over the reality threshold using non-invasive brain stimulation. We used a combination of psychophysics, mental imagery and subthreshold Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): a technique that is assumed to increase subthreshold neuronal activity. We applied subthreshold TMS to early visual cortex while participants simultaneously imagined and detected visual stimuli in noise. Both imagining the stimulus as well as brain stimulation to the early visual cortex (compared to vertex) increased reports of perceiving a real stimulus when none was presented. However, there was no interaction between brain stimulation and imagery, indicating that TMS failed to push imagined signals over the reality threshold. We discuss various explanations for our results and suggest how these methods could be used to investigate the causal mechanisms of perceptual reality monitoring in future research.",

Using the PRISMA procedure for scoping reviews, a search of nine databases identified 21 empirical studies that jointly measured political views or related constructs and AI attitudes, including a broad range of AI domains. Findings reveal a patterned heterogeneity: ideological cleavages concentrate in high-stakes application domains with coercive or welfare implications and are attenuated or mixed in lower-stakes domains like consumer services. Across the sampled studies, three mechanisms are repeatedly described or tested to\nexplain when political views relate to AI attitudes: (1) value-congruence, (2) risk or threat appraisals, and (3) affective pathways potentially activated by dis- or satisfied values or psychological processes. Methodological frictions are posed by heterogeneous measures and\nWEIRD-skewed convenience samples which constrain cumulation and comparability of empirical results at the current time. The review converts a fragmented literature into a testable integrative framework linking psychological layers of political views to actionable design and communication levers and outlines a testable agenda on the relations between AI attitudes and political views.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering – a spontaneous shift in attention away from a task – has been consistently associated with impaired cognitive task performance, often attributed to disruptions in executive functioning. In this study, we conducted three experiments to replicate and extend previous work by examining how mind wandering interacts with three core executive functions: inhibition (Experiment 1: Sustained Attention to Response Task , n = 55), updating (Experiment 2: Random n-back Task, n = 52) and shifting (Experiment 3: Number-Letter Task, n = 54). If mind wandering is closely related to executive functioning, it was expected that mind wandering would impair performance on trials requiring these functions, reflected in lower accuracy and increased reaction time variability. Our findings partly confirmed this: Mind wandering was associated with a stronger reduction in accuracy in executive trials involving inhibition and shifting. However, in the updating task, where executive and non-executive trials were matched in difficulty, mind wandering reduced accuracy in both executive and non-executive trials, with stronger evidence for an effect in non-executive trials. Notably, the executive trials in the inhibition and shifting tasks were inherently more difficult than their non-executive counterparts. These findings suggest that the observed performance decrements may be more closely tied to task difficulty than to executive trials per se.",

          "abstract": "Memory improves when encoding and retrieval occur in the same context—a phenomenon known as the context reinstatement (CR) effect. CR is well established in younger adults (Smith &amp; Vela, 2001), yet it remains unclear whether older adults benefit from contextual support as effectively. Addressing this question, this meta-analysis synthesized findings from 22 manuscripts (33 studies, 106 effect sizes, N = 2,177) comparing CR effects in younger and older adults across various types of contexts, encoding instructions, and memory paradigms, thereby extending the previous review by Smith and Vela (2001). Overall, CR reliably enhanced memory in both age groups (Hedges’ g = 0.32), with no age-related difference in effect size. This comparable benefit held despite 72% of primary studies reporting typical age-related declines in memory. This suggests that older adults retain the ability to encode and retrieve item–context associations when strategic retrieval demands are minimized, aligning with the Environmental Support Hypothesis (Craik, 1983) and challenging a strict interpretation of the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (Naveh-Benjamin, 2000). Moderator analyses indicated that CR effects were overall weaker when item pairs with associative instructions were encoded, compared to single items. Furthermore, CR effects tended to reduce when switched contexts were familiar, rather than novel at retrieval. No age-specific moderation was found. However, a lack of variation of encoding demands, context types, and memory tests across empirical studies limited statistical power for such moderator analyses. Overall, more research is needed to systematically examine potential conditions under which age differences in CR may emerge.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural experiments, whether conducted in the laboratory or in the wild, often involve altering the context for the organisms. Such constraints may include environmental changes or manipulation by experimenters. These disturbances can induce stress, potentially affecting the physiology and behaviour of the animals and thus compromising the initial conditions of the experiment. When stress is directly related to the study subject, it can act as a confounding variable. This study aimed to investigate the impact of introducing an acclimation period, i.e., a delay between handling and the commencement of a task, on animal behaviour, specifically in woodlice. By incorporating this delay, we hypothesised that the animals would return to a baseline psychophysiological state, thereby reducing the stress effects of pre-experimental manipulations. We set up a simple task in which woodlice had to cross a corridor and we manipulated the delay between handling and the task itself. Contrary to our main hypothesis, our findings indicate that acclimation did not significantly affect the speed of woodlice. However, exploratory analyses revealed that a longer pre-experimental delay reduced the likelihood of U-turns in the corridor. Additionally, in trials without U-turns, woodlice spent more time in the experimental apparatus when the acclimation period was longer. These preliminary results only partially support previous research linking stress and exploration in woodlice. Further studies are necessary to confirm these effects and better characterise the relationship between acclimation and subsequent behaviour in scientific experiments.",

Furthermore, DD is associated with impairments in rhythmic ability and working memory. This study examined SL in adults with DD compared to Typical Readers (TR), and explored whether individual differences in rhythmic ability, working memory, and vocabulary related to individual SL ability in a speech segmentation experiment.\nA total of 143 participants (NDD = 25, NTR = 118) were exposed to an artificial language of trisyllabic nonsense-words while neural entrainment to the words assessed SL via electroencephalography (EEG), followed by behavioral SL outcome measures. Aiming to assess individual differences, we linked the neural measure of SL to a battery of tests measuring musicality, rhythmic abilities, working memory, and vocabulary size. \nResults indicated successful SL in both groups, with similar neural entrainment to the TP-structure during exposure. Behavioral performance in the DD group on SL seemed below TR, though Bayesian analyses rendered this inconclusive. The DD group further obtained lower scores on tasks measuring rhythmic ability, working memory and vocabulary size, but this seemed primarily driven by the latter two. Comparison of relations between neural SL and these tasks indicated no group differences. Exploratively combining the groups resulted in anecdotal Bayesian evidence that individual differences in SL related to working memory and rhythmic ability measured by sensorimotor synchronization. Our results emphasize the importance of an individual differences approach, moving beyond group comparisons based on diagnoses.",

Traditional expert-based procedures are often resource-intensive and subjective, underscoring the need for objective, scalable assessment methods.\nAims and Methods: This study evaluates the capability of Large Language Models—comparing embedding-based semantic similarity and prompt-based generative approaches—to perform scalable content assessments. The methodology was validated across 13 scales for Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and applied to 7 established measures of depression, benchmarking results against theoretical criteria and expert consensus.\nResults: Models demonstrated strong capability across two key tasks. Generative models achieved high classification accuracy (Cohen's κ up to 0.90) in mapping scale items to their theoretically intended symptoms. Furthermore, aggregated semantic similarity derived from embedding models strongly correlated with overall expert rankings of scales’ content validity (ρ = 0.89), validating their use for objective instrument triage. Importantly, the open-source model (intfloat/e5-large-v2) successfully replicated expert consensus in the depression application. However, models struggled to reliably replicate fine-grained symptom-level quality assessments.\nConclusion: Both embedding and generative models offer a powerful, scalable, and theory-referenced heuristic for psychometric triage. By providing an objective and cost-effective methodology to rank item-construct alignment, this approach helps researchers efficiently select the measurement tools with the highest content validity with respect to the predefined construct.",

A recent study suggested that such a general characterization can be obtained by assuming efficient compression of the syntactic information from the input guided by a logic-based grammar. Specifically, it was shown that the memory cost of syntactic integration measured in terms of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) predicts variance in reading times for naturalistic texts in English, unlike the more traditional dependency-based integration cost. The crucial test for the new theory is yet to be done, however, since the predictions of CCG- and dependency-based integration cost most drastically diverge in head-final languages. This study conducts this crucial test using a naturalistic reading time dataset in Japanese. Our results favor CCG over dependency grammar: CCG-based integration cost predicted reading time variance of held-out data, while the dependency-based version failed to show such a predictive power. We also show that CCG predicts the cost of information storage better than dependency grammar, though in this realm the two formalisms make similar predictions. Overall, our results, combined with previous ones,} suggest that the logic-based grammar captures some cross-linguistic, potentially universal aspect of human sentence comprehension.",

Robust alternatives like robust linear regression do not hinge on assumptions like normally distributed errors with equal variances or the inconsequentiality of extreme values and outliers. Tests with these broad robustness features act agains nonreplication that occurs solely because data anomalies arise differently across studies. Using them from the outset sidesteps the pitfalls of making a data-based decision about whether a standard test is applicable. The common practice of conducting them in addition, commonly in response to data inspection, yields multiple test results. I argue that these should be avoided when a binary decision must be reached, for example, conducting further research on the basis on the assumption that an effect exists. Practically, using a single test simplifies analysis. While R offers numerous robust methods, the ones that provide broad robustness are largely restricted to linear models.",

          "authors": "Junya Fukuta; Masato Terai",
          "abstract": "Recent years have seen a growing number of empirical studies that examine negative entrenchment and statistical preemption as mechanisms of frequency-based learning in second language (L2) acquisition. As the body of research expands, there is a need to take stock of how these mechanisms have been studied and what kinds of evidence have accumulated. This scoping review analyses 24 empirical studies published between 1993 and 2024, focusing on the range of target structures, language backgrounds, task types, and reported outcomes. While both negative entrenchment and statistical preemption have received empirical support, null results were also frequently reported. Crucially, these null results are not confined to specific methodological choices or task types. This review, therefore, examines the conditions under which such mixed findings emerge and shows that they arise at the intersection of L1 influence and broader universal constraints. Building on this analysis, the paper proposes several methodological directions, including simulation-informed Bayesian modelling as an integrative approach and experimental paradigms carefully designed to isolate mechanisms as a disentangling approach. It also highlights the need for greater transparency in sample-size determination, preregistration practices, and other measures that enhance the reliability of future research.",

          "abstract": "Background: Suffering is an undesired experiential state that can degrade well-being, but few studies have explored its potential impact on well-being at the population level. \n\nMethods: Using nationally representative samples from 23 countries and territories in the Global Flourishing Study (N = 207,919), this preregistered longitudinal study examined associations between suffering and multidimensional well-being outcomes assessed approximately one year later. Following the analytic template for outcome-wide designs, we conducted a series of country-specific weighted regression analyses where each Wave 2 outcome was regressed on Wave 1 suffering (controlling for Wave 1 demographic and childhood variables). Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool country-specific effect estimates for the 56 main outcomes encompassing psychological, social, physical, volitional, and material dimensions of well-being.  \n\nResults: The cross-national meta-analyses provided some evidence of associations between suffering and worse well-being for both composite well-being indicators and most specific well-being indicators across different domains of functioning. Somewhat stronger and more consistent associations with worse well-being were observed for some domains (e.g., psychological well-being) compared to others (e.g., social participation). Effect estimates generally attenuated after applying a more conservative analytic approach that included additional adjustment for principal components extracted from the Wave 1 outcomes. Country-specific estimates showed some cross-national variation. \n\nConclusions: Our findings provide novel population-level evidence on the implications of suffering for various aspects of well-being in a diverse set of contexts. We discuss some potential implications for implementing scalable interventions and informing public policy aimed at reducing the burden of human suffering.",

          "abstract": "Suicide remains a leading cause of death, particularly among young adults, highlighting the critical need to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying suicidality. This study used an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm to test whether depressed individuals with and without suicidal ideation show neural markers of altered semantic processing and conflict monitoring when reading clinically relevant self-referential content. During electroencephalography recording, depressed participants with (n=46) and without (n=44) suicidal ideation, and healthy controls (n=48), read first-person sentences whose final word rendered them congruent or incongruent with depression, suicidality, or neutral biographical experiences. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess group and topic congruency effects on the N400 (semantic processing) and P600 (conflict monitoring/reanalysis). For neutral biographical (vs. non-biographical) sentences, all groups showed the expected reduction in N400 amplitudes, while the suicidal group exhibited significantly reduced P600 responses compared to the other groups. For depressive (vs. non-depressive) sentences, both depressed groups showed significantly reduced N400 amplitudes relative to controls and larger P600 amplitudes. For suicidal (vs. non-suicidal) sentences, there were no group differences in N400 amplitudes, but the suicidal group showed significantly attenuated P600 responses compared to controls. These results suggest that depressed individuals, regardless of suicidality, demonstrate facilitated semantic processing and increased reanalysis of depressive self-referential content, consistent with a negative self-schema. In contrast, those with suicidal ideation show reduced reanalysis of both neutral and suicidal self-referential content, possibly reflecting cognitive disengagement from personally relevant information. These patterns may support the potential utility of ERP markers for identifying individuals at elevated risk.",

          "authors": "Rin Tsuboyama",
          "abstract": "This paper develops a cognitively grounded agent-based model of trust and cooperation in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. To move beyond the common “black box” treatment of decision-making in simulation research, it operationalizes the Free Energy Principle and active inference as an explicit process of Bayesian belief updating and prediction-error minimization. Agents are implemented with a hierarchical recurrent neural network inspired by predictive coding and trained to jointly forecast both players’ next actions, payoffs, and opponent-type indicators from interaction histories. In an Axelrod-style tournament, the resulting agent is evaluated against canonical strategies (ALLC, ALLD, Random, and Tit-for-Tat) and in dyadic interaction with another independently initialized agent of the same kind. The agent exhibits conditional cooperation with reciprocating opponents, rapid withdrawal under sustained defection, and systematic vulnerabilities under stochastic play. Crucially, trajectories of latent internal states provide a process-level account of how cooperation emerges, stabilizes, and collapses, linking observable behavior to evolving expectations about the social environment. The study demonstrates how cognitive modeling can enrich sociological accounts of trust by making the micro-dynamics of inference empirically inspectable within simulations, and it outlines a transferable framework for extending such models to richer action spaces and institutional settings.",

An important but understudied mechanism for attracting private investment into biodiversity outcomes is conservation compensation funds – funds that aggregate payments to compensate for negative impacts on biodiversity to contribute to strategic objectives. We described the principles of effective compensation funds based on economic and ecological theory, and assembled by far the largest database of operational compensation funds to date (32 funds across 17 countries) through a mixed methods review. We explored the variety of practice in real-world implementation, and how empirical practice compares to theory, highlighting key gaps.  In doing so, we provided a guide to the design of ecologically effective compensation funds, a hitherto understudied but potentially substantial source of investment for biodiversity outcomes.",

          "authors": "Mayank Kejriwal",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces a compartmental modeling framework for analyzing the dynamic interplay between innovation and imitation in socio-technical systems. Drawing inspiration from epidemiological models, we represent agents as belonging to distinct behavioral states, such as aspiring innovators, successful inventors, idle imitators, and successful imitators, and model transitions between these states using a system of differential equations. We investigate how varying the fraction of innovators within a fixed population affects system-wide social utility over time. Simulations conducted in Berkeley Madonna reveal that, contrary to common intuition, higher proportions of innovators do not necessarily lead to higher social utility in the short run due to front-loaded opportunity costs. In the long run, however, utility is maximized not when innovation is maximized, but when there is a modest surplus of innovators relative to imitators. We further extend the model to incorporate a baseline productivity class of agents contributing constant social value, allowing for a more realistic assessment of marginal utility. These findings offer insight into the design of balanced innovation policies and provide a flexible foundation for future empirical and agent-based research.",

          "abstract": "Research on energy siting conflict argues that high levels of local control and public input increase the perceived fairness of the permitting process. However, these studies largely rely on retrospective evaluations, meaning respondents may form their attitudes about procedural fairness and legitimacy based on whether they secure their preferred policy outcome. In contrast, I use experimental designs to randomly vary whether respondents learn the policy outcome prior to judging the permitting process. Across two pre-registered survey experiments, state control and limited public input decrease the perceived fairness and legitimacy of wind turbine siting. This relationship is unaltered by knowing the policy outcome. However, the resilient effect of these specific process on legitimacy is only around half the size as the effect of getting one's preferred policy outcome. Consequently, studies which measure public perceptions after siting may largely capture the effect of the outcome, rather than that of process alone.",

          "abstract": "Intergenerational closure is a crucial factor in the formation of educational inequalities (Coleman, 1988, 1990). Empirical studies provide evidence of positive associations between intergenerational closure and students' competencies, school grades, and retention. Less is known about its impact on parental aspirations that precede the children's educational success within Germany’s stratified school system, where intermediate school tracks may provide a specific context in which closure becomes especially important. Under an extended theoretical perspective from the Wisconsin Model (Sewell et al., 1969, 1970a, 2003) and using data from the National Educational Panel Study Starting Cohort 3 (NEPS Network, 2024) (n = 6,162), we examine whether intergenerational closure is associated with parents’ realistic and idealistic aspirations for their child’s educational attainment. Results from linear probability models indicate that closure significantly increases realistic aspirations among parents with children in the intermediate tracks, but has no effect on idealistic aspirations.",

          "abstract": "Background: Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) uses Boolean set theory to identify complex causal ‘recipes’. QCA has been used in systematic reviews to identify configurations of intervention and contextual features associated with the effectiveness of complex multi-component interventions. Despite increasing use of QCA in systematic reviews, no tool currently exists to appraise reviews using QCA. To address this gap, we developed ‘CARU-QCA’ (Critical Appraisal of Reviews Using QCA).  \n\nMethods: We used three sources of evidence to develop CARU-QCA: key papers on the logic and procedures of QCA; existing systematic review appraisal tools; and published QCA reviews. In addition to the existing six stages of QCA outlined elsewhere, we also distinguished a baseline stage (Stage 0) where we appraise the set-up and appropriateness of the use of QCA. Several rounds of user testing by the lead authors and colleagues in the field aimed to refine the tool and enhance its usability. \n\nResults: QCA blends a deep, holistic understanding of interventions and their underlying theory, with computer-based mathematical procedures for examining and testing patterns in the data. As such, elements of the CARU-QCA tool support the appraisal of the approach used to develop case-based knowledge and use of theory for exploring cross-case patterns as well as the technical analytic procedures. In line with systematic review guidance, CARU-QCA also appraises transparency of reporting. The tool is divided into seven sections to support users in appraising the set-up of QCA and the six analytical steps. The tool guides users to assess their confidence in the execution of each of the seven stages, before forming an overarching confidence assessment. A detailed guide accompanies the tool providing further background information and explanation of the rationale for each question.\n\nConclusions: CARU-QCA provides a transparent and standardised approach for critiquing and evaluating reviews using QCA; it will be of value to those seeking to assess and implement the findings of QCA reviews. CARU-QCA will also be useful to systematic reviewers seeking guidance on how to undertake and report a QCA.",

          "abstract": "This evaluation focuses on a speaker series of community college studies presentations. The seven monthly presentations were led by professors and an institutional researcher who conduct research on community colleges. Example presentation topics included the history of community colleges, policy reforms in community college developmental education, and transfer receptive culture. The presentations’ primary audience was community college students. I interviewed 12 community college student attendees and then analyzed interview transcripts using structural coding and thematic analysis. Two themes were identified. The first theme was that the presentations improved most students’ perceptions of community colleges. To elaborate, the presentations destigmatized community colleges and dismantled a deficit thinking paradigm. Moreover, interviewees reported that their improved perceptions of community colleges helped with their academic engagement and social engagement at their community college. The second theme was that the presentations improved most students’ interest and ability in community college advocacy. For example, several attendees informally shared the knowledge they gained from the presentations to empower their community college peers. Furthermore, several attendees became more effective advocates within formal institutional positions such as student advisory group member, office assistant, or peer advisor. These evaluation findings align with past research that suggests that community college studies can improve learners’ perceptions and advocacy around community colleges.",

University students, particularly those belonging to Generation Z, may be especially vulnerable due to increased nighttime light exposure from electronic devices and campus environments. This study examined the relationship between light pollution exposures and sleep outcomes. A cross-sectional study design was employed using self-reported survey data collected from 109 Millersville university students. Spearman rank-order correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between ALAN exposure variables and sleep-related outcomes. Results indicated that higher exposure to artificial light at night was associated with poorer sleep quality, reduced sleep duration, and increased difficulty falling asleep. These findings suggest that light pollution represents a significant and underrecognized public health concern for young adults and highlight the need for targeted interventions and policy strategies to reduce nighttime light exposure in residential and built environments.\nKeywords:\nArtificial light at night; light pollution; sleep quality; circadian rhythm; university students; public health",

It situates caste as a durable political economy of graded inequality, structured by ritualised hierarchies, occupational immobility, and asymmetric access to land, education, and state power. The study contrasts Brahminical normative–legal traditions (including the Manusmriti and Dharmashastra literature) with anti-caste emancipatory interventions associated with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, tracing how constitutional safeguards and redistributive policy instruments converted fragmented social groups into administratively and politically “homogeneous” categories for purposes of representation and welfare. Using econometric analysis alongside historical institutionalism and jurisprudential interpretation, the research assesses recent Supreme Court deliberations on SC/ST “sub-classification\" (divide) and the possible extension of the “creamy layer” (income-cap) principle, evaluating their fragmental effects and constitutional implications. It argues that these interventions risk weakening substantive equality by reinforcing structural distortions within India’s federal and constitutional framework.",

Two thirds of these emissions are process-related and cannot be eliminated by switching to clean energy sources. Meeting the Paris Agreement's call for \"highest possible mitigation ambition\" requires faithful assessment of all mitigation options, including demand-side measures to reduce cement emissions. \nTo assess how actors define and justify their highest possible ambitions for the construction sector, we analyze cement decarbonization roadmaps in Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway: countries selected for their high floorspace per capita, which is a key indicator of significant potential for demand-side sufficiency measures in housing. We identified 30 decarbonization measures using qualitative document analysis. We coded the measures iteratively from roadmaps and literature and categorized them into a cement-specific mitigation hierarchy (Avoid, Reduce, Reuse, Substitute, Minimize, ‘Capture, Store and Recarbonate’) that integrates supply-side decarbonization with demand-side sufficiency in housing. Our findings expose a persistent sufficiency gap: roadmaps prioritize incremental technical solutions and speculative carbon storage, while neglecting transformative measures that reduce overconsumption like separating spacious living units, building smaller or house sharing. This inflates cement demand and associated residual emissions. We find that the current mitigation ambition is not a “highest possible mitigation ambition” but politically constructed version that sidelines demand-side sufficiency measures. Truly Paris-aligned pathways must integrate demand-side strategies through transdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a faithful assessment of all mitigation options.",

          "authors": "Jan Rohden; Richard Heidler; Christoph Funk",
          "abstract": "This paper applies natural language processing, machine learning and repository linking to examine the adoption of research data management (RDM) practices in proposals submitted to the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) Individual Research Grants Programme between 2017 and 2024. The analysis reveals a growing awareness of RDM, reflected in longer and more substantive statements as well as an increasing number of references to specific data repositories. Significant disciplinary differences emerge in the frequency, profile, and concreteness of RDM references, pointing to varying levels of maturity across fields. By linking proposal texts with re3data metadata, we identify the most frequently cited repositories and their disciplinary coverage. A marked shift toward more professionalized RDM following the introduction of a DFG checklist in 2021 suggests that funding agencies can actively shape RDM practices through policy instruments. These findings demonstrate how funders can influence data practices through guidance rather than coercion, offering novel insights for the monitoring of Open Science policies.",

          "authors": "DeVan L. Hankerson; Hannah Quay-de la Vallee; Morgan Badurak; Dhanaraj Thakur",
          "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational technology (edtech) in the K–12 space has grown significantly, and schools are being encouraged to adopt AI by a range of actors from states to the federal government to industry. Used well, AI may provide significant educational benefits. But the use of AI in a high-stakes context such as K–12 education also raises concerns about how well these systems will work, whether they will be worth the investment, whether they will introduce bias or other harms, and more. One commonly recommended, broadly endorsed approach to support the responsible use of edtech products that incorporate AI is transparency from the developers and designers of these systems. To better assess the current state of transparency in edtech products in the K–12 context that incorporate AI, the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) has developed a rubric of eight key elements of transparency that contribute to a full picture of an edtech product and can be used to inform decisions such as whether to procure the product and how to use it.",

          "authors": "Maria Gargiulo",
          "abstract": "Quantifying mortality in conflict settings is a challenging but necessary task for health and humanitarian response, historical memory, and accountability. In conflict settings, traditional demographic data sources, like vital statistics, may not be available or of suitable quality for mortality estimation. However, alternative sources documenting the deceased may exist, such as news reports or data collected by civil society organizations. These sources are not without their own biases; rather than being statistically representative samples or complete counts, they are convenience samples. However, when multiple sources are taken together, they can be used for mortality estimation. This article describes a workflow for mortality estimation using disparate and statistically biased data sources, motivated by three missing data challenges commonly encountered in conflict settings: missing individual identifiers, missing covariates in records of documented victims, and records of victims that are entirely undocumented. A simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of jointly applying the constituent methods of the workflow. Then, the workflow is demonstrated using data about conflict-related homicides during the armed conflict in Colombia from 1985–2018. Beyond its applications to conflict mortality estimation, this workflow can be applied to examine mortality due to other causes or other events of demographic interest.",

          "abstract": "Despite calls for reform, many transit agencies rely heavily on enforcement to increase fare revenue and perceptions of safety. Both fare evasion and behaviour violations (like loitering and public intoxication) can carry heavy fines, and lead to debt collection and criminal justice system involvement. Yet, there has been limited examination of the financial and social costs of transit fines, and whether enforcement programs can achieve revenue goals. Using administrative data obtained through freedom of information requests, I document the nature and extent of transit enforcement and fines in sixteen Canadian cities. I find that transit fines are excessively punitive when compared with parking violations, with fines on average five times higher than similar parking infractions. While there may be deterrence value from enforcement, few transit fines are paid, and the costs of enforcing transit violations are likely significantly greater than revenue from payments. Given this, transit agencies should evaluate the goals, impacts, and outcomes of enforcement programs, with a full accounting of both the financial and social costs, and consideration of alternative programs.",

          "abstract": "Everyday interests expressed in leisure, media consumption, or cultural practices, increasingly intersect with political orientations, making them strong signals of individuals’ political identities. While most research on this phenomenon has focused on bipartisan systems, this study examines interest-politics alignment within Sweden’s multi-party context. We extend prior work by systematically analyzing both the size (strength of associations) and shape (structural patterns) of this alignment, and by distinguishing whether lifestyle polarization follows partisan identities or broader ideological orientations—a question that cannot be addressed in two-party contexts where these dimensions are confounded. Analyzing Swedish Twitter data (2010-2020), we examine how politically engaged users’ interests captured through the accounts they follow correspond to their political preferences, measured both as party associations and left-right ideological positions. Our findings show that multi-party systems do not shield against interest-politics consolidation. Patterns of everyday interests among politically engaged Swedish social media users reveal two dominant clusters that correspond closely to Sweden’s coalition landscape. Importantly, fragmentation in everyday interests aligns more strongly with ideological orientations than with party identities. We find that left-leaning individuals follow accounts associated with human rights, environmentalism, and cultural consumption, whereas right-leaning users favor finance, sports, and security content. Despite this polarization, certain interests cut across political divides, offering opportunities for dialogue across ideological lines. By disentangling partisan and ideological dimensions in a multi-party setting, the study contributes to research on affective polarization and cultural cleavages in European democracies.",

          "abstract": "Intergenerational closure is a crucial factor in the formation of educational inequalities (Coleman, 1988, 1990). Empirical studies provide evidence of positive associations between intergenerational closure and students' competencies, school grades, and retention. Less is known about its impact on parental aspirations that precede the children's educational success within Germany’s stratified school system, where intermediate school tracks may provide a specific context in which closure becomes especially important. Under an extended theoretical perspective from the Wisconsin Model (Sewell et al., 1969, 1970a, 2003) and using data from the National Educational Panel Study Starting Cohort 3 (NEPS Network, 2024) (n = 6,162), we examine whether intergenerational closure is associated with parents’ realistic and idealistic aspirations for their child’s educational attainment. Results from linear probability models indicate that closure significantly increases realistic aspirations among parents with children in the intermediate tracks, but has no effect on idealistic aspirations.",

          "authors": "Viyaleta Korsunava; Boris Sokolov",
          "abstract": "Non-probability web surveys offer several advantages over face-to-face (F2F) interviews—they are cheaper, faster, more accessible, and reduce interviewer effects and desirability bias. As such, they are increasingly popular in both academic and commercial research. However, they often yield demographically biased samples, raising concerns about the accuracy of the resulting public opinion estimates. Most studies on web surveys focus on developed countries, with limited attention to non-WEIRD contexts. Addressing this gap, we compare data from the Values in Crisis (VIC) survey (2020–2021, opt-in online panels with quota sampling) and the 7th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS; 2017–2022, probability-based multi-stage stratified sampling) across nine countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Germany, Greece, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. We assess differences in demographic coverage and national mean scores on 15 attitudinal items, including trust, national pride, religiosity, life satisfaction, postmaterialism, and support for gender equality and reproductive freedom. WVS samples more closely match national demographics, though VIC performs comparably in some cases. Substantively, web surveys show higher (up to 20–30 p.p.) acceptance of gender equality, abortion, and homosexuality and lower religiosity, national pride, and life satisfaction. These differences persist even after adjusting for demographic imbalances and restricting WVS samples to internet users.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Currently, the Solovetsky Archipelago is a popular pilgrimage and tourist destination, which, from the point of view of popularization of such routes, sets a positive impetus for the socio-eco-nomic development of the remote island territories of the North and the Arctic of Russia. At the same time, questions naturally arise about taking into account the risk of increased anthropogenic load on the eco-systems of such territories and the need to study the features of the social portrait of visitors.\nThe purpose of the research is to describe generalized social portraits of the two main categories of vis-itors to the Solovetsky Islands, tourists and pilgrims, considered as potential factors impacting the natural complexes of the archipelago; at the same time, to evaluate the validity of sociological methods as addi-tional tools for assessing anthropogenic impact.\nMaterials and methods. The information basis of the study was made up of legal acts and documents of strategic planning for the Russian territories’ development (including the northern regions and the Rus-sian Arctic), the work of Russian scientists on the formation of a social portrait of pilgrims and tourists, and sociological data collected by the authors. Systematic approach, methods of logical, conceptual and comparative analysis, methods of statistical data processing was used in working the article.\nResults. The article analyzes the concepts of “tourism” and “pilgrimage” in the legal perspective, as well as legislative differences regarding the implementation of tourism products and the organization of pil-grimage activities. A review of Russian research, devoted to the study of the tourists and pilgrims’ social portraits, as well as the ways for its use for the various Russian territories development has been con-ducted. Based on the survey results a social portrait of visitors to the Solovetsky Archipelago was describe, tourists and pilgrims were assessed in terms of their potential anthropogenic impact on the island eco-system. A shortage of waste bins, toilets, stands with maps and reference information about tourist or religious sites and route signs has been identified.\nConclusions. The survey results allowed us to put forward and confirm the hypothesis that the majority of Solovki visitors due to the specific purposes of their stay in the territory, due the cultural and education level do not constitute a factor increasing the pressure on the island’s ecosystem. At the same time, the authors think that a further solution to the problem of more accurately determining the risk of in-creasing anthropogenic impact is supplementing the survey data through the use of mobile applications for collecting anonymized data, as well as in integration with video recording systems.",

          "abstract": "Measuring individual-level issue importance is crucial for the study of voting behavior and public opinion, yet existing methods struggle to balance estimation accuracy with respondent burden. Standard approaches often sacrifice either ordinal precision or cardinal intensity to reduce cognitive load. To overcome this trade-off, I propose a pairwise comparison framework where respondents repeatedly choose the more important of two issues. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, this method recovers latent continuous importance weights from simple binary choices, capturing both rank order and preference intensity. Simulation studies demonstrate that the method accurately recovers preference structures even with limited data. In an empirical application, the method exhibits concurrent validity with traditional ``Most Important Issue” (MII) questions while revealing granular individual differences. Finally, I discuss an application to a weighted spatial voting model, where estimated issue weights are used to weight policy dimensions in modeling vote choice.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, I focused on the examination of the extent of women's political involvement in Finland's local politics by studying the 2017,2021, and 2025 municipal elections. By using comparative analysis, trends and disparities between political parties were identified. The findings show that as many as 42.3% of all candidates in the 2025 polls were women, which indicates a rise from previous years. The critical mass theory is used to show how a high proportion of women in local politics can influence local policymaking. Left-wing political parties featured more female candidates across the electoral years, as compared to far-right parties, which lag. Factors such as political party ideologies, shifting political culture, prominence of strong women organizations, and the rise of female political role models are some key drivers of increased female participation. The study recommends the introduction of a quota system to ensure political parties have a minimum proportion of female candidates they can feature in elections. This article contributes to addressing Finland’s progressive but uneven landscape of women’s grassroots political participation, and it also lends a voice to the global gender discourse.",

Exploiting naturally occurring variation in exposure to an Iranian missile attack, we measure Israelis' proneness to hawkish (vs. dovish) policy responses as a function of information concerning the majority's policy preferences. We find that Israelis shift their preferences to align with perceived majority opinion: when they perceive the public to be dovish, they support more dovish positions; whereas they become more hawkish when they perceive the public as hawkish. People who report having been exposed to Iranian attacks show stronger support for belligerence. Partisanship also matters as respondents are more likely to respond to cues aligned with priors that are consistent with their party's positions. We explore mechanisms of these patterns.",

This paper examines the case of Massachusetts—a state that consistently ranks first in overall educational performance but receives failing marks for financial literacy—to assess whether optional, non-mandated approaches to personal finance education can deliver equitable outcomes. Drawing on national empirical literature, state-issued policy reports, and a localized case study, this paper argues that policy optionality is the central mechanism through which financial literacy efforts in the Commonwealth have stagnated and declined. Indeed, this paper further concludes that a standalone financial literacy graduation requirement represents the most effective and evidence-based mechanism for translating existing efforts into universal access, particularly as the Commonwealth reconsiders graduation frameworks in the post-MCAS era.",

While Indian mobility to Thailand has expanded through corporate and entrepreneurial pathways, the experiences of accompanying spouses—predominantly women—remain underexplored within South Asian diaspora scholarship, particularly in non-Western host contexts. Drawing on a structured questionnaire complemented with three open-ended questions, administered to Indian trailing spouses residing primarily in Bangkok, the paper investigates three interrelated processes: identity loss, negotiated belonging, and personal reinvention. Quantitative findings indicate low overall identity disruption alongside moderate professional underutilisation, limited early autonomy, and gradual adaptation and resilience over time. Qualitative narratives contextualise these patterns, illustrating how gendered expectations, diasporic networks, and cultural navigation shape everyday life. By combining breadth and depth, this study contributes to debates on gendered migration, transnational family mobility, and identity formation within South Asian diasporas in Southeast Asia.",

Qualitative studies\nindicate that parents play a crucial role by either supporting or hindering their children's\nengagement in gender-typical and gender-atypical sports; however, little is known about\nthe influence of specific parental attributes. We argue that parental physical activity (PA)\nexerts a gendered influence on children's participation in gender-(a)typical sports, and\nthat parents with high education promote children's engagement in gender-atypical\nsports. We test these hypotheses using a large dataset of children and adolescents in\nGermany (N = 9,224). Overall, we find that parental PA exhibits the expected gendered\nassociation: boys are more likely to practise (only) male-dominated sports when only\ntheir father does PA, and girls are more likely to practise (only) female-dominated sports\nwhen only their mother does PA. Regarding parental education, we find limited support:\nboys with highly educated parents are less likely to participate (exclusively) in gendertypical sports, whereas no such pattern is observed for girls.

We examine if a father’s history of absence—measured by his nonresidence, incarceration, and/or extended periods without contact—conditions the influence of his subsequent death for adolescent boys’ and girls’ mental health. Results: The results offer three main findings. First, a father’s death corresponds with poor mental health for adolescent boys—a risk that is uniformly experienced regardless of his history of nonresidence, incarceration, and/or extended period without contact. Second, girls demonstrate uniform resilience in the wake of a father’s death. Third, a father’s nonresidence, incarceration, and extended period without contact during childhood corresponds with poor mental health for adolescent boys and girls, even as it is not related to the influence of a father’s death. Conclusion: The loss of a father—either temporarily or permanently—can have lasting mental health consequences for youth that operate independently from one another and are highly gendered in nature.",

          "abstract": "Bereavement—the loss of a loved one through death—is a significant health risk. Sibling death is an especially consequential bereavement, as evidenced by population health research on adults. Less is known about the relationship between sibling death and adolescent wellbeing, including mental health, and whether any deleterious consequences manifest because of bereaved parents’ poor mental health. We use Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study data (n = 2,963) to analyze linkages between sibling death, parents’ depression, and adolescents’ depressive symptoms. With information collected from biological mothers and adolescents, including the vital status of siblings who share the same biological mother, we focus specifically on maternal siblings and maternal depression. Regression results show that sibling death corresponds with adolescents’, specifically girls’, higher depressive symptoms, net of characteristics associated with selection into the experience. The association between sibling death and girls’ depressive symptoms persists regardless of mothers’ depression.",

          "abstract": "Riding a bicycle, particularly for transport purposes, offers substantial environmental and health benefits. Suitable bicycle infrastructure is crucial for promoting bicycle use, but remains scarce and fragmented in Australia, particularly in regional cities. In this context, understanding cyclists' route choices is a key input in informed infrastructure planning to increase cycling mode share. \nThis study uses data from a map-based public participatory route survey to spatially capture bicycle route choice in the regional city of Greater Bendigo, Australia. The model incorporates attributes such as level of traffic stress (LTS), slope, tree canopy cover, intersection density, and route directness, along with an adjustment to account for overlap among alternative routes. \nThe results show that cyclists strongly prefer routes with the lowest traffic stress, lower gradients, and greater network connectivity, while avoiding circuitous paths. Cyclists are also more likely to choose routes that are distinct and share fewer common segments with alternative routes. Segmentation by gender and age reveals notable behavioural differences: female cyclists are considerably more sensitive to traffic stress and slope, prioritising safety and comfort, whereas male cyclists exhibit greater tolerance to stress and prioritise route efficiency. Middle-aged cyclists (40-60 years) exhibit the strongest aversion to stressful routes, while younger cyclists (18-40 years) demonstrate greater flexibility in route choice. These findings highlight the importance of age and gender considerations in bicycle infrastructure planning as well as prioritising low-stress, well-connected, and direct cycling corridors. The findings also highlight the value of map-based public participatory surveys as a cost-effective means of collecting route data in regional settings with small populations.",

          "authors": "Yunbei Ou; Nick Bailey; David Philip McArthur; Qunshan Zhao",
          "abstract": "An extensive literature shows a positive relationship between housing energy efficiency and house prices. However, the methodological issue of omitted variable bias (OVB) has weakened claims of a causal effect. It is also unclear whether any willingness-to-pay (WTP) for housing energy efficiency reflects a concern with energy costs or a more symbolic ‘green’ consumption. The recent exogenous shock of the global ‘energy crisis’ in 2022 offers a novel opportunity to examine both. If WTP changes significantly after the energy crisis, it effectively removes OVB issues and strengthens causal interpretations. It could also indicate that WTP for energy efficiency is driven (at least in part) by energy cost savings. Using over 170,000 listings for second-hand house sales in Greater Manchester, UK (2017-24), we model WTP for energy efficiency before and after the dramatic rise in energy prices using multilevel hedonic regressions. We find that WTP for more energy efficient homes increased after the energy crisis, largely because the ‘brown discount’ (penalty) for more inefficient homes increased. These results confirm the causal interpretation of the relationship between house prices and energy efficiency and indicate that consumers are motivated at least in part by energy cost savings. These findings suggest that policymakers could promote housing energy efficiency by focussing on financial benefits in policy design and advertisements, as well as support financially vulnerable households to ensure an equal sustainable housing transition process.",

          "authors": "lyric Li",
          "abstract": "Certain high-growth cities exhibit a persistent gap between aggregate economic performance and the labor security of their resident populations. Existing literatures have addressed this observation under various rubrics—global city stratification, precarious labor markets, financialized urbanism—yet these frameworks tend to interpret such gaps as distortions of an otherwise labor-absorptive growth process, rather than as outcomes of a structurally distinct growth logic. This paper offers an analytical re-specification by distinguishing between two growth logics: production-based growth, in which wealth accumulation is tied to local labor organization, and channel-based growth, in which wealth accrues through the facilitation of value flows that originate and terminate elsewhere. This distinction clarifies why economic expansion may proceed without structural reference to resident labor participation. The paper specifies the mechanism through which channel-based configurations delimit labor necessity and situates this argument within debates in urban studies and cultural political economy. The analytical usefulness of this framework lies in reframing growth-labor decoupling not as a policy failure, but as an indication that the growth process itself may be structurally indifferent to local labor absorption.",

          "abstract": "The present study identifies and compares typical classes of relationship qualities in the nuclear and extended family ties of younger adults across nine European countries (Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, as well as the Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden). We used KINMATRIX data that were collected online in 2022-23 from an ego-centric perspective of 7,375 respondents aged 25–35. Employing latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression models, we identified five distinct types of relationship qualities, labelled as ‘tight-knit’, ‘connected-but-autonomous’, ‘disharmonious-but-supportive’, ‘intimate-but-distant’, and ‘detached’. The prevalence of these relationship types varied across the family system, showing a clear gradient from tight-knit relations being most prevalent in the nuclear family to distant-extended relations being dominated by detachment. This resulted in a high overall proportion of relatively ‘weak’ relationships within young adults’ family networks. The distribution of classes across countries confirmed the existence of a North-South gradient of increasingly close nuclear and extended family ties in Europe: ‘Weaker’ relationships were more (and ‘stronger’ ties less) common in the Nordic countries, compared to an ‘intermediate’ cluster of countries consisting of the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, as well as the United Kingdom, and – especially – compared to Italy. Our study demonstrates the applicability of common typologies of relationship qualities to assess kin relations beyond the nuclear family and it highlights the relevance of accounting for extended kin relations across a range of European countries.",

          "abstract": "How do rebel groups shape democratic publics’ attitudes toward humanitarian intervention? Many state-led atrocities occur during civil wars, yet rebels are often portrayed solely as sources of instability rather than as governing actors who shape external perceptions. We argue that rebels’ modes of governance—whether inclusive or exclusive in service provision and decision-making—fundamentally shape public opinion on intervention. Inclusive governance that embodies equality and participation reinforces identification with democratic values, strengthening the moral imperative to protect and the instrumental confidence that intervention would be both justified and effective. In contrast, exclusive governance, marked by coercion or discrimination, undermines perceptions of shared identity and moral legitimacy, making state repression appear justified and intervention less defensible. We test these claims through survey experiments in the U.S. (N=1,615) and the U.K. (N=1,583). Across both countries, inclusive governance boosts perceived legitimacy and credibility of rebels, fostering positive attitudes toward humanitarian intervention, while exclusive governance undermines these perceptions and weakens public endorsement.",

          "abstract": "Aesthetic experiences are a universal and constant phenomenon, affecting our decision making, job performance, and emotional reactivity. While the effects of aesthetic experiences reach far beyond the simple appreciation of art, most research in the field still focuses on subjective ratings of fine art. The current study explored the effect of decorating a lab space, through the addition of a rug, faux plants, artwork, and nicer desk and chair, on a participant's inhibitory control and emotional reactivity. Study 1 used an online survey to confirm that participants found the aesthetic room (i.e., decorated lab space) more pleasing and comforting, and expressed a greater willingness to work in that space compared to the bare room. In Study 2, participants performed a Proportion Congruent Stroop task to examine inhibitory control and a Emotion Vocabulary Stroop task to test inhibitory control in the context of emotional stimuli, or their emotional reactivity. Average response times on both tasks were faster in the aesthetic room, while accuracy did not differ between the rooms. Additionally, the bare room may impact the use of reactive, but not proactive, cognitive control. These results suggest that the aesthetics of a lab space may impact the efficiency of inhibitory control and conflict resolution in laboratory tasks. This research provides a controlled and standardized attempt at understanding the role that aesthetics plays in our daily lives by elaborating on the understudied link between aesthetics and inhibitory control.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between contract management practices and the performance of projects is integral to achieving project goals, managing risks, fostering collaboration, and ensuring long-term success, both developed and developing world have had its fair share of challenges associated with poor project contract management and consequently leading loses in taxpayers’ money. The primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of contract management practices on the project performance of ministry of energy and petroleum parastatals in Kenya. The research was based on specific objectives, such as contract planning, contract monitoring, contract cost management, and contract documentation on the performance of ministry of energy and petroleum parastatals. Theories, such as the transaction-cost economics theory, stakeholder theory, institutional theory, and agency theory, also guided the study. This study employed a cross- sectional survey approach and mainly concentrate on 13 ministry of energy and petroleum parastatals in Kenya. To meet the research objectives, the departmental heads and other officers across various departments were used as analysis units across the firms. The pilot study targeted 9 respondents, 10% of the final study sample size, of which respondents were randomly chosen in each firm. The primary data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire that included open and closed-ended questions designed to obtain definite responses. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 28) was used to analyze the data, present the variables through coding, and summarize all the respondents' responses. Data analysis was presented in the form of tables. The Cronbach’s Alpha value was greater than 0.7 which indicated that the questionnaire met the minimum acceptable threshold. The study findings showed that contract management practices namely contract planning, contract monitoring, contract cost management and contract documentation significantly influence the performance of parastatals in Kenya. The study concluded that performance was predicted to improve for every unit increase in these practices. The study further recommends that the parastatals should improve contract monitoring to increase their project performance. Also, management should develop and implements risk mitigation plans. According to the research, the parastatals should ensure contract planning process involves all relevant stakeholders, including procurement, legal, and technical teams. To achieve this, companies should ensure active participation of diverse stakeholders, including procurement, legal, and technical teams.",

          "abstract": "Behind every successful firm lies a deliberate financing strategy that transforms borrowed capital into sustainable wealth, a reality that places capital structure at the heart of corporate performance. This study examined the effect of debt financing on the financial performance of manufacturing firms listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange over the period 2019–2023, focusing on how different debt instruments shape profitability in an increasingly volatile and competitive business environment. Grounded in capital structure theories including the Modigliani and Miller propositions, Net Income approach, Trade-Off Theory, and Modern Portfolio Theory, the study adopted a quantitative research design and employed linear regression analysis using SPSS to test the relationship between debt structure and financial performance measured by return on assets. Four regression models were estimated, with bank loans, trade credit, debentures, and lines of credit serving as independent variables. The findings revealed that bank loans and trade credit exerted a statistically significant positive influence on financial performance by supporting growth investments and enhancing liquidity management. Debentures demonstrated a positive but comparatively weaker effect, reflecting the long-term financing benefits tempered by higher costs and financial risk exposure. In contrast, line of credit financing exhibited a significant negative effect on performance, largely attributed to high interest rates and short repayment horizons that intensify cash flow pressures. The study concludes that the composition of debt, rather than its sheer magnitude, is a critical determinant of financial outcomes among manufacturing firms. An optimal financing strategy therefore entails a balanced debt portfolio, approximating 60% long-term and 40% short-term instruments, to sustain capital-intensive operations while preserving liquidity and resilience amid market uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "With annual revenues of around US$ 1.5 trillion, the pharmaceutical industry has, in recent decades, consolidated itself as one of the most powerful sectors in the global economy, exerting significant influence over knowledge production and medical practice. This article critically examines relationships between the pharmaceutical industry and medical education and practice, focusing on transfers of value – such as payments, gifts, and financial incentives – directed to physicians and academic institutions, from undergraduate training to professional practice. The study combines a descriptive documentary analysis of data from the Open Payments program in the United States – where such transfers are regulated and publicly disclosed – with a narrative review of the international literature. Empirically, it is observed that between 2015 and 2024, reporting entities under Open Payments (including drug and medical device manufacturers) transferred approximately US$ 23.2 billion to physicians and US$ 23.3 billion to teaching hospitals in the United States, primarily in the form of meals, travel, educational support, consulting, research, and other remuneration. In light of the international literature, these transfers are examined as part of engagement and influence strategies targeting prescribers: observational studies indicate associations – often operating unconsciously – between receiving benefits and increased prescribing of products from paying companies, a greater share of brand-name drugs at the expense of generics, the promotion of products with marginal clinical benefit, and higher costs for health systems. Drawing on theoretical frameworks and concepts from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory – such as reciprocity, self-serving bias, unconscious influence, and the third-person effect – the article discusses how even low-value benefits, such as meals, can function as mechanisms of socialization and become embedded in the “hidden curriculum” of medical training, normalizing conflicts of interest and shaping professional identities. Finally, the article argues for transforming the logic governing relationships between industry and the medical field through greater transparency, restrictions on gifts, and the strengthening of institutional models of funding and governance aligned with public health.",

          "abstract": "Sociologists have extensively studied family instability and its childhood consequences, focusing principally on family instability resulting from parental separation and parental incarceration. Children’s exposure to another source of family instability—early life parental death—has received scant attention. This article extends research on the childhood consequences of family instability by considering the prevalence and consequences of parental death using Future of Families and Child Wellbeing (FFCWS) data. Results show that by age 15, 13% of the FFCWS cohort had experienced a parent’s death, with an additional 3% of children’s father’s vital status unknown. Results show that having ever experienced parental death is associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms at age 15, with some evidence that the associations are pronounced among boys. Fixed-effects models using pre- and post-death measures further show that parental death between ages 9 and 15 corresponds with increases in children’s depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and delinquent behavior. Place-based instability around the time of parental death explains children’s worsening outcomes, which aligns with a social trajectory model of parental death. Together, the results demonstrate parental death is a relatively common and notably consequential childhood experience that can set children on disadvantaged trajectories.",

Yet, existing research on the demography of young adult bereavement in the U.S. focuses mostly on older cohorts born under more favorable mortality conditions, and on few sources of bereavement, namely the deaths of immediate family. This research note describes the demography of bereavement among a contemporary cohort of disadvantaged young adults, attending to three generations of family relationships, as well as non-familial relationships. We analyze data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) (N=2,350), a longitudinal study of young adults disproportionately born to unmarried mothers in the late 1990s. Demographers have documented this cohort’s family experiences extensively, yet we know little about their exposure to familial and non-familial deaths. We document high levels and large inequalities in bereavement from adolescence through young adulthood; show the consequences of bereavement for young adults’ mental health, measured by major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; and confirm these associations are comparable across race and ethnic groups. The results emphasize the need to recognize bereavement as a substantial stressor that affects population health.",

However, persistent challenges remain, particularly related to workload, emotional exhaustion, student behavior, chronic absenteeism, and uneven parent support - especially for discipline. Differences across school types and poverty contexts reveal that teachers in traditional public, charter, and Title I schools continue to experience greater strain than their peers in private and hybrid school settings.

The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research.",

Reducing citizen support for violence against politicians is therefore crucial to safeguard democratic institutions. To examine how this can be addressed, we use two pre-registered survey experiments in France and Belgium that manipulate politician characteristics (gender, age, and party) and violence’s severity. We find that extreme violent attitudes remain rare, although support for verbal abuse online is substantial. Importantly, our results reveal that such attitudes are  largely unrelated to affective polarization. We then show that simple interventions (humanizing politicians through perspective-taking or stressing the importance of ideological pluralism for democracy) reduce support for political violence. These findings suggest that protecting institutions requires addressing underlying societal predispositions by promoting empathy and reinforcing norms of political tolerance.",

          "authors": "Clay Williams",
          "abstract": "This study extends the precarious sexuality framework to examine how observers categorize bisexual individuals who engage in exclusively same-sex or different-sex sexual behaviors. While prior research demonstrates that men's heterosexuality is easily reclassified when engaging in same-sex behavior, less is known about how bisexual identities are perceived when behavioral patterns appear monosexual. Furthermore, this study examines whether mediated contact with bisexual characters moderates categorization effects, whereas interpersonal contact has proven inconsistent. Through a 2 (character gender: male, female) x 2 (sexual behavior: same-sex, different-sex) factorial experimental design, participants read narratives about target characters’ identifying as bisexual but engaging in unidirectional sexual behaviors. Participants rated their confidence in the characters’ future sexual identity. Results show that bisexuality operates as a precarious identity within the LGB community itself, subject to reclassification tendencies to recategorize sexual identities into the binary. Notably, mediated exposure to bisexual characters moderated these categorization effects, though primarily for same-sex behaviors, suggesting that contemporary media representation may cultivate associations between bisexuality and gay-adjacent identities rather than genuinely disrupting binary thinking. These findings illuminate how status hierarchies operate within sexual minority communities and reveal both the potential and limitations of visibility-based media representation in challenging the categorization of non-monosexual identities.",

          "authors": "Tabea Lüders",
          "abstract": "As original method of communication sciences, quantitative and qualitative content analyses are widespread not only in numbers, but also their thematical scopes. Accordingly, this methodological approach receives high popularity within the science of science communication community when it comes to investigating media coverage on scientific or technological topics. Yet, scholars criticise that there are only marginal accumulations of knowledge about this kind of coverage which they trace back to loose or missing links to theory of many empirical examinations in this area. By focussing on the concept of (public) discourse whose terminology is nearly equally widespread within the field as potential theoretical framework, this study investigated a sample of 379 scientific studies using content or discourse analytical approaches. Asking whether and how they are embedded within broader discourse theories and on what coverage they are concretely focussed on as well as examining the interconnectedness of the research area through common references and journals, the systematic review showed that content analytical studies on technoscientific media discourses are not only thematically scattered with analysed coverage ranging from environmental crises to novel technologies and health advice, but also highly heterogeneous in terms of publishing journals and shared references. This might be related to a mostly implicit and therefore vague inclusion of (some kind of) discourse concept by uncritically using the term synonymous to media coverage in many of the reviewed publications. In summary, this study critically exemplifies what happens when the links between theory and empirical research are questionable in large parts of a research area but also establishes the concept of technoscientific media discourse as promising starting point to meet this problem.",

          "authors": "Yuning Liu; Yichen Wang; Lucía Magis-Weinberg; Nathaniel D. Osgood; Laura Marciano",
          "abstract": "Methodological innovations are needed to examine behavioral patterns of engagement with digital platforms which would contribute to understanding how increasing social media use—particularly among adolescents—may relate to mental health. Emerging work suggests that patterns of variability may significantly capture behavioral signatures linked to health above and beyond the average time spent online. Importantly,  although passive tracking now enables detailed measurement of digital media use, including variability, most research has focused on mean-level metrics such as screen time. Thus, we hereby review the literature measuring digital media use variability (DMUV) using objective data by  (1) proposing a new theoretical framework, (2) mapping existing dimensions, and (3) summarizing links with behavioral and health outcomes. Our DMUV model includes five dimensions: dispersion, routineness, fragmentation, inertia, and unpredictability. Studies have linked these dimensions to behavioral outcomes such as overuse, habitual use, intentional use, and task delay, as well as to mental health outcomes including depression and schizophrenia. We discuss current evidence, its limitations and future directions, underscoring the need for theory-driven approaches to conceptualize and test DMUV as a construct of interest in the complex relationship between digital media and health.",

          "abstract": "Modern human uniqueness has been defined by a reliance on social learning and hierarchical cooperation networks that result in cumulative cultural evolution. There is archaeological evidence that such social organization emerged through innovations that facilitated exploitation of resources that naturally occur in dense and predictable patches, leading to social regionalization and potentially territorial behavior. However, another way humans can access high-density patches is through transformation of the environment via niche construction. Here, we use an agent-based model to investigate how low-cost niche construction behaviors - those that can be applied without intensifying into dependence on food production - can transform resource distributions over time. We then examine the resulting impact of this on human mobility and social organization. In all scenarios where the cost of disturbance is low, we see positive selection for disturbance behaviors, leading to creation of a locally heterogeneous resource landscape. This results in increased carrying capacity, higher population densities, reduced mobility, and smaller social networks - all factors implicated in the eventual transition to food production. We demonstrate that foragers using even low-cost niche constructing behaviors can produce legacy landscapes with resource distributions that support more local social interactions even without socially imposed boundaries or territory defense of dense and predictable resources.",

          "authors": "Jacqueline Kroh; Monja Schmitt; Lena Nusser",
          "abstract": "Social belonging, defined as temporally stable \"frequent, affectively pleasant interactions with a few other people\" (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995, p. 497), is a fundamental human need and a crucial determinant of well-being. Despite its importance, gaps persist in our understanding of how social belonging to peers develops during adolescence and the extent of which social inequalities matter during this crucial life stage. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the development of social belonging to peers between the ages of 12 and 16, utilizing data from the kindergarten cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study. We employ fixed- and random-effects regression models to examine how students’ sense of social belonging changes as they grow older and how these developmental patterns differ by individual characteristics, i.e., gender, cultural and socioeconomic background, and academic achievement. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in social belonging between the ages of 12 and 16. Females report higher social belonging, although their decline over time is more pronounced than that of males. Students with a non-European cultural background do not show significantly higher belonging and differential growth trajectories compared to German native students. Adolescents from higher socioeconomic backgrounds start with slightly lower belonging at age 12 but experience a gentler decline than their less advantaged peers. No differences emerge by academic achievement levels. We conclude that social inequalities in perceived levels of social belonging with peers persist throughout the earlier life stages, with some developing before adolescence.",

          "authors": "Jungmin Han",
          "abstract": "What domestic political benefits do leaders derive from successful peace initiatives with a foreign adversary? Existing research emphasizes how adversary cooperation softens enemy images and increases public support for reconciliation, but pays less attention to how such concessions operate as political assets domestically. This paper examines how partisan polarization conditions the domestic political returns to adversary cooperation for incumbent leaders. I argue that polarization intensifies partisan interpretations of diplomatic outcomes by converting foreign concessions into signals of incumbent party's competence. When a leader secures reciprocal cooperation, ruling-party supporters are likely to interpret the outcome as a partisan achievement, increasing their support for rapprochement. Cross-partisans may also shift toward support as the incumbent’s diplomatic success undermines confidence in their own party’s competence. I test these expectations using an original survey experiment centered on U.S.–DPRK rapprochement during the first Trump administration. The results indicate that polarization priming amplifies Republican support for reconciliation by strengthening perceptions of partisan competence, while Democrats exhibit a modest increase in support, accompanied by declining confidence in their party’s competence. Overall, the findings demonstrate that domestic political conflict fundamentally shapes whether and how foreign signals are translated into domestic political assets or liabilities within partisan competition.",

          "abstract": "Research has consistently shown a mental health advantage for immigrant youth compared to U.S.-born youth, despite often facing disadvantages associated with lower socioeconomic status. This mental health advantage, termed the “immigrant paradox,” appears to attenuate with acculturation. However, little research has explored whether gender moderates this relationship during adolescence. Using Wave I data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), the current study tests if the association between immigrant generation and depression differs by gender. Building on this framework, the study estimates a series of age and parental education adjusted, survey weighted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models including family cohesion as a protective mechanism and perceived discrimination as a risk mechanism. Across models the pattern is clear: there is a gendered immigrant paradox: immigrant-origin girls have significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms than do native-born girls and gender differences among immigrant youth are negligible. Generational contrasts show that the advantage is largest among first-generation adolescents and dissipates across generations. Accounting for cohesion and discrimination partly, but not fully, attenuates the immigrant female advantage suggesting that cultural, social and gendered processes are fundamental to understanding the well-being and assimilation of adolescents in the United States.\n\nKey Words: Immigrant paradox, gender, adolescent mental health, assimilation",

          "abstract": "Objective: The study examines changes across cohorts in terms of the timing and frequency of the full spectrum of reproductive events and explores whether these reproductive trajectories reflect broader trends towards the destandardisation of family formation. Furthermore, the study assesses the quality and limitations of Czech health registry data by comparing them with official vital statistics.\nBackground: Analysing fertility alone is insufficient with respect to understanding individual reproductive trajectories since reproductive experiences are interconnected across the lifespan and may be influenced by other reproductive events that affect both the tempo and the quantum – especially within the context of fertility postponement.\nMethod: This study employs individual data obtained from the Czech National Health Information System (NHIS) that enable the holistic analysis of reproductive trajectories including live births, induced abortions, in vitro fertilisation, miscarriages and stillbirths across selected cohorts of women (1976–1991).\nResults: The younger cohorts experienced delayed and less frequent reproductive events. However, the lower incidence of adverse events partly reflected fewer conceptions due to the postponement of reproduction to older ages. The most common combination of event types involved live births with induced abortions or miscarriages. Reproductive trajectories were found to diversify with age but exhibited limited variation across the cohorts, and an early live birth remained linked to higher completed fertility. The NHIS data were largely in line with the vital statistics, with the moderate underestimation of live births and the under-reporting of early miscarriages and induced abortions.\nConclusion: The findings highlight the potential and limitations of health registry data in terms of capturing the full spectrum of reproductive events. Forming a deeper understanding of women’s reproductive trajectories and experiences, enabled via the use of linked health register data, is essential in terms of developing policies on reproductive health and rights in the context of declining fertility levels and the postponement of childbearing to later ages.",

          "abstract": "The choice between marriage or cohabitation is shown to be associated with many demographic and socioeconomic factors, as well as personal relationship assessments and mental health. However, the role of individual differences linked to genetic factors has attracted less attention. This study uses genetically informed data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) to investigate whether polygenic scores related to educational attainment, fertility, personality traits, and mental health are associated with union type at first birth, as well as the subsequent transition to marriage. Our results indicate that genetic factors influence parental union type choices through educational attainment, reproductive outcomes, and positive and negative emotionality. For union type at first birth, polygenic scores for educational attainment and postponement of reproductive activity have the strongest associations. For the subsequent transition to marriage, associations with polygenic scores for subjective wellbeing and educational attainment are most salient. However, there is also some indication that polygenic scores for negative emotionality are negatively associated with marriage among men. These findings give insights into potential selection processes and the chain of intermediate phenotypes through which genetic factors influence couples’ choice of union type.",

          "abstract": "Short-video platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts have become increasingly relevant for science communication, requiring communicators to align with technical infrastructures and platform logics. Drawing on the concept of platform affordances, this study examines platformization patterns in 1,055 German science-related short videos across four dimensions: algorithmic curation, hypertextuality, interactivity, and multimodality. Using computational methods, it also compares communicators and analyzes engagement relationships. Findings show selective adaptation, with the strongest adoption in multimodal design. However, platform constraints create tensions with science communication principles of contextualization and transparency. Individual communicators exhibit stronger platformization than institutional actors, yet platformization does not meaningfully relate to engagement. The results further reveal convergence and divergence between platforms, with YouTube Shorts gradually aligning with TikTok while retaining distinctive features. Methodologically, the study integrates conceptual perspectives with computational methods, providing a framework for analyzing platformization dynamics in science communication and across platforms.",

          "abstract": "Gender revolution theory posits that, in contexts with high female labor participation, couples sharing domestic work equally will (desire to) have more children. However, empirical findings at the micro level have been mixed. We propose three reasons why prior research has been inconclusive: (1) a tendency to treat gender attitudes or practices as a single continuum, rather than multidimensionally; (2) insufficient attention to partner’s shared attitudes; and (3) empirical approaches that conflate timing and quantum. We propose a refined approach that considers how shared gender egalitarian attitudes toward work divisions, female careers, and child-welfare are differentially related to the quantum versus timing of fertility. Using cure models and data from Germany, we show that couples’ shared gender egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, and child welfare have distinct relationships with the occurrence and timing of first births. We find no evidence of higher probability of first births among couples who shared egalitarian attitudes regarding domestic work, career support, child welfare, or all three domains. However, egalitarian couples regarding domestic work and career support have later first births. Our results underscore the importance of (1) differentiated measurements of gender attitudes, and (2) considering quantum and timing as affected separately.",

This study aimed to examine changes in offending trajectories among Australian adolescents with a proven offence aged 10 to 16 years across 12 consecutive birth cohorts (1995 to 2006), in Queensland, Australia. Findings indicate that the number of adolescents with a proven offence decreased by 44% from the oldest to the youngest cohort. However, within recent birth cohorts of justice-involved adolescents, there have been significant increases in high frequency and violent offending. Additionally, despite declines in offending participation, First Nations adolescents have become more over-represented in the youth justice system, due to steeper declines in offending participation for non-First Nations adolescents. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify offending trajectories across the birth cohorts. Multinomial logistic regression indicated that recent cohorts of justice-involved adolescents were significantly more likely to display moderate or chronic offending trajectories, compared to low-level offending. Findings suggest that while criminogenic risk has reduced across the majority of adolescents in recent birth cohorts, for a subset of adolescents it has also increased.

This study systematically examines the use of GAs in leading environmental health journals and develops a practical guideline to support GA design for researchers without a design background. We systematically screened articles from three high-impact environmental health journals and identified 23 exemplar GAs for in-depth analysis. These GAs were evaluated using five content criteria (inclusion of title, background, methods, results and conclusion) and four visual design criteria (visual signs, grid systems, typography and color). Most of the GAs we reviewed showed substantial room for improvement in both content and visual clarity. Many did not serve a clear communicative purpose and suffered from issues such as unclear or missing titles, ambiguous background information and weak or absent conclusions. Visual problems—particularly related to typography and hierarchy—were also widespread. In contrast, the 23 exemplar GAs demonstrated how concise content, clear structure and coherent visual design can improve readability and better support knowledge translation. Based on these findings, we developed a simplified guideline focusing on two domains: (1) content clarity, by ensuring sufficient information from background to conclusion; and (2) visual clarity, by improving visual signs, grid integration, typography and color use. The resulting evidence-informed guideline can help researchers independently create clearer and more impactful GAs, ultimately strengthening knowledge translation and the broader impact of environmental health research.",

          "abstract": "While the Montgomery Bus Boycott is widely celebrated, its economic impact on Montgomery has been understudied. This paper provides one of the first quantitative analyses of the fiscal consequences of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Using archival data from the City of Montgomery and ARIMA based time series forecasting, the study estimates counterfactual revenue and expenditure paths to reexamine the boycott with two goals: (1) determining whether the boycott affected the city’s public finances, and (2) forecasting the probability that city revenues would have fallen below expenditures had existing trends continued. Results reveal that although the city-maintained surpluses throughout the forecasted period, the gap between revenues and expenditures narrowed steadily signaling growing fiscal strain. This economic pressure stemmed largely from the city's “get tough” response, which increased spending on police, fire, and public services. These findings reframe the boycott not only as a moral and legal turning point, but also as a form of economic resistance with measurable budgetary impact. The study contributes a new lens for understanding how grassroots movements can reshape public finance and municipal governance, suggesting that protest can be used as an economic tool to effect political change.",
