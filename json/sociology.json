          "authors": "Sean F. Reardon, Ericka S. Weathers, Erin M. Fahle, Heewon Jang, Demetra Kalogrides",
          "abstract": "U.S. public schools are racially and economically segregated. Prior research shows that the desegregation of Southern schools beginning in the 1960s led to significant benefits for Black students. Less clear, however, is whether segregation today has the same harmful effects as it did 50 years ago and through what mechanisms segregation continues to affect achievement. We estimate the effects of current-day school segregation on racial achievement gaps using 11 years of data from all U.S. public school districts. We find that racial segregation is strongly associated with the magnitude of achievement gaps in 3rd grade and the rate at which gaps grow from 3rd to 8th grade. The association of racial segregation with achievement-gap growth is completely accounted for by racial differences in school poverty. Thus, racial segregation is harmful because it concentrates minority students in high-poverty schools, which are, on average, less effective than lower-poverty schools. Exploratory analyses show that segregation-related between-school differences in teacher characteristics are associated with unequal learning rates and account for roughly 20 percent of the effect of Black–White racial differences in exposure to poverty. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms linking school segregation to achievement-gap growth.",

          "title": "Diverging Paths: Heterogeneities in Single Parenthood and Consequences for Child Poverty",
          "authors": "Roxana-Diana Burciu, Zachary Parolin",
          "abstract": "The authors propose an expanded conceptualization of single parenthood that acknowledges within-group heterogeneity and investigate differential short- and long-term poverty outcomes on the basis of pathways into single parenthood. Using representative panel data for the United States, the authors present descriptive trends in the evolution of four pathways into single parenthood (divorce, separation, widowhood, and never getting married) and the diversity of demographic characteristics across these pathways. The authors then identify the associations between pathways into single parenthood and child poverty. In 2019, most single parents were single because they had never been married, compared with the 1970s, when the most common pathway into single parenthood was divorce. Moreover, the authors find large heterogeneities by age, race/ethnicity, and education across the pathways. Never getting married and separation are associated with the most negative consequences for child poverty. In contrast, no statistical differences emerge in children’s later life poverty for those raised by divorced or widowed single parents compared with children raised in two-parent families. The findings demonstrate that studies treating single parenthood as a homogenous demographic overlook meaningful within-group differences. The negative effects of single parenthood are not uniformly distributed among children of single parents. However, a nontrivial part of the heterogeneities between pathways is a result of compositional differences, and the authors do not argue that some single parenthood types are “better or worse” for child poverty outcomes.",

          "title": "Beyond Fear of Crime: Toward a Reconceptualization of Emotional Responses to Threat in Urban Public Places",
          "authors": "Rebecca Lennox",
          "abstract": "What do social scientists communicate when they label a person or community fearful of crime? I examine the utility of “fear of crime” as a heuristic for representing emotional responses to threat. Applying Sklansky’s concept of cognitive burn-in, which describes the epistemic foreclosures that occur when schemas become entrenched, I argue that the use of “fear of crime” across domains including academic research and public policy ossifies a simplified framework for thinking about risk. This framework overstates the extent to which the public’s negative emotions in the street are directly crime related and conceals intersectional quality-of-life inequalities. Based on interview data, I theorize three emotional responses to threat: reactive fear, anticipatory fear, and anticipatory anxiety. These responses are socially stratified, with marginalized women disproportionately vulnerable to severe emotions. This typology disaggregates actual and prospective harms, distinguishes crime threats from social threats, and reveals the stratification of emotion and threat severity.",
