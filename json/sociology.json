          "authors": "Weirong Guo",
          "abstract": "People migrate from authoritarian to democratic regimes seeking greater freedom of expression, yet many continue to avoid politics in their host country. This study examines how Chinese international students in the United States navigate political taboos across borders and why they still avoid political expression despite newfound freedoms. Drawing on participant observations and 93 in-depth interviews with Chinese students at two American universities and one Chinese university, I find that students develop three avoidance strategies—pragmatic disengagement, veiled allegiance, and closeted activism—as they navigate two distinct fields of political taboos. In China’s “forbidden zone,” where state-imposed taboos are intuitively understood but constantly shifting, avoidance is largely habitual—students perceive politics as dangerous and irrelevant, frame patriotism in apolitical terms, or engage in activism discreetly to avoid repression. After migrating to the US “landmine zone,” where political taboos are decentralized, scattered, and socially enforced, these tactics evolve—students pretend to be apathetic to sidestep ideological pressure, downplay nationalism to prevent conflict, and confine activism to trusted circles to evade peer, institutional, or transnational consequences. This study bridges political sociology and migration studies by challenging the activism bias in transnational politics and the assumption of unilateral political incorporation. It also calls for a reassessment of educational institutions’ roles in sustaining or challenging the culture of avoidance.",

          "authors": "Claire Daviss, Emma Williams-Baron, Erin Macke",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the widespread adoption of remote and hybrid work arrangements. How will this change affect parental status gaps in hiring? We experimentally test hiring decision-makers’ beliefs about companies’ preferences (i.e., third-order beliefs) and their personal preferences (i.e., first-order beliefs) when evaluating mothers, childless women, fathers, and childless men applying to in-person, remote, and hybrid jobs. Participants believed companies would prefer childless women over mothers in all three job types and expected no significant penalties for fathers versus childless men. However, participants’ own preferences varied across jobs: they preferred childless women over mothers applying for in-person jobs, but they held no significant preference for childless women or mothers in remote or hybrid jobs. In additional analyses of digital trace data, we show that the salience of parental status differs by job candidate gender and job type. Overall, our findings suggest meaningful variation in parental status hiring gaps across gender and core job features, with potential implications for gender inequality.",

          "authors": "Carla Rowold",
          "abstract": "Gender pension gaps (GPGs) represent crucial indicators of gender inequalities over the life course. Despite reaching higher levels, they have received less attention than other gender inequalities, such as gender wage gaps. More generally, research typically focuses on selected sets of life course summary measures, predominantly the employment duration, to explain gender inequalities across the life course. This oversimplifies gender-specific life courses in particular. Taking a life-course perspective and using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe for the Netherlands and West Germany, I propose an innovative combination of machine learning, sequence analysis, and decomposition techniques, allowing for a new perspective on gender inequalities over the life course. The study disentangles which specific life-course elements are most relevant for pension inequalities and quantifies the role of gender-exclusive life-course experiences for gender disparities. I find that the duration, timing, order of life-course events, and overall life-course complexity matter for pension income inequalities in both pension systems. Specifically, the duration, timing, and order of care work experiences are more crucial pension predictors than the employment duration, which has been the primary focus of previous research. This holds for the GPGs: the largest shares are attributable to gender-exclusive life-course experiences because of the lack of a male counterpart for female engagement in care work, which is poorly rewarded in pension systems. Future research and policymakers will benefit from considering such gender-specific combinations of life-course experiences for the gender pension gap and other inequalities.",

          "authors": "Javier San Millán, Javier Polavieja, Toni Gamundí",
          "abstract": "Research on rental housing discrimination (RHD) against migrant minorities has overwhelmingly focused on the first generation, paying special attention to the most sizeable immigrant groups. As a result, we still know little about the housing-market experiences of immigrants’ children and the less sizeable—but often fast-growing—ethnic minorities. RHD research has also lagged behind the spectacular growth of online apps for conducting private rental transactions. We present a novel instant messaging correspondence test to study (real) private landlords’ responses to (fictitious) flat seekers of native and Chinese background in Madrid, Spain. Drawing on instant messaging allows us to introduce innovative treatments for phenotype and cultural assimilation. We find moderate levels of RHD against visibly Chinese-background applicants with a fully Chinese name and who use full Chinese characters in their WhatsApp status profile (low assimilation condition) but very low levels of discrimination against visibly identical applicants who combine a Spanish first name with a Chinese last name (typical of the second generation) and who use the word “Madrid” in Latin alphabet in their app status profile (high assimilation condition). Finally, we find adding signals of flat-seekers’ income reliability (diagnostic treatment) does not reduce discrimination propensity. Results are robust to stringent controls for ethnic composition and COVID-19 incidence rate at the district level. These findings highlight the primacy of perceived cultural assimilation over racial appearance and information deficits in shaping RHD against Chinese minorities in Spain and illustrate the analytical pay-offs of using instant messaging correspondence tests in discrimination research.",

          "abstract": "Panel data are often used to study change and stability in social patterns. However, repeated interviewing may affect respondents’ attitudes in a panel study by triggering reflection processes on the surveyed topics (cognitive stimulus hypothesis) . Using data from a survey experiment within a probability-based and a nonprobability panel in Germany, we investigate change—and the mechanisms underlying change—in respondents’ abortion attitudes over six panel waves. The experiment manipulated the frequency of receiving identical attitude questions. We estimate multiple-group and longitudinal structural equation models to differentiate change in the measurement of abortion attitudes from “real” attitude change. Results show that repeatedly administering the same abortion questions increases the reliability of respondents’ reported attitudes and the stability of their latent attitudes toward abortion. However, we find no evidence of an increase in attitude certainty and knowledgeability on abortion and only tentative evidence of improved response behavior (increased attitude reliability) due to general survey experience.",

          "abstract": "Models for time-to-event data are based on transition rates between states, and to define such hazards of experiencing an event, the time scale over which the process evolves needs to be identified. In many applications, however, more than one time scale might be of importance. Here, we demonstrate how to model a hazard jointly over two time dimensions. The model assumes a smooth bivariate hazard function, and the function is estimated by two-dimensional P -splines. We provide an R package for the analysis of event history data with two time scales. As an example, we model transitions from cohabitation to marriage or separation simultaneously over the age of the individual and the duration of the cohabitation. We use data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) and demonstrate that considering the two time scales as equally important provides additional insights about the transition from cohabitation to marriage or separation.",

          "abstract": "Using data from over 24,000 respondents in the Norwegian Crime Victimization Survey, we conducted a double list experiment to measure domestic violence (DV). Both list experiments revealed a statistically significant decrease in reporting when including a sensitive DV item. This clear violation of the “no design effects” assumption is not only explained by floor effects. One possibility is that the results indicate a “fleeing” behavior whereby respondents try to avoid association with DV. Combined with the inherent power limitations of list experiments in many contexts, these results underscore the need for caution in employing list experiments to measure DV, even in large samples.",
